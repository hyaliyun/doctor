OBJECTIVE: We determined the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Uganda. MEASUREMENTS: As of the 16 May 2020, a total of 203 cases had been confirmed. We report on the first 56 patients; 29 received hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and 27 did not. Endpoints included admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation or death during hospitalisation. MAIN RESULTS: The median age was 34.2 years; 67.9% were male; and 14.6% were <18 years. Up 57.1% of the patients were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were fever (21.4%), cough (19.6%), rhinorrhea (16.1%), headache (12.5%), muscle ache (7.1%) and fatigue (7.1%).

This disease is currently treated by administering high doses of various oral anti-TB drugs for prolonged periods (up to 2 years). While this regimen is normally effective when taken as prescribed, many people with TB experience difficulties in complying with their medication schedule. Furthermore, the oral administration of standard anti-TB drugs causes severe side effects and widespread resistances. Recently, we proposed an original platform for pulmonary TB treatment consisting of mannitol microspheres (Ma MS) containing iron (III) trimesate metalCorganic framework (MOF) MIL-100 nanoparticles (NPs). In the present work, we loaded this system with the first-line anti-TB drug isoniazid (INH) and evaluated both the viability and safety of the drug vehicle components, as well as the cell internalization of the formulation in alveolar A549 cells. Results show that INH-loaded MOF (INH@MIL-100) NPs were efficiently microencapsulated in Ma MS, which displayed suitable aerodynamic characteristics for pulmonary administration and non-toxicity.

The positive lessons learned from this experience are documented as they emerge in order to support other states and nations as they address this issue globally in the near-term and consider enduring improvements for the longer term. While the authors have personal experience in the WA context, wider observations across Australia and selected international benchmarks are also included. Key lessons include the importance of good health advice in Australia's interest;timely, synchronized and aligned action at all levels of government;a program of well communicated, aligned health and economic measures which support all in society allowing a very high level of appropriate community behaviour, ensuring the health system was not overloaded;innovation in telehealth, testing, pandemic modelling, and integrated operations which also allowed essential industries to continue;and strong border and travel controls with highly effective isolation preventing community spread, ultimately enabling rapid elimination of the disease from the hospital system. In combination, these demonstrate that in the case of Western Australia the result of first eliminating the disease from the community, and then reopening the economy progressively at a strong pace, has enabled a world leading outcome in both in health and economic terms.

The objective of the study was to validate whether patients with higher serum PCT concentrations have a higher incidence of ARDS. METHODS: The study was a prospective, single-center, observational cohort study. All patients who received cardiac surgery with CPB were screened for study eligibility. Patients were assigned to the PCT-elevated cohort or the control cohort according to serum PCT concentration on the first postoperative day with a cut-off value of 7.0 ng/mL. Patients were followed up until the 7th postoperative day. The primary endpoint was the incidence of ARDS, which was diagnosed according to the Berlin definition. RESULTS: A total of 296 patients were enrolled, 64 patients were assigned to the PCT-elevated cohort and 232 patients were assigned to the control cohort. PCT concentration was 16.23  5.9 ng/mL in the PCT-elevated cohort, and 2.70  1.43 ng/mL in the control cohort (p < 0.001). The incidence of ARDS was significantly higher in the PCT-elevated cohort than in the control cohort (21.9% versus 5.6%, p < 0.001). The incidence of moderate-to-severe ARDS was also significantly higher in the PCT-elevated cohort than in the control cohort (10.9% versus 0.4%, p < 0.001). The hazard ratio of ARDS at 7 days in the PCT-elevated cohort, as compared with the control cohort, was 6.8 (95% confidence interval 2.7 to 17.4). The hazard ratio of moderate-to-severe ARDS in the PCT-elevated cohort was 57.3 (95% confidence interval 10.4 to 316.3). The positive predictive value of PCT for ARDS and moderate-to-severe ARDS were 0.242 and 0.121, respectively; the negative predictive value of PCT for ARDS and moderate-to-severe ARDS were 0.952 and 1.0, respectively.

We conducted an online questionnaire survey among 307 SCA patients from China. The contents of the questionnaire included general information, the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), the self-rating depression scale (SDS). The relevant influencing factors included COVID-19 risk factors, age, gender, BMI (body mass index), educational background, disease course, and score of the scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA). Results indicate the 307 SCA patients had an anxiety rate of 34.9%, along with a depression rate of 56.7%.

Methods: Eighty-nine SLPs responded to an 18-question online survey that inquired about demographics, telepractice during the pandemic, perceptions of telepractice and prior training received. Results: Seventy-five percent of SLPs reported providing services via telepractice during the pandemic compared to 19% before the pandemic. Most SLPs who used telepractice stated that services delivered via telepractice were comparable with face-to-face services;no association was found between the frequency of providing services via telepractice and the SLPs' perceptions of its effectiveness.They had also received some training in telepractice, although no association was found between the type of training received and the provision of telepractice services. SLPs who did not provide services via telepractice reported awareness of telepractice but described a lack of knowledge, support, and training. All SLPs expressed interest to receive more training in telepractice to enable them to provide better services.

We previously described the VirScan system, a phage-display based technology for profiling antibody binding to a comprehensive library of peptides designed to represent the human virome. The previous VirScan analytical approach did not fully account for disproportionate representation of viruses in the library or for antibody cross-reactivity among sequences shared by related viruses. Here we present the AntiViral Antibody Response Deconvolution Algorithm (AVARDA), a multi-module software package for analyzing VirScan datasets. AVARDA provides a probabilistic assessment of infection at species-level resolution by considering alignment of all library peptides to each other and to all human viruses. We employed AVARDA to analyze VirScan data from a cohort of encephalitis patients with either known viral infections or undiagnosed etiologies. By comparing acute and convalescent sera, AVARDA successfully confirmed or detected antibody responses to human herpesviruses 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6, thereby improving the rate of diagnosing viral encephalitis in this cohort by 62.5%. We further assessed AVARDAs utility in the setting of an epidemiological study, demonstrating its ability to determine infections acquired in a child followed prospectively from infancy. We consider ways in which AVARDAs conceptual framework may be further developed in the future and describe how its analyses may be extended beyond investigations of viral infection.

While some patients respond completely to each course of treatment, many do not, and with each unsuccessful antidepressant trial the likelihood that a patient will respond decreases. This raises the possibility that neurophysiologic response in subsequent antidepressant treatment may be influenced by learning processes including sensitization, habituation, and/or classical conditioning. Classical conditioning would entail the association of cues such as pill-taking (conditioned stimuli; CS) with the effects of active medication (unconditioned stimulus; US), such that later presentation of the CS alone would come to elicit a conditioned response (CR). Such effects could be revealed by blinded administration of placebo following a period of treatment with active medication. Habituation effects (tolerance), or sensitization effects (increased response), which require only repeated exposure to a stimulus, might be evidenced after repeated courses of antidepressant treatment. Knowledge of how learning processes impact neurophysiologic response to successive courses of antidepressant treatment would have relevance for clinical populations. Specific hypotheses, however, may be tested in healthy non-clinical samples to avoid potential confounding factors related to severity or chronicity of illness. Learning theories would suggest two hypotheses: (1) neurophysiologic response to placebo will differ between subjects who were previously treated with antidepressant treatment as compared to placebo (classical conditioning hypothesis); and (2) neurophysiologic response to an initial course of antidepressant treatment will differ from response to a repeated course of antidepressant treatment. Pilot data addressed these hypotheses in healthy never-depressed women who had previously received four weeks of venlafaxine IR, 150 mg (antidepressant-experienced subjects; n=2) or matching placebo (antidepressant-naive subjects; n=4) under double-blind conditions. Six-and-a-half years later, we treated these six women with placebo for one week, followed by four weeks of double-blind treatment with venlafaxine IR, 150 mg. Brain functional changes over the course of treatment were assessed using quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to compare prefrontal neurophysiologic responses between subjects who had, versus had not, previously been exposed to venlafaxine. Antidepressant-experienced versus antidepressant-naive subjects showed greater decreases in prefrontal cordance (PFC) during venlafaxine administration (sensitization hypothesis) but did not show significantly different PFC changes during treatment with placebo in this small pilot sample (classical conditioning hypothesis). Data suggest that brief treatment with antidepressant medication may have an enduring impact on neurophysiologic responses to a subsequent course of antidepressant treatment.

Mange zoonosis in camels is complicated by scarcity of available data. One of the main strategies for disease control is early detection of the parasite combined with prevention/control of the major risk factors associated with the infection. The present study focused on the prevalence of sarcoptic mange in camels from Egypt together with a histopathological examination of the parasite and association of the major risk factors, to describe the epidemiological pattern of the disease. Our data demonstrate that 47.6% of the camels harbored sarcoptic mange infections. In addition, the animals exhibited obvious clinical signs of mange and numerous histopathological findings that are consistent with sarcoptic mange. The camels age, gender and sampling season were found to be the most significant risk factors associated with the disease. Taken together, our epidemiological and histopathological data are consistent with sarcoptic mange being widespread among camels in the studied area. Our study suggests further research is needed for management of this zoonotic disease in Egypt. ABSTRACT: Mange has been considered one of the most common parasitic infestations among camels. It adversely impacts animal productivity and poses a risk to human health. Given the scarcity of available data about mange in camels, the current study focused on the prevalence of camel mange and its associated risk factors in Aswan Governorate, Egypt. Towards this end, a general visual inspection was conducted on camels (N = 210) in different markets and slaughterhouses in Aswan Governorate. Skin scrapings from suspect infected camels were also examined microscopically. Importantly, these findings were further checked and confirmed by histopathology on samples from suspected cases collected post-slaughter in abattoirs. The possible risk-associated factors, which include the camels age, sex and sampling season, were recorded and statistically analyzed. Interestingly, the data showed that a total of 100 camels (47.6%) were found exclusively infested by sarcoptic mange. Furthermore, the predominant histopathological changes included burrowing tunnel of mites in the skin, hyperkeratosis and acanthosisconsis of the epidermis, while the dermis showed hemorrhage, mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration around the blood vessels and perifolliculitis. These major histopathological findings are consistent with sarcoptic mange. Furthermore, the statistical analysis of the possible associated risk factors, camels age (p = 0.006), gender (p = 0.032) and sampling season (p = 0.004), were all found to be significantly affected and related to the disease. In this regard, camels 2 years old were found at higher risk of infection (odds ratio (OR) = 2.75; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.345 to 5.604) versus younger animals (OR = 0.36; 95 CI, 0.1784 to 0.743). Females had higher odds of exposure (OR = 2.02; 95% CI, 1.096 to 3.708) compared to males (OR = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.269 to 0.912). Moreover, the exposure to infection was reported higher in winter (OR = 2.30; 95% CI, 1.297 to 4.098) than in summer (OR = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.244 to 0.771). Collectively, our data provide novel epidemiological and histopathological support for sarcoptic mange being widespread among camels in the studied area. Sarcoptic mange is extremely contagious and zoonotic. Therefore, our baseline investigation indicates an urgent need for additional multicenter-studies to investigate the occurrence of this disease in camels and humans combined with the appropriate control measures of camel importation for combating this disease.","output":"Epidemiological and Histopathological Investigation of Sarcoptic Mange in Camels in Egypt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: One of the most difficult public policy decisions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has been about how to offer K-12 instruction.

METHODS: We divided Illinois counties into three groups based on the instruction type used for a majority of K-12 students at the start of the school year: in-person, hybrid, or online-only. We used synthetic control analysis to match counties between the three groups. RESULTS: Both majority hybrid and majority online-only counties had significantly fewer new cases than majority in-person counties. There were no significant differences in new cases between majority hybrid counties and majority online-only counties or in new hospital admissions or deaths between any of the three county groups.

METHODS: Chart review was performed and demographics, ophthalmic diagnoses, procedures performed, and visual acuity at all visits were recorded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity in patients who completed, canceled, and no-showed for the COVID-19 period visit. RESULTS: Of the 1,041 total patients in this study, 620 (60%) completed the scheduled visit, while 376 (36%) canceled and 45 (4%) were no-shows. In patients who missed the scheduled visit, the average delay in care was 5.34 weeks. In those who missed a visit, the visual acuity was assessed at the subsequent visit. Patients who canceled a visit were older, and patients who no-showed had lower baseline vision [mean EDTRS letters (SE); no-show: 53.27 (3.21), canceled: 60.79 (1.11), completed: 62.81 (0.84), p=0.0101] and were more likely to have DME and/or PDR [no-show: 13 (29%), canceled: 56 (16%), completed: 81 (13%), p=0.0456].

METHODS Individuals from 30 different substance addiction recovery groups across the UK (N = 151, 66% male, M age = 42.5 years) completed a survey, which asked participants to provide a narrative about their recovery group experiences. Participants were also asked to rate the extent to which theorized ingredients of addiction recovery groups were offered by their group, and how important each was to them. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS The results indicated that the recovery group components suggested in previous literature were both present and rated as important. Component ratings did not differ depending on the type of group, the length of time the person had been in recovery, nor the length of time they had been involved in the group. The qualitative results identified other important components of recovery groups that had not been identified in the previous literature: presence of like-minded individuals and developing self-awareness and reflection skills. An updated list of recovery group components was thereby created.

At the early stages of the pandemic, Ecuador was one of the most affected countries in Latin America. The objective of this study was to assess the levels of depression, anxiety and stress in the Ecuadorian general population during the social isolation period due to COVID-19. METHODS: A web-based survey consisting of 31 short-answer and multiple-choice questions was administered to the general population from April 22CMay 3, 2020. Mental health status was assessed through the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21) questionnaire. Ordinal logistic analyses were used to identify potential risk factors associated with the severity of mental health issues. RESULTS: A total of 626 individuals were included. Most of them were females (60.5%), and their mean age was 29.6  11.7 years. Approximately 17.7% of the respondents had moderate to very severe levels of depression, 30.7% had similar levels of anxiety, and 14.2% experienced stress. Female sex, younger age, student status, and having a relative diagnosed with COVID-19 were associated with significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress. Ordinal regression models showed that being a student was a risk factor for having more severe levels of depression (OR = 3.67; 95% CI = 2.56C5.26, p: 0.0001), anxiety (OR= 1.86; 95% CI= 1.35C2.55, p: 0.0001), and stress (OR = 2.17; 95% CI= 1.47C3.19, p: 0.0001). Having a relative with COVID-19 was also found to be a risk factor only for depression (OR= 1.70; 95% CI= 1.03C2.80, p: 0.036) and anxiety (OR = 2.17; 95% CI= 1.35C3.47, p: 0.001). Additionally, male sex, older age, and having more children were found to be protective factors for the three conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that social isolation due to the COVID-19 outbreak has impacted the mental health of the general population in Ecuador. We identified potential risk and protective factors that could serve as a foundation from which to develop psychological strategies to safeguard the mental health of our population during the current pandemic.

Interleukins (ILs) are among the main immune factors contributing to the deterioration of the immune response and the formation of cytokine storms in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections. INTRODUCTION This review article investigated the relationship between virus structure, risk factors, and patient plasma interleukin levels in infections caused by the coronavirus family. METHOD The keywords \\"interleukin,\\" \\"coronavirus structure,\\" \\"plasma,\\" and \\"risk factors\\" were the main words searched to find a relationship among different interleukins, coronavirus structures, and risk factors in ISI, PUBMED, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar databases. RESULT Patients with high-risk conditions with independent panels of immune system markers are more susceptible to death caused by SARS-CoV2. IL-4, IL-10, and IL-15 are probably secreted at different levels in patients with coronavirus infections despite the similarity of inflammatory markers during coronavirus infections. SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV increase the secretion of IL-4 in the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, while it remains unchanged in MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV infection demonstrates increased IL-10 levels. However, IL-10 levels increase during SARS-CoV infection, and different levels are recorded in SARS-CoV2. MERS-CoV increases IL-15 secretion while its levels remain unchanged in SARS-CoV2. CONCLUSION In conclusion, the different structures of SARS-CoV2, such as length of spike or nonstructural proteins (NSPs), and susceptibility of patients based on their risk factors may lead to differences in immune marker secretion and pathogenicity. Therefore, identifying and controlling interleukin levels can play a significant role in controlling the symptoms and the development of individual-specific treatments.","output":"The Relation of the Viral Structure of SARS-CoV2, High-Risk Condition, and Plasma Levels of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-15 in COVID-19 Patients compared to SARS and MERS Infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we describe our submissions to the 2nd and 3rd SlavNER Shared Tasks held at BSNLP 2019 and BSNLP 2021, respectively.

The effect of COVID\\\\19 on effusion cytology is not yet known. This study aimed to examine the cytomorphologic features and workup of effusion fluids in patients with active COVID\\\\19 infection versus those in recovery. METHODS: PE (n = 15), PCE (n = 1), and PTE samples (n = 20) from hospitalized patients with a SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection (from June 1, 2020, to December 30, 2020) were reviewed. Effusion fluids with metastatic carcinoma were excluded. Differential cell counts, cytomorphology, and relevant immunostains for effusion fluids were retrospectively evaluated and compared between patients with active infection (positive on a SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 nucleic acid amplification test [NAAT] within 2 months; n = 23) and those in the recovery phase from COVID\\\\19 (negative on a SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 NAAT for >2 months; n = 13). RESULTS: The cytology diagnoses were negative for malignancy (n = 31), atypical (n = 4), and suspicious for malignancy (n = 1). Active infection cases showed more atypical mesothelial cells than recovery cases (P < .05); some had enlarged nuclei, prominent nucleoli, occasional multinucleation, and bizarre nuclei. Immunostains were performed more often in active infection cases than recovery cases (47.8% vs 7.7%; P < .05). Differential cell counts (available for 28 cases) showed no significant differences between the active infection and recovery groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study found atypical and bizarre mesothelial cells more often in effusions of cases with active COVID\\\\19 infection in comparison with patients in recovery.

However, little research has examined whether online religious participation improves these outcomes, especially when in-person attendance is suspended. METHODS: Using longitudinal data of 8951 UK adults, this study prospectively examined the association between frequency of online religious participation during the stringent lockdown in the UK (23 March -13 May 2020) and 21 indicators of psychological well-being, social well-being, pro-social/altruistic behaviors, psychological distress, and health behaviors. All analyses adjusted for baseline socio-demographic characteristics, pre-pandemic in-person religious service attendance, and prior values of the outcome variables whenever data were available. Bonferroni correction was used to correct for multiple testing. RESULTS: Individuals with online religious participation of 1/week (v. those with no participation at all) during the lockdown had a lower prevalence of thoughts of self-harm in week 20 (odds ratio 0.24; 95% CI 0.09-0.62).

Methods We used national SARS-CoV-2 testing data in England to estimate the risk of reinfection >90 days after primary infection from 01 January 2020 to 31 July 2021, which encompassed both the Alpha and Delta waves in England. Disease severity was assessed by linking reinfection cases to national hospitalisation, intensive care admission and death registrations datasets. Findings Reinfection rates closely followed community infection rates, with a small peak during the Alpha wave and a larger peak during the Delta wave. In children aged <16 years, there were 688,418 primary infections and 2,343 reinfections. The overall reinfection rate was 66.88/100,000 population, being higher in adults (72.53/100,000) than in children (21.53/100,000). Reinfection rates after primary infection were 0.68% overall, 0.73% in adults and 0.34% in children. Of the 109 reinfections in children admitted to hospital, 78 (72%) had underlying comorbidities. Hospitalisation rates were similar for the first (64/2343, 2.73%) and second episode (57/2343, 2.43%). Intensive care admission was rare after primary infection (n=7) or reinfection (n=4), mainly in children with comorbidities. 44 deaths occurred after primary infection within 28 days of diagnosis (44/688,418, 0.01%), none after possible reinfections. Interpretation The risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is strongly related to exposure due to community infection rates, especially during the Delta variant wave. Children had a lower risk of reinfection than adults, but reinfections were not associated with more severe disease or fatal outcomes.

During a time of great civil upheaval following the tumultuous elections of 2016 and 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and mass demonstrations following the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, higher education may be the only institution left to be both responsible for and responsive to society at large. Public trust in the federal government is at near-record lows, but confidence in higher education has decreased more than any other U.S. institution since 2015. In a time where public opinion is quickly changing for the better or the worse, higher education must respond to this decline in trust in it as an institution, but also the decline in the belief that a college degree is worth the time and cost. Higher education was founded on the idea that colleges would prepare citizens for a life of public service, but they have quickly changed to a business model that largely puts profits over people. Practitioners of higher education must respond to this lack of trust and the pressures of preparing a 21st century workforce while battling the threats of a pandemic, declining enrollment, budget destabilization, and increased regulation. The Proper Role of Higher Education in a Democratic Society reexamines the purpose of higher education during rapidly changing times, offers practical advice and best practices to reclaim higher education's most fundamental mission, and argues that if higher education is called to prepare students to serve a government by the people, the people must be prepared to govern effectively. This book provides resources and suggestions for restoring the public faith in higher education by connecting the educational experience with civic engagement outcomes. Diverse perspectives presented in this book challenge traditional notions that civic engagement is handled by one office on a college campus and is only discussed during a presidential election. Covering everything from civic engagement to diversity perspectives, this book is ideal for higher education practitioners and those interested in promoting civic engagement and democratic participation, improving assessment or accreditation standards using a civic engagement perspective, and infusing civic engagement to diversity conversations on campus. ? 2021, IGI Global.

To enable routine surveillance and comprehensive diagnostic applications, there is a need for detection technologies that can scale to test many samples1-3 while simultaneously testing for many pathogens4-6. Here, we develop Combinatorial Arrayed Reactions for Multiplexed Evaluation of Nucleic acids (CARMEN), a platform for scalable, multiplexed pathogen detection. In the CARMEN platform, nanolitre droplets containing CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection reagents7 self-organize in a microwell array8 to pair with droplets of amplified samples, testing each sample against each CRISPR RNA (crRNA) in replicate. The combination of CARMEN and Cas13 detection (CARMEN-Cas13) enables robust testing of more than 4,500 crRNA-target pairs on a single array. Using CARMEN-Cas13, we developed a multiplexed assay that simultaneously differentiates all 169 human-associated viruses with at least 10 published genome sequences and rapidly incorporated an additional crRNA to detect the causative agent of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. CARMEN-Cas13 further enables comprehensive subtyping of influenza A strains and multiplexed identification of dozens of HIV drug-resistance mutations. The intrinsic multiplexing and throughput capabilities of CARMEN make it practical to scale, as miniaturization decreases reagent cost per test by more than 300-fold. Scalable, highly multiplexed CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection shifts diagnostic and surveillance efforts from targeted testing of high-priority samples to comprehensive testing of large sample sets, greatly benefiting patients and public health9-11.","output":"Massively multiplexed nucleic acid detection with Cas13"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic caused by SARS\\\\Cov\\\\2 has led to the elaboration of multiple studies to increase knowledge and understanding, hence, having the ability to accomplish an adequate and timely diagnosis and give an optimal treatment according to the patient's condition.

Methods A total of 867 patients with T2DM were enrolled. Measurements of central fat distribution were obtained by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Patients were stratified into three groups according to their levels of serum uric acid (SUA). Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the association between SUA and central body fat distribution. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the risk factors for hyperuricemia (HUA). Mediation analysis was applied to assess the overall, direct, and indirect mediators of SUA levels. Results Multiple linear regression analysis showed that SUA levels were significantly positively correlated with waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), Android fat mass, Gynoid fat mass, fasting c-peptide (F-CP), and area under the curve of C-peptide (P < 0.05 for all).

MATERIAL/METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study enrolled 364 patients with cancer from the Oncology Clinic of University Clinical Hospital Mostar during February 2021. Data were collected using a questionnaire that captured general information about the participants and their attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: Of the participants, 41.8% answered Yes when asked if they would take the vaccine once it becomes available, 37.6% answered Not sure, and 20.6% answered No. For patients in favor of vaccination, the main reasons reported were fear of getting sick (77.6%), the desire to contribute to herd immunity (57.8%), and trusting the recommendations of health professionals (57.2%). The main reasons for the patients vaccination refusal/indecision were doubts about the results from clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines (49.1%), concerns about adverse effects (24.5%), and confusion about the various vaccine options (19.8%). The majority of participants (82.4%) stated that recommendation by their oncologist could influence their decision about vaccination. Of the participants who indicated unwillingness (refusal or indecision) to be vaccinated against COVID-19, 65.3% stated that recommendation by their oncologist could influence their decision about vaccination.

The role of mRNA cap ribose 2'-O methylation is enigmatic, although recent work has implicated this as a signature to avoid detection of RNA by the innate immune system (S. Daffis, K. J. Szretter, J.

Diamond, Nature 468:452-456, 2010, doi:10.1038/nature09489). Working with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), we previously showed that a panel of recombinant VSVs carrying mutations at a predicted methyltransferase catalytic site (rVSV-K1651A, -D1762A, and -E1833Q) or S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site (rVSV-G1670A, -G1672A, and -G4A) were defective in cap methylation and were also attenuated for growth in cell culture. Here, we analyzed the virulence of these recombinants in mice. We found that rVSV-K1651A, -D1762A, and -E1833Q, which are defective in both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylation, were highly attenuated in mice. All three viruses elicited a high level of neutralizing antibody and provided full protection against challenge with the virulent VSV. In contrast, mice inoculated with rVSV-G1670A and -G1672A, which are defective only in G-N-7 methylation, were attenuated in vivo yet retained a low level of virulence. rVSV-G4A, which is completely defective in both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylation, also exhibited low virulence in mice despite the fact that productive viral replication was not detected in lung and brain. Taken together, our results suggest that abrogation of viral mRNA cap methylation can serve as an approach to attenuate VSV, and perhaps other nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses, for potential application as vaccines and viral vectors. IMPORTANCE Nonsegmented negative-sense (NNS) RNA viruses include a wide range of significant human, animal, and plant pathogens. For many of these viruses, there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs available. mRNA cap methylation is essential for mRNA stability and efficient translation. Our current understanding of mRNA modifications of NNS RNA viruses comes largely from studies of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). In this study, we showed that recombinant VSVs (rVSVs) defective in mRNA cap methylation were attenuated in vitro and in vivo. In addition, these methyltransferase (MTase)-defective rVSVs triggered high levels of antibody responses and provided complete protection against VSV infection. Thus, this study will not only contribute to our understanding of the role of mRNA cap MTase in viral pathogenesis but also facilitate the development of new live attenuated vaccines for VSV, and perhaps other NNS RNA viruses, by inhibiting viral mRNA cap methylation.","output":"mRNA cap methylation influences pathogenesis of vesicular stomatitis virus in vivo."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The existence of physical and financial barriers in the provision of healthcare leads to an increasing recognition that alternative sources of information are being used to supplement or replace the advice of healthcare professionals.

Elective surgical cases have been largely postponed, and surgery departments are struggling to correctly and equitably determine which cases need to proceed. A resource to objectively prioritize and track time sensitive cases would be useful as an adjunct to clinical decision-making. METHODS: A multidisciplinary working group at Emory Healthcare developed and implemented an adjudication tool for the prioritization of time sensitive surgeries. The variables identified by the team to form the construct focused on the patient's survivability according to actuarial data, potential impact on function with delay in care, and high-level biology of disease. Implementation of the prioritization was accomplished with a database design to streamline needed communication between surgeons and surgical adjudicators. All patients who underwent time sensitive surgery between 4/10/20 and 6/15/20 across 5 campuses were included. RESULTS: The primary outcomes of interest were calculated patient prioritization score and number of days until operation. 1767 cases were adjudicated during the specified time period. The distribution of prioritization scores was normal, such that real-time adjustment of the empiric algorithm was not required. On retrospective review, as the patient prioritization score increased, the number of days to the operating room decreased. This confirmed the functionality of the tool and provided a framework for organization across multiple campuses. CONCLUSIONS: We developed an in-house adjudication tool to aid in the prioritization of a large cohort of canceled and time sensitive surgeries. The tool is relatively simple in its design, reproducible, and data driven which allows for an objective adjunct to clinical decision-making.

We use (a) the stable cumulative infection of various countries and (b) the number of infection versus the tests carried out to evaluate the model. The time-dependent infection rate is set in the model to obtain the best fit with the available data. The model is simulated aiming to project the probable features of the infection in India, various Indian states, and other countries. India imposed an early lockdown to contain the infection that can be treated by its healthcare system. We find that with the current infection rate and containment measures, the total active infection in India would be maximum at the end of June or beginning of July 2020. With proper containment measures in the infected zones and social distancing, the infection is expected to fall considerably from August. If the containment measures are relaxed before the arrival of the peak infection, more people from the susceptible population will fall sick as the infection is expected to see a threefold rise at the peak. If the relaxation is given a month after the peak infection, a second peak with a moderate infection will follow. However, a gradual relaxation of the lockdown started well ahead of the peak infection, leads to a nearly twofold increase of the peak infection with no second peak. The model is further extended to incorporate the infection arising from the population showing no symptoms. The preliminary finding suggests that random testing needs to be carried out within the asymptomatic population to contain the spread of the disease. Our model provides a semi-quantitative overview of the progression of COVID-19 in India, with model projections reasonably replicating the current progress.

By entering the host through the spike (S) glycoprotein, it paves way for its own survival and multiplication. Respiratory tract being the point of entry causes pulmonary compromise and leads to development of ARDS. Having non-specific clinical features that resemble flu makes the clinical diagnosis much more difficult. Pregnancy being an immunocompromised and a hypercoagulable state is prone to be a high-risk group for COVID-19. This study is an attempt to understand the maternal and fetal outcomes in COVID-19 and the vertical transmissibility of the virus. Evidence suggests that the contribution of COVID-19 is not very significant in maternal morbidity and mortality. However, due to some factors such as the immunological response in the mother, certain complications may arise in the neonate in the post-natal period. No vertical transmission of the virus has been reported yet. However, the management remains crucial as two lives are at stake. Some of the precautionary measures that can be implemented to prevent COVID-19 can be segregation of medical services from that of the general population in settings of outpatient care, inpatient care and labor room care. Also, triaging the patients into low risk, moderate risk and high risk can aid in faster delivery of health-care facilities to the pregnant and the newborn.","output":"COVID-19 infection in pregnancy: a review of existing knowledge."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores how men living in Istanbul talk about the sociality of house and care work C vacuuming the house, cooking, doing the laundry C in their everyday lives.

Twenty-seven variants of the new Lombrosian vision of forensic screening and prevention are distinguished, and some scientific and technical limitations are noted. Some lures, biases and structural factors, making the application of the Lombrosian idea likely in spite of weak evidence are pointed out and noted as a specific type of ethical aspect. Many classic and complex ethical challenges for health screening programmes are shown to apply to the identified variants and the choice between them, albeit with peculiar and often provoking variations. These variations are shown to actualize an underlying theoretical conundrum in need of further study, pertaining to the relationship between public health ethics and the ethics and values of criminal law policy.","output":"The Return of Lombroso?

Although vaccination is highly efficacious in preventing disease, cases continue to occur and vaccination failures are well documented. Maternally derived antibody interference is the leading cause of vaccination failure and age at vaccine administration is a significant risk factor for failure. However, no studies have been performed on practicing veterinarians' usage of and compliance with published vaccination guidelines and label recommendations. Likewise, there are no published studies of veterinarian perceptions on CPV occurrence and mortality and its influence on case outcome. We report a study in which all Australian small companion animal (canine and feline) veterinary hospitals were surveyed, yielding a response rate of 23.5% (534 unique veterinary hospitals). Respondents overall perceived national CPV occurrence ten-times lower (median 2000 cases) than the estimated national caseload (20,000 cases). Respondents from hospitals that did not diagnose CPV perceived national occurrence twenty-times lower (median 1000 cases) than the estimated rate (p < 0.0001). Perceived disease mortality (50%) was 2.74 times higher than that reported (18.2%). In addition, 26.7% of veterinarians reported using serological titer testing to some degree, which some practitioners use in lieu of vaccination if a titer is perceived to reflect sufficient immunity. Based on this study veterinarians appear to be aware of the disease risk in their region but unaware of the burden of CPV disease nationally, and perceive mortality risk higher than it actually is. This might lead to an overestimation of cost to treat, and over-recommendation of euthanasia. Nearly half (48.7%) of respondents recommended final puppy vaccination earlier than guidelines recommend, while 2.8% of respondents recommended a puppy re-vaccination interval longer than supported by vaccine labels and guidelines.

Despite their salience, however, they have hardly been studied systematically in our field (or organizational research at large). We suggest that this is due to a dominance of the Gaussian paradigm, which (often unrealistically) assumes linearity and independence of observations. Moreover, case-based qualitative studies which offer contextualization have been underrepresented. We thus call on researchers to abolish the practice of habitually discarding outliers, reflect on nonnormal distributions, and pursue more qualitative studies. Journal editors and reviewers should widen their assumptions regarding \\"acceptable\\" papers and reflect on the requirement of contributing to big \\"T\\" theories. Finally, PhD training should juxtapose fundamental paradigms and associated implications for epistemological choices.

Understanding their determinants, characteristics, and dynamics allows for heightened vigilance, preparedness, and ultimately performance. Yet, much of global strategy research (and organizational research at large) has focused on \\"average\\" phenomena, based on methodologies that assume bell-shaped distributions and independent observations. In this note, we argue that this is not a realistic way to think about most social phenomena. In fact, most are characterized by their high degree of interdependence among elements, as well as a relative commonness of \\"rare\\" events and outliers. As a result of embracing the reality of nonnormality, scholars will be able to offer more relevant guidance to practitioners.","output":"The importance of rare events and other outliers in global strategy research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The perspective of using messenger RNA (mRNA) as a therapeutic molecule first faced some uncertainties due to concerns about its instability and the feasibility of large-scale production.

The primary outcome was rate of severe surgical complications based on the Clavien-Dindo classification (defined as grade &#8805;3), and the secondary outcome was the anatomical success at the last postoperative follow-up visit. RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety-six patients were included, 289 of these patients underwent anterior sacrospinous fixation with uterine preservation, 50 had a previous hysterectomy and 57 underwent a concomitant hysterectomy. The median follow-up was 12 months (interquartile range, 7 months). The rate of severe complications was 2.1%, 6.0%, and 5.3% in the uterine preservation group, previous hysterectomy group, and concomitant hysterectomy group, respectively (P = 0.2).

We present new ALMA CO(1-0) interferometry of cold molecular gas in the nearby (z=0.0755), massive (M_stellar=4x10^11 M_sun), isolated, late-type spiral galaxy 2MASSX J23453269-044925, which is outstanding for having two pairs of powerful, giant radio jets, and a bright X-ray halo. The molecular gas is in a massive (M_gas=2x10^10 M_sun), 24 kpc wide, rapidly rotating ring, which is associated with the inner stellar disk. Broad (FWHM=70-180 km s^-1) lines with complex profiles associated with the radio source are seen over large regions in the ring, indicating gas velocities that are high enough to keep the otherwise marginally Toomre-stable gas from fragmenting into gravitationally bound, star-forming clouds. About 1-2% of the jet kinetic energy are required to power these motions. Resolved star-formation rate surface densities fall factors 50-75 short of expectations from the Kennicutt-Schmidt law of star-forming galaxies, and near gas-rich early-type galaxies with signatures of star formation lowered by jet feedback. We argue that radio AGN feedback is the only plausible mechanism to explain the low star-formation rates in this galaxy. Previous authors have already noted that the X-ray halo of J2345-0449 implies a baryon fraction near the cosmic average, which is very high for a galaxy. We contrast this finding with other, equally massive baryon-rich spiral galaxies without prominent radio sources. Most of the baryons in these galaxies are in stars, not in the halos. We also discuss the implications of our results for our general understanding of AGN feedback in massive galaxies.","output":"Jet-driven AGN feedback on molecular gas and low star-formation efficiency in a massive local spiral galaxy with bright X-ray halo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Whole genome duplication (WGD) is a dramatic evolutionary event generating many new genes and which may play a role in survival through mass extinctions. Paddlefish and sturgeon are sister lineages that both show genomic evidence for ancient WGD. Until now this has been interpreted as two independent WGD events due to a preponderance of duplicate genes with independent histories. Here we show that although there is indeed a plurality of apparently independent gene duplications, these derive from a shared genome duplication event occurring close to the Permian-Triassic mass extinction period, followed by a prolonged process of reversion to stable diploid inheritance (rediploidisation). We show that the sharing of this WGD is masked by the fact that paddlefish and sturgeon lineage divergence occurred before rediploidisation had proceeded even half-way. Thus, for most genes the resolution to diploidy was lineage-specific. Because genes are only truly duplicated once diploid inheritance is established, the paddlefish and sturgeon genomes are a mosaic of shared and non-shared gene duplications resulting from a shared genome duplication event. This is the first time that lineage-specific resolution of genes from a common WGD event has been shown to affect such a large proportion of the genome.","output":"Extensive lineage-specific rediploidisation masks shared whole genome duplication in the sturgeon-paddlefish ancestor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The enterovirus 71 (EV71) 3D(pol) is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that plays the central role in the viral genome replication, and is an important target in antiviral studies.

The structure reveals that the 5-end guanosine of the downstream RNA template interacts with a fingers domain pocket, with the base sandwiched by H44 and R277 side chains through hydrophobic stacking interactions, and these interactions are still maintained after one in-crystal translocation event induced by nucleotide incorporation, implying that the pocket could regulate the functional properties of the polymerase by interacting with RNA. When mutated, residue R277 showed an impact on virus proliferation in virological studies with residue H44 having a synergistic effect. In vitro biochemical data further suggest that mutations at these two sites affect RNA binding, EC stability, but not polymerase catalytic rate (k(cat)) and apparent NTP affinity (K(M,NTP)). We propose that, although rarely captured by crystallography, similar surface pocket interaction with nucleobase may commonly exist in nucleic acid motor enzymes to facilitate their processivity.

The WHO Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Surveillance and Quality Assessment Collaborating Centres Network conducted a survey to assess the effects of COVID-19 on AMR surveillance, prevention and control. METHODS: From October to December 2020, WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) national focal points completed a questionnaire, including Likert scales and open-ended questions. Data were descriptively analysed, income/regional differences were assessed and free-text questions were thematically analysed. RESULTS: Seventy-three countries across income levels participated. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 67% reported limited ability to work with AMR partnerships; decreases in funding were frequently reported by low- and middle-income countries (LMICs; P < 0.01). Reduced availability of nursing, medical and public health staff for AMR was reported by 71%, 69% and 64%, respectively, whereas 67% reported stable cleaning staff availability. The majority (58%) reported reduced reagents/consumables, particularly LMICs (P < 0.01). Decreased numbers of cultures, elective procedures, chronically ill admissions and outpatients and increased ICU admissions reported could bias AMR data. Reported overall infection prevention and control (IPC) improvement could decrease AMR rates, whereas increases in selected inappropriate IPC practices and antimicrobial prescribing could increase rates. Most did not yet have complete data on changing AMR rates due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This was the first survey to explore the global impact of COVID-19 on AMR among GLASS countries. Responses highlight important actions to help ensure that AMR remains a global health priority, including engaging with GLASS to facilitate reliable AMR surveillance data, seizing the opportunity to develop more sustainable IPC programmes, promoting integrated antibiotic stewardship guidance, leveraging increased laboratory capabilities and other system-strengthening efforts.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the surveillance, prevention and control of antimicrobial resistance: a global survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Periampullary adenocarcinoma (PAAC) is a rare, lethal heterogeneous group of malignancy that differs in their molecular phenotypes. Ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73)/adenosine A2A Receptor (A2AR) pathway has shown an emerging role in cancer therapy through modulating the immune response. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the functional role of CD73 and A2AR in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and ampullary carcinoma (AC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: An immunohistochemical study for CD73 and A2AR carried on 48 PDAC cases, 21 AC cases and 34 adjacent non-tumor tissues that were taken from the farthest point of normal pancreatic tissue away from the tumor. RESULTS: CD73 was overexpressed in the PDAC (p < 0.001), and AC (p = 0.004) groups compared to their non-tumor tissues. However, A2AR was overexpressed in the PDAC group (p = 0.003) but not in the AC group (p = 0.359) compared to non-tumor tissue. In the PDAC group, CD73 overexpression was significantly associated with longer overall survival (p = 0.018). In contrary, A2AR overexpression was significantly associated with high grade (p = 0.001) and late- stage (p = 0.01). Both markers had no prognostic impact on AC. In the meantime, tumor immune response showed a negative prognostic role in PDAC and AC. The prognostic role of tumor immune response in the PDAC group was strongly modulated by CD73 and A2AR expression. CONCLUSIONS: PDAC and AC shared CD73 Overexpression while A2AR was overexpressed in PDAC only. In PDAC, CD73 and A2AR showed an opposed prognostic effect but both had no prognostic impact on AC.

The COVID-19 pandemic has perturbed the functioning of healthcare systems around the world and led to changes in elective surgical care, with bariatric procedures being postponed until the end of pandemic. There is no data in the literature about the effect of a new epidemiological situation on bariatric patients. Methods: The study was designed as an online survey containing multiple open questions about bariatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was conducted among pre- and postoperative bariatric patients. Results: Out of 800 respondents, 74.53% felt anxiety about their health in regard to the present epidemiologic state. Some (72.25%) were aware of the fact that obesity was an important risk factor that could impair the course of the COVID-19 disease. Almost 30% of respondents admitted having put on weight, significantly more in the group of preoperative patients (43.8% vs. 22.69%; p < 0.001). Only 20.92% of patients had a possibility of continuing direct bariatric care; 67.3% of patients had an opportunity of remote contact with a bariatric specialist, including online consultations, teleconsultations and social media meetings. Conclusions: Limited access to medical care and quarantine lockdown may result in a deterioration of long-time operation outcomes and lower weight losses.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are one of the major pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed by immune cells as well as non-immune cells, including neurons, which play a crucial role in generating cytokine storm. They recognize microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs, expressed by pathogens) and damage or death-associate molecular patterns (DAMPs; released and/expressed by damaged/killed host cells). Upon recognition of MAMPs and DAMPs, TLRs activate downstream signaling pathways releasing several pro-inflammatory mediators [cytokines, chemokines, interferons, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS or RNS)], which cause acute inflammation meant to control the pathogen and repair the damage. Induction of an exaggerated response due to genetic makeup of the host and/or persistence of the pathogen due to its evasion mechanisms may lead to severe systemic inflammatory condition called sepsis in response to the generation of cytokine storm and organ dysfunction. The activation of TLR-induced inflammatory response is hardwired to the induction of several negative feedback mechanisms that come into play to conclude the response and maintain immune homeostasis. This state-of-the-art review describes the importance of TLR signaling in the onset of the sepsis-associated cytokine storm and discusses various host-derived endogenous negative regulators of TLR signaling pathways. The subject is very important as there is a vast array of genes and processes implicated in these negative feedback mechanisms.

The clinical features and subsequent medical treatment, combined with the impact of a global pandemic, require specific nutritional therapy in hospitalised adults. This document aims to provide Australian and New Zealand clinicians with guidance on managing critically and acutely unwell adult patients hospitalised with COVID-19. These recommendations were developed using expert consensus, incorporating the documented clinical signs and metabolic processes associated with COVID-19, the literature from other respiratory illnesses, in particular Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, and published guidelines for medical management of COVID-19 and general nutrition and intensive care. Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 are likely to have pre-existing comorbidities, and the ensuing inflammatory response may result in increased metabolic demands, protein catabolism, and poor glycaemic control. Common medical interventions, including deep sedation, early mechanical ventilation, fluid restriction, and management in the prone position, may exacerbate gastrointestinal dysfunction and effect nutritional intake. Nutrition care should be tailored to pandemic capacity, with early gastric feeding commenced using an algorithm to provide nutrition for the first 5-7 days in lower nutritional risk patients, and individualised care for high nutritional risk patients where capacity allows. Indirect calorimetry should be avoided due to potential aerosole exposure and therefore infection risk to health care providers. Use of a volume-controlled, higher-protein enteral formula and gastric residual volume monitoring should be initiated. Careful monitoring, particularly post-ICU, is required to ensure appropriate nutrition delivery to prevent muscle deconditioning and aid recovery. The infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2 and the expected high volume of patient admissions will require contingency planning to optimise staffing resources including up-skilling, ensure adequate nutrition supplies, facilitate remote consultations and optimise foodservice management.

Despite the encouraging progress of existing computational approaches in protein function prediction, it remains challenging to annotate proteins to a novel function that is not collected in the Gene Ontology and does not have any annotated proteins. This limitation, a side effect from the widely-used multi-label classification problem setting of protein function prediction, hampers the progress of studying new pathways and biological processes, and further slows down research in various biomedical areas. Here, we tackle this problem by annotating proteins to a function only based on its textual description so that we do not need to know any associated proteins for this function. The key idea of our method ProTranslator is to redefine protein function prediction as a machine translation problem, which translates the description word sequence of a function to the amino acid sequence of a protein. We can then transfer annotations from functions that have similar textual description to annotate a novel function. We observed substantial improvement in annotating novel functions and sparsely annotated functions on CAFA3, SwissProt and GOA datasets. We further demonstrated how our method accurately predicted gene members for a given pathway in Reactome, KEGG and MSigDB only based on the pathway description.

The Amazon rain forest is one of the Brazilian biomes that suffers the most with fires caused by droughts and illegal deforestation. These fires can bring respiratory diseases associated with air pollution, and the State of Par in Brazil is the most affected. COVID-19 pandemics associated with air pollution can potentially increase hospitalizations and deaths related to respiratory diseases. Here, we aimed to evaluate the association of fire occurrences with the COVID-19 mortality rates and general respiratory diseases hospitalizations in the State of Par, Brazil. METHODS: We employed machine learning technique for clustering k-means accompanied with the elbow method used to identify the ideal quantity of clusters for the k-means algorithm, clustering 10 groups of cities in the State of Par where we selected the clusters with the highest and lowest fires occurrence from the 2015 to 2019. Next, an Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average Exogenous (ARIMAX) model was proposed to study the serial correlation of respiratory diseases hospitalizations and their associations with fire occurrences. Regarding the COVID-19 analysis, we computed the mortality risk and its confidence level considering the quarterly incidence rate ratio in clusters with high and low exposure to fires. FINDINGS: Using the k-means algorithm we identified two clusters with similar DHI (Development Human Index) and GDP (Gross Domestic Product) from a group of ten clusters that divided the State of Par but with diverse behavior considering the hospitalizations and forest fires in the Amazon biome. From the auto-regressive and moving average model (ARIMAX), it was possible to show that besides the serial correlation, the fires occurrences contribute to the respiratory diseases increase, with an observed lag of six months after the fires for the case with high exposure to fires. A highlight that deserves attention concerns the relationship between fire occurrences and deaths. Historically, the risk of mortality by respiratory diseases is higher (about the double) in regions and periods with high exposure to fires than the ones with low exposure to fires. The same pattern remains in the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, where the risk of mortality for COVID-19 was 80% higher in the region and period with high exposure to fires. Regarding the SARS-COV-2 analysis, the risk of mortality related to COVID-19 is higher in the period with high exposure to fires than in the period with low exposure to fires. Another highlight concerns the relationship between fire occurrences and COVID-19 deaths. The results show that regions with high fire occurrences are associated with more cases of COVID deaths. INTERPRETATION: The decision-make process is a critical problem mainly when it involves environmental and health control policies. Environmental policies are often more cost-effective as health measures than the use of public health services. This highlight the importance of data analyses to support the decision making and to identify population in need of better infrastructure due to historical environmental factors and the knowledge of associated health risk. The results suggest that The fires occurrences contribute to the increase of the respiratory diseases hospitalization. The mortality rate related to COVID-19 was higher for the period with high exposure to fires than the period with low exposure to fires. The regions with high fire occurrences is associated with more COVID-19 deaths, mainly in the months with high number of fires.

We focus not only on experimental results but also discuss theoretical and simulation studies regarding kinetic and structural aspects of heteroaggregation processes arising in such systems. In the first part of this work, heteroaggregation of oppositely charged particles is reviewed. When the interactions are short ranged, binary diffusion-limited cluster-cluster aggregation takes place. In this case, the short time behavior of the system follows the Hogg, Healy and Fuerstenau (HHF) theory. At long times, however, stable aggregates may form and remain in the system. Furthermore, cluster discrimination is observed, clusters that differ only by one constituent particle were found to behave quite differently. When the range of the interactions is increased, the latter effects become more pronounced. The fractal dimension of heteroaggregates is, in general, smaller than the values reported for fast and slow homoaggregation processes. In some cases, even values close to unity were obtained. This means that heteroaggregates have an open branched structure that may approach a chain-like morphology.

Considering the current pandemic, it's important to understand how COVID-19 impacts individuals with SCD, a medically vulnerable population. We sought to identify factors associated with more severe COVID-19 illness and hospitalization in the SCD population. We established the international SECURE-SCD Registry to collect COVID-19 data in SCD patients. Providers were instructed to report confirmed COVID-19 cases after the disease course was known. Providers reported demographics, prior SCD complications and COVID-19 related hospitalization, severity/management strategies and death. Data were without protected health information. We used multivariable models to estimate the independent effects of age, sex, genotype, SCD-related and non-related comorbidities grouped by organ systems on the outcomes of severe COVID-19 and hospitalization. We defined the pain variable as 0, 1-2 or &gt;2 prior acute care visits (i.e., emergency department visits, hospitalizations) for pain in the last 3 years. As of October 12th, 2020, 366 COVID-19 cases in SCD patients were reported, 41.5% were children and 52.7% were female. Acute pain was the most common presenting symptom of COVID-19 in SCD patients (54.6%), followed by pneumonia (27.0%). Children who had more than 2 acute care visits for pain had a more severe course of COVID-19 (OR=3.964, 95% CI (1.420, 11.065), p=0.03) and required hospitalization (OR=4.641, 95% CI (1.976, 10.900), p=0.006). Children who had 1-2 acute care visits for pain showed no significant association with COVID-19 severity (p=0.73) or hospitalization (p=0.82). In adults, there was no association between with history of frequent SCD pain and COVID outcomes. Pain is the most common presenting symptom of COVID-19 in SCD patients. Further, more than 2 prior acute care visits for pain is associated with severe COVID-19 course and hospitalization in children with SCD and not in adults.

METHODS: Patient and operator manikins were used to recreate a dental setting inside a custom-built class III cabinet-like chamber. The mouth of the patient manikin was inoculated with an HCoV-229E suspension, the viral load of which was similar to that of asymptomatic people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The dental procedure was performed with an air turbine handpiece and HVE for 10 seconds. The efficacy of surgical masks, N95 (filtering facepiece class 2) and filtering facepiece class 3 respirators, and face shields was tested via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The wide surface on which the inoculum was spread caused low contamination. Over the external surfaces of masks and respirators, when a face shield was not worn, viral loads ranged from 1.2 through 1.4 log10 mean gene copies per cm2. When the shield was worn, viral loads dropped below the detection limit (< 0.317 log10 gene copies/cm2) for all PPE. On the operator's forehead, viral loads were 0.6 through 0.8 log10 gene copies/cm2. Inside the operator manikin's mouth, viral loads were under the detection limit when using any PPE, with or without the shield. HVE did not significantly change viral loads. CONCLUSIONS: All PPE combinations significantly reduced viral loads in the operator manikin's mouth to below the detection limit, but HVE did not decrease viral contamination. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Although caution is suggested when removing and disposing of PPE to avoid self-contamination, the combination of PPE and face shields drastically decreases the risk of transmitting human coronavirus during aerosol-generating dental procedures.","output":"Efficacy of personal protective equipment against coronavirus transmission via dental handpieces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a new production factor, digitalization plays a vital role in society, economy, and the environment.

The results show that the energy structure mainly based on coal has a significant driving effect on carbon emissions. Compared with non-resource-based provinces, the increase of energy structure dominated by coal has a greater effect on carbon emission in resource-based provinces. It is worth noting that this kind of influence has a greater impact on the central region of China, followed by the western region and the eastern region. Besides, the digital economy has a significant moderating effect. With the development of digital economy, the impact of coal-based energy structure on carbon emissions is gradually decreasing.

DESIGN Population-based retrospective cohort study. SETTING Residential neighbourhoods (1000-metre circular buffers from the centroids of dissemination areas) across Canada for which the Canadian ALE Measure was derived, based on intersection density, points of interest and dwelling density. PARTICIPANTS 249 420 survey respondents from an individual-level record linkage between the Canadian Community Health Survey (2000-2010) and the Canadian Mortality Database until 2011, comprised of older women (65-85 years), older men (65-81 years), middle-aged women (45-64 years) and middle-aged men (45-64 years). PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES Premature cardiometabolic mortality and average daily energy expenditure attributable to walking. Multivariable proportional hazards regression models were adjusted for age, educational attainment, dissemination area-level median income, smoking status, obesity, the presence of chronic conditions, season of survey response and survey cycle. RESULTS Survey respondents contributed a total of 1 451 913 person-years. Greater walking was observed in more favourable ALEs. Walking was associated with lower cardiometabolic death in all groups except for middle-aged men. Favourable ALEs conferred a 22% reduction in death from cardiometabolic causes (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97) for older women. CONCLUSIONS On average, people walk more in favourable ALEs, regardless of sex and age. With the exception of middle-aged men, walking is associated with lower premature cardiometabolic death.

It can be subdivided into three major classifications based on the component of the neuromuscular system (i.e. peripheral nerves or skeletal muscle or both) that are affected. This includes critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), critical illness myopathy (CIM), and an overlap syndrome, critical illness polyneuromyopathy (CIPNM). It is a common complication observed in people with critical illness requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Given CIAW is found in individuals experiencing grave illness, it can be challenging to study from a practical standpoint. However, over the past 2 decades, many insights into the pathophysiology of this condition have been made. Results from studies in both humans and animal models have found that a profound systemic inflammatory response and factors related to bioenergetic failure as well as microvascular, metabolic, and electrophysiological alterations underlie the development of CIAW. Current management strategies focus on early mobilization, achieving euglycemia, and nutritional optimization. Other interventions lack sufficient evidence, mainly due to a dearth of large trials. The goal of this Physiology in Medicine article is to highlight important aspects of the pathophysiology of these enigmatic conditions. It is hoped that improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying these disorders will lead to further study and new investigations for novel pharmacologic, nutritional, and exercise-based interventions to optimize patient outcomes.","output":"Pathophysiology and management of critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides a practical approach to acute vestibular syndrome while highlighting recent research advances. RECENT FINDINGS: Acute vestibular syndrome is defined as sudden-onset, continuous vertigo lasting longer than 24 hours with associated nausea and vomiting, all of which are worsened with head movement. Acute vestibular syndrome is provoked by a variety of central and peripheral causes, the most common of which are vestibular neuritis and acute stroke (posterior circulation). A clinical approach focusing on timing, associated history, and ocular motor findings can improve diagnostic accuracy and is more sensitive and specific than early neuroimaging. Because of the shared neurovascular supply, both peripheral and central vestibular disorders can manifest overlapping signs previously considered solely peripheral or central, including vertical skew, nystagmus, abnormal vestibular ocular reflex, hearing loss, and gait instability. Although acute vestibular syndrome is typically benign, stroke should be considered in every person with acute vestibular syndrome because it can act as a harbinger of stroke or impending cerebellar herniation. Treatment is focused on physical therapy because the evidence is minimal for the long-term use of medication. SUMMARY: The diagnosis of acute vestibular syndrome first requires the elimination of common medical causes for dizziness. Next, underlying pathology must be determined by distinguishing between the most common causes of acute vestibular syndrome: central and peripheral vestibular disorders. Central vestibular disorders are most often the result of ischemic stroke affecting the cerebellar arteries. Peripheral vestibular disorders are assumed to be caused mostly by inflammatory sources, but ischemia of the peripheral vestibular apparatus may be underappreciated. By using the HINTS Plus (Head Impulse test, Nystagmus, Test of Skew with Plus referring to hearing loss assessment) examination in addition to a comprehensive neurologic examination, strokes are unlikely to be missed. For nearly all acute vestibular disorders, vestibular physical therapy contributes to recovery.","output":"Acute Vestibular Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many infectious/ communicable diseases (IDs) are endemic in Nepal. Until a decade and half ago, IDs were the major cause of both morbidity and mortality accounting 70% for both. However, as a result of various preventive measures implemented by both the state and non-state actors, the overall IDs have shown a changing (declining) trend. The most impressive decline has been seen in the intestinal helminth infection. Though the overall burden of IDs is decreasing, several newer infectious diseases (emerging infections) namely, dengue fever, scrub typhus, influenza (H5N1 and H1N1), and others are posing a great public health problem. On the other hand, though sporadic, outbreaks of endemic diseases together with HIV-TB coinfection and infection with drug resistance microbes during recent years have constituted a serious public health as well as medical problem. On the contrary, with the decline of IDs, noninfectious diseases (noncommunicable disease, NCD) namely, diabetes, cancer (and cancer therapy), and others are on the rise particularly in urban areas.

Data are triangulated from deaf primary and secondary school students, their teachers, interpreters and parents. Deaf learners encountered unique modality-specific barriers since e-learning in the country was not prepared to convey the full range of communication available in sign language. Challenges also stemmed from institutional support issues, existing social inequalities and the unique sociolinguistic history of the local deaf community.

We observed an independent positive mutual association between S. aureus and rhinovirus carriage and between H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis carriage. Dual carriage of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis was strongly associated with S. pneumoniae carriage (OR = 6.22, 95%CI [2.04-19.01]). Finally, our model showed that M. catarrhalis carriage was negatively associated with K. pneumoniae carriage. Chronic respiratory disease was associated with symptoms of LRTI. K. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis-S. aureus and H. influenzae-rhinovirus dual carriage was associated with LRTI symptoms. Our data suggest that RTIs at the Hajj are a result of complex interactions between a number of respiratory viruses and bacteria. Author summary Despite the recommendation to take individual preventive measures to prevent respiratory tract infections, these infections remain common among Hajj pilgrims. Respiratory pathogens acquired during the Hajj are usually studied individually, although in their natural environment they often compete or coexist with multiple microbial species. A better understanding of polymicrobial interactions in the nasopharynx among Hajj pilgrims is important. Our study describes the dynamics of the acquisition of respiratory pathogens and their potential interactions among pilgrims during the Hajj. We found that polymicrobial carriage was observed in most individuals and that some pathogens associated positively while other did not. Some pathogen associations correlated with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections.","output":"The dynamics and interactions of respiratory pathogen carriage among French pilgrims during the 2018 Hajj"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is growing evidence that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a neurotropic and neuroinvasive potential.

Methods A cross-sectional study, with a purposive sampling was conducted from March 2018 to November 2018 to enroll 540 infants 6 months of age from three different sites in Karachi, Pakistan. The anthropometric measurements (MUAC, length and weight) were taken by experienced community health workers. The data were analyzed using SPSS. MUAC was compared with WLZ-score for sensitivity and specificity to observe the concordant among the two diagnostic measures. The Youden Index was used to determine the ideal cut-off for infants less than 6 months of age in this population and the Kappa coefficient was also calculated to assess the agreement between MUAC and WLZ-score. Results The study findings revealed that SAM was found in 13.6% (n=74) of the children. MUAC cut-off 11.5 cm yielded the Youden Index of 0.31 with 59.5% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity.

Several viruses and bacteria can cause acute pharyngitis; however, Streptococcus pyogenes (also known as Lancefield group A -hemolytic streptococci) is the only agent that requires an etiologic diagnosis and specific treatment. S. pyogenes is of major clinical importance because it can trigger post-infection systemic complications, acute rheumatic fever, and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Symptom onset in streptococcal infection is usually abrupt and includes intense sore throat, fever, chills, malaise, headache, tender enlarged anterior cervical lymph nodes, and pharyngeal or tonsillar exudate. Cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and diarrhea are uncommon, and their presence suggests a viral cause. A diagnosis of pharyngitis is supported by the patient's history and by the physical examination. Throat culture is the gold standard for diagnosing streptococcus pharyngitis. However, it has been underused in public health services because of its low availability and because of the 1- to 2-day delay in obtaining results. Rapid antigen detection tests have been used to detect S. pyogenes directly from throat swabs within minutes. Clinical scoring systems have been developed to predict the risk of S. pyogenes infection. The most commonly used scoring system is the modified Centor score. Acute S. pyogenes pharyngitis is often a self-limiting disease. Penicillins are the first-choice treatment. For patients with penicillin allergy, cephalosporins can be an acceptable alternative, although primary hypersensitivity to cephalosporins can occur. Another drug option is the macrolides.

Considering the substantial increase in screen time caused by social isolation policies, this study aimed to analyze the association of increased screen time in different devices during the COVID-19 pandemic with consumption and increased desire of alcohol, smoking, and sweetened foods in adults. Methods: A sample of 1,897 adults with a mean age of 37.9 (13.3) years was assessed by an online survey, being composed by 58% of women. Participants were asked whether screen time in television, cell phone, and computer increased during the pandemic, as well as how much time is spent in each device. Closed questions assessed the frequency of alcohol and sweetened food consumption, smoking, and an increased desire to drink and smoke during the pandemic. Educational level, age, sex, feeling of stress, anxiety, depression, and use of a screen device for physical activity were covariates. Binary logistic regression models considered adjustment for covariates and for mutual habits. Results: Increased television time was associated with increased desire to drink (OR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.12; 1.89) and increased sweetened food consumption (OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.18; 1.99), while an increase in computer use was negatively associated with consumption of alcohol (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.53; 0.86) and sweetened foods (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.62; 0.98). Increased cell phone time was associated with increased sweetened food consumption during the pandemic (OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.18; 2.67).

Little is known about the challenges to advance care planning in this context, or the changes services made to adapt. AIM: Describe the challenges that UK specialist palliative care services experienced regarding advance care planning during COVID-19 and changes made to support timely conversations. DESIGN: Online survey of UK palliative/hospice services' response to COVID-19. Closed-ended responses are reported descriptively. Open-ended responses were analysed using a thematic Framework approach using the Social Ecological Model to understand challenges. RESPONDENTS: Two hundred and seventy-seven services. RESULTS: More direct advance care planning was provided by 38% of services, and 59% provided more support to others. Some challenges to advance care planning pre-dated the pandemic, whilst others were specific to/exacerbated by COVID-19. Challenges are demonstrated through six themes: complex decision making in the face of a new infectious disease; maintaining a personalised approach; COVID-19-specific communication difficulties; workload and pressure; sharing information; and national context of fear and uncertainty. Two themes demonstrate changes made to support: adapting local processes and adapting local structures. CONCLUSIONS: Professionals and healthcare providers need to ensure advance care planning is individualised by tailoring it to the values, priorities, and ethnic/cultural/religious context of each person. Policymakers need to consider how high-quality advance care planning can be resourced as a part of standard healthcare ahead of future pandemic waves.

Objective: To examine the expression of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in lacrimal gland tissues of a patient with COVID-19 and a patient without COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this retrospective case-control study, the case of a 35-year-old woman with positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 who had had lacrimal gland enlargements for 6 months was analyzed. A 43-year-old woman without COVID-19 who had idiopathic chronic bilateral dacryoadenitis served as a negative control. Main Outcomes and Measures: Histopathology and immunohistochemistry with anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and ACE2 in the lacrimal glands. Results: Both patients were Japanese women aged 35 years (case) and 43 years (control). Histopathologic findings in the patient with COVID-19 demonstrated marked inflammatory cell infiltration, lymphoid follicles, and germinal center formation in the lacrimal gland. The inflammation was mainly made up of lymphocytes and plasma cells with several polymorphonuclear leukocytes, where the lacrimal glands were atrophic. Of note, a number of lacrimal gland ducts markedly contained eosinophilic materials in the lumens, which indicated glandular damage. Immunoreactivity for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was noted in the inflammatory cells around the lacrimal gland ductal epithelia. In addition, strong ACE2 expression was noted in the lacrimal gland. In the patient without COVID-19, marked inflammation was noted in the lacrimal gland; however, there were no eosinophilic material deposits in the ductal lumens. SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein immunoreactivity was not observed, whereas ACE2 was expressed in the lacrimal glands. Conclusions and Relevance: In this case-control study, expression of ACE2 indicated that the lacrimal gland could be a target organ for SARS-CoV-2 to adhere to.

Here, we tackle the limitation by using polarization-dependent two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy and quantify the excitation energy-dependent biexciton binding energy at cryogenic temperatures. The biexciton binding energy increases with excitation energy, which can be modeled as a near inverse-square size dependence in the effective mass approximation considering the quantum confinement effect. The spectral line width for the exciton-biexciton transition is much broader than that for the ground state to exciton transition, suggesting weakly correlated broadening between these transitions.

Project team members alert clinicians by email of scores that exceed severity thresholds as follows-Distress: 4, PHQ-8: 8, GAD-7: 10, any item on r-ESAS: 4 and PROCTCAE Insomnia: Severe/very severe or quite a bit/very much. Results: From May 29, 2020 and April 5, 2021, 67 patients were approached for participation, and 40 (59.7%) completed the BL PROs. Median age was 64 (range 36-85). Most participants were White (70%), non-Hispanic (90%) and had hormone receptor-positive (93%) MBC. At BL, 22 (55%) had visceral disease and most were receiving endocrine-based regimens [21 (53%)] or chemotherapy [16 (40%)]. 27 (68%) participants had 1 BL alert. The most common BL alerts were for symptoms on the r-ESAS [23 participants (58%)]. The most frequent items on the r-ESAS for which participants had BL alerts were pain, tiredness, well-being, tingling/numbness and rash. Other BL alerts were: Distress [9 participants (23%)], PROCTCAE Insomnia [5 participants (13%)], PHQ-8 [4 participants (10%)] and GAD-7 [2 participants (5%)]. To date, 24 of 35 (69%) and 15 of 28 (54%) participants who have reached the 3 and 6 mo time points have completed the respective follow-up (FU) PROs. Most common FU alerts to date are on the r-ESAS [3 mo: 14 participants (58%), 6 mo: 9 participants (60%)]. The project team has successfully notified providers of all alerts to date. Clinical actions (phone calls, provider visits and/or referrals) have been taken within 30 days of notification for > 75% of alerts. Conclusions: Implementation of a PRO battery for patients receiving routine care for MBC led to detection of a range of symptoms, the majority of which were clinically actionable. Restrictions on in-person interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to low rates of PRO completion in this pilot project. Prior to broader implementation, we will consider strategies such as an electronic platform and a shorter battery to enhance patient engagement.","output":"Patient-reported outcomes to assess symptoms in patients with metastatic breast cancer: Pilot implementation project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Training in cardiac surgery is a cumbersome topic.

Our objective was to describe the characteristics, outcomes and management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia at a single designated pandemic centre in Montral, Canada. METHODS: A descriptive analysis was performed on consecutive critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the ICU at the Jewish General Hospital, a designated pandemic centre in Montral, between Mar. 5 and May 21, 2020. Complete follow-up data corresponding to death or discharge from hospital health records were included to Aug. 4, 2020.

METHODS This study evaluated 14 meshes including bare polypropylene, macroporous polytetrafluoroethylene, absorbable barrier, partially absorbable mesh, and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene materials. Each mesh provided 15 specimens, which were prepared in 7.5  7.5-cm squares. Of these, 5 \\"undamaged\\" specimens were subjected to ball-burst testing to determine their biomechanical properties before application of helical titanium tacks (ProTack). To 10 \\"damaged\\" specimens 7 tacks were applied 1 cm apart in a 3.5-cm-diameter circle using a tacking force of 25 to 28 N. The tacks were removed from five of the specimens before ball-burst testing and left intact in the remaining five specimens. RESULTS The application of tacks had no effect on the tensile strength of Dualmesh, ProLite Ultra, Infinit, Ultrapro, C-QUR Lite (<6 in.), Prolene Soft, or Physiomesh, but the tensile strengths were reduced for Bard Mesh, C-QUR, ProLite, and C-QUR Lite (>6 in.). Most of the meshes did not exhibit significantly different tensile strengths between removal of tacks and tacks left intact. Exceptions included C-QUR, Prolene, Ultrapro, and Bard Soft Mesh, which were weaker with removal of tacks than with tacks left intact during the test. Damage due to the application of helical titanium tacks also caused increased strain at a stress of 16 N/cm for all the meshes except C-QUR Lite (>6 in.) and Physiomesh. CONCLUSIONS Many of the meshes evaluated in this study exhibited damage in the form of reduced tensile strength and increased extensibility after the application of tacks compared with the corresponding \\"undamaged\\" meshes. Meshes with smaller interstices and larger filaments were influenced negatively by the application of helical titanium tacks, whereas mesh designs with larger interstices and smaller filaments tended to maintain their baseline mechanical properties.","output":"Biomechanical evaluation of potential damage to hernia repair materials due to fixation with helical titanium tacks."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Emergence of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caught the world off guard and unprepared, initiating a global pandemic. In the absence of evidence, individual communities had to take timely action to reduce the rate of disease spread and avoid overburdening their health care systems. Although a few predictive models have been published to guide these decisions, most have not taken into account spatial differences and have included assumptions that do not match the local realities. Access to reliable information that is adapted to local context is critical for policy makers to make informed decisions during a rapidly evolving pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to develop an adapted susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model to predict the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina and the Charlotte Metropolitan Region, and to incorporate the effect of a public health intervention to reduce disease spread while accounting for unique regional features and imperfect detection. METHODS: Three SIR models were fit to infection prevalence data from North Carolina and the greater Charlotte Region and then rigorously compared. One of these models (SIR-int) accounted for a stay-at-home intervention and imperfect detection of COVID-19 cases. We computed longitudinal total estimates of the susceptible, infected, and removed compartments of both populations, along with other pandemic characteristics such as the basic reproduction number. RESULTS: Prior to March 26, disease spread was rapid at the pandemic onset with the Charlotte Region doubling time of 2.56 days (95% CI 2.11-3.25) and in North Carolina 2.94 days (95% CI 2.33-4.00). Subsequently, disease spread significantly slowed with doubling times increased in the Charlotte Region to 4.70 days (95% CI 3.77-6.22) and in North Carolina to 4.01 days (95% CI 3.43-4.83). Reflecting spatial differences, this deceleration favored the greater Charlotte Region compared to North Carolina as a whole. A comparison of the efficacy of intervention, defined as 1 C the hazard ratio of infection, gave 0.25 for North Carolina and 0.43 for the Charlotte Region. In addition, early in the pandemic, the initial basic SIR model had good fit to the data; however, as the pandemic and local conditions evolved, the SIR-int model emerged as the model with better fit. CONCLUSIONS: Using local data and continuous attention to model adaptation, our findings have enabled policy makers, public health officials, and health systems to proactively plan capacity and evaluate the impact of a public health intervention. Our SIR-int model for estimated latent prevalence was reasonably flexible, highly accurate, and demonstrated efficacy of a stay-at-home order at both the state and regional level. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating local context into pandemic forecast modeling, as well as the need to remain vigilant and informed by the data as we enter into a critical period of the outbreak.","output":"Modeling COVID-19 Latent Prevalence to Assess a Public Health Intervention at a State and Regional Scale: Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigated the prevalence and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in recipients of kidney transplants in the Bronx, New York, one of the epicenters of the pandemic. Between March 16 and June 2, 2020, 132 kidney transplant recipients tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. From May 3 to July 29, 2020, 912 kidney transplant recipients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies during routine clinic visits, of which 16.6% tested positive. Fifty-five of the 152 patients had previously tested positive by RT-PCR, while the remaining 97 did not have significant symptoms and had not been previously tested by RT-PCR. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 23.4% in the 975 patients tested by either RT-PCR or SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Older patients and patients with higher serum creatinine levels were more likely diagnosed by RT-PCR compared to SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Sixty-nine RT-PCR positive patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies at a median of 44 days post-diagnosis (Inter Quartile Range 31-58) and 80% were positive. Overall mortality was 20.5% but significantly higher (37.8%) in the patients who required hospitalization. Twenty-three percent of the hospitalized patients required kidney replacement therapy and 6.3% lost their allografts. In multivariable analysis, older age, receipt of deceased-donor transplantation, lack of influenza vaccination in the previous year and higher serum interleukine-6 levels were associated with mortality. Thus, 42% of patients with a kidney transplant and with COVID-19 were diagnosed on antibody testing without significant clinical symptoms; 80% of patients with positive RT-PCR developed SARS-CoV-2 IgG and mortality was high among patients requiring hospitalization.","output":"COVID-19 infection in kidney transplant recipients at the epicenter of pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (covid-19) is a pandemic of international concern It creates serious health risk all around the globe and it has no effective treatment Doxycycline and Quinine are the drugs used as ligands in the study as these drugs has proved in vitro antiviral activity against dengue virus and herpes simplex virus These compounds were targeted against non structural protein (nsp 12) which plays a vital role in replication and transcription of Corona viral genome The protein 6 NUR that showed maximal identity of target protein nsp 12 was retrieved using BLASTp Further the protein was modelled and the compounds were docked using AUTODOCK software and to study the structure activity relationship of ligand with target protein and biochemical information of ligand receptor interaction was done Both the compounds, Doxycycline and Quinine were well engaged into the active site of target protein nsp 12 with strong hydrogen bond interaction and non polar interaction with active site of the protein The Docking score of Doxycycline is found to be - 7 34 kcal/mol while that of Quinine being -6 14 Kcal/mol This indicates the potential of these drugs as a lead against the nsp target protein of Corona virus which need further analysis and Optimisation studies","output":"COVID-19 - In Silico Structure Prediction and Molecular Docking Studies with Doxycycline and Quinine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA and infectious virus particles from patient samples requires a good sample quality.

It has challenged the active treatment of oncology patients, having protocols that require frequent monitoring. Some patients' anxiety of the COVID-19 pandemic led to delays in treatment and impaired the effectiveness of anti-cancer therapy. Moreover, the stage migration term was coined to newly referred patients who postponed their doctor's appointment leading to late diagnosis. Prevention of COVID-19 disease among oncology patients is a priority, in order to avert morbidity, complications and mortality. In a recently published article, Waissengrin et al. compared the incidence of COVID-19 disease in oncology patients at Tel-Aviv Medical Center to the general population between March 2020 and October 2020. A lower rate of confirmed cases was demonstrated among oncology patients in comparison to the general population. This difference was attributed to the oncology patients' adherence to COVID-19 avoidance guidelines. In addition, no association was found between a specific type of cancer or oncological treatment and mortality from COVID-19. However, a significant correlation was presented between severe COVID-19 disease, old age and the presence of metastases. Waissengrin et al., support the importance of continuing the oncological care routine to avoid the devastating consequences of postponing treatments.

In conclusion, a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine can induce trained immunity responses against SARS-CoV-2, which may result in relative protection against COVID-19. These data, coupled with similar recent independent reports, argue for a beneficial effect of influenza vaccination against influenza as well as COVID-19, and suggests its effective deployment in the 2020-2021 influenza season to protect against both infections.","output":"The effect of influenza vaccination on trained immunity: impact on COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM Extremely preterm infants are separated from their mothers immediately after birth and not placed skin-to-skin in routine neonatal intensive care unit settings. Visual and physical contact in the delivery room as a first cuddle potentially can facilitate early parent-infant interaction and reduce the trauma of separation. Our aim in this study was to explore mothers' experience of delivery room cuddle by collecting qualitative feedback via emotional mapping. METHODS Six mothers experiencing delivery room cuddle had been recruited (GA of their babies 24+5 - 29+0 weeks, birth weight 540-1019g). Using a descriptive qualitative approach, semi-structured interviews were performed with six mothers following consent via Zoom or phone between September 2020 and March 2021. Interviews were transcribed using AI Otter and then analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS Analysis of the participants' experiences revealed five themes: fears and hopes around delivery; the moment of delivery - recognising uncertainty; reclaiming normalcy; forming connections; and the journey ahead as an empowered parent. CONCLUSION All mothers reported positive emotions about the cuddle with their baby. They highlighted that this physical contact was often the only positive and 'normal' birth experience they had from the time of delivery.","output":"Cuddling very and extremely preterm babies in the delivery room is a positive and normal experience for mothers after the birth."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has become pandemic and the duration of protective immunity to the virus is unknown.

This study assessed the feasibility of two ITCs, a network meta-analysis (NMA) and a population-adjusted ITC (PAIC), comparing the efficacy of the PARP inhibitor niraparib in the PRIMA trial (NCT02655016) with other 1L maintenance treatments. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify trials using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions to assess differences in trial design, population characteristics, treatment arms, and outcome measures. All 12 trials identified were excluded from the NMA due to the absence of a common comparator and differences in survival measures and/or inclusion criteria. The PAIC comparing PRIMA and PAOLA-1 trials was also not feasible due to differences in inclusion criteria, survival measures, and the previous receipt of chemotherapy/bevacizumab. Neither ITC met recommended guidelines for analysis; the results of such comparisons would not be considered appropriate evidence when selecting 1L maintenance options in ovarian cancer.

Methods: HCWs of the system were retrospectively included from the beginning of a COVID-19 vaccination program (December 16, 2020) until March 31, 2021. Those with a prior COVID-19 infection before December 15 were excluded. The Occupational Health department of the system ran a COVID-19 screening and testing referral program for workers, consistently throughout the study period. A master database had been established and updated comprising of the demographics, COVID-19 PCR assays, and vaccinations of each HCW.

Results: Among the 4317 eligible HCWs, 3249 (75%) received any vaccination during the study period. Vaccinated HCWs were older, less likely to be Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino or identify as two or more races, and more likely to be medical providers. After adjusting for age, sex, race, and the statewide background incidence at the time of vaccination, we observed a VE of 80.2% (95% CI: 57.5-90.8%) for [greater double equals]14 days after the first dose of Pfizer/Moderna, and 95.5% (95% CI: 88.2-98.3%) among those fully vaccinated (i.e. [greater double equals]14 days after the second dose of Pfizer/Moderna or the single dose of J&J/Janssen).

Methods: A total of 476 siponimod plasma concentrations aggregated from 28 dosage groups (corresponding to 294 healthy volunteers and 207 patients with MS) were collected from published clinical trials. Population pharmacokinetic (PPK) analysis was performed using a nonlinear, mixed-effect modeling approach. The pharmacokinetic properties of siponimod in healthy volunteers and patients with MS were compared, and the influence of covariates on siponimod exposure was evaluated using both PPK analysis and noncompartmental analysis (NCA). Results: A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination adequately described siponimod pharmacokinetics. The typical population parameter estimates of clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution (V/F), and absorption rate constant (ka) were 3.17 L/h, 112.70 L, and 0.38 h(?1), respectively. An 11.85% lower siponimod clearance was estimated for patients with MS relative to healthy volunteers. Subgroup analyses using NCA assessments revealed that siponimod presented an accumulation index of approximately 2 after multiple administration. Compared with nonobese participants, obese participants had a relatively lower dose-corrected area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(0-)/D) (0.31 vs. 0.42 h/L) and V/F (120.95 vs. 133.75 L), and a relatively higher CL/F (3.25 vs. 3.21 L/h). Participants with CYP2C9*2/*3, *1/*3, and *3/*3 genotypes experienced an increased (1.3- and 3.4-fold, respectively) AUC(0-)/D and a decreased (0.7- and 0.3-fold, respectively) CL/F compared with those in participants with the CYP2C9*1/*1, *1*2, and *2*2 genotypes. Fluconazole combination led to a decrease in CL/F (approximately 0.5 times) and an increase in AUC(0-)/D (approximately 1.3 times). Conclusion: Siponimod pharmacokinetic properties in healthy volunteers and patients with MS were explored using complementary model-based meta-analysis (MBMA) and NCA approaches. A slightly lower siponimod clearance was observed in patients with MS than in healthy volunteers.

We aimed to determine whether, despite this, a decline in acute stroke presentations, imaging and intervention occurred during the pandemic at a busy stroke centre. METHODS: The number of 'code stroke' activations, multimodal CTs and endovascular clot retrievals (ECRs) performed during the pandemic period (3/1/2020-5/10/2020) at a large comprehensive stroke centre was compared against the pre-pandemic period (3/1/2019-1/31/2019) using Z-statistics. Year-on-year comparison of the number of patients with large vessel occlusions (LVOs) and ECRs performed per month was also made. RESULTS: The number of 'code stroke' activations and patients undergoing multimodal CT per month decreased significantly (P < 0.0025) following lockdown on 29th March. The number of ECRs also decreased (P = 0.165). The nadir in the weekly number of CTs coincided with lockdown and the peak of new COVID-19 cases. The number of patients with LVOs and ECRs increased by 15% and 14%, respectively, in March but decreased by 55% and 48%, respectively, in April. CONCLUSIONS: The significant decrease in volume of 'code stroke' activations and acute stroke imaging following lockdown was accompanied by a concomitant decrease in patients with LVOs and ECRs. The decrease in imaging was therefore not driven purely by patients with mild strokes and stroke mimics, but also included those with severe strokes. Since Australia had a low prevalence of COVID-19, this observed decrease cannot be attributed to hospital congestion and is instead likely driven by patient fear.","output":"Where have our patients gone?

The ATXCLPA axis has been associated with cognitive dysfunction and inflammatory diseases, mainly in a range of nonalcoholic liver diseases. Recently, preclinical and clinical evidence has suggested a role of LPA signaling in alcohol use disorder (AUD) and AUD-related cognitive function. However, the ATXCLPA axis has not been sufficiently investigated in alcoholic liver diseases. An exploratory study was conducted in 136 participants, 66 abstinent patients with AUD seeking treatment for alcohol (alcohol group), and 70 healthy control subjects (control group). The alcohol group was divided according to the presence of comorbid liver diseases (i.e., fatty liver/steatosis, alcoholic steatohepatitis, or cirrhosis). All participants were clinically evaluated, and plasma concentrations of total LPA and ATX were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Data were primarily analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) while controlling for age, body mass index, and sex. Logistic regression models were created to assess the association of the ATXCLPA axis and AUD or liver disease. LPA and ATX were log(10)-transformed to fit the assumptions of parametric testing.The main results were as follows: total LPA and ATX concentrations were dysregulated in the alcohol group, and patients with AUD had significantly lower LPA (F((1,131)) = 10.677, p = 0.001) and higher ATX (F((1,131)) = 8.327, p = 0.005) concentrations than control subjects; patients with AUD and liver disease had significantly higher ATX concentrations (post hoc test, p < 0.05) than patients with AUD but not liver disease; significant correlations between AUD-related variables and concentrations of LPA and ATX were only found in the non-liver disease subgroup (the duration of alcohol abstinence with LPA and ATX (r = +0.33, p < 0.05); and the severity of AUD with ATX (rho = ?0.33, p < 0.05)); and a logistic regression model with LPA, ATX, and AUD-related variables showed an excellent discriminative power (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.915, p < 0.001) for distinguishing patients with AUD and comorbid liver disease. In conclusion, our data show that the ATXCLPA axis is dysregulated in AUD and suggest this lipid signaling, in combination with relevant AUD-related variables, as a reliable biomarker of alcoholic liver diseases.","output":"Plasma Concentrations of Lysophosphatidic Acid and Autotaxin in Abstinent Patients with Alcohol Use Disorder and Comorbid Liver Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research on data extraction methods applies recent advances in natural language processing to evidence synthesis based on medical texts.

This study assessed the feasibility of collecting reliable chronic disease data in Irish general practice, using a program of training and feedback to improve the quality of coding for chronic conditions in practice information systems. Methods: Training in chronic disease coding and reporting was provided to a purposive sample of general practices in Ireland. From July to December 2020, practices reported the number of patients receiving free medical care, and the number of patients coded with each of eight chronic conditions: type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ischaemic heart disease (IHD), heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (ATF), transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and cerebrovascular accident/stroke (CVA). Calculated prevalences were compared with national and international estimates. Results: We recruited and trained 16 practices with 65.5 full-time equivalent GPs and a study-eligible patient population of 36,327. There was a large degree of variation across practices for all conditions. For example, in July, reported prevalence of IHD ranged from 0.3% to 10.2% (a 34-fold difference), and reported prevalence of HF ranged from 0.2% to 4.0% (a 20-fold difference). No single practice had high or low prevalences across all conditions. Changes over time across all practices were minimal, averaging between 0.1% and 0.3% for all conditions. By December, a large degree of variation across practices remained. Across all conditions, average prevalences were higher than previously published estimates. Conclusions: Although hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic, it was feasible to implement this programme of training and feedback to report on chronic disease data recorded in general practice.

CONCLUSION: To be complete, evaluation of hearing status requires testing understanding of speech in noise. The examination must begin with a minimum of two measurements familiarizing the subject with the test procedure.

The first is whether production will be mainly publicly managed, privately managed, or 'mixed.' The second is whether the financing of production will be mainly publicly managed, privately managed, or mixed.In the American commercial republic, we seem more or less to have answered the 'who does production' question to our own satisfaction. From the founding era to the present, we have elected to leave production primarily, though not of course solely, 'in private hands.' Where the financing of production is concerned, on the other hand, we have been more ambivalent. For the past 160 years, our financial system has operated as a public-private franchise arrangement. At the core of our franchise lie the sovereign public (the 'public' of our 'republic') and its money-modulator - the issuer and manager of its monetized full faith and credit, its 'money' - on the one hand, and the private sector financial institutions and markets we publicly license to allocate most of the resultant Wicksellian 'bank money' or 'credit-money' on the other hand. At the periphery of the franchise lie those institutions and markets that 'shadow bank' through relations with the banking core.In recent years, developments in several distinct spaces have prompted what amounts to a broad reassessment of our hybrid financial arrangements. One such development is weariness with our system's penchant for over-generating public credit that fuels bubbles and busts rather than production, a product of leaving our public capital - by far the greater part of investment capital - to private management. This is what the author has long called poor credit modulation. Another ground of critique is our hybrid system's poor record on what the author has long called credit allocation, from which modulation turns out to be inseparable. Our morbid fear of explicitly, rather than implicitly, picking winners and losers is the culprit here. Finally, other sources of disenchantment are our system's long-term worsening of inequality, the scandal of commercial and financial exclusion our system permits, and the promise offered by new financial technologies where ending both that and leaky monetary policy are concerned. The current COVID pandemic and recent murder of George Floyd of course underscore these sources of disillusion.This article embraces these critiques, which the author himself has leveled continuously over the past fifteen years, argues that privately ordered production requires publicly ordered finance, and shows how to order finance publicly on a Fed balance sheet forthrightly recognized as a Citizens Ledger. New public investments will make up the asset side of the upgraded Fed balance sheet, while a corresponding system of digital public banking through FedWallets will upgrade the liability side of the same. Newly restored regional Fed functionalities ('Spreading the Fed'), an FSOC-inspired National Reconstruction and Development Council (NRDC) and its financing arm (a restored RFC), and a price-stabilizing 'People's Portfolio' round out the new system of Citizens' Finance. In the course of its arguments, the article traces all salient consequences that flow from its complete overhaul of our system of financing production, from banking through shadow banking to the capital markets. It also makes some surprising discoveries along the way. Among these is that full separation of Fed and Treasury and hence monetary and fiscal policy, itself an artifact of franchise finance and hence the false hope of separating credit modulation from credit allocation, is no longer tenable. Another is that global central bank digital currency (CBDC) development is now corroborating much of what the article argues.","output":"The Capital Commons: Digital Money and Citizens' Finance in a Productive Commercial Republic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Randomized vaccine trials are used to assess vaccine efficacy (VE) and to characterize the durability of vaccine\\\\induced protection.

We, therefore, compared SARS-CoV-2 with such known viruses that were prepared in the laboratory and other relevant natural strains to estimate their genetic relatedness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BLAST and clustalW were used to identify and align viral sequences of SARS-CoV-2 to other animal coronaviruses (human, bat, mouse, pangolin) and related artificial constructs. Phylogenetics trees were then prepared using iTOL. RESULTS: Our study supports the notion that known artificial coronaviruses, including the chimeric SL-SHC014-MA15 synthesized in 2015, differ too much from SARS-CoV-2 to hypothesize an artificial origin of the latter. On the contrary, our data support the natural origin of the COVID-19 virus, likely derived from bats, possibly transferred to pangolins, before spreading to man. CONCLUSIONS: Speculations about the artificial origin of SARS-CoV-2 are most likely unfounded. On the contrary, when carefully handled, engineered organisms provide a unique opportunity to study biological systems in a controlled fashion.

AIMS: The aim of this study was to describe the role of an occupational health service during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in an oncologic hospital and characterize the most likely sources of viral infection. METHODS: The information of all healthcare workers with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection from 11 March to 15 December 2020 was collected through an epidemiological survey conducted during contact tracing. The data extracted included gender, age, comorbidities, occupational group, source of infection, clinical presentation, duration of the disease, need for hospitalization and persistent or late symptoms after disease or upon returning to work. RESULTS: Out of a total of 2300 workers, 157 were infected, consisting of nurses (36%), nurse assistants (33%) and diagnostic and therapeutic professionals (10%). Physicians and administrative staff accounted for 8% each. The most frequently reported source of infection was occupational (43%), owing to worker-to-worker transmission (45%) and patient-to-worker transmission (36%). The most frequent moments of infection perceived corresponded to the removal of protective equipment during meals and moments of rest in the staff and changing rooms. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that occupational transmission from patients and colleagues might be an important source of SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers. Spread between colleagues accounted for 45% of the occupational source infections reported. Implementing physical distancing measures and limiting the number of people in changing and rest rooms could significantly reduce infection and related absenteeism.","output":"Occupational management of healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: New data collection in established longitudinal population studies provides an opportunity for studying the risk factors and sequelae of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), plus the indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on wellbeing. The Extended Cohort for E-health, Environment and DNA (EXCEED) cohort is a population-based cohort (N>11,000), recruited from 2013 in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland. EXCEED includes consent for electronic healthcare record (EHR) linkage, spirometry, genomic data, and questionnaire data. Methods: Between May 2020 and July 2021, a new questionnaire was deployed in EXCEED, which captured COVID-19 symptoms, general physical and mental health, plus socioeconomic and environmental factors during the pandemic. An online system was developed to invite new participants to join EXCEED, with informed consent being provided online. New and existing participants then completed the COVID-19 questionnaire online. A subset of the new questionnaire respondents were invited to participate in COVID-19 serology substudies, using home antibody testing kits. Results: In total, 3,693 participants provided COVID-19 infection status (median age 62.9 (IQR 54.7-69.2), 58.9% female). Trends of monthly incidence proportions of COVID-19 in EXCEED (self-report or symptom-predicted) approximated local and national figures. Regression analysis of 2,768 participants with linked EHR data showed no obvious monotonic relationship between number of chronic diseases (of 16 pre-specified diseases) and COVID-19 infection. There were 2,144 participants with valid results from a kit allowing differentiation between antibodies due to vaccination or infection. Of these, 8.5% had results consistent with previous COVID-19 infection, and 85.9% had evidence of COVID-19 vaccination, but without evidence of infection. Conclusions: Enriching EXCEED with a new COVID-19 questionnaire and serology data may improve understanding of the risk factors, clinical sequelae and broader impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population.

The SSN is consistently rated within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development among the highest countries for life expectancy and among the lowest in health-care spending as a proportion of gross domestic product. Italy appears to be in an envious position. However, a rapidly ageing population, increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, rising demand, and the COVID-19 pandemic have exposed weaknesses in the system. These weaknesses are linked to the often tumultuous history of the nation and the health-care system, in which innovation and initiative often lead to spiralling costs and difficulties, followed by austere cost-containment measures. We describe how the tenuous balance of centralised versus regional control has shifted over time to create not one, but 20 different health systems, exacerbating differences in access to care across regions. We explore how Italy can rise to the challenges ahead, providing recommendations for systemic change, with emphasis on data-driven planning, prevention, and research; integrated care and technology; and investments in personnel. The evolution of the SSN is characterised by an ongoing struggle to balance centralisation and decentralisation in a health-care system, a dilemma faced by many nations. If in times of emergency, planning, coordination, and control by the central government can guarantee uniformity of provider behaviour and access to care, during non-emergency times, we believe that a balance can be found provided that autonomy is paired with accountability in achieving certain objectives, and that the central government develops the skills and, therefore, the legitimacy, to formulate health policies of a national nature.

Main outcome measuresAdjusted odds ratios of Covid-19 vaccination status (received at least one dose/ intends to get vaccinated/ does not know whether to get vaccinated/refuses vaccination) were assessed using multinomial regressions to test associations with social and mistrust factors and to study how these two factors interacted with each other. ResultsIn all, 72.2% were vaccinated at the time of the survey. The population of unvaccinated people was younger, less educated, had lower incomes, and more often belonged to racialised minorities, as compared to vaccinated people. Mistrust of government and scientists to curb the spread of the epidemic were the factors most associated with refusing to be vaccinated: OR=8.86 (7.13 to 11.00) for the government and OR=9.07 (7.71 to 10.07) for scientists, compared to vaccinated people. Mistrust was more prevalent among the poorer which consequently reinforced social inequalities in vaccination. The 10% poorest who did not trust the government reached an OR of 16.2 (11.9 to 22) for refusing to be vaccinated compared to the 10% richest who did.

The prevailing hypothesis is that SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 interactions lead to an imbalance of the RAS, favoring proinflammatory angiotensin II (ANG II)-related signaling at the expense of the anti-inflammatory ANG-(1C7)-mediated alternative pathway. Indeed, multiple clinical trials targeting this pathway in COVID-19 are underway. Therefore, precise measurement of circulating RAS components is critical to understand the interplay of the RAS on COVID-19 outcomes. Multiple challenges exist in measuring the RAS in COVID-19, including improper patient controls, ex vivo degradation and low concentrations of angiotensins, and unvalidated laboratory assays. Here, we conducted a prospective pilot study to enroll 33 patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 and physiologically matched COVID-19-negative controls to quantify the circulating RAS. Our enrollment strategy led to physiological matching of COVID-19-negative and COVID-19-positive moderate hypoxic respiratory failure cohorts, in contrast to the severe COVID-19 cohort, which had increased severity of illness, prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and increased mortality.

Retrospective studies show promising results of deploying remote hospital care to reduce the number of days spent in the hospital, but the beneficial effect has yet to be established. Methods: We conducted a single centre, randomised trial from January to June 2021, including hospitalised COVID-19 patients who were in the recovery stage of the disease. Hospital care for the intervention group was transitioned to the patients home, including oxygen therapy, medication and remote monitoring. The control group received in-hospital care as usual. The primary endpoint was the number of hospital-free days during the 30 days following randomisation. Secondary endpoints included health care consumption during the follow-up period and mortality. Results: A total of 62 patients were randomised (31 control, 31 intervention). The mean difference in hospital-free days was 1.7 (26.7 control vs. 28.4 intervention, 95% CI of difference ?0.5 to 4.2, p = 0.112).

Persistent illness has been reported; however, its prevalence and characteristics are unclear. We aimed to determine illness duration and characteristics in symptomatic UK school-aged children tested for SARS-CoV-2 using data from the COVID Symptom Study, one of the largest UK citizen participatory epidemiological studies to date. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, data from UK school-aged children (age 5C17 years) were reported by an adult proxy. Participants were voluntary, and used a mobile application (app) launched jointly by Zoe Limited and King's College London. Illness duration and symptom prevalence, duration, and burden were analysed for children testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 for whom illness duration could be determined, and were assessed overall and for younger (age 5C11 years) and older (age 12C17 years) groups. Children with longer than 1 week between symptomatic reports on the app were excluded from analysis. Data from symptomatic children testing negative for SARS-CoV-2, matched 1:1 for age, gender, and week of testing, were also assessed. FINDINGS: 258 790 children aged 5C17 years were reported by an adult proxy between March 24, 2020, and Feb 22, 2021, of whom 75 529 had valid test results for SARS-CoV-2. 1734 children (588 younger and 1146 older children) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and calculable illness duration within the study timeframe (illness onset between Sept 1, 2020, and Jan 24, 2021). The most common symptoms were headache (1079 [622%] of 1734 children), and fatigue (954 [550%] of 1734 children). Median illness duration was 6 days (IQR 3C11) versus 3 days (2C7) in children testing negative, and was positively associated with age (Spearman's rank-order r(s) 019, p<00001). Median illness duration was longer for older children (7 days, IQR 3C12) than younger children (5 days, 2C9). 77 (44%) of 1734 children had illness duration of at least 28 days, more commonly in older than younger children (59 [51%] of 1146 older children vs 18 [31%] of 588 younger children; p=0046). The commonest symptoms experienced by these children during the first 4 weeks of illness were fatigue (65 [844%] of 77), headache (60 [779%] of 77), and anosmia (60 [779%] of 77); however, after day 28 the symptom burden was low (median 2 symptoms, IQR 1C4) compared with the first week of illness (median 6 symptoms, 4C8). Only 25 (18%) of 1379 children experienced symptoms for at least 56 days. Few children (15 children, 09%) in the negatively tested cohort had symptoms for at least 28 days; however, these children experienced greater symptom burden throughout their illness (9 symptoms, IQR 77C110 vs 8, 6C9) and after day 28 (5 symptoms, IQR 15C65 vs 2, 1C4) than did children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. INTERPRETATION: Although COVID-19 in children is usually of short duration with low symptom burden, some children with COVID-19 experience prolonged illness duration. Reassuringly, symptom burden in these children did not increase with time, and most recovered by day 56. Some children who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 also had persistent and burdensome illness. A holistic approach for all children with persistent illness during the pandemic is appropriate.

In this case report, we describe our first case of COVID-19 pneumonia that was complicated by cerebral venous thrombosis and bleeding in a patient with polycythemia vera. Madam A, a 72-year-old lady with polycythemia vera, ischemic stroke, hemorrhoids, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia was admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 pneumonia. She was treated with hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir as per hospital protocol. She continued taking hydroxyurea and aspirin for her treatment of polycythemia vera. Subsequently, she developed rectal bleeding when her platelet count was 1247  103/l, even though she was not on an anticoagulant. Her aspirin was withheld. One week later, she was readmitted to the hospital for cerebral venous thrombosis and her D-dimer was 2.02 g/ml. She was commenced on a therapeutic dose of low molecular weight heparin. Following that, her D-dimer level showed a decreasing trend and normalized upon her discharge. Patients with polycythemia vera are prone to develop thrombotic and bleeding complications. Management of this group of patients has become more complex with COVID-19 infection. It is crucial for us to decide when to start an anticoagulant especially when there is a history of recent bleeding. We need to balance the risks of further bleeding versus potentially fatal thrombotic events. Studies have shown that D-dimer can be used as a clinical marker to predict thrombotic events in COVID-19 infection. Patients with COVID-19 infection and polycythemia vera will benefit from both pharmacological thromboprophylaxis and close monitoring for bleeding.","output":"Thrombosis and Bleeding as Presentation of COVID-19 Infection with Polycythemia Vera.

This retrospective study investigated the utility of a box-shaped shielding device for reducing the risk of COVID-19 droplet infection during endoscopic procedures. METHODS: We created a cuboid box (500  650  450 mm) with four sides were covered with a transparent, vinyl-chloride sheet having two windows for endoscopic passage and assistance. The shielding box was then placed over a patients head and shoulders and covered with another transparent vinyl sheet. We assessed its utility and safety using the medical data concerning the procedure time and vital signs and a questionnaire for the endoscopic staff and patients. RESULTS: We performed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography-related procedures using this device for two patients suspected of having COVID-19-associated pneumonia. Both patients were smoothly and successfully treated without any complications. No difficulties were noted with either endoscopic operation or in assisting the procedure, and the transparency was good enough to observe the patients faces and movements. CONCLUSIONS: This box-shaped shielding device can be used to reduce the risk of COVID-19 droplet infection during endoscopic procedures in the clinical setting. RELEVANCE FOR PATIENTS: The COVID-19 outbreak has reminded healthcare personnel working in endoscopy units of the importance of infection prevention during endoscopy. The box-shaped shielding device can help endoscopic staff avoid hospital-setting COVID-19 infection.","output":"A box-shaped shielding device for reducing the risk of COVID-19 droplet infection during gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article presents the analysis and design of the intelligent agent model IA-ACR, which has the objective of monitoring movements, which are carried out in a coordinated and intelligent way in a robot, which will have the task of performing routines of physical exercises and dance, these routines will then be imitated by children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), in order to capture their attention so that therapies are more effective, which will be evaluated by the specialist (psychologist).

Although self-quarantine and social-distancing measures were implemented, restrictions were less severe compared to several other countries. The aim of this study was to assess changes in eating behavior and food purchases among a representative adult sample in the Netherlands (n = 1030), five weeks into lockdown. The results show that most participants did not change their eating behaviors (83.0%) or food purchases (73.3%). However, socio-demographic differences were observed among those that reported changes during lockdown. For example, participants with overweight (OR = 2.26, 95%CI = 1.24-4.11) and obesity (OR = 4.21, 95%CI = 2.13-8.32) were more likely to indicate to eat unhealthier during lockdown compared to participants with a healthy weight. Those with a high educational level (OR = 2.25, 95%-CI = 1.03-4.93) were also more likely to indicate to eat unhealthier during lockdown compared to those with a low educational level. Older participants were more likely to indicate to experience no differences in their eating behaviors compared to those of younger age, who were more likely to indicate that they ate healthier (OR = 1.03, 95%CI = 1.01-1.04) as well as unhealthier (OR = 1.04, 95%CI = 1.02-1.06) during lockdown.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a catastrophic event that has raised a number of psychological issues such as depression given abrupt social changes and lack of employment. Advancements of deep learning-based language models have been promising for sentiment analysis with data from social networks such as Twitter. Given the situation with COVID-19 pandemic, different countries had different peaks where the rise and fall of new cases affected lock-downs which directly affected the economy and employment. During the rise of COVID-19 cases with stricter lock-downs, people have been expressing their sentiments in social media. This can provide a deep understanding of human psychology during catastrophic events. In this paper, we present a framework that employs deep learning-based language models via long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks for sentiment analysis during the rise of novel COVID-19 cases in India. The framework features LSTM language model with a global vector embedding and state-of-art BERT language model. We review the sentiments expressed for selective months in 2020 which covers the first major peak of novel cases in India. Our framework utilises multi-label sentiment classification where more than one sentiment can be expressed at once. Our results indicate that the majority of the tweets have been positive with high levels of optimism during the rise of the novel COVID-19 cases and the number of tweets significantly lowered towards the peak. The predictions generally indicate that although the majority have been optimistic, a significant group of population has been annoyed towards the way the pandemic was handled by the authorities.","output":"COVID-19 sentiment analysis via deep learning during the rise of novel cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Existing research investigating gay mens eating behavior has focused on stereotypes and body image, rather than to understand why disordered eating is prevalent in gay men. The current study adopted a qualitative approach and employed interview methodology to explore gay mens attitudes, feelings and experiences of their eating behavior, and the potential link to mindfulness and self-compassion. Twenty gay men aged from 21 to 51 years were interviewed using an interview schedule with open-ended questions. Three main themes emerged from the transcript data sets: Lean to be Seen, Sod it Ill Have a Pizza, and You Cant Sit with Us. The first theme was developed following responses that participants eating behavior and exercise engagement were influenced by their perceived attractiveness by the gay community. All participants spoke of achieving or maintaining a slim or muscular body type and adopted their eating behavior or exercise regime to reach corresponding goals. The second theme relates to the lack of acceptance felt from the gay community upon not conforming to the bodily expectations set out by the community. The third theme relates to the conflicts in participants attitudes around how exercising and eating healthily would improve their mental well-being; but that they also would give preference to calorie dense foods to reduce stress. These reflections are observed through a context of self-kindness and self-compassion and are seen to be related to increased feelings of self-criticism and body dissatisfaction.

They were divided into 2 groups based on the use (C group) and nonuse (NC group) of CBCT guidance. The technical success of RFA and local tumor progression after the first RFA session were evaluated by dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging methods. Between-group differences were assessed retrospectively. RESULTS We enrolled 198 patients with 260 HCC nodules. The complete ablation rates were 63.0 and 89.4% in the NC and C groups, respectively. In log-rank testing, local tumor progression occurred significantly more often in the NC group when RFA was used without TACE, in males when des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin was 29 mAU/mL, and when the diameter of a nodule was 18 mm. On Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis, the NC group, RFA alone without TACE, and male gender were significant independent variables. CONCLUSION TACE followed by RFA under CBCT and ultrasound guidance improves the reliability of ablation of target HCC nodules, reduces the need for additional treatment sessions, and prevents local tumor progression.","output":"C-Arm Cone Beam Computed Tomography Guidance for Radiofrequency Ablation in Hepatocellular Carcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS This study aimed to identify determinants of work readiness and to assess the influences of work readiness on work-related outcomes in graduate nurses. BACKGROUND Higher work readiness facilitates smoother role transitions of new graduate nurses. However, determinants of work readiness had not been fully examined. In addition, the relationships between work readiness and work-related outcomes, such as coping self-efficacy and occupational commitment, are also crucial but had not been assessed. METHODS We recruited 794 graduate nurses and assessed their work readiness before working as nurses. After they commenced their work, we assessed their occupational commitment, coping self-efficacy, and intention to remain. All assessments were conducted online. RESULTS There were 728 (92%) female respondents. The mean scores and standard deviation (SD) of work readiness, coping self-efficacy, occupational commitment, and intention to remain were 261.51 (SD: 45.40), 30.30 (SD: 6.13), 81.65 (SD: 11.56), and 11.01 (SD: 2.36), respectively. Based on a regression analysis, determinants of work readiness were positive school climate, student leadership experience, nursing as the primary choice of discipline, and perceived influences of COVID-19 on the honorability of being a nurse and the willingness to be a nurse (p < 0.001). Moreover, after adjusted by all demographics and characteristics variables, higher work readiness would result in higher coping self-efficacy (estimated coefficient = 0.06, p < 0.001), occupational commitment (estimated coefficient = 0.06, p < 0.001), and intention to remain (estimated coefficient = 0.01, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION Work readiness is a composite concept affected by psychosocial and environmental factors, which can predict new graduate nurses' future self-efficacy, occupational commitment, and intention to remain. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT The management of new graduate nurses when they begin to work could target their work readiness. Transition programs that consider our identified determinants can be provided to those who show lower work readiness.","output":"Work Readiness: Its Determinants and Association with Work-related Outcomes among New Graduate Nurses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has surely demonstrated that the capacity of EDs to handle surges of patients is a concern for all members of the healthcare community: the multifactorial causes of frequent use, most of which are outside the realm of the ED, need to be concertedly addressed by those who are in the best position to do so [ ]we call on Journals in all fields, and particularly those few general medical Journals remaining, to look beyond the keywords (and the myths) to recognise when the implications of a study suggest that the proper audience is their own readership Analysis of costs, length of stay, and utilization of emergency department services by frequent users: implications for health policy Frequent attenders to an emergency department: a study of primary health care use, medical profile, and psychosocial characteristics","output":"Are we preaching to the choir?

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS This was a retrospective cohort study of 1392 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a tertiary teaching hospital. Clinical characteristics and laboratory data were extracted from electronic hospitalization and laboratory databases. AKI was defined and staged according to the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Risk factors for AKI and the association of AKI with in-hospital mortality were assessed. RESULTS A total of 7% (99 of 1392) of patients developed AKI during hospitalization, 40% (40 of 99) of which occurred within 1 week of admission. Factors associated with a higher risk of AKI include severe disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37 to 3.67), higher baseline serum creatinine (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.17 to 4.11), lymphopenia (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.12 to 3.53), and elevated D-dimer level (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.07 to 6.70).

The consequences of antibiotic overuse as it relates to antimicrobial resistance and development of secondary infections remains uncertain. The objective of this study is to compare antibiotic prescription patterns in patients with a history of COVID-19 to those without a history of COVID-19 and determine if there are differences in the frequency of secondary infections from Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile), multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, and candida infections. METHODS: This study is a single-center, retrospective cohort study of 18,757 adults hospitalized during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021. Patients were stratified as COVID-19 positive, throughout all hospitalizations subsequent to the date of initial positivity, or COVID-19 negative. Differences in antibiotic practice patterns between the two groups were quantified using days of therapy per 1000 patient days (DOT/1000 PD). The frequency of C. difficile infection, MDR-bacteria, and candida infections were assessed among the two groups. RESULTS: During the 12-month study period, on average, the COVID-19 positive group received 21.81% more antibiotics than COVID-19 negative patients, with up to 56.15% increase seen in the first month of the pandemic (Table 1, Figure 1) The COVID-19 positive group had an increased frequency of Candidemia (0.73% versus 0.18%, p< .00001) and decreased isolation of ESBL organisms (1.17% versus 1.87%, p< 0.01416) compared to the COVID-19 negative group. There were no significant differences in frequency of C. difficile infection, isolation of other MDR-organisms, or Candida auris between the two groups. (Table 2) Table 1.

Frequency of secondary infections in COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Patients with a history of COVID-19 infection received an average of 21.81% more antibiotics, have higher rates of candidemia, but lower rates of ESBL infection than those without a history of COVID-19 infection. The potential increase in antibiotic exposure could account for the increase in candidemia in patients with a history of COVID-19. Future studies include investigating the decrease in ESBL infections seen, perhaps due to receipt of broad antibiotics in COVID-19 patients that target ESBL bacteria. DISCLOSURES: Shruti K.

The results showed that lifetime prevalence of NSSI among students was 6.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.7 to 6.9) at the first assessment. Scratching and hair pulling were the most and least common methods of self-injury, respectively. Over the one year, 206 students (3.6% CI 95%: 3.1-4.1) reported the onset of NSSI. Tobacco smoking and previous year average grade were related to the incidence of NSSI.

From asymptomatic to symptomatic, the virus causes a wide spectrum of presentations. COVID-19 patients may present with oral manifestations. In Afghanistan, where COVID-19 has severely strained the health care system, much of the population lacks proper oral hygiene. This makes the oral cavity a perfect site for SARS-CoV-2 to manifest clinical signs. CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old male was evaluated in the Dentistry Teaching Clinic of Kabul University of Medical Sciences for a painful erosive lesion on dorsal surface of his tongue. He also complained of fever, cough, and taste alteration. He was referred to Afghan Japan Hospital for COVID-19 testing and tested positive. He was followed on for the treatment of SARS-CoV2. After 2 weeks, the patient tested negative and returned to the dentistry clinic for follow-up. Although there were no other signs of COVID-19, the painful erosive lesion on his tongue persisted. Oral evaluation were performed and the patient was advised to practice good hygiene. After 10 days, we observed an asymptomatic geographic tongue without fever and myalgias and the lesion of dorsal surface of tongue improved from severe condition to moderate.

Clinical status improved within 24 hours in 11 (39%) patients, within one week in 23 (82%) patients, and within two weeks in 25 (89%); one (4%) patient showed no change and two (7%) patients died. Sixteen patients (57%) no longer needed oxygen therapy within a week (p < 0.001). The serum concentrations of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and fibrinogen decreased significantly (p  0.001). Lung changes improved in 21 (84%) patients within two weeks of treatment; 19 had minimal or no changes upon final examination. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab can control the symptoms of severe COVID-19 by reducing the inflammatory response and rapidly improves the clinical status in most patients.","output":"Tocilizumab for patients with severe COVID-19: a retrospective, multi-center study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionMost patients with early-onset neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) were advised to shield during the pandemic due to assumptions that treatments e.g. corticosteroids, or complications e.g. pre-existing respiratory failure would increase COVID-19 risk. It remains poorly understood how those with NMDs and their families approached and responded to risk mitigating strategies e.g. shielding. We aimed to determine themes describing the psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to reduce risk in this population.MethodsIn-depth questionnaires specifically designed to meet research aims were completed by telephone between September 17th and December 31st 2020 by patients with NMDs or their parent. Inductive thematic analysis was performed to first code transcriptions of audio recordings of questionnaires then develop candidate themes by exploring coded data. Candidate themes were evaluated against the original data set before defining final themes: participant validation was sought to provide additional confirmation of accuracy.Results40 questionnaires were completed: patients were 70% male, aged 2 to 48 years with NMDs e.g. muscular dystrophies, spinal muscular atrophy. 80% required long-term non-invasive or tracheostomy ventilation. Three themes were identified: 1) concern regarding the health impact of COVID-19;2) perceptions of strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission;3) psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety, fear and worry were the most frequently reported emotions, particularly in relation to health risk of COVID-19, but level and pervasiveness fluctuated during the pandemic. Strict adherence to shielding was reported at the start of the pandemic but was often relaxed due to 1) official guidance, 2) emerging evidence of less severe outcomes in children and NMD cohorts, and 3) unsustainability of limited social contact including cessation or reduction in personal care. Concern about hospital attendance during the pandemic, and anxiety regarding perceived lack of access to Intensive Care were common.ConclusionsMeasures to reduce transmission of COVID-19 have disproportionally affected patients with NMDs and their families. For most, negative psychosocial impacts have and will continue to improve, particularly due to the success of the vaccination programme. These aspects should be considered when advising patients and families on risk and risk-mitigating strategies during the current and future pandemics.","output":"Psychosocial themes of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and shielding in adults and children with early-onset neuromuscular disorders and their families"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with cardiovascular complications and coagulation disorders. OBJECTIVES: To explore the coagulopathy and endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The study analyzed clinical and biological profiles of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection at admission, including hemostasis tests and quantification of circulating endothelial cells (CECs). RESULTS: Among 96 consecutive COVID-19-suspected patients fulfilling criteria for hospitalization, 66 were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19-positive patients were more likely to present with fever (P = .02), cough (P = .03), and pneumonia at computed tomography (CT) scan (P = .002) at admission. Prevalence of D-dimer >500 ng/mL was higher in COVID-19-positive patients (74.2% versus 43.3%; P = .007). No sign of disseminated intravascular coagulation were identified. Adding D-dimers >500 ng/mL to gender and pneumonia at CT scan in receiver operating characteristic curve analysis significantly increased area under the curve for COVID-19 diagnosis. COVID-19-positive patients had significantly more CECs at admission (P = .008) than COVID-19-negative ones. COVID-19-positive patients treated with curative anticoagulant prior to admission had fewer CECs (P = .02) than those without. Interestingly, patients treated with curative anticoagulation and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers had even fewer CECs (P = .007).

Interestingly, lower incidence and mortality rates have been observed in women from Africa compared to their cohorts from other continents. Also, in the US non-Hispanic Black females have lower COVID-19 and death rates compared to their white counterparts. Its unclear why this significant difference exists; however, the ovarian function, genetics and immunological statuses could play a major role. Women of African descent have elevated levels of estrogen compared with Caucasians hence we anticipate that estrogen might offer some protection against the SARS-CoV-2 infections. The racial differences in lifestyle, age and inaccessibility to contraceptive usage might also play a role. Here, we provide insight on how the high levels of estrogen in African women might contribute to the lower cases and fatalities in Africa. Specifically, estrogen might offer protection against COVID-19 by suppressing hyper-production of cytokines, promoting anti-inflammatory cytokines, stimulating antibody production and suppressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.

Chatbots, powered by artificial intelligence, can automatically interact with individuals through natural conversation. They may be more engaging than one-way messaging interventions. To our knowledge, physical activity chatbots have not been developed with low-income participants, nor in Spanishthe second most dominant language in the U.S. We recommend best practices for physical activity chatbots in English and Spanish for low-income women. Methods: We designed a prototype physical activity text-message based conversational agent based on various psychotherapeutic techniques. We recruited participants through SNAP-Ed (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education) in California (Alameda County) and Tennessee (Shelby County). We conducted qualitative interviews with participants during testing of our prototype chatbot, held a Wizard of Oz study, and facilitated a co-design workshop in Spanish with a subset of our participants. Results: We included 10 Spanish- and 8 English-speaking women between 27 and 41 years old. The majority was Hispanic/Latina (n = 14), 2 were White and 2 were Black/African American. More than half were monolingual Spanish speakers, and the majority was born outside the US (>50% in Mexico). Most participants were unfamiliar with chatbots and were initially skeptical. After testing our prototype, most users felt positively about health chatbots. They desired a personalized chatbot that addresses their concerns about privacy, and stressed the need for a comprehensive system to also aid with nutrition, health information, stress, and involve family members. Differences between English and monolingual Spanish speakers were found mostly in exercise app use, digital literacy, and the wish for family inclusion. Conclusion: Low-income Spanish- and English-speaking women are interested in using chatbots to improve their physical activity and other health related aspects. Researchers developing health chatbots for this population should focus on issues of digital literacy, app familiarity, linguistic and cultural issues, privacy concerns, and personalization. Designing and testing this intervention for and with this group using co-creation techniques and involving community partners will increase the probability that it will ultimately be effective.","output":"Conversational Physical Activity Coaches for Spanish and English Speaking Women: A User Design Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on the overall well\\\\being of consumers is disastrous.

The thyroid gland and the virus infection with its associated inflammatory-immune responses are known to be engaged in complex interplay. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 combined with the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) as the key molecular complex to infect the host cells. Interestingly, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels are high in the thyroid gland and more than in the lungs. Our literature search provided greater evidence that the thyroid gland and the entire hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis could be relevant targets of damage by SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, COVID-19-related thyroid disorders include thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism, as well as nonthyroidal illness syndrome.

Since a similar nsp1 coding region appears in all characterized groups 1 and 2 coronavirus DI RNAs and must be translated in cis for BCoV DI RNA replication, we hypothesized that nsp1 might regulate ORF 1 expression by binding this intra-nsp1 cistronic element. Here, we (i) establish by mutation analysis that the 72-nt intracistronic SLV immediately upstream of SLVI is also a DI RNA cis-replication signal, (ii) show by gel shift and UV-cross-linking analyses that cellular proteins of approximately 60 and 100 kDa, but not viral proteins, bind SLV and SLVI, (SLV-VI) and (iii) demonstrate by gel shift analysis that nsp1 purified from Escherichia coli does not bind SLV-VI but does bind three 5' untranslated region (UTR)- and one 3' UTR-located cis-replication SLs. Notably, nsp1 specifically binds SLIII and its flanking sequences in the 5' UTR with approximately 2.5 muM affinity. Additionally, under conditions enabling expression of nsp1 from DI RNA-encoded subgenomic mRNA, DI RNA levels were greatly reduced, but there was only a slight transient reduction in viral RNA levels.

Leader-to-body joining has been proposed to occur during minus-strand RNA synthesis and to involve transfer of the nascent RNA strand from one site in the template to another. This discontinuous step in subgenomic RNA synthesis is guided by short transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) that are present at both these template sites (leader TRS and body TRS). Sense-antisense base pairing between the leader TRS in the plus strand and the body TRS complement in the minus strand is crucial for strand transfer. Here we show that extending the leader TRS-body TRS duplex beyond its wild-type length dramatically enhanced the subgenomic mRNA synthesis of the arterivirus Equine arteritis virus (EAV). Generally, the relative amount of a subgenomic mRNA correlated with the calculated stability of the corresponding leader TRS-body TRS duplex. In addition, various leader TRS mutations induced the generation of minor subgenomic RNA species that were not detected upon infection with wild-type EAV. The synthesis of these RNA species involved leader-body junction events at sites that bear only limited resemblance to the canonical TRS. However, with the mutant leader TRS, but not with the wild-type leader TRS, these sequences could form a duplex that was stable enough to direct subgenomic RNA synthesis, again demonstrating that the stability of the leader TRS-body TRS duplex is a crucial factor in arterivirus subgenomic mRNA synthesis.","output":"The stability of the duplex between sense and antisense transcription-regulating sequences is a crucial factor in arterivirus subgenomic mRNA synthesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionOne of the noted features of COVID-19 is the spectrum of expressivity in symptoms among those with the disease, ranging from no or mild symptoms that may last a small number of days, to severe and/or longer lasting symptoms.

This paper describes the next iteration of the prototype. Processes included concept ideation and brainstorming activities, iterative prototyping, and playtesting/input/feedback sessions with key stakeholders (PLWD/MCI, exercise professionals, engineers, VR game designers, content developers). RESULTS The multidisciplinary and collaborative design process occurred over 15 months (overlapping with COVID-19 pandemic) with 7 PLWD/MCI (6 females; M=81.3 years) and 9 exercise professionals (7 females; M=38.1 years) to date. The game was designed to target movements identified by exercise professionals and researchers (aerobic exercises, range of motion, seated-balance, quick response to stimuli) and is structured in three exercise stages (warm-up, conditioning, cool-down). To ensure safety of participants while using VR headsets, only seated upper-limb exercises were targeted.

The authors conducted a retrospective review of the medical records of COVID-positive inpatients at Valleywise Health Medical Center, Arizona, USA from March to June 2020. The authors examined a cohort of COVID-positive inpatients admitted early in the pandemic to assess the ways in which the virus and infection prevention and control (IPC) measures affected patients at a large psychiatric hospital. Data was gathered for demographics, psychiatric diagnoses, COVID-19 symptoms, medical co-morbidities, and length of stay. Initial and revised hospital policies and procedures, and emergent challenges in managing this highly contagious disease in the inpatient psychiatric setting, were examined by review of relevant documents and direct observation by board certified psychiatrists who provided direct care. Significant challenges were encountered in balancing the need for a therapeutic milieu and compliance with IPC measures. During the study period, 39 patients and 15 staff members became COVID-positive. Within the covid staff, all but one had provided direct care to COVID-positive patients. Overall, behavioral health facilities were largely successful in identifying and quarantining COVID-positive patients. The hospitals IPC policies/procedures were constantly updated to meet new guidelines and knowledge about the virus, which may have lowered transmission rates and mitigated potential complications. While basic quality and safety of providing psychiatric care were preserved, individual and group therapies formats and provision of a therapeutic milieu were altered and may have adversely affected patient care and/or contributed to doubling the length of stay.","output":"Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Implementation of Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) Measures on Inpatient Psychiatric Units"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Toothbrushing and interdental cleaning are critical to maintaining good oral health. Literature is beginning to suggest that these behaviours may be conducted automatically, although the instigation (deciding to do) and execution ('doing') of these behaviours has never been examined separately. The objective of this study was to test a theoretically informed supposition that oral hygiene behaviours in adults are automatic behaviours. METHODS One hundred and fifty participants attending three types of dental providers covering emergency and routine dental services, completed a questionnaire. The self-reported behavioural automaticity index scale (SRBAI) was used to measure behavioural automaticity. RESULTS Morning toothbrushing SRBAI scores were higher than evening scores (Z=-3.315, p = 0.001). Automaticity scores for instigating both toothbrushing and interdental cleaning were also higher compared to execution (toothbrushing: Z=-2.601, p = 0.009 and interdental cleaning: Z=-2.256. p = 0.024). Toothbrushing automaticity scores were associated with age, gender and self-efficacy, whereas interdental cleaning automaticity scores were associated with intention. Individuals in lower socio-economic status (SES) occupations had significantly higher automaticity scores for interdental cleaning compared to those with higher SES roles.

A more comprehensive understanding of the global iAb prevalence could help reduce avertible morbidity and mortality among children and adolescents and contribute to the understanding in the observed differences in the incidence, prevalence and health outcomes of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes across and within countries. We present the first scoping review that provides a global synthesis of the prevalence of iAb in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Research Design and Methods: We searched Ovid MEDLINE? with Daily Update, Embase (Elsevier, embase.com) and PubMed (National Library of Medicine -NCBI), for studies pertaining to prevalence in children and adolescents (0-19) with type 1 diabetes published between 1 Jan 1990 and 18 June 2021. Results were synthesized using Covidence systematic review software and meta-analysis was completed using R v361. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts with a third reviewer resolving conflicts (k= 092). Results: The review revealed 125 studies from 48 different countries, with 92 from high-income countries. Globally, in new-onset type 1 diabetes, IA-2A was the most prevalent iAb 0714 [95% CI (071, 072)], followed by ICA 0681 [95% CI (067, 069)], ZnT8A was 0654 [95% CI (064, 066)], GADA 0636 [95% CI (063, 066)] and then IAA 0424 [95% CI (042, 043)], with substantial variation across world regions. The weighted mean prevalence of IA-2A was more variable, highest in Europe at 0749 [95% CI (074, 076)] followed by Northern America 0662 [95% CI (064, 069)], Latin America and the Caribbean 0632 [95% CI (054, 072)], Oceania 0603 [95% CI (054, 067)], Asia 0466 [95% CI (044, 050)] and Africa 0311 [95% CI (023, 040)]. In established cases of type 1 diabetes, GADA was the most prevalent iAb 0407 [95% CI (039, 042)] followed by ZnT8A 0322 [95% CI (029, 036)], IA-2A 0302 [95% CI (029, 032)], IAA 0258 [95% CI (024, 026)] and ICA 0145 [95% CI (013, 016)], again with substantial variation across world regions. Conclusion: Understanding the global prevalence of iAb in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes could help with earlier identification of those at-risk of developing type 1 diabetes and inform clinical practice, health policies, resource allocation, and targeted healthcare interventions to better screen, diagnose and manage children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.","output":"The Prevalence of Islet Autoantibodies in Children and Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: A Global Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Although the prognosis is good in the vast majority of patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19, there are cases in which Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure occur rapidly and result in death in a short time.

Abstract Lower respiratory tract infections remain one of the most common causes of mortality worldwide, which is why early diagnosis is crucial. Traditionally the microbiological diagnosis of these infections has been based on conventional methods including culture on artificial media for isolation of bacteria and fungi and cell cultures for virus and antibody or antigen detection using antigen-antibody reactions. The main drawback of the above mentioned methods is the time needed for an etiological diagnosis of the infection. The techniques based on molecular biology have drawn much attention in recent decades as tools for rapid diagnosis of infections. Some techniques are very expensive, especially those that can detect various microorganisms in the same reaction, therefore the question that arises is whether the cost of such testing is justified by the information obtained and by the clinical impact that its implementation will determine. In this article we make a review of the various techniques of molecular biology applied to the diagnosis of pneumonia and focus primarily on analysing the impact they may have on the management of patients with acute respiratory tract infections.","output":"Mtodos moleculares de diagnstico de infecciones respiratorias. ?Ha cambiado el esquema diagnstico?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: e-learning was underutilized in the past especially in developing countries.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the university medical staff perceptions, evaluate their experiences, recognize their barriers, challenges of e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, and investigate factors influencing the acceptance and use of e-learning as a tool teaching within higher education. METHODS: Data was collected using an electronic questionnaire with a validated Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) for exploring factors that affect the acceptance and use of e-learning as a teaching tool among medical staff members, Zagazig University, Egypt. RESULTS: The majority (88%) of the staff members agreed that the technological skills of giving the online courses increase the educational value of the experience of the college staff. The rate of participant agreement on perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and acceptance of e-learning was (77.1%, 76.5%, and 80.9% respectively). The highest barriers to e-learning were insufficient/ unstable internet connectivity (40%), inadequate computer labs (36%), lack of computers/ laptops (32%), and technical problems (32%). Younger age, teaching experience less than 10 years, and being a male are the most important indicators affecting e-learning acceptance.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to use the Quadruple Aim Framework to integrate published knowledge of surgical outpatient eConsults with regard to efficacy, safety, limitations, and evolving use in the era of COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically searched for relevant studies across four databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science) on November 4, 2021, with the following inclusion criteria: English language, published in the past 10 years, and data on the outcomes of outpatient surgical eConsults. RESULTS: A total of 363 studies were screened for eligibility, of which 33 (9.1%) were included. Most of the included studies were from the United States (23/33, 70%) and Canada (7/33, 21%), with a predominant multidisciplinary focus (9/33, 27%).

However, the efficacy and safety of HCQ and/or AZM have been questioned by recent clinical reports. Direct effects of these drugs on the human heart remain very poorly defined. To better understand the mechanisms of action of HCQ +/- AZM, we employed bioengineered human ventricular cardiac tissue strip (hvCTS) and anisotropic sheet (hvCAS) assays, made with human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes (hvCMs), which have been designed for measuring cardiac contractility and electrophysiology, respectively. Our hvCTS experiments showed that AZM induced a dose-dependent negative inotropic effect which could be aggravated by HCQ; electrophysiologically, as revealed by the hvCAS platform, AZM prolonged action potentials and induced spiral wave formations. Collectively, our data were consistent with reported clinical risks of HCQ and AZM on QTc prolongation/ventricular arrhythmias and development of heart failure. In conclusion, our study exposed the risks of HCQ/AZM administration while providing mechanistic insights for their toxicity.

Rapid antigen tests (RATs) are considered an important addition to molecular tests in diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), mainly because of their fast turnaround time, easier analytical procedure and lower price. However, real-life studies on the usefulness of such testing for screening of HCWs are limited. METHODS: Physicians, nurses and hospital attendants currently working at the University Clinic of Respiratory and Allergic Diseases Golnik were invited to participate in the pilot study. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained three times per week for two consecutive weeks and tested with a point-of-care RAT and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Serum samples were obtained at the beginning of the study and 2 weeks after the last swab was collected to evaluate the serological status. RESULTS: A total of 191 nasopharyngeal swabs from 36 HCWs were obtained. None of the samples tested was positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigen, whereas two HCWs tested positive on RT-PCR. Of these, one HCW had a newly identified SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas RT-PCR probably detected a previous but recent infection in the other HCW. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this pilot study, it is unlikely that RAT will reliably detect novel SARS-CoV-2 infections among asymptomatic HCWs despite serial sampling.

Members of the archaeal family Methanoperedenaceae (formerly ANME-2d) have been demonstrated to couple AOM to the reduction of nitrate, iron, and manganese. Here, comparative genomic analysis of 16 Methanoperedenaceae metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), recovered from diverse environments, revealed novel respiratory strategies acquired through lateral gene transfer (LGT) events from diverse archaea and bacteria. Comprehensive phylogenetic analyses suggests that LGT has allowed members of the Methanoperedenaceae to acquire genes for the oxidation of hydrogen and formate and the reduction of arsenate, selenate, and elemental sulfur. Numerous membrane-bound multiheme c-type cytochrome complexes also appear to have been laterally acquired, which may be involved in the direct transfer of electrons to metal oxides, humic substances, and syntrophic partners.IMPORTANCE AOM by microorganisms limits the atmospheric release of the potent greenhouse gas methane and has consequent importance for the global carbon cycle and climate change modeling.

The survey tool was prepared in Google form and distributed to the health professionals through their emails and social media pages. Data were analyzed using STATA version 14. A descriptive result was reported using frequency tables and bar charts. Factors associated with correct use of facemask were assessed using binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 368 health professionals have participated in this study. All of the participants work involves direct contact with patients and 98 (26.6%) of them work in direct contact with COVID-19 patients daily. The level of overall correct use of facemask was 10.1% (95% CI: 7.4C13.6). Two hundred fifty-five (69.3%) do not perform hand hygiene before wearing a facemask and 238 (64.7%) do not perform hand hygiene after removing the facemask. Three hundred twenty-three (87.8%) of the study participants reuse disposable facemasks. The odds of practicing correct use of facemask were more than two times higher among health professionals who received training related to personal protective equipment utilization (AOR= 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1C4.5) compared to their counterparts. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that health professionals practice regarding the correct use of facemask in the context of COVID-19 prevention is very low. Receiving training related to proper utilization of personal protective equipment was found to favor the correct use of facemask. In this regard, health authorities should provide training to enable the rational and correct use of facemask among healthcare workers.","output":"Correct Use of Facemask Among Health Professionals in the Context of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: School closures as part of broader social lockdown measures during the COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with the health and well-being of children and adolescents. OBJECTIVE: To review published reports on the association of school closures during broader social lockdown with mental health, health behaviors, and well-being in children and adolescents aged 0 to 19 years, excluding associations with transmission of infection. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Eleven databases were searched from inception to September 2020, and machine learning was applied for screening articles. A total of 16a?817 records were screened, 151 were reviewed in full text, and 36 studies were included. Quality assessment was tailored to study type. A narrative synthesis of results was undertaken because data did not allow meta-analysis. FINDINGS: A total of 36 studies from 11 countries were identified, involving a total of 79a?781 children and adolescents and 18a?028 parents, which occurred during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (February to July 2020). All evaluated school closure as part of broader social lockdown during the first COVID-19 wave, and the duration of school closure ranged from 1 week to 3 months. Of those, 9 (25%) were longitudinal pre-post studies, 5 (14%) were cohort, 21 (58%) were cross-sectional, and 1 (3%) was a modeling study. Thirteen studies (36%) were high quality, 17 (47%) were medium quality, and 6 (17%) were low quality. Twenty-three studies (64%) were published, 8 (22%) were online reports, and 5 (14%) were preprints. Twenty-five studies (69%) concerning mental health identified associations across emotional, behavioral, and restlessness/inattention problems; 18% to 60% of children and adolescents scored above risk thresholds for distress, particularly anxiety and depressive symptoms, and 2 studies reported no significant association with suicide. Three studies reported that child protection referrals were lower than expected number of referrals originating in schools. Three studies suggested higher screen time usage, 2 studies reported greater social media use, and 6 studies reported lower physical activity. Studies on sleep (10 studies) and diet (5 studies) provided inconclusive evidence on harms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this narrative synthesis of reports from the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, studies of short-term school closures as part of social lockdown measures reported adverse mental health symptoms and health behaviors among children and adolescents. Associations between school closure and health outcomes and behaviors could not be separated from broader lockdown measures.","output":"School Closures During Social Lockdown and Mental Health, Health Behaviors, and Well-being Among Children and Adolescents During the First COVID-19 Wave: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The arts and creative industries are among those most affected by government measures to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.

Recent reports suggest that more than 7 months after recovering from COVID-19, a large proportion of these individuals still have olfactory dysfunction of some form. To establish the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction 18 months and beyond, we tested 100 individuals with established COVID-19 in the first wave of the pandemic using psychophysical full-scale testing of smell and taste functions as well as assessments of parosmia. Participants were recruited from an ongoing study, comprising healthcare workers at a hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, that are regularly tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies since the start of the pandemic in Sweden. To assess potential skewed recruitment of individuals with prior olfactory dysfunction and assess normal rate of dysfunctions in the used population, 44 SARS-CoV-2 IgG naive individuals were also tested as a control group. One and a half year after COVID-19, more than one third of individuals recovered from COVID-19 demonstrated a clinical reduction in their sense of smell. Critically, nearly half of COVID-19-recovered individuals complaint about parosmia. Prevalence of gustatory dysfunction was, however, low (3%).

RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the effect of portable HEPA filtering on aerosol concentration during exercise testing and its efficiency in reducing room clearance time in a clinical exercise testing laboratory? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects were six healthy volunteers aged 20 to 56 years. In the first experiment, exercise was performed in a small tent with controlled airflow with the use of a stationary cycle, portable HEPA filter with fume hood, and particle counter to document aerosol concentration. Subjects performed a four-stage maximal exercise test that lasted 12 minutes plus 5 minutes of pretest quiet breathing and 3 minutes of active recovery. First, they exercised without mitigation then with portable HEPA filter running. In a separate experiment, room aerosol clearance time was measured in a clinical exercise testing laboratory by filling it with artificially generated aerosols and measuring time to 99.9% aerosol clearance with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) only or HVAC plus portable HEPA filter running. RESULTS: In the exercise experiment, particle concentrations reached 1,722  1,484/L vs 96  124/L (P < .04) for all particles (>0.3 m), 1,339  1,281/L vs 76  104/L (P < .05) for smaller particles (0.3 to 1.0 m), and 333  209/L vs 17  19/L (P < .01) for larger particles (1.0 to 5.0 m) at the end of the protocol in a comparison of mitigation vs portable HEPA filter. Use of a portable HEPA filter in a clinical exercise laboratory clearance experiment reduced aerosol clearance time 47% vs HVAC alone. INTERPRETATION: The portable HEPA filter reduced the concentration of aerosols generated during exercise testing by 96%  2% for all particle sizes and reduced aerosol room clearance time in clinical exercise testing laboratories. Portable HEPA filters therefore might be useful in clinical exercise testing laboratories to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.","output":"Mitigation of Aerosols Generated During Exercise Testing With a Portable High-Efficiency Particulate Air Filter With Fume Hood"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study examines the websites of central government ministries, prefectures and municipalities to obtain a comprehensive birds-eye view of how they are preparing for natural disasters in the context of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the websites of central government ministries, prefectures and municipalities in Japan to survey the actual status of information dissemination on evacuation and sheltering in the context of COVID-19. Findings: This study found that the central government issued many notices, notifications and administrative communications to prefectures, cities with public health centers and special wards, which were mainly related to opening, securing and operating evacuation centers and improving the environment. It was found that most prefectures disseminated information on both survival and living evacuation and did so from June onward, when the flood season was approaching. Among the municipalities, there were differences in information dissemination tendencies by prefecture, and it became clear that smaller municipalities were especially incapable of fully disseminating information via the Web. Research limitations/implications: The data from the prefectures and municipalities surveyed in this study were collected from websites and do not necessarily represent the actual response to disaster-related evacuation in the context of COVID-19 in those areas. To clarify this evacuation, more detailed surveys are needed.

The present study takes a neural trait approach, examining whether the temporal dynamics of resting EEG networks are associated with inter-individual differences in prosociality. In two experimental sessions, we collected 55 healthy males' resting EEG, their self-reported prosocial concern and values, and their incentivized prosocial behavior across different reward domains (money, time) and social contexts (collective, individual). By means of EEG microstate analysis we identified the temporal coverage of four canonical resting networks (microstates A, B, C, and D) and their mutual communication in order to examine their association with an aggregated index of prosociality. Participants with a higher coverage of microstate A and more transitions from microstate C to A were more prosocial. Our study demonstrates that temporal dynamics of intrinsic brain networks can be linked to complex social behavior. On the basis of previous findings on links of microstate A with sensory processing, our findings suggest that participants with a tendency to engage in bottom-up processing during rest behave more prosocially than others.","output":"Temporal dynamics of resting EEG networks are associated with prosociality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this interview, philosopher Luciano Floridi explains the effects that, in his opinion, the digital revolution is having on our understanding of human nature.

The aim of this ecological study based on a 12.5-year time series was to investigate the association of short-term exposure to PM with aerodynamic diameter  2.5 m (PM(2.5)) and aerodynamic diameter  10 m (PM(10)) with hospital admissions for respiratory diseases. METHODS: Daily hospital admissions data were from the Shanghai Medical Insurance System for the period January 1, 2008 to July 31, 2020. We estimated the percentage change with its 95% confidence interval (CI) for each 10 g/m(3) increase in the level of PM(2.5) and PM(10) after adjustment for calendar time, day of the week, public holidays, and meteorological factors applying a generalized additive model with a quasi-Poisson distribution. RESULTS: There were 1,960,361 hospital admissions for respiratory diseases in Shanghai during the study period. A 10 g/m(3) increase in the level of each class of PM was associated with increased total respiratory diseases when the lag time was 0 day (PM(2.5): 0.755%; 95% CI: 0.422, 1.089%; PM(10): 0.250%; 95% CI: 0.042, 0.459%). The PM(2.5) and PM(10) levels also had positive associations with admissions for COPD, asthma, and pneumonia. Stratified analyses demonstrated stronger effects in patients more than 45 years old and during the cold season. Total respiratory diseases increased linearly with PM concentration from 0 to 100 g/m(3), and increased more slowly at higher PM concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: This time-series study suggests that short-term exposure to PM increased the risk for hospital admission for respiratory diseases, even at low concentrations. These findings suggest that reducing atmospheric PM concentrations may reduce hospital admissions for respiratory diseases.

This feeling can become a barrier against the achievement of the immunity necessary to stop the expansion of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptance of the vaccine against COVID-19 in Spain, as well as to identify the factors that have an influence on the concerns and attitudes of people against accepting the vaccine in the months prior to the start of vaccination on December 2020. An online questionnaire was created to obtain information about (1) sociodemographic characteristics; (2) concerns and sources of information about vaccines; and (3) attitudes about vaccination and state of health. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the influencing factors. Of the 2501 participants, 1207 (48.3%) would accept the COVID-19 vaccine, 623 (24.9%) were hesitant, and 671 (26.8%) would reject it. The logistic regression showed that being male, older than 60, married, retired, with a high level of education, or with a leftist political inclination, could increase the probability of accepting the COVID-19 vaccine. Disinformation and the lack of political consensus were the main sources of distrust. The patients with hypertension, immunodepression, hypercholesterolemia, or respiratory disease, or were overweight, showed a greater acceptance to the vaccine, while those with cancer took the longest to accept it. A low acceptance of the vaccine against COVID-19 was observed among the Spanish population in the phase prior to its availability, and the main fears of the population were identified.

Ever since the start of SARS-CoV-2, also known as the COVID-19 pandemic, countless uncertainties have been revolving around the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. While air pollution has been shown to be strongly correlated to increased SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality, whether environmental pollutants such as ground-level ozone affects the susceptibility of individuals to SARS-CoV-2 is not yet established. To investigate the impact of ozone inhalation on the expression levels of signatures associated with host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed lung tissues collected from mice that were sub-chronically exposed to air or 0.8 ppm ozone for three weeks (4 h/night, 5 nights/week), and analyzed the expression of signatures associated with host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells is dependent on the binding of the virus to the host cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), and its subsequent proteolytic priming by the host-derived protease, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). The Ace2 transcripts were significantly elevated in the parenchyma, but not in the extrapulmonary airways and alveolar macrophages, from ozone-exposed mice. The TMPRSS2 protein and Tmprss2 transcripts were significantly elevated in the extrapulmonary airways, parenchyma, and alveolar macrophages from ozone-exposed mice. A significant proportion of additional known SARS-CoV-2 host susceptibility genes were upregulated in alveolar macrophages and parenchyma from ozone-exposed mice. Our data indicate that the unhealthy levels of ozone in the environment may predispose individuals to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

When the COVID-19 pandemic let to closure of medical schools in these countries, the Bhutanese medical students were repatriated in March-April 2020. Upon return, they were kept in government-sponsored facility quarantine for 21 days. This study assessed their knowledge on COVID-19 as a part of self-learning and attitude as part of preparedness towards participation in government's health response to COVID-19. Method: This was a cross-sectional study among medical students who had returned to the country. This survey was conducted through an online questionnaire while the students were in 21-day facility quarantine. The sample size calculated was 129 and a convenient sampling was used. Knowledge was assessed using 20 questions, each scored 1/20. Cumulative score of score of >=80% was categorized as \\"good knowledge\\", score of >=60-79% was considered \\"satisfactory knowledge\\", and score <60% was considered \\"poor knowledge.\\" Correlation between knowledge score and duration of clinical clerkship was tested using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Attitude of students towards their willingness to participate in the national COVID-19 response were tested using rating scales. Data were analysed using Stata 13.1. Results: 120 medical students responded to this survey (response rate = 93%). Eighty-eight (74%) had good knowledge, 28 (23%) had satisfactory knowledge and only four (3%) had poor knowledge on COVID-19. The students scored high on the symptomatology, mode of transmission, prevention and treatment options and on local epidemiology; and scored low on the forms of mechanical ventilations and on the home-management of non-critical cases. The knowledge score correlated with duration of clinical clerkship (r = 0.326, p = 0.001). The primary source of information were social media sites (102, 85%), television (94, 78%) and newspapers (76, 63%).

AIM: The current study is aimed at exploring the prevalence and risk factors of MSDs among the schoolteachers in Hail, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted online among the teachers in Hail City using the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire. Teachers were randomly selected from randomly selected high schools. Teachers with at least 1 year experience were recruited for the study. Descriptive statistics, Cochran's Q test, and binominal regression were used to investigate the prevalence of MSDs among such teachers and to determine if the percentage of MSDs differed by anatomical region and risk factor (one hundred forty-five males and 106 females filled out the questionnaires). RESULTS: The prevalence of MSDs in the last 12 months was 93.63% (235 of 251 teachers). Interestingly, 91% of the affected participants (214 of 235 teachers) complained of MSDs in more than one anatomical region. The most affected site was the lower back (183 of 251 teachers, 72.91%), followed by the shoulders (168 of 251 teachers, 66.93%), and the least affected sites were the elbows (45 of 251 teachers, 17.93%). The females showed a higher prevalence of MSDs than the males. Only gender was a significant risk factor for shoulder and neck MSDs (p < 0.02). CONCLUSION: Overall, the findings of the current study suggest a high prevalence of MSDs among teachers, especially in the lower back and shoulders. The affected teachers should learn more about biomechanics and ergonomics and should engage in exercise to improve their health. Future studies should focus on identifying the biomechanical and ergonomic risk factors of MSDs and on designing MSD prevention programmes to reduce the burden of MSDs.","output":"Long-Term Prevalence and Risk Factors of Musculoskeletal Disorders among the Schoolteachers in Hail, Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Currently, physicians are limited in their ability to provide an accurate prognosis for COVID-19 positive patients. Existing scoring systems have been ineffective for identifying patient decompensation. Machine learning (ML) may offer an alternative strategy. A prospectively validated method to predict the need for ventilation in COVID-19 patients is essential to help triage patients, allocate resources, and prevent emergency intubations and their associated risks. METHODS: In a multicenter clinical trial, we evaluated the performance of a machine learning algorithm for prediction of invasive mechanical ventilation of COVID-19 patients within 24 h of an initial encounter. We enrolled patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis who were admitted to five United States health systems between March 24 and May 4, 2020. RESULTS: 197 patients were enrolled in the REspirAtory Decompensation and model for the triage of covid-19 patients: a prospective studY (READY) clinical trial. The algorithm had a higher diagnostic odds ratio (DOR, 12.58) for predicting ventilation than a comparator early warning system, the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS). The algorithm also achieved significantly higher sensitivity (0.90) than MEWS, which achieved a sensitivity of 0.78, while maintaining a higher specificity (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In the first clinical trial of a machine learning algorithm for ventilation needs among COVID-19 patients, the algorithm demonstrated accurate prediction of the need for mechanical ventilation within 24 h. This algorithm may help care teams effectively triage patients and allocate resources. Further, the algorithm is capable of accurately identifying 16% more patients than a widely used scoring system while minimizing false positive results.","output":"Prediction of respiratory decompensation in Covid-19 patients using machine learning: The READY trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Protein kinase R (PKR) is implicated in the inflammatory response to bacterial infection while the role of PKR in sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is largely unknown.

MATERIAL/METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were injected intraperitoneally with C16 or vehicle 1 h before the LPS challenge and then injected intraperitoneally with LPS or 0.9% saline. After the LPS challenge, histopathological damage, renal function, and levels of proinflammatory cytokines were assessed. All the related signaling pathways were analyzed. RESULTS: C16 effectively inhibited LPS-induced renal elevation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. C16 prevented NF-B activation and suppressed the PKR/eIF2 signaling pathway in AKI after the LPS challenge. Furthermore, C16 significantly inhibited pyroptosis during AKI, as evidenced by decreased renal levels of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein; NACHT, LRR, NLR Family Pyrin Domain-Containing 3; caspase-1; interleukin (IL)-1; and IL-18.

The present study investigated the incidence, predisposing factors, and imaging characteristics of vaccine-related axillary lymphadenopathy in patients with thoracic malignancy who underwent CT scans before and after COVID-19 vaccinations. Methods The study included patients with thoracic malignancies who received two doses of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccinations and had pre-vaccine and post-vaccine chest CT scans. Post-vaccine chest CT scans were reviewed for increase in size of axillary/subpectoral lymph nodes, comparing to the pre-vaccine scans. The cases with axillary/subpectoral lymphadenopathy were further reviewed independently by two radiologists referring to clinical information, to determine if lymphadenopathy was attributed to vaccinations. Results Vaccine-related axillary/subpectoral lymphadenopathy was noted in 21 of 232 patients (9.0%). The median short axis diameter of the largest node was 7 mm (range: 5-14 mm). The median number of increased nodes was 4 (range: 1-10). The median time to the post-vaccine scan demonstrating lymphadenopathy was 1.7 weeks (range: -2.9 C 6.6) from the 2nd dose.

Mass drug administration (MDA) has been proposed as one strategy to reduce transmission. The success of MDA is contingent upon high levels of acceptance among the target population. To inform the design of future MDA campaigns, this rapid ethnographic assessment examined malaria-related knowledge and attitudes toward malaria MDA among residents of a transmission focus in Santo Domingo. METHODS: In October 2019, a rapid ethnographic assessment was conducted in the Los Tres Brazos transmission focus, which had not previously received MDA. National malaria programme staff conducted 61 structured interviews with key informants, recorded observations, and held 72 informal conversations. Using a grounded theory approach, data were analysed during three workshop sessions with research team members. RESULTS: Among those who had heard of malaria in the structured interviews (n = 39/61; 64%), understanding of the disease was largely based on personal experience from past outbreaks or through word-of-mouth. Community health workers (promotores) were trusted for health information and malaria diagnosis more so than professional clinicians. No participant (0%) was familiar with malaria MDA. After learning about MDA, almost all study participants (92%) said that they would participate, seeing it as a way to care for their community. Reasons for not participating in future MDA included not trusting drug administrators, feeling reluctant to take unprescribed medicine, and fear of missing work. Additional identified challenges to MDA included reaching specific demographic groups, disseminating effective MDA campaign messages, and managing misinformation and political influence. CONCLUSION: Residents appear accepting of MDA despite a lack of prior familiarity. Successful MDA will depend on several factors: fostering relationships among community-based health workers, clinicians, community leaders, and others; developing clear health messages that use local terms and spreading them through a variety of media and social networks; and contextualizing MDA as part of a broader effort to promote community health.","output":"Rapid ethnographic assessment for potential anti-malarial mass drug administration in an outbreak area of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The baseline composition of T cells directly impacts later response to a pathogen, but the complexity of precursor states remains poorly defined.

However, little is known whether SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection will cause long-term pulmonary complications. We present our experience with a patient with a new diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) during the pandemic. Case: A 61-year-old man with history of hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea developed acute onset cough and dyspnea in March 2020. The patient was not initially tested for COVID-19 because of the local department of public health's stay-at-home advisory. Cough resolved but dyspnea persisted. Two months later, polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 was checked and was negative. Due to ongoing dyspnea, a CT chest was performed 5 months after symptom onset and showed diffuse, mild sub-pleural reticulonodular opacities in upper and lower lungs, concerning for ILD (Figure 1). Pulmonary function testing (PFT) showed normal spirometry and lung volumes, and mild impairment in gas exchange. Work up for causes of ILD, including assessment for exposures and serologies for rheumatologic disease, was unremarkable. IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2 was detected (25.9 AU/ml;normal&lt;1.00 AU/ml);IgM was undetectable. Work up for other causes of dyspnea included an echocardiogram, CT pulmonary angiogram, and ventilation-perfusion scan that revealed no evidence of structural heart disease or thromboembolic disease. Discussion: Given no other etiology of ILD was identified, it is most plausible that our patient had acute COVID-19 infection in March and developed secondary ILD over the ensuing months. Previous studies of patients with SARS and MERS have found occurrences of pulmonary fibrosis and PFT abnormalities persisting many months after onset of infection. Thus, it is prudent to be vigilant for symptoms of lung disease in patients with a known history of COVID-19 infection. An additional diagnostic challenge, as with the case above, lies with patients who present with new onset ILD but without a confirmation of COVID-19, particularly given the limited access to testing in the early stages of the pandemic. In these patients, we suggest a thorough history that includes screening for symptoms suggestive of prior viral syndromes, particularly with associated anosmia or dysgeusia, that can point to a history of COVID-19 infection. Another option is consideration of serologic testing, although such tests must be interpreted with caution in view of the paucity of supporting evidence and the possibility of both false-positives and false-negatives.","output":"Importance of eliciting history of prior sars-cov-2 infection in evaluation of new diagnosis of interstitial lung disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We and others have confirmed activation of macrophages plays a critical role in liver injury and fibrogenesis during HBV infection. And we have also proved HBeAg can obviously induce the production of macrophage inflammatory cytokines compared with HBsAg and HBcAg. However, the receptor and functional domain of HBeAg in macrophage activation and its effects and mechanisms on hepatic fibrosis remain elusive. METHODS: The potentially direct binding receptors of HBeAg were screened and verified by Co-IP assay. Meanwhile, the function domain and accessible peptides of HBeAg for macrophage activation were analyzed by prediction of surface accessible peptide, construction, and synthesis of truncated fragments. Furthermore, effects and mechanisms of the activation of hepatic stellate cells induced by HBeAg-treated macrophages were investigated by Transwell, CCK-8, Gel contraction assay, Phospho Explorer antibody microarray, and Luminex assay. Finally, the effect of HBeAg in hepatic inflammation and fibrosis was evaluated in both human and murine tissues by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, ELISA, and detection of liver enzymes. RESULTS: Herein, we verified TLR-2 was the direct binding receptor of HBeAg. Meanwhile, C-terminal peptide (122-143 aa.) of core domain in HBeAg was critical for macrophage activation. But arginine-rich domain of HBcAg hided this function, although HBcAg and HBeAg shared the same core domain. Furthermore, HBeAg promoted the proliferation, motility, and contraction of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in a macrophage-dependent manner, but not alone. PI3K-AKT-mTOR and p38 MAPK signaling pathway were responsible for motility phenotype of HSCs, while the Smad-dependent TGF- signaling pathway for proliferation and contraction of them. Additionally, multiple chemokines and cytokines, such as CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10, and TNF-, might be key mediators of HSC activation. Consistently, HBeAg induced transient inflammation response and promoted early fibrogenesis via TLR-2 in mice. Finally, clinical investigations suggested that the level of HBeAg is associated with inflammation and fibrosis degrees in patients infected with HBV. CONCLUSIONS: HBeAg activated macrophages via the TLR-2/NF-B signal pathway and further exacerbated hepatic fibrosis by facilitating motility, proliferation, and contraction of HSCs with the help of macrophages.

This is because U.S. drug policy has been long dominated by the antiquated view that OUD is a deviant moral failing that deserves prosecution instead of a complex health care condition that demands evidence-based treatment. The persistence of such anti-scientific theories about OUD motivated the federal governments creation of a surveille-and-supervise regulatory regime that isolates OUD treatment from the traditional health care delivery system and prioritizes the policing of individuals with OUD over the provision of expansive access to care. Unlike prior U.S. drug crises, which were attributed to the alleged immoral nature of targeted racial and ethnic minority groups, the countrys current drug use and overdose dilemma has been characterized as a predominantly rural and suburban white American problem instigated by clinical overprescribing and the aggressive and fraudulent marketing of opioid analgesics. This popular narrative, which shifts blame for use disorder from the white victim, to unscrupulous prescribers and Big Pharma, changed the substance use disorder solutions rhetoric from policing and punishment to public health interventions. Consequently, federal health officials were more amenable to policies aimed at enhancing assess to OUD treatment as the novel coronavirus began to sweep over the United States in early months of 2020. In fact, they quickly waived several of the rigid federal legal requirements that attend to OUD treatmentand have long-obstructed access to OUD therapeuticsat the inception of the COVID-19 national health emergency. The federal governments decision to waive certain access to treatment barriers for individuals with OUD was a long overdue positive development. There is no question that the federal agencies that oversee the draconian U.S. OUD therapeutic regulatory regime ought to make those waivers permanent post-pandemic. This essay argues, however, that the benefits of the OUD-related COVID-19 waivers have disproportionately inured to individuals who use buprenorphine and are overwhelmingly white at the expense of individuals who use methadone and are overwhelmingly persons of color. This is particularly tragic given that it was considerably easier to obtain a prescription for officed-based buprenorphine than access methadone administration treatment under the drug control regulatory regime pre-pandemic. The essay concludes by advancing a series of additional reforms beyond the current COVID-19 waivers that the federal government should adopt to ensure more equitably enhance access to OUD treatment.","output":"Policing Opioid Use Disorder in a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tetrastigma hemsleyanum Diels et Gilg (Sanyeqing, SYQ) has traditionally been used to treat inflammation, high fever and improve immune function of patients. Polysaccharides have been proved to be one of the important components of SYQ. Previous studies have confirmed the antipyretic and antitumor effects of polysaccharides from SYQ (SYQP), and clarified that SYQP could enhance immunity through TLR4 signalling pathway. However, there were more possibilities for the mechanism by which SYQP exerted immunomodulatory effects and the role of SYQP in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is elusive. The purpose of this study was further to explain the bidirectional modulation of immunity mechanism of SYQP in vitro and its effect in LPS-induced ARDS in vivo. Experimental results showed that SYQP significantly stimulated gene expressions of TLR1, TLR2 and TLR6 and secretion of cytokines in RAW264.7 cells. Individual or combined application of TLR2 antagonist C29 and TLR4 antagonist TAK-242 could reduce SYQP-mediated stimulation of cytokine secretion in RAW264.7 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) to varying degrees. On the other hand, SYQP markedly inhibited the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, NO, iNOS and COX-2 in LPS-treatment RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, in vivo results indicated that SYQP significantly reduced LPS-induced damage in ARDS mice through alleviating LPS-induced pulmonary morphological damage, inhibiting myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression levels, ameliorating the inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and improving hematological status. Meanwhile, SYQP evidently reduced IL-6, TNF- and IFN- secretion, the overexpression levels of TLR2 and TLR4, as well as the phosphorylation of NF-B p65. In addition, SYQP reduced the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT1 and the overexpression of NLRP3, caspase-1, caspase-3 and caspase-8 in lung tissues of ARDS mice. In summary, our study confirmed that SYQP induced bidirectional immunity and ameliorated LPS-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome in mice through TLR2/TLR4-NF-B, NLRP3/caspase and JAK/STAT signaling pathways, which provided a theoretical basis for further use of SYQP.","output":"Polysaccharides From the Aerial Parts of Tetrastigma Hemsleyanum Diels et Gilg Induce Bidirectional Immunity and Ameliorate LPS-Induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate etonogestrel (ENG)-implant acceptance during the immediate postnatal period among adolescents and young women during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to compare variables according to choice and discuss possible implications of this measure during the pandemic period METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed All women aged up to 24 years, who delivered between April 25, 2020, and June 24, 2020, at Women's Hospital, University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil were considered The ENG-implant or other contraceptive methods were offered prior to hospital discharge The participants were split into two groups: (1) those who chose the ENG-implant and (2) those that refused the implant Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed RESULTS: 151 women were included, with 76 2% selecting the ENG-implant The average age was 19 5 years;73 2% of pregnancies were unplanned, 32 5% already had a previous pregnancy, 74% were single, and 75 5% were not in full time education Further, 70 5% had previously used contraceptives, with 89 1% unsatisfied with their previous method that opted for the ENG-implant (P = 0 07) CONCLUSION: Offering the ENG-implant to youths during the immediate postnatal period is evidence-based care, and contraceptive provision is an essential health promotion tool, even during a pandemic Thinking quickly about public policies in times of crisis is important to guarantee sexual and reproductive rights","output":"Acceptability of ENG-releasing subdermal implants among postpartum Brazilian young women during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Even though coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) clinical course in children is much milder than in adults, pneumonia can occur in the pediatric population as well. Here, we reported a single-center pediatric case series of COVID-19 from Kazakhstan during the first wave of pandemic. AIM: To analyze the main clinical and laboratory aspects in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive and negative children diagnosed with pneumonia. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 54 children, who were medically assessed as close contacts of COVID-19 adults in their family setting, between June and September 2020. These children were all hospitalized: We compared the clinical and laboratory characteristics of children affected with pneumonia in the presence (group 1) or absence (group 2) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Overall, the main clinical manifestations at the admission were fever, cough, loss of appetite, fatigue/weakness, nasal congestion and/or rhinorrhea, and dyspnea. Based on the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, 24 positive children with pneumonia (group 1) and 20 negative children with pneumonia (group 2) were identified; 10 positive children did not show any radiological findings of pneumonia. No significant differences were found between the two pneumonia study groups for any clinical and laboratory parameters, except for C-reactive protein (CRP). Of course, both pneumonia groups showed increased CRP values; however, the COVID-19 pneumonia group 1 showed a significantly higher increase of CRP compared to group 2. CONCLUSION: In our case series of children assessed for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on contact tracing, the acute inflammatory response and, in detail, CRP increase resulted to be more pronounced in COVID-19 children with pneumonia than in children with SARS-CoV-2-unrelated pneumonia.

We found that the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 contains a furin cleavage site, which did not exist in any other betacoronavirus subtype B. Based on a series of analysis, we speculate that the presence of a redundant furin cut site in its Spike protein is responsible for SARS-CoV-2's stronger infectious nature than other coronaviruses, which leads to higher membrane fusion efficiency. Subsequently, a library of 4,000 compounds including approved drugs and natural products was screened against furin through structure-based virtual screening and then assayed for their inhibitory effects on furin activity. Among them, an anti-parasitic drug, diminazene, showed the highest inhibition effects on furin with an IC50 of 5.42  0.11 M, which might be used for the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Furin: A Potential Therapeutic Target for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study assesses the clinical performance of three anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays, namely EUROIMMUN anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (IgG) ELISA, Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (total antibodies) assay, and LIAISON anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins S1 and S2 (IgG) assay.

Both pathogens are not identified with standard microbiology techniques, resulting in missed or delayed diagnosis. We present a clinical case that illustrates the added value that next-generation sequencing (NGS) may offer in the diagnosis of respiratory infections in immune-compromised patients. Results: A 55 years-old man with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis underwent double lung transplantation. He received antibiotic prophylaxis with piperacillin-tazobactam and azythromycin. At day 4 post-transplantation (PTx), the patient presented an acute respiratory distress. A broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. At day 5 PTx, the patient presented a status epilepticus due to diffuse cerebral oedema. Serum ammonia concentration was 661 g/dL. BAL bacterial culture was negative. Because of the clinical presentation, special cultures were performed and identified 100.000 CFU/mL of M. hominis and Ureaplasma spp. and specific PCRs were positive for M. hominis and Ureaplasma parvum. Antibiotic therapy was shifted to therapeutic dose of azithromycin and doxycycline; within 48 h ammonia serum concentrations returned to normal but the coma persisted several weeks, followed by a persistent frontal lobe syndrome. A follow-up BAL was performed on day 11 Ptx. The Mycoplasma/Ureaplasma culture was negative, yet the specific PCRs remained positive. Bacterial culture found 100 CFU/mL of Staphylococcus aureus and viral culture was positive for Herpes Simplex Virus-1. These results were confirmed by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). In the bacterial fraction, the majority of reads belonged to Corynebacterium propinquum (34.7%), S. aureus (24.1%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (17.1%). Reads assigned to M. hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and parvum represented 0.71, 0.13, and 0.04% of the bacterial fraction and corresponded to 6.9  10(3), 9.7  10(2), and 3.7  10(2) genome equivalents per mL of BAL fluid, respectively. These results are in favor of a cure of the atypical infection. Conclusions: mNGS offered added diagnostic and quantitative values compared to PCR tests, which can remain positive after resolved infections.

To solve this issue, several solutions in the form of assistive devices have been presented recently. Another issue highlighted is the lack of kinematic compatibility in low degrees-of-freedom (dof) systems. The proposed approach of developing a human-motion-oriented rehabilitation device deals with the problem through hybrid architectures. A novel modular synthesis approach is used for the purpose to induce generality in the design process. MATERIALS AND METHODS Using a modular strategy, three planar hybrid configurations are generated for two-dof mechanisms for supporting flexion/extension motion. Three such architectures are optimally synthesised and kinematically analysed over the entire workspace. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to synthesise the architecture parameters optimally. Moreover, the outcomes are evaluated against a set of seven poses and posture locations of the wrist to choose the most suitable configuration among the others. Subsequently, kinematic compatibility is analysed for the coupled system - formed by the selected architecture and the human arm - while wearing the proposed mechanism. RESULTS According to the findings of optimal synthesis, workspace and singularity analysis, configuration-III is capable of achieving the optimal postures for all task space locations (TSLs). Further, the work modifies the design by attaching additional three revolute passive joints for correcting misalignment concerns using coupled mobility analysis. CONCLUSION The modular strategy for hybrid architectures and the subsequent mobility analysis provides an algorithmic framework for synthesising a task-based rehabilitation device.IMPLICATIONS OF REHABILITATIONManual physiotherapy is reported as repeated task, expensive and time-consuming, and considered stressful for the therapist or assistants to provide one-on-one physiotherapy to each patient in the traditional method. Robotic rehabilitation is, therefore, a viable option.In the several reported works on robotic rehabilitation exoskeletons, misalignment of the exoskeleton and the human motion is considered an open challenge. Normally, it is being managed through large number of degrees of freedom, which is certainly expensive and complex in control. The proposed approach of developing a human-motion-oriented rehabilitation device deals with the problem through hybrid architectures and modular strategy to develop them.While focusing upon the emulation of natural human motion trajectory, the compatibility of orthotic joint and human joint motion needs attention. As biological joint possesses complex kinematic characteristics, closed-loops are used in the design.Overall, a complete framework of a cost effective low-dof rehabilitation device is proposed and detailed through coupled analysis.","output":"Architectural design and development of an upper-limb rehabilitation device: a modular synthesis approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review looks at the different approaches, techniques, and materials devoted to DNA studies.

OBJECTIVES To assess IPC in the renal care settings in the era of COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS The survey consisted of the Assessment of Interprofessional Team Collaboration Scale II (AITCS-II) (3 subscales - partnership, cooperation and coordination, maximum of 5 points), questions about work conditions and factors influencing work during the pandemic, as well as demographic data. The survey was distributed in 8 renal care settings (4 hospital wards with dialysis units and 4 individual dialysis units); 127 participants filled out the survey; 26.8% of participants were physicians, 68.5% nurses and 4.7% other staff members, i.e., administrative assistants. Mean work experience in their current team was 16.8 11.7 years among nurses and 11.6 9.7 years among physicians. RESULTS Interprofessional collaboration was assessed by physicians and nurses, respectively, as follows: partnership 4.03 0.79 compared to 3.58 0.73 (p = 0.003), cooperation 4.28 0.59 compared to 3.71 0.72 (p = 0.0002), and coordination 3.83 0.87 compared to 3.48 0.82 (p = 0.04). The specific workplace did not influence the IPC rates; 49.9% of physicians and 40.1% of nurses agreed or strongly agreed that the collaboration worsened during the pandemic; 47% of physicians and 42.4% of nurses admitted that the communication has significantly deteriorated. An increased level of stress, new procedures and fear of getting infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were, according to the participants, the most significant factors for the worsening of IPC.

Frameshifts or deletions in the P3 gene have little effect on RNA 3 accumulation in P12 protoplasts whereas such mutations in the CP gene result in a 100-fold reduction of plus-strand RNA 3 accumulation. When P12 protoplasts were inoculated with a mixture of a RNA 3 mutant with a deletion in the P3 gene and a mutant with a deletion in the CP gene, CP expressed by the P3 mutant was unable to upregulate plus-strand RNA accumulation of the CP mutant.

In this study, we sought to investigate the possible pulmonary functional changes during and after administering chemotherapy in patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: In this study, a total of 37 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with cancer who were discharged from hospital and received subsequent cytotoxic chemotherapy were enrolled and prospectively followed-up. The following parameters were prospectively measured before (P1), after first chemotherapy cycle (P2), and 10 weeks after the end of chemotherapy (P3), to assess their impact on respiratory complications in terms of diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), forced expiratory volume in 1-s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), 6-min walking distance (6MWD) test and levels of key inflammatory markers. RESULTS: All patients completed at least 2 cycles of chemotherapy without showing overt respiratory complications. Six patients (16%) complained about dyspnea during chemotherapy or at follow-up period. DLCO was significantly impaired during follow-up period [from P1 78 to P3 60% of predicted values; interquartile range (IQR) 55C89] and in 32 of 37 (86% of patients) from P1 to P2 (65% of predictive value; IQR 58C70; p < 0.001).

Unlike elective surgery, Acute care surgery (ACS) workloads cannot be artificially reduced providing a unique challenge for administrators to balance healthcare resources between the COVID-19 surge and regular patient admissions. Methods: An extended ACS (eACS) model of care is described with the aim of limiting COVID-19 healthcare worker and patient cross-infection as well as providing 24/7 management of emergency general surgical (GS) and trauma patients. The eACS service comprised 5 independent teams covering a rolling 1:5 24-hr call. Attempts to completely separate eACS teams and patients from the elective side were made. The service was compared to the existing ACS service in terms of clinical and efficiency outcomes. Finally, a survey of staff attitudes towards these changes, concerns regarding COVID-19 and psychological well-being was assessed. Results: There were no staff/patient COVID-19 cross-infections. Compared to the ACS service, eACS patients had reduced overall length of stay (2-days), time spent in the Emergency Room (46 minutes) and time from surgery to discharge (2.4-hours). Mortality was decreased during this time. The eACS model of care saved financial resources and bed-days for the organisation. The changes were well received by team-members who also felt that their safety was prioritised. Conclusion: In healthcare systems affected by COVID-19, an eACS model may assist in preserving psychological well-being for healthcare staff whilst providing 24/7 care for emergency GS and trauma patients.","output":"Development of an Extended Acute Care Surgery Service in Response to the Covid-19 Global Pandemic: Assessment of Clinical Patient Outcomes and Staff Psychological Well-being"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Quarantine and stay-at-home orders are strategies that many countries used during the acute pandemic period of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to prevent disease dissemination, health system overload, and mortality. However, there are concerns that patients did not seek necessary health care due to these mandates. PURPOSE: To evaluate the differences in the clinical presentation of acute appendicitis and CT findings related to these cases between the COVID-19 acute pandemic period and nonpandemic period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed to compare the acute pandemic period (March 23, 2020, to May 4, 2020) versus the same period the year before (March 23, 2019, to May 4, 2019). The proportion of appendicitis diagnosed by CT and level of severity of the disease were reviewed in each case. Univariate and bivariate analyses were performed to identify significant differences between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 196 abdominal CT scans performed due to suspected acute appendicitis were evaluated: 55 from the acute pandemic period and 141 from the nonpandemic period. The proportion of acute appendicitis diagnosed by abdominal CT was higher in the acute pandemic period versus the nonpandemic period: 45.5% versus 29.8% (P = .038). The severity of the diagnosed appendicitis was higher during the acute pandemic period: 92% versus 57.1% (P = .003). CONCLUSION: During the acute COVID-19 pandemic period, fewer patients presented with acute appendicitis to the emergency room, and those who did presented at a more severe stage of the disease.","output":"Acute Appendicitis During Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Changes in Clinical Presentation and CT Findings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nervous system has multiple intrinsic defenses against viral infection, including the bloodCbrain barrier.

We examined static postural control in the presence of a frequency-modulated sound in three groups of participants, prior to and following a short period of training designed to create an association between auditory mental imagery of sounds and postural swaying. Results suggest that mental imagery impacted performance, as a significant decrease in postural control was observed in the experimental group following mental imagery training. Results of the control groups confirmed that the effect of mental imagery was not due to response bias, but to a significant multimodal interaction following training. These findings are in accordance with previous studies suggesting that mental imagery stimuli can interact with perceptual stimuli of a different sensory modality and lead to multisensory integration.

Although various antiviral drugs and their combinations have been tried so far against SARS-CoV-2 and they have shown some effectiveness, there is still a need for safe and cost-effective binding inhibitors in the fight against COVID-19. Therefore, phytochemicals in nature can be a quick solution due to their wide therapeutic spectrum and strong antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties.

Although most infected persons are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms, some patients progress to devastating disease; such progression is difficult to predict or identify in a timely manner. COVID-19 patients who do not require hospitalization can self-isolate at home. Calls from one disease epicenter identify the need for homebased isolation with telemedicine surveillance to monitor for impending deterioration. Methodology: Although the dominant approach for these asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic patients is to monitor oxygen saturation, we suggest additionally considering the potential merits and utility of home-based imaging. Chest computed tomography is clearly impractical, but ultrasound has shown comparable sensitivity for lung involvement, with major advantages of short and simple procedures, low cost, and excellent repeatability. Thoracic ultrasound may thus allow remotely identifying the development of pneumonitis at an early stage of illness and potentially averting the risk of insidious deterioration to severe pneumonia and critical illness while in home isolation. Conclusions: Lung sonography can be easily performed by motivated nonmedical caregivers when directed and supervised in real time by experts.

The effects of PDMPs on opioid prescription, misuse and overdose rates have been mixed due in part to variability in states PDMPs and difficulties measuring this complexity, and a lack of attention to implementation and enforcement of PDMP components. The current study uses qualitative interviews with key informants from 3 states with different PDMPs, Connecticut, Kentucky and Wisconsin to explore differences in the characteristics of the PDMPs in each state; how they are implemented, monitored and enforced; and unintended negative consequences of these programs. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with key informants from each state representing the following sectors: PDMP and pain clinic regulation agencies, Medicaid programs, state licensing boards, pharmacies, emergency medicine departments, pain management clinics, first responders, drug courts, drug treatment programs, medication assisted treatment (MAT) providers, and harm reduction organizations. Interview guides explored participants experiences with and opinions of PDMPs according to their roles. Data analysis was conducted using a collaborative, constant comparison method. RESULTS: While all 3 states had mandated registration and reporting requirements, the states differed in the implementation and enforcement of these and the extent to which provider prescribing was monitored. These, in turn, influenced how medical providers perceived the PDMP and changed how providers prescribed opioids. Unintended consequences of state PDMPs included under-prescribing for pain and dumping patients who were long term users of opioids or who had developed opioid use disorders and may explain the increase in illicit heroin or opioid use.

NSG and humanized NSG mice were infected with 100 O. volvulus infective larvae (L3) for 4 to 12 weeks. When necropsies of infected animals were performed, it was observed that parasites survived and developed throughout the infection time course. In each of the different humanized mouse models, worms matured from L3 to advanced fourth stage larvae, with both male and female organ development. In addition, worms increased in length by up to 4-fold. Serum and urine, collected from humanized mice for identification of potential biomarkers of infection, allowed for the identification of 10 O. volvulus-derived proteins found specifically in either the urine or the serum of the humanized O. volvulus-infected NSG mice. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The newly identified mouse models for onchocerciasis will enable the development of O. volvulus specific biomarkers, screening for new therapeutic approaches and potentially studying the human immune response to infection with O. volvulus.","output":"Development of Onchocerca volvulus in humanized NSG mice and detection of parasite biomarkers in urine and serum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global threat to healthcare systems, requiring hospitalization in sub intensive and intensive care for respiratory syndrome in 25-30% of patients and accounting for a lethality up to 15%.

PDeathLabs is intended for use as a summary metric for baseline metabolic status in multivariate models for COVID-19 death. MethodsCases were identified through the COVID-19 Shared Data Resource (CSDR) of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The diagnosis required at least one positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). The primary outcome was death within 60 days of the first positive test. We retrieved all values for systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), O2 saturation (O2SAT), body mass index (BMI), estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum albumin (ALB), hematocrit (HCT), LDL cholesterol (LDL) hemoglobin A1c (A1C), and HDL cholesterol (HDL) if they were done at least 14 days prior to the NAAT. Clinicians evaluate several attributes of CM that are of critical importance: metabolic control, disease burden, chronicity, refractoriness, tendency to relapse, temporal trends, and lability. We derived 1-3 parameters for each of these attributes: the most recent value (metabolic control); time-weighted average and abnormal area under a severity versus time curve (disease burden); time and number of readings above or below goal (chronicity); longest abnormal cluster and time/number of consecutive readings above goal if the last value was abnormal (refractoriness); number of abnormal clusters (tendency to relapse); long- and short-term changes (temporal trends); and coefficient of variation and mean deviation between consecutive readings (lability). We created computer programs to derive cumulative values for these 13 parameters for all 11 CM as each new value is added. A fitted logistic model was developed for each CM to determine which of the 13 parameters contributed to the risk of death. A main logistic model was developed to determine which of the 13 * 11 = 143 metabolic parameters were independently predictive of death. The resulting model was used to derive PDeathLabs for each patient and the area under its receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve calculated. Single variable logistic models were also derived for age at diagnosis, the Charlson 2-year (Charl2Yr) and lifetime (CharlEver) scores, and the Elixhauser 2-year (Elix2Yrs) and lifetime (ElixEver) scores. Stata was used to compare the ROCs for PDeathDx and each of the other metrics. ResultsOn September 30, 2021 there were 347,220 COVID-19 patients in the CSDR. 329,491 (94.9%) patients had CM performed at least 14 days prior to the COVID-19 diagnosis and form the basis for this report. 17,934 (5.44%) died within 60 days of the diagnosis. On the subset regressions, the number of significant parameters ranged from all 13 for SBP to 7 for HDL. 239,393 patients had complete sets of data for developing the main model. Of 143 candidate predictors, 49 parameters were identified as statistically significant, independent predictors of death. The most influential domains were the most recent value, disease burden, temporal trends, and tendency to relapse. The ROC area for PDeathLabs was 0.785 +/- 0.002. No difference was found in the ROC areas of PDeathLabs and age at diagnosis (0.783 +/- 0.002; P = NS). However, the ROC area for PDeathLabs was significantly greater than that of Charl2Yrs (0.704 +/- 0.002; P < 0.001), CharlEver (0.729 +/- 0.002; P < 0.001), Elix2Yrs (0.675 {+/-} 0.002; P < 0.001), and ElixEver (0.707 +/- 0.002; P < 0.001). A poor prognosis was found for chronic systolic hypertension. On the other hand, a higher BMI was protective once SBP, DBP, HDL, LDL and A1C were considered. ConclusionsOur study confirms that parameters derived for 11 CM are significant determinants of COVID-19 death. The most recent value should not be selected over other parameters for multivariate modeling unless there is a physiologic basis for doing so. PDeathLabs has the same discriminating power as age at diagnosis and outperforms comorbidity indices as a summary metric for pre-existing conditions. If validated by others, this approach provides a robust approach to handling CM in multivariate models.","output":"Baseline Metabolic Profiling and Risk of Death from Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is hard to overemphasize the role that metagenomics has had on our recent understanding of RNA virus diversity.

OBJECTIVE: To understand the onset, severity, and recovery of sensory changes associated with COVID-19 infection, this study will longitudinally track changes in chemosensory acuity among people with suspected COVID-19 infection using standardized test stimuli that are self-administered over 28 days. METHODS: In a prospective, case-controlled observational study, volunteers will be recruited when they present for COVID-19 screening by respiratory tract polymerase chain reaction test (\\"swab test\\"). The volunteers will initially complete a series of questionnaires to record their recent changes in smell and taste ability, followed by a brief standardized smell and taste test. Participants will receive a home-use smell and taste test kit to prospectively complete daily self-assessments of their smell and taste acuity at their place of residence for up to 4 weeks, with all data submitted for collection through web-based software. RESULTS: This study has been approved by the Domain Specific Review Board of the National Healthcare Group, Singapore, and is funded by the Biomedical Research Council Singapore COVID-19 Research Fund. Recruitment began on July 23, 2020, and will continue through to March 31, 2021. As of October 2, 2020, 69 participants had been recruited. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study will be the first to collect longitudinal data on changes to smell and taste sensitivity related to clinically diagnosed COVID-19 infection, confirmed by PCR swab test, in a population-based cohort. The findings will provide temporal insights on the onset, severity, and recovery of sensory changes with COVID-19 infection, the consistency of symptoms, and the frequency of full smell recovery among patients with COVID-19. This self-administered and cost-effective approach has many advantages over self-report questionnaire-based methods and provides a more objective measure of smell and taste changes associated with COVID-19 infection; this will encourage otherwise asymptomatic individuals who are potential spreaders of the virus to self-isolate and seek formal medical diagnosis if they experience a sudden change in sensory acuity. This broadened case finding can potentially help control the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce the emergence of clusters of infections.

With $P$ as the prediction from a neural network, these questions are \`Why P?', \`What if not P?', and \`Why P, rather than Q?' for a given contrast prediction $Q$. The answers to these questions are observed correlations, observed counterfactuals, and observed contrastive explanations respectively. Together, these explanations constitute the abductive reasoning scheme. We term the three explanatory schemes as observed explanatory paradigms. The term observed refers to the specific case of post-hoc explainability, when an explanatory technique explains the decision $P$ after a trained neural network has made the decision $P$. The primary advantage of viewing explanations through the lens of abductive reasoning-based questions is that explanations can be used as reasons while making decisions. The post-hoc field of explainability, that previously only justified decisions, becomes active by being involved in the decision making process and providing limited, but relevant and contextual interventions.

Patient to patient spread has been reported, however mechanisms of acquisition of Bcc are not well understood. Method: Data from the Belgian CF Registry (year 2000C2010) were collected. Inclusions: Bcc infected patients with entries on lung function in at least 1 y before and 3 y after Bcc acquisition. For each case, we included 2 controls, matched for age at the index year (year of first Bcc infection), pancreatic status, sex. Cumulative data up to 2 years before index year were compared to values obtained after infection using Rank sum test. Rate of decline in lung function was adjusted for baseline lung function, age, sex. RESULTS: Bcc prevalence in CF is low in Belgium (<3%). 183 patients were included: 61 cases, 122 controls. 59% were F508del homozygous. Mean age in cases was 20.9 y (SD 10.5) vs 20.3 y (SD 10.3) in controls. Among the Bcc, 54% were unspecified, 31% were B. multivorans. Mean FEV(1) at index year was 65.2% (SD 24.9) in cases vs 73.1 (SD 26.9) in controls (p = 0.07). FEV(1) decline before index year was significantly higher in cases (C1.7%, SD 0.5) compared to controls (C1.0%, SD 0.3) (p = 0.002). FEV(1) slopes were comparable in the period after index year (C1.1%, SD 0.5, in cases vs C0.99%, SD 0.4, p = 0.24). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a declining FEV(1) precedes acquisition of Bcc and may be a risk factor. After acquisition, lung function decline was comparable in Bcc infected and uninfected patients. These results should be interpreted with caution, since registry data are collected retrospectively and bear a risk of incompleteness or inaccuracy.","output":"67 CF patients with a declining FEV(1): At risk for acquisition of Burkholderia cepacia complex infection?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The association of socioeconomic status and lifestyle behaviours on mental health appears well-established in the literature, as several studies report that better socioeconomic status such as higher levels of disposable income and employment as well as practising healthy lifestyles can enhance mental well-being. However, the reliance on cross-sectional correlations and lack of adequate statistical controls are possible limitations. This study aims to add the evidence of longitudinal association to the literature by using Japanese representative longitudinal household panel data. We employed panel data analytical techniques such as the random-effects conditional logistic regression (RE-CLR) and the fixed-effects conditional logistic regression (FE-CLR) models with possible time variant confounders being controlled. Our sample was comprised of 14,717 observations of 3,501 individuals aged 22C59 years for five waves of the Japanese Household Panel Survey. We confirmed many of the factors associated with mental health reported in existing studies by analysing cross-sectional data. These significant associations are also longitudinal (within) associations estimated by the FE-CLR models. Such factors include unemployment, low household income, short nightly sleeping duration, and lack of exercise. However, we also found that several factors such as disposable income, living alone, and drinking habits are not significantly associated with mental health in the FE-CRL models. The results imply the reverse causality that poor mental health conditions cause lower disposal income, possibly due to the inability to exhibit higher productivity, but an increase in disposal income would not necessarily improve mental health conditions. In this case, aggressive policy interventions to increase the disposal income of people of lower socioeconomic backgrounds would not necessarily be effective to minimize health inequalities.","output":"Impact of socioeconomic- and lifestyle-related risk factors on poor mental health conditions: A nationwide longitudinal 5-wave panel study in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the 10 days commencing April 29, 2013, the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory received the first 4 of many submissions from swine farms experiencing explosive epidemics of diarrhea and vomiting affecting all ages, with 90-95% mortality in suckling pigs.

The major objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of SH+ interventions on the alleviation of stress levels and mental health problems among healthcare workers. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial of SH+ will be conducted to investigate the stress level and mental health status of Chinese healthcare workers and control subjects in Guangzhou. Assessments will be performed before (baseline), at the end of (1 month), and 2 months after (3 months) the intervention. After completing the baseline screening questionnaire, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups in a 1:1 ratio by block randomization.

The current paper considers whether the rising incidence of psychiatric symptoms during the pandemic may affect lay beliefs about the cause and course of mental illness. Laypeople's causal attributions and expectations regarding the trajectory of mental illness have important implications for societal stigma and therapeutic orientations. Two online experimental studies investigated whether reading about fictional cases of mental illness that were explicitly situated during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with reading about the same cases without any pandemic-related contextualisation, affected attributions and expectations about Generalised Anxiety Disorder (Study 1) and Major Depressive Disorder (Study 2). Study 1 (n = 137) results showed that highlighting the onset of anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic weakened attributions to biological causes and reduced the anticipated duration of symptoms.

Platinum electrodes turn black in this process, while they behave differently when the polarity is not altered. We prove that the modification of Pt is associated with highly energetic impact of nanobubbles rather than with any electrochemical process. Experiments Nanobubbles are generated by planar Pt or Ti microelectrodes. The process is driven by a series of alternating or single polarity pulses. In the case of Ti electrodes a Pt plate is separated by a gap from the electrodes. Nanoparticles on the surface of platinum are investigated with a scanning electron microscope and elemental composition is analysed using an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer. Findings Vigorous formation of Pt nanoparticles with a size of 10 nm is observed when the process is driven by the alternating polarity pulses. The effects of Pt corrosion have different character and cannot explain the phenomenon. Similar nanoparticles are observed when the Pt plate is exposed to a stream of nanobubbles. The process is explained by spontaneous combustion of hydrogen and oxygen nanobubbles on Pt surface.

Preventing recurrence of aneurysms requires dense coiling, which may aggravate the mass effect. However, the flow diverter (FD) is a new device that avoids the need for dense coiling. This study was performed to investigate whether use of FDs with adjunctive coil embolization can relieve the aneurysmal mass effect and to explore the factors that affect the variation of compressional symptoms. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated patients with compressional symptoms caused by unruptured aneurysms who underwent endovascular treatment with an FD with adjunctive coil embolization at our center from January 2015 to December 2017. Imaging follow-up included digital subtraction angiography (DSA) ranging from 11 to 14 months and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ranging from 24 to 30 months; the former was used to evaluate the intracavitary volume, and the latter was used to measure the variation of the mass effect. Follow-up physical examinations were performed to observe variations of symptoms. Results: In total, 22 patients with 22 aneurysms were treated by an FD combined with coil embolization. All 22 patients underwent the last clinical follow-up. Regarding compressional symptoms, 12 (54.54%) patients showed improvement, 6 (27.27%) were fully recovered, and 6 (27.27%) showed improvement but with incomplete cranial palsy. However, five (22.72%) patients showed no change, four (18.18%) showed worsening symptoms compared with their preoperative state, and one (4.55%) died of delayed rupture. Seventeen of the 22 patients underwent MRI. Of these 17 patients, the aneurysm shrank in 13 (76.47%) and no significant change occurred in 4 (23.53%). In the multivariate analysis, a short duration from symptom occurrence to treatment (p = 0.03) and younger patient age (p = 0.038) were statistically significant factors benefiting symptom improvement, and shrinkage of the aneurysm was associated with favorable clinical outcomes (p = 0.006). Conclusions: Use of the FD with adjunctive loose coil embolization might help to alleviate the compressional symptoms caused by intracranial aneurysms. Shrinkage of the aneurysm, a short duration of symptoms, and younger patient age might contribute to favorable outcomes of mass effect-related symptoms.","output":"Variation of Mass Effect After Using a Flow Diverter With Adjunctive Coil Embolization for Symptomatic Unruptured Large and Giant Intracranial Aneurysms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"These unprecedented times have forced the scientific community to gather to face the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is important to periodically assess changes in the legal status of abortion around the world. METHODS The criteria for legal abortion as of 2019 for 199 countries and territories were used to distribute them along a continuum of six mutually exclusive categories, from prohibited to permitted without restriction as to reason. The three most common additional legal grounds that fall outside of this continuum-rape, incest and fetal anomaly-were also quantified. Patterns by region and per capita gross national income were examined. Changes resulting from law reform and judicial decisions since 2008 were assessed, as were changes in policies and guidelines that affect access. RESULTS Legality correlated positively with income: The proportions of countries in the two most-liberal categories rose uniformly with gross national income. From 2008 to 2019,27 countries expanded the number of legal grounds for abortion; of those, 21 advanced to another legality category, and six added at least one of the most common additional legal grounds. Reform resulted from a range of strategies, generally involving multiple stakeholders and calls for compliance with international human rights norms.

Additionally, 1 in 3 also have epilepsy, with prevalence ranging from 6C50% depending on the severity of the learning disability. An EEG (Electroencephalogram) is therefore often required to aid in the diagnosis, but this can be difficult to achieve in this cohort of patients due to levels of understanding and cooperation.Additionally, neurotypical children referred for clinical procedures often encounter high levels of anxiety and distress and those who are not adequately prepared for health interventions are more likely to have poor experiences as well as increased anxiety. This can result in fearfulness of healthcare professionals and failure to attend follow-up appointments.ObjectivesTo investigate ways to alter our approach and improve the experience for patients attending for EEG, thereby improving the quality of the recorded EEG to optimise the accuracy of epilepsy diagnosis within the service.To reduce the waiting list times from referral to EEG recording from 6 weeks to 4 weeks in line with NICE guidance (NICE CG137, 1.6.3).MethodsAfter training and attendance at the RCPCH Epilepsy Quality Improvement Programme (EQIP), a driver diagram, fishbone analysis, 5-whys methodology and patient questionnaire were used to understand the patient pathway. An EEG leaflet explaining the procedure is already sent to patients. However, it was noted that there was little information or avenue for families to ask questions or to allay fears and anxieties before attending. This highlighted the need for improved preparation in addition to the standard EEG leaflet before arrival to the hospital.A Model for Improvement with 4 PDSA (Plan, Do, Study, Act) cycles was employed to test change. Patient families were contacted several days before the EEG to discuss needs, anxieties and ways of working that might improve the experience and thereby the quality of the EEG recording eg room layout, staff in uniform, toys, Wifi availability etc.The later PDSA cycles highlighted logistical problems in telephoning all paediatric patients. Therefore, an addendum to the patient leaflet was sent to the patient. This signposted useful online material and other resources.

The scientific communitys focus has recently shifted towards the association of the T cell immunological repertoire with COVID-19 progression and severity, by utilising T cell receptor sequencing (TCR-Seq) assays. The Multiplexed Identification of T cell Receptor Antigen (MIRA) dataset, which is a subset of the immunoACCESS(C) study, provides thousands of TCRs that can specifically recognize SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Our study proposes a novel Machine Learning (ML) assisted approach for analysing TCR-Seq data from the antigens point of view, with the ability to accurately distinguish between COVID-19-convalescent and healthy individuals in the case of MIRA dataset. Most SARS-CoV-2 antigens were found to exhibit equal levels of recognition by MIRA TCRs in both convalescent and healthy cohorts, leading to the assumption of putative cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious agents. This hypothesis was validated by combining MIRA with other public TCR profiling repositories that host assays and sequencing data concerning a plethora of pathogens. Our study provides evidence regarding the cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and a wide spectrum of pathogens and diseases, with M. tuberculosis and Influenza virus exhibiting the highest levels of cross-reactivity. These results can potentially shift the emphasis of immunological studies towards an increased application of TCR profiling assays that have the potential to uncover key mechanisms of cell-mediated immune response against pathogens and diseases.","output":"Machine learning assisted analysis on TCR profiling data from COVID-19-convalescent and healthy individuals unveils cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and a wide spectrum of pathogens and other diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of COVID-19 crisis, the handling of biological samples from known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals demanded the use of inactivation protocols aimed at ensuring laboratory operators safety. While not standardized, these practices can be roughly divided in two categories, namely heat inactivation and solvent-detergent treatments. As such, these routine procedures should also apply to samples intended for Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) analysis. Assessing the impact of virus inactivating pre-treatments is therefore of pivotal importance, given the well-known variability introduced by different pre-analytical steps on downstream EVs isolation and analysis. Common guidelines on inactivation protocols tailored to best address EVs-specific requirements will be likely needed among the EVs community, yet deep investigations in this direction havent been reported so far. In the attempt of sparking interest on this highly relevant topic, we here provide preliminary insights on SARS-CoV-2 inactivation practices to be adopted prior serum EVs analysis by comparing solvent/detergent treatment vs. heat inactivation. Our analysis entailed the evaluation of EVs recovery and purity along with biochemical, biophysical and biomolecular profiling by means of Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis, Western Blotting, Atomic Force Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy, miRNA content (digital droplet PCR) and tetraspanin assessment by antibody microarrays. Our data suggest an increase in ultracentrifugation (UC) recovery following heat-treatment, however accompanied by a marked enrichment in EVs-associated contaminants. On the contrary, solvent/detergent treatment is promising for small EVs (< 150nm range), yet a depletion of larger vesicular entities was detected.

COVID-19 has had and will continue to have important consequences on wellness and burnout for EM physicians in Canada. Baseline data are crucial to monitor the health of EM physicians in Canada, and evaluate any interventions designed to help during and after COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To describe the rates of burnout, depression, and suicidality in practicing EM physicians in Canada, just before the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A modified snowball method was used for survey distribution. Participants completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory C Health Services Tool (MBI-HSS), a screening measure for depression (PHQ-9), and a question regarding if the physician had ever or in the past 12 months contemplated suicide. RESULTS: A total of 384 respondent surveys were included in the final analysis: 86.1% (329/382) met at least one of the criteria for burnout, 58% (217/374) scored minimal to none on the PHQ-9 screening tool for depression, 14.3% (53/371) had contemplated suicide during their staff career in EM, and of those, 5.9% (22/371) had actively considered suicide in the past year. CONCLUSION: Canadian EM physicians just before the COVID-19 pandemic had an alarming number of respondents meet the threshold for burnout, confirming EM as a high-risk specialty.

Despite evidence of a link between social networks and mental wellbeing, little is known about this relationship in the context of rural and resource poor environments. The current study uses novel social network methodology to investigate the extent to which social network size and composition is related to mental wellbeing in a social housing community in rural England. Data come from 88 individuals living in social housing in Cornwall. These participants are part of a larger study of 329 social housing households surveyed in 2017 and 2018. Mental wellbeing was measured by the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS). A series of multivariable linear regression models were used to test associations between social network characteristics and mental wellbeing. Social network size was significantly associated with the SWEMWBS (b = 0.39, p < 0.01), such that individuals with larger networks reported better mental wellbeing, but after controlling for community social cohesion, this effect dissipated. Neither gender composition or talking with network members about health and wellbeing were significantly associated with the SWEMWBS. Findings suggest that both the quantity of social connections and perceptions of community cohesion are moderately associated with mental wellbeing in rural and resource poor localities. As such, efforts to improve mental wellbeing would benefit from targeting multiple aspects of social relationships, rather than focusing solely on increasing the size of individuals social networks.","output":"Wellbeing and Social Network Characteristics in Rural Communities: Findings from a Cohort in Social Housing in Cornwall, United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) variants posed considerable threats to the global public health.

Cattle are considered to be the primary host and reservoir, and previous studies suggested a tropism of IDV for the upper respiratory tract and a putative role in the bovine respiratory disease complex. This study aimed to characterize the pathogenicity of IDV in naive calves as well as the ability of this virus to transmit by air. Eight naive calves were infected by aerosol with a recent French isolate, D/bovine/France/5920/2014. Results show that IDV replicates not only in the upper respiratory tract but also in the lower respiratory tract (LRT), inducing moderate bronchopneumonia with restricted lesions of interstitial pneumonia. Inoculation was followed by IDV-specific IgG1 production as early as 10 days postchallenge and likely both Th1 and Th2 responses. Study of the innate immune response in the LRT of IDV-infected calves indicated the overexpression of pathogen recognition receptors and of chemokines CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4, but without overexpression of genes involved in the type I interferon pathway. Finally, virological examination of three aerosol-sentinel animals, housed 3 m apart from inoculated calves (and thus subject to infection by aerosol transmission), and IDV detection in air samples collected in different areas showed that IDV can be airborne transmitted and infect naive contact calves on short distances. This study suggests that IDV is a respiratory virus with moderate pathogenicity and probably a high level of transmission. It consequently can be considered predisposing to or a cofactor of respiratory disease.IMPORTANCE Influenza D virus (IDV), a new genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family, has a broad geographical distribution and can infect several animal species. Cattle are so far considered the primary host for IDV, but the pathogenicity and the prevalence of this virus are still unclear. We demonstrated that under experimental conditions (in a controlled environment and in the absence of coinfecting pathogens), IDV is able to cause mild to moderate disease and targets both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. The virus can transmit by direct as well as aerosol contacts. While this study evidenced overexpression of pathogen recognition receptors and chemokines in the lower respiratory tract, IDV-specific IgG1 production as early as 10 days postchallenge, and likely both Th1 and Th2 responses, further studies are warranted to better understand the immune responses triggered by IDV and its role as part of the bovine respiratory disease complex.","output":"Pathogenesis, Host Innate Immune Response, and Aerosol Transmission of Influenza D Virus in Cattle."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Public health emergencies require resources at state, regional, federal, and often international levels; however, community preparedness is the crucial first step in managing these events and mitigating their consequences, particularly for children. Community preparedness can be optimized through system-wide planning that includes integrating multiple points of contact, such as the community, prehospital care, health facilities, and regional level of care assets.Citizen readiness, call centers, alternate care facilities, emergency medical services, and health emergency operations centers linked to community incident command systems should be considered as important options for delivery of population-based care. Early collaboration between pediatric clinicians and public health authorities is essential to ensure that pediatric needs are addressed in community preparedness for mass critical care events. METHODS In May 2008, the Task Force for Mass Critical Care published guidance on provision of mass critical care to adults. Acknowledging that the critical care needs of children during disasters were unaddressed by this effort, a 17-member Steering Committee, assembled by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education with guidance from members of the American Academy of Pediatrics, convened in April 2009 to determine priority topic areas for pediatric emergency mass critical care recommendations.Steering Committee members established subcommittees by topic area and performed literature reviews of MEDLINE and Ovid databases. The Steering Committee produced draft outlines and convened October 6-7, 2009, in New York, NY, to review and revise each outline. Eight draft documents were subsequently developed from the revised outlines as well as through searches of MEDLINE updated through March 2010.The Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care Task Force, composed of 36 experts from diverse public health, medical, and disaster response fields, convened in Atlanta, GA, on March 29-30, 2010. Feedback on each manuscript was compiled and the Steering Committee revised each document to reflect expert input in addition to the most current medical literature. TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS The Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care Task Force recommends active promotion of programs to ensure an informed citizenry; education of children and families in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention community mitigation strategies; emphasis on community-level preparedness empowering the public to provide self care; use of 9-1-1 telephone triage with pre-established protocols and in coordination with emergency medical services; and advocacy for healthcare coalitions and other creative operational concepts that provide guidance and protocols for care of the pediatric population.","output":"Pediatric emergency mass critical care: the role of community preparedness in conserving critical care resources."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Objective: To explore the impact of corona virus disease-19 pandemic on postgraduate paediatric residents.

Transfer of the ATP  phosphate to a protein tyrosine residue activates signaling cascades regulating the differentiation, survival, and effector functions of all cells, with unique roles in immune antigen receptor, polarization, and other signaling pathways. Defining the substrates and scaffolding interactions of tyrosine kinases is critical for revealing and therapeutically manipulating mechanisms of immune regulation. Quantitative analysis of the amplitude and kinetics of these effects is becoming ever more accessible experimentally and increasingly important for predicting complex downstream effects of therapeutics and for building computational models. Secondarily, quantitative analysis is increasingly expected by reviewers and journal editors, and statistical analysis of biological replicates can bolster claims of experimental rigor and reproducibility. Here we outline methods for perturbing tyrosine kinase activity in cells and quantifying protein phosphorylation in lysates and immunoprecipitates. The immunoblotting techniques are a guide to probing the dynamics of protein abundance, protein-protein interactions, and changes in post-translational modification. Immunoprecipitated protein complexes can also be subjected to targeted mass spectrometry to probe novel sites of modification and multiply modified or understudied proteins that cannot be resolved by immunoblotting.

Therefore, it is important to gain insight into the human milk antibody response after immunization with the various vaccines that are currently widely used. The aim of this study is to determine and compare the antibody response in human milk following vaccination with mRNA- and vector-based vaccines up to over two months post-vaccination. METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted in the Netherlands between January 06, 2021 and July 31, 2021. Participants were recruited through social media. Human milk samples were collected longitudinally during a period of 70 days from women receiving one of the four different severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines: Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2), Moderna (mRNA-1273), Oxford/AstraZeneca (AZD1222) and Johnson&Johnson (Ad26.COV2.S). SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The area under the curve (AUC) of the Immunoglobulins A (IgA) and G (IgG) antibody response was determined over 15 and 70 days following the first vaccination and compared between the different vaccines. FINDINGS: This study enrolled 134 vaccinated lactating women of whom 97 participated the entire study period. In total, 1887 human milk samples were provided. The human milk antibody response differed between SARS-CoV-2 vaccines over the study period. The mean AUC of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA, but not IgG, in human milk over 15 days was higher after vaccination with an mRNA-based vaccine than a vector-based vaccine (AUC with respect to ground [AUCg]  the standard error of the mean [SEM] for IgA was 609  089 in the BNT162b2 group, 748  103 in the mRNA-1273 group, 417  073 in the AZD1222 group, and 571  070 in the Ad26.COV2.S group). Over a period of 70 days, the mean AUCg of both IgA and IgG was higher after vaccination with an mRNA-based vaccine than a vector-based vaccine (AUCg  SEM for IgA was 3877  651 in the BNT162b2 group, 5013  741 in the mRNA-1273 group, 2412  547 in the AZD1222 group, and 2815  669 in the Ad26.COV2.S group; AUCg  SEM for IgG was 4043  267 in the BNT162b2 group, 3701  238 in the mRNA-1273 group, 1604  509 in the AZD1222 group, and 1044  250 in the Ad26.COV2.S group). INTERPRETATION: Overall, maternal vaccination during lactation with an mRNA-based vaccine resulted in higher SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in human milk compared to vector-based vaccines. Therefore, vaccination with mRNA-based vaccines, preferably with the mRNA-1273 vaccine, might not only provide better immunological protection for the mother but also for her breastfed infant.

Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Situation. http://https://covid19.who.int/). Consequently, the high demand for testing has resulted in a depletion of commercially available consumables, including the recommended swabs and viral transport media (VTM) required for nasopharyngeal sampling. Therefore, the potential use of unvalidated alternatives must be explored to address the global shortage of testing supplies. To tackle this issue, we evaluated the utility of different swabs and transport mediums for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2. This study compared the performance of six swabs commonly found in primary and tertiary health care settings (PurFlock Ultra, FLOQSwab, Puritan Pur-Wraps cotton tipped applicators, Puritan polyester tipped applicators, MedPro 6 cotton tipped applicators, and HOLOGIC Aptima) for their efficacy in testing for SARS-CoV-2. Separately, the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 was completed from different transport mediums (DMEM, PBS, 100 % ethanol, 0.9 % normal saline and VTM), which were kept up to three days at room temperature (RT).

Yet, the drivers and patterns of microbiota imbalance (dysbiosis) in wild animals remain largely unexplored. One hypothesised outcome of stress on animal microbiomes is a destabilised microbial community that is characterised by an increase in inter-individual differences compared with microbiomes of healthy animals, which are expected to be (a) temporally stable and (b) relatively similar among individuals. This set of predictions for response of microbiomes to stressors is known as the Anna Karenina principle (AKP) for animal microbiomes. We examine the AKP in a wild mammal inhabiting disturbed environments by conducting a capture-mark-recapture survey of bank voles Myodes glareolus in areas that contrast in levels of radionuclide contamination (Chernobyl, Ukraine). Counter to key predictions of the AKP, bank voles that are not exposed to radionuclides harbour variable (increased inter-individual differences) and temporally dynamic gut microbiota communities, presumably tracking the natural spatio-temporal variation in resources. Conversely, bank voles exposed to radionuclides host more similar gut microbiota communities that are temporally stable, potentially due to a dysbiosis or selection (on host or bacteria) imposed by chronic radiation exposure. The implication of these data is that environmental stress (radiation exposure) can constrain the natural spatial and temporal variation of wild animal gut microbiota.","output":"Applying the Anna Karenina principle for wild animal gut microbiota: Temporal stability of the bank vole gut microbiota in a disturbed environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency is a rare monogenic disease, often fatal in the first decade, causing severe intellectual disability, movement disorders and autonomic dysfunction. It is due to mutations in the gene coding for the AADC enzyme responsible for the synthesis of dopamine and serotonin. Using whole exome sequencing, we have identified a novel homozygous c.989C > T (p.Pro330Leu) variant of AADC causing AADC deficiency. Pro330 is part of an essential structural and functional element: the flexible catalytic loop suggested to cover the active site as a lid and properly position the catalytic residues. Our investigations provide evidence that Pro330 concurs in the achievement of an optimal catalytic competence. Through a combination of bioinformatic approaches, dynamic light scattering measurements, limited proteolysis experiments, spectroscopic and in solution analyses, we demonstrate that the substitution of Pro330 with Leu, although not determining gross conformational changes, results in an enzymatic species that is highly affected in catalysis with a decarboxylase catalytic efficiency decreased by 674- and 194-fold for the two aromatic substrates. This defect does not lead to active site structural disassembling, nor to the inability to bind the pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP) cofactor. The molecular basis for the pathogenic effect of this variant is rather due to a mispositioning of the catalytically competent external aldimine intermediate, as corroborated by spectroscopic analyses and pH dependence of the kinetic parameters. Altogether, we determined the structural basis for the severity of the manifestation of AADC deficiency in this patient and discussed the rationale for a precision therapy.

While evidence has begun to point to persisting antibody responses among SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, cases of re-infection have begun to emerge, calling the protective nature of humoral immunity against this highly infectious pathogen into question.

Notably, neutralization, Fc-function, and SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses were only observed in subjects that elicited RBD-specific antibody titers above a threshold. The findings point to a switch-like relationship between observed antibody titer and function, where a distinct threshold of activitydefined by the level of antibodiesis required to elicit vigorous humoral and cellular response.

Effective mental health care for youth from these families is currently lacking, urging research on new methods. The InConnection approach is an integrated care program to improve resilience in multi-problem families by connecting the professional expertise from multiple disciplines with the informal social network of the youth. Specifically, youth are asked to nominate a youth initiated mentor (YIM) from among the supportive adults in their network. The aim of this protocol is to describe the design of a mixed-methods study to examine the effectiveness and working mechanisms of the InConnection approach. METHOD/DESIGN: The effectiveness of the InConnection approach is studied in a quasi-experimental questionnaire study using propensity score matching, with N = 300 families with youth aged 10-23 years receiving treatment in either the intervention group (InConnection approach) or the control group (care as usual). The main outcome variables include youth resilience (primary), youth mental health, parental functioning, and the number, duration and types of out-of-home placements. Mediators, moderators, and predictors of effectiveness are examined. Assessments take place at the start of the care program and after three, nine and 15 months. Additionally, semi-structured interviews are conducted with families who have and have not nominated a YIM to understand why some families successfully nominate a YIM, whereas others do not. DISCUSSION: Effective care for youth in multi-problem families is urgently needed. Given its flexibility and accessibility to suit all youth aged 10-23 years from multi-problem families, and its low costs compared to out-of-home placements, the InConnection approach seems an appealing approach to support these families.

However, the relationship between being underweight and COVID-19 mortality remains inconclusive. Previous dose-response meta-analyses did not enroll or specifically analyze the underweight population. Herein, we conducted a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and mortality in both obese and underweight patients with COVID-19. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from inception until August 12, 2020 using the keywords COVID-19, body mass index, obesity, overweight, and underweight. Three reviewers independently assessed the relevant articles, including the title, abstract, and full text, to identify eligible studies. We performed a two-stage random-effects dose-response meta-analysis, including only studies with at least three quantitative classifications for BMI. The nonlinear trend was evaluated using a restricted cubic splines model with three-knots at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by pooling only those studies which specifically evaluated underweight patients (BMI<18.5 kg/m(2)). Results: Thirteen studies comprising 25,828 patients were included in the analysis. In the linear model, the mortality of patients with COVID-19 increased by 1.5% for each 1-kg/m(2) increase in BMI (pooled relative risk [RR] =1.015, 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.004?1.027). However, a significant non-linear relationship between BMI and mortality was observed (Wald test: P(non-linearity)<0.001). We demonstrated a J-shaped curve, indicating that both underweight and obese patients had a higher mortality than those with normal weight. Interestingly, overweight patients (BMI, 25?30 kg/m(2)) seemed to have the lowest mortality risk. Using a BMI of 15 kg/m(2) as the reference, the RRs of mortality decreased with BMI, and this trend continued until BMI of approximately 28 kg/m(2) (RR=0.743, 95% CI=0.576?0.959). The relationship between BMI and mortality was then reversed, and an upward trend was observed when BMI exceeded 30 kg/m(2); the RRs (95% CI) at BMIs 30, 35, 40, and 45 kg/m(2) were 0.745 (0.570?0.974), 0.841 (0.643?1.100), 1.082 (0.850?1.377), and 1.457 (1.129?1.879), respectively. Conclusion: This study is the first dose-response meta-analysis that showed both underweight and obese COVID-19 patients are at higher risk of increased mortality.

They allow for computational case studies on non-pharmaceutical interventions thereby providing an important basis for policy makers. While research is ongoing on the transmission dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, it is important to come up with epidemic models that can describe the main stages of the progression of the associated COVID-19 respiratory disease. We propose an age-stratified discrete compartment model as an alternative to differential equation based S-I-R type of models. The model captures the highly age-dependent progression of COVID-19 and is able to describe the day-by-day advancement of an infected individual in a modern health care system. The fully-identified model for Switzerland not only predicts the overall histories of the number of infected, hospitalized and deceased, but also the corresponding age-distributions. The model-based analysis of the outbreak reveals an average infection fatality ratio of 0.4% with a pronounced maximum of 9.5% for those aged &#8805; 80 years. The predictions for different scenarios of relaxing the soft lockdown indicate a low risk of overloading the hospitals through a second wave of infections. However, there is a hidden risk of a significant increase in the total fatalities (by up to 200%) in case schools reopen with insufficient containment measures in place.","output":"Age-stratified discrete compartment model of the COVID-19 epidemic with application to Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to evaluate the influence of nutritional status on eating habits and food choice determinants among Brazilian women during the COVID-19 outbreak.

OBJECTIVE To understand COVID-19 and influenza vaccine willingness and its associations among PwMS, following the approval of the first two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS A survey was distributed to PwMS via an online platform from December 2020 to February 2021. Logistic regression models were constructed to determine the relationship between (1) COVID-19 and (2) influenza vaccination willingness with demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS Of 701 responding PwMS, 76.6% were COVID-19 vaccine willing. COVID-19 vaccine willingness was significantly associated with influenza vaccine willingness (p < 0.001). In multivariable models, older age increased the odds of COVID-19 and influenza vaccine willingness (odds ratios (ORs) > 1) and other race decreased the odds of COVID-19 and influenza vaccine willingness (ORs < 1); higher functional disability decreased the odds of COVID-19 vaccine willingness (OR = 0.88, 95% confidence interval = 0.80-0.96). Prevalent vaccine-related concerns include safety (n = 244) and efficacy (n = 122).

METHODS: Tianjin, a northeastern city in China, was chosen as the region of research and applied the influenza-like illness attack rate (ILI)% as the baseline and warning line to determine the severity of influenza epidemic. Then, an influenza early warning model was constructed based on the theory of rough set and support vector machines (RS-SVM), and the relationship between influenza and meteorology was explored through analyzing the monitoring data. RESULTS: The predictive performance of the model was good, which had achieved 81.8% accuracy when grouping the obtained data into three levels that represent no danger, danger of a light epidemic, and danger of a severe epidemic. The test results showed that if the host qi and guest qi were not balanced, this kind of situation was more likely to cause influenza outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: The outbreak of influenza closely relates to temperature, humidity, visibility, and wind speed and is consistent with some part of CM doctrine.

A number of surveys have explored public perceptions of their risks and benefits. In this paper we meta-analyse these surveys to assess the extent to which the following four hypotheses derived from previous studies of new technologies might be said to be valid for nanotechnologies: risk aversion will prevail over benefit appreciation; an increase in knowledge will not result in reduced aversion to risks; judgements will be malleable and subject to persuasion given risk-centric information; and contextual, psychometric and attitudinal predictors of perceived risk from prior studies can help anticipate future perceptions of nanotechnologies. We find that half the public has at least some familiarity with nanotechnology, and those who perceive greater benefits outnumber those who perceive greater risks by 3 to 1. However, a large minority of those surveyed (44%) is unsure, suggesting that risk judgements are highly malleable. Nanotechnology risk perceptions also appear to contradict some long-standing findings. In particular, unfamiliarity with nanotechnology is, contrary to expectations, not strongly associated with risk aversion and reduced 'knowledge deficits' are correlated with positive perceptions in this early and controversy-free period. Psychometric variables, trust and affect continue to drive risk perceptions in this new context, although the influence of both trust and affect is mediated, even reversed, by demographic and cultural variables.

However, concerns among the public about the safety and health effects of radiofrequency radiations (RFRs) emitted from the newer-generation cell phone frequencies remain, partly due to the lack of robust scientific data. Previously, we used developmental zebrafish to model the bioactivity of 3.5 GHz RFR, a frequency used by 5G-enabled cell phones, in a novel RFR exposure chamber. With RFR exposures from 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 48 hpf, we observed that, despite no teratogenic effects, embryos showed subtle hypoactivity in a startle response behavior assay, suggesting abnormal sensorimotor behavior. This study builds upon the previous one by investigating the transcriptomic basis of RFR-associated behavior effects and their persistence into adulthood. Using mRNA sequencing, we found a modest transcriptomic disruption at 48 hpf, with 28 differentially expressed genes. KEGG pathway analysis showed that biochemical pathways related to metabolism were significantly perturbed. Embryos were grown to adulthood, and then a battery of behavioral assays suggested subtle but significant abnormal responses in RFR-exposed fish across the different assays evaluated that suggest potential long-term behavioral effects. Overall, our study suggests the impacts of RFRs on the developing brain, behavior, and the metabolome should be further explored.","output":"Transcriptomic and Long-Term Behavioral Deficits Associated with Developmental 3.5 GHz Radiofrequency Radiation Exposures in Zebrafish"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome that results from a structural or functional cardiac disorder that reduces the ability of the ventricle of the heart to fill with, or eject, blood. It is a multifaceted clinical condition that affects up to 2% of the population in the developed world, and is linked to significant morbidity and mortality; it is therefore considered a major concern for public health. Regarding the mechanism of HF, three neurohumoral factors - the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the sympathetic nervous system, and natriuretic peptides  are related to the pathology of chronic HF (CHF), and the targets of treatment. Angiotensin receptor blocker and neprilysin inhibitor (angiotensin-receptor neprilysin inhibitor), namely sacubitril/valsartan (SAC/VAL), has been introduced as a treatment for CHF. SAC/VAL is an efficacious, safe, and cost-effective therapy that improves quality of life and longevity in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and reduces hospital admissions. An in-hospital initiation strategy offers a potential new avenue to improve the clinical uptake of SAC/VAL. In the last five years, SAC/VAL has been established as a cornerstone component of comprehensive disease-modifying medical therapy in the management of chronic HFrEF. On the other hand, further work, with carefully designed and controlled preclinical studies, is necessary for understanding the molecular mechanisms, effects, and confirmation of issues such as long-term safety in both human and animal models.","output":"Angiotensin receptor blocker neprilysin inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has placed tremendous pressure on public health systems across the world.

This paper aimed to identify existing evidence on psychological symptoms and their associated factors among cancer patients in the Chinese Mainland during the COVID-19 pandemic, and on interventions to effectively manage these symptoms.

A total of 180 studies were identified, and 18 studies were included in the review after removing duplicates and screening for relevancy. The results suggest that patients with cancer in the Chinese Mainland have suffered psychological pressure during COVID-19, with a high prevalence of psychological distress, depression and anxiety reported across most of the reviewed studies. Pandemic-related factors such as treatment discontinuation and worry about being infected are associated with these symptoms. Nurses may help to relieve these symptoms by identifying stressors, providing relevant information through mass and social media and referring patients to specialists for psychological support.

Coronavirus infections in humans are typically associated with respiratory illnesses; however, viral RNA has been isolated in serum from infected patients. Coronaviruses have been identified as a potential low-risk threat to blood safety. The Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology (PRT) System utilizes riboflavin and ultraviolet (UV) light to render blood-borne pathogens noninfectious, while maintaining blood product quality. Here, we report on the efficacy of riboflavin and UV light against the pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2 when tested in both plasma and platelets units. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Stock SARS-CoV-2 was grown in Vero cells and inoculated into either plasma or platelet units. Those units were then treated with riboflavin and UV light. The infectious titres of SARS-CoV-2 were determined by plaque assay using Vero cells. A total of five (n = 5) plasma and three (n = 3) platelet products were evaluated in this study. RESULTS: In both experiments, the measured titre of SARS-CoV-2 was below the limit of detection following treatment with riboflavin and UV light. The mean log reductions in the viral titres were &#8805;340 and &#8805;453 for the plasma units and platelet units, respectively. CONCLUSION: Riboflavin and UV light effectively reduced the titre of SARS-CoV-2 in both plasma and platelet products to below the limit of detection in tissue culture.

Interventions Descriptive statistics were used to describe demographics and patient-reported information. Differences in frailty status by demographics and patient-reported information were assessed with Chi-square test and analysis of variance. Main Outcome Measures Frailty and pre-frail status were determined based on five pre-defined criteria described by Fried and colleagues. Our modified criteria were drawn from clinic screening questions on significant weight loss, exhaustion, activity level, walking difficulty as a surrogate measure of walking speed, and ability to open jars or grip and open things. Results COVID-19 survivors (Mage 52.6  14.8 years old, 64.5% female) had  1 comorbidity, average of 70.82  60 days from COVID diagnosis to follow-up, 64 symptoms at the clinic visit, and 2.791.06 special care referrals.

Method The survey collected demographic data, burnout scores using the validated Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), psychosocial and work-related variables using questions adapted from previous surveys. It was tested for readability by a group of pharmacists and academic clinicians before distribution via social media and professional organisations. Main outcome measure Burnout was calculated using mean MBI scores, descriptive statistics were used to report work and psychosocial variables and Pearson's chi-square compared males and females. Results Overall, 647 responses were analysed. Most participants were female n = 487 (75.7%) with hospital n = 269 (42.2%) and community n = 253 (39.9%) pharmacists well represented. Mean (SD) for emotional exhaustion (possible range 0-54) and depersonalisation (possible range 0-30) were 28.5 (13.39) and 7.98 (5.64), which were higher (increased burnout) than reported pre-COVID-19. Personal accomplishment (range 0-48, lower scores associated with burnout) mean (SD) 36.58 (7.56), was similar to previously reported. Males reported higher depersonalisation indicating more withdrawal and cynicism. Working overtime, medication supply and patient incivility were reported to affect work.

The purpose of this study was to compare the results of the use of iliac crest autograft versus allograft from the same anatomic site in terms of union and recurrence. METHODS: Forty-six patients with genovarum with or without medial compartment osteoarthritis were enrolled based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria and were randomly assigned into two groups. MOW-HTO was done using iliac crest allograft (23 patients) or autograft (23 patients) as void filler. Follow-up visits were done monthly for the first 3 months and then every 3 months until 1 year and then at 5th and 8th postoperative year. The clinical assessment of union, anatomical indices of proximal tibia, complications and WOMAC score were assessed for both groups. RESULTS: The amount of correction (degrees), recurrence, complication rates, time to get symptom-free, radiologic union and knee scores was similar in both groups. The symptom-free time was 6.1 (SD = 0.9) weeks in autograft group versus 6.2 (SD = 0.8) weeks in allograft group (p = 0.73, 95% CI - 0.4 to 0.6). The time to radiologic union had a between-group difference of 0.3 weeks (p = 0.58, 95% CI - 1.6 to 0.9). There was one case of surgical site infection in graft harvest site. No nonunion or delayed union was encountered in either group. Fifty-two percent of the autograft patients reported more intense postoperative pain in iliac graft harvest site than tibial osteotomy site. CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, iliac crest allograft can be safely used in MOW-HTO with comparable efficacy and safety to iliac crest autograft.

The automated approaches identify and locate carious regions from dental images by localizing and processing either colored photographs or X-ray images taken via specialized dental photography cameras. The dentists interpretation of carious regions is difficult since the detected regions are masked using solid coloring and limited to a particular dental image type. The software-based automated tools to localize caries from dental images taken via ordinary cameras requires further investigation. This research provided a mixed dataset of dental photographic (colored or X-ray) images, instantiated a deep learning approach to enhance the existing dental image carious regions localization procedure, and implemented a full-fledged tool to present carious regions via simple dental images automatically. The instantiation mainly exploits the mixed dataset of dental images (colored photographs or X-rays) collected from multiple sources and pre-trained hybrid Mask RCNN to localize dental carious regions.

For risk assessment and clinical decisions, predictive values are of interest. Positive predictive value (PPV) is the chance that a member of a relevant population who tests positive has been ill. Negative predictive value (NPV) is the chance that someone who tests negative has not been ill. The medical literature regularly reports sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is the chance that an ill person receives a positive test result. Specificity is the chance that a nonill person receives a negative result. Knowledge of sensitivity and specificity enables one to predict the test result given a person's illness status. These predictions are not directly relevant to patient care but, given knowledge of sensitivity and specificity, PPV and NPV can be derived if one knows the prevalence of the disease, the population rate of illness. There is considerable uncertainty about the prevalence of some diseases, a notable case being COVID-19. This paper addresses the problem of identification of PPV and NPV given knowledge of sensitivity and specificity and given bounds on prevalence.

PM2.5 samples were collected using mid-volume samplers during the autumn of 2017 in all six cities. The samples were analyzed to determine the ambient PM2.5 compositions, including the concentrations of water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs), carbonaceous aerosols, and elements concentrations. The chemical ratios of organic carbon to elemental carbon and nitrate to sulfate as well as the enrichment factors of elements were calculated to establish the possible sources of PM2.5 in all six cities. The highest PM2.5 concentration was 152 g/m3 in SJZ, while the lowest concentration was 47 g/m3 in HRB. During the sampling period in these six cities, the PM2.5 concentrations exceeded the World Health Organization recommended daily average air quality guidelines by 2.4-6.1 times, and WSIIs, carbonaceous aerosols, and elements accounted for 31.8%-61.6%, 9.8%-35.1%, and 0.9%-2.5% of the PM2.5, respectively. In 2013, the Chinese government formulated the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (APPCAP) for controlling air pollution, and effective measures have been implemented since then. Compared with previous studies conducted during 2009-2013 before the implementation of the APPCAP, the concentrations of PM2.5 and most of its components decreased to varying degrees, and large changes in the chemical ratios of PM2.5 components were observed. These results indicate that PM2.5 sources vary among these six cities and that China has improved the ambient air quality in these cities through the implementation of air pollution control policies. The APPCAP have achieved considerable results in continuously reducing pollution concentrations, although the air pollution concentrations observed in this study remain high compared with those of other countries.","output":"Distribution characteristics and policy-related improvements of PM2.5 and its components in six Chinese cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Visitor restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic limit in-person family meetings for hospitalized patients. We aimed to evaluate the quantity of family meetings by telephone, video and in-person during the COVID-19 pandemic by manual chart review. Secondary outcomes included rate of change in patient goals of care between video and in-person meetings, the timing of family meetings, and variability in meetings by race and ethnicity. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study evaluated patients admitted to the intensive care unit at an urban academic hospital between March and June 2020. Patients lacking decision-making capacity and receiving a referral for a video meeting were included in this study. RESULTS: Most patients meeting inclusion criteria (N = 61/481, 13%) had COVID-19 pneumonia (n = 57/61, 93%). A total of 650 documented family meetings occurred. Few occurred in-person (n = 70/650, 11%) or discussed goals of care (n = 233/650, 36%). For meetings discussing goals of care, changes in patient goals of care occurred more often for in-person meetings rather than by video (36% vs. 11%, p = 0.0006). The average time to the first goals of care family meeting was 11.4 days from admission. More documented telephone meetings per admission were observed for White (10.5, SD 9.5) and Black/African-American (7.1, SD 6.6) patients compared to Hispanic or Latino patients (4.9, SD 4.9) (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: During this period of strict visitor restrictions, few family meetings occurred in-person.

However, many established cancer centres worldwide have recently shown total laparoscopic Wertheim's radical hysterectomy (TLRH) to be a safe and feasible alternative to the conventional abdominal route for early cervical cancer management. This technique was introduced in Singapore in 2009. METHODS This was a prospective pilot study comparing TLRH with RAH in a single large tertiary institution in Singapore. Inclusion criteria included surgically fit patients with early cervical cancer and no radiological evidence of regional or distant metastases. RESULTS From November 2009 to February 2011, a total of 18 TLRHs and 30 RAHs were performed. The median blood loss in the TLRH group was significantly lower than that in the RAH group (300 mL vs. 500 mL; p = 0.04). However, there was no statistically significant difference found between the two techniques in terms of operative time, hospital stay, bladder recovery, total lymph node yield or adjuvant treatment. No intraoperative bladder, ureteric or bowel complications were observed in the two groups. Postoperative complications occurred in 2 (11.1%) TLRH patients and 4 (13.3%) RAH patients. With a median follow-up of 37.3 (range 10-68) weeks, the rate of recurrence was found to be 5.6% for the TLRH group and 10.0% for the RAH group. CONCLUSION The results of our study suggest that with appropriate patient selection and increased experience, TLRH can be a safe and effective procedure for the management of early cervical cancer in Singapore.","output":"Total laparoscopic Wertheim's radical hysterectomy versus Wertheim's radical abdominal hysterectomy in the management of stage I cervical cancer in Singapore: a pilot study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Healthcare workers (HCWs) have a substantially higher risk of Covid-19 infection but there is a paucity of information on the risk factors of disease transmission in high-burden real-world settings. The study objective was to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers in a high-burden Covid-19 setting and to estimate the incidence and identify the risk factors of infection. Methods This was a prospective observational cohort study amongst doctors and nurses working at a dedicated Covid-19 tertiary care government hospital in Delhi, India. A baseline blood sample (2-3ml) was collected from all the participants to test for the presence of total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The HCWs that were seronegative (non-reactive) at baseline were followed-up for 2128 days with the collection of a second blood sample to assess for the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results A total of 321 (51.3%, 95% C.I 47.4, 55.3) HCWs were detected with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on baseline examination. The seroprevalence, when adjusted for assay characteristics, was 54.5% (95% C.I 50.3, 58.6). On bivariate analysis, SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity lacked statistically significant association with either age, sex, occupation, cumulative duty duration, and smoking status. The incidence of seroconversion in the baseline seronegative cohort on follow-up after 21-28 days was observed in 35 (14.9%) HCWs (n=245). Furthermore, the self-reported adherence to infection prevention and control measures did not show a statistically significant association with antibody positivity in the HCWs, neither at baseline nor on follow-up. Conclusions The high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in HCWs may be substantially reduced by adherence to Infection Prevention Control (IPC) and protective measures.","output":"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and Risk Assessment Among Healthcare Workers at a Dedicated Tertiary Care COVID-19 Hospital in Delhi, India: A Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) constitute a vulnerable population in view of their impaired immune status. At this time, the full interaction between HIV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been incompletely described. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection on mortality. METHOD: We systematically searched PubMed and the Europe PMC databases up to 19 January 2021, using specific keywords related to our aims. All published articles on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and HIV were retrieved. The quality of the studies was evaluated using the NewcastleCOttawa Scale for observational studies. Statistical analysis was performed with Review Manager version 5.4 and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3 software. RESULTS: A total of 28 studies including 18 255 040 COVID-19 patients were assessed in this meta-analysis. Overall, HIV was associated with a higher mortality from COVID-19 on random-effects modelling {odds ratio [OR] = 1.19 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01C1.39], p = 0.03; I(2) = 72%}. Meta-regression confirmed that this association was not influenced by age (p = 0.208), CD4 cell count (p = 0.353) or the presence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (p = 0.647). Further subgroup analysis indicated that the association was only statistically significant in studies from Africa (OR = 1.13, p = 0.004) and the United States (OR = 1.30, p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Whilst all persons ought to receive a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, PLWH should be prioritised to minimise the risk of death because of COVID-19.

METHODS: Chest CT of 34 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by the nucleic acid test (NAT) were retrospectively analyzed. Analyses were performed to investigate the pathological basis of four imaging features(\\"feather sign\\",\\"dandelion sign\\",\\"pomegranate sign\\", and \\"rime sign\\") and to summarize the follow-up results. RESULTS: There were 22 patients (65.2%) with typical \\"feather sign\\"and 18 (52.9%) with \\"dandelion sign\\", while few patients had \\"pomegranate sign\\" and \\"rime sign\\". The \\"feather sign\\" and \\"dandelion sign\\" were composed of stripe or round ground-glass opacity (GGO), thickened blood vessels, and small-thickened interlobular septa. The \\"pomegranate sign\\" was characterized as follows: the increased range of GGO, the significant thickening of the interlobular septum, complicated with a small amount of punctate alveolar hemorrhage. The \\"rime sign\\" was characterized by numerous alveolar edemas. Microscopically, the wall thickening, small vascular proliferation, luminal stenosis, and occlusion, accompanied by interstitial infiltration of inflammatory cells, as well as numerous pulmonary interstitial fibrosis and partial hyaline degeneration were observed. Repeated chest CT revealed the mediastinal lymphadenectasis in one patient. Re-examination of the NAT showed another positive anal swab in two patients.

We aimed to determine if human platelets express the known SARS-CoV-2 receptor-protease axis on their cell surface and assess whether the anti-platelet effect of aspirin may mitigate risk of myocardial infarction (MI), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19. Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 on human platelets were detected by immunoblotting and confirmed by confocal microscopy. We evaluated 22,072 symptomatic patients tested for COVID-19. Propensity-matched analyses were performed to determine if treatment with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) affected thrombotic outcomes in COVID-19. Neither aspirin nor NSAIDs affected mortality in COVID-19. However, both aspirin and NSAID therapies were associated with increased risk of the combined thrombotic endpoint of (MI), (CVA), and (VTE). Thus, while platelets clearly express ACE2-TMPRSS2 receptor-protease axis for SARS-CoV-2 infection, aspirin does not prevent thrombosis and death in COVID-19.

However, in the United States race and temperature correlate with various other social determinants of health, comorbidities, and environmental influences that could be responsible for noted effects. This study investigates the independent effects of race and environmental temperature on COVID-19 incidence and mortality in United States counties. METHODS: Data on COVID-19 and risk factors in all United States counties was collected. 661 counties with at least 50 COVID-19 cases and 217 with at least 10 deaths were included in analyses. Upper and lower quartiles for cases/100,000 people and halves for deaths/100,000 people were compared with t-tests. Adjusted linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the independent effects of race and environmental temperature. RESULTS: Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated Black race is a risk factor for increased COVID-19 cases (OR=1.22, 95% CI: 1.09-1.40, P=0.001) and deaths independent of comorbidities, poverty, access to health care, and other risk factors. Higher environmental temperature independently reduced caseload (OR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.71-0.91, P=0.0009), but not deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Higher environmental temperatures correlated with reduced COVID-19 cases, but this benefit does not yet appear in mortality models. Black race was an independent risk factor for increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. Thus, many proposed mechanisms through which Black race might increase risk for COVID-19, such as socioeconomic and healthcare-related predispositions, are inadequate in explaining the full magnitude of this health disparity.","output":"Multivariate Analysis of Black Race and Environmental Temperature on COVID-19 In the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A genetically encoded caffeine\\\\operated synthetic module (COSMO) is introduced herein as a robust chemically induced dimerization (CID) system.

However, correct estimation of one's own cardiovascular risk is important as risk unawareness is associated with noncompliance with interventions aimed to reduce risk burden. Knowing the prevalence and factors linked with an increased probability of risk unawareness are therefore important to develop strategies aimed to increase risk awareness. Aims. To study prevalence of risk unawareness and to understand risk markers associated with risk underestimation and overestimation. Design. A total of 1716 participants were enrolled to the study in 33 centers across Turkey. Relevant demographic and clinical data were collected by direct interview. Cardiovascular risk of the participants was calculated using SCORE risk charts. Results. Ten-year risk for a fatal cardiovascular event was calculated as low in 633 (36.8%), intermediate in 513 (29.9%) and high-very high in 570 (33.2%) participants, respectively. According to these findings, 34.6% (n = 593) of the participants estimated their risk correctly, whereas 22.7% (n = 390) of the participants overestimated and 42.7% (n = 733) of the participants underestimated their risk. Male gender was the sole factor that was associated with an increased risk of underestimation, while having hypertension, significant valve disease or atrial fibrillation was associated with increased odds for risk overestimation. Conclusions. Only one-thirds of the sample was aware of their calculated risk for cardiovascular mortality and risk underestimation was the most common mode of risk unawareness, prompting concerns on the possible impact of the latter on adherence to the strategies aimed to reduce cardiovascular risk.","output":"Cardiovascular risk unawareness is common in individuals admitting to cardiology outpatient clinics in Turkey: the CVSCORE-TR study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Development of acquired resistance limits the utility of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) for the treatment of EGFR-mutant lung cancers. There are no accepted targeted therapies for use after acquired resistance develops. Metastasectomy is used in other cancers to manage oligometastatic disease. We hypothesized that local therapy is associated with improved outcomes in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancers with acquired resistance to EGFR TKI. METHODS Patients who received non-central nervous system local therapy were identified by a review of data from a prospective biopsy protocol for patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancers with acquired resistance to EGFR TKI therapy and other institutional biospecimen registry protocols. RESULTS Eighteen patients were identified, who received elective local therapy (surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation, or radiation). Local therapy was well tolerated, with 85% of patients restarting TKI therapy within 1 month of local therapy. The median time to progression after local therapy was 10 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2-27 months). The median time until a subsequent change in systemic therapy was 22 months (95% CI: 6-30 months). The median overall survival from local therapy was 41 months (95% CI: 26-not reached). CONCLUSIONS EGFR-mutant lung cancers with acquired resistance to EGFR TKI therapy are amenable to local therapy to treat oligometastatic disease when used in conjunction with continued EGFR inhibition. Local therapy followed by continued treatment with an EGFR TKI is well tolerated and associated with long PFS and OS.

A surveillance program for healthcare workers (HCWs) that included free in-site medical consultation and RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 was initiated. On 04/28/2020, screening of HCWs was started to detect asymptomatic carriers. We report the results of such programs updated to 05/21/2020. METHODS: Sex, worker category, working area, use of personal protective equipment, date of screening, date of onset of symptoms and home address were retrieved from electronic databases. Logistic regression was done to identify factors associated with being a COVID-19 case or carrier, with p< 0.05 being significant. Odds ratios and incidence densities were calculated. RESULTS: Of 2566 HCWs in the hospital, 976 (38.0%) underwent screening and 41 (4.2%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (7.4 carriers x 10,000 person-days; median follow-up of 55.5 days); none of the latter were diagnosed with COVID-19 after completing a 14-day follow-up. Of HCWs with negative screen results, 6 (0.6%) ultimately developed COVID-19 after a median of 10 days (1.1 cases x 10,000 person-days). Of 232 symptomatic HCWs that did not undergo basal screening, 131 (56.5%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 (8.8 cases x 10,000 person-days). Ten COVID-19 cases (7.6%) were hospitalized and all were discharged without complications after a median hospital stay of 9 days. Factors associated with COVID-19 were working in a non-clinical area (OR=9.3, 95% CI=1.1C78.6) and being a nurse (OR=1.9, 95% CI=1.1C3.4). Factors associated with being a carrier were living in the State of Mexico (OR=3.7, 95% CI=1.8C8.0) and being a hospital cook (OR=3.7, 95% CI=1.7C8.5). Being a physician was associated with not being a carrier (OR=0.07, 95% CI=0.01C0.5). Wearing a face mask at all times tended to be associated with not being a carrier.

(2) Determine the impact of tracheostomy on mechanical ventilation duration, overall length of stay (LOS), and intensive care unit (ICU) LOS for patients with COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: Case series with planned chart review. SETTING: Single-institution tertiary care center. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 who were 18 years old and requiring invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) met inclusion criteria. Patients were stratified into 2 cohorts: IPPV with tracheostomy and IPPV with intubation only. Cohorts were analyzed for the following primary outcome measures: mortality, LOS, ICU LOS, and IPPV duration. RESULTS: An overall 258 patients with IPPV met inclusion criteria: 46 (18%) with tracheostomy and 212 (82%) without (66% male; median age, 63 years [interquartile range, 18.75]). Average LOS, time in ICU, and time receiving IPPV were longer in the tracheostomy cohort (P < .01). Ability to wean from IPPV was similar between cohorts (P > .05). The number of deaths in the nontracheostomy cohort (54%) was significantly higher than the tracheostomy cohort (29%, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: While tracheostomy placement in patients with COVID-19 did not shorten overall LOS, mechanical ventilation duration, or ICU LOS, patients with a tracheostomy experienced a significantly lower number of deaths vs those without. One goal for tracheostomy is improved pulmonary toilet with associated shortened IPPV requirements. Our study did not identify this advantage among the COVID-19 population. However, this study demonstrates that the need for tracheostomy in the COVID-19 setting does not portent a poor prognostic factor, as patients with a tracheostomy experienced a significantly higher survival rate than their nontracheostomy counterparts.","output":"COVID-19 Tracheostomy Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O Informe Dirio de Evidncias  uma produ??o do Ministrio da Sade que tem como objetivo acompanhar diariamente as publica??es cientficas sobre tratamento farmacolgico e vacinas para a COVID-19 Dessa forma, s?o realizadas buscas estruturadas em bases de dados biomdicas, referentes ao dia anterior desse informe N?o s?o includos estudos pr-clnicos (in vitro, in vivo, in silico) A frequncia dos estudos  demonstrada de acordo com a sua classifica??o metodolgica (revis?es sistemticas, ensaios clnicos randomizados, coortes, entre outros) Para cada estudo  apresentado um resumo com avalia??o da qualidade metodolgica Essa avalia??o tem por finalidade identificar o grau de certeza/confian?a ou o risco de vis de cada estudo Para tal, s?o utilizadas ferramentas j validadas e consagradas na literatura cientfica, na rea de sade baseada em evidncias Cabe ressaltar que o documento tem carter informativo e n?o representa uma recomenda??o oficial do Ministrio da Sade sobre a temtica Foram encontrados 20 artigos e 16 protocolos","output":"Informe dirio de evidncias COVID-19: busca realizada em 10 de julho de 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We use German KiGGS data to add to existing knowledge about trends in vaccination-related attitudes and behavior.

We further analyze how these attitudes relate to vaccination rates in the corresponding birth cohorts, and which sociodemographic subgroups are more likely to have vaccination-hesitant attitudes and to act upon them. Results show that the share of parents who report deliberate reasons against vaccination has decreased across birth cohorts; at the same time, the children of these parents have become less likely to be vaccinated. This suggests that vaccination-hesitant parents became more willing to act upon their beliefs towards the turn of the millennium. Regarding efforts to convince parents and the public about the benefits of vaccination, the number of parents who think that vaccinations have serious side effects, or that it is better for a child to live through a disease, may have become smallerbut these parents are more determined to follow their convictions.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From the March 1 to April 26, 2020, major urologic surgeries were drastically reduced at our tertiary-care referral hospital. In order to evaluate health-related quality-of-life outcomes, the SF-36 questionnaire was sent to all patients scheduled for major surgery at our department 3 weeks after the cancellation of the planned surgical procedures because of the COVID-19 emergency. RESULTS: All patients included in the analysis had been awaiting surgery for a median (interquartile range) time of 52.85 (35-72) days. The SF-36 questionnaire measured 8 domains: physical functioning (PF), role limitations due to physical health (PH), role limitations due to emotional problems (RE), energy/fatigue (EF), emotional well-being (EWB), social functioning (SF), bodily pain (BP), general health perceptions (GHP). When considering physical characteristics as measured by the SF-36 questionnaire, PF was 91.5 (50-100) and PH was 82.75 (50-100) with a BP of 79.56 (45-90). For emotional and social aspects, RE was 36.83 (0-100) with a SF of 37.98 (12.5-90). Most patients reported loss of energy (EF 35.28 [15-55]) and increased anxiety (EWB 47.18 [interquartile range, 20-75]). All patients perceived a reduction of their health conditions, with GHP of 49.47 (15-85). Generally, 86% of patients (n = 43) noted an almost intact physical function but a significant emotional alteration characterized by a prevalence of anxiety and loss of energy.

Acknowledging the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to mutate into distinct strains as an RNA virus and investigating its potential to cause reinfection is important for future health policy guidelines. It was thought that individuals who recovered from COVID-19 generate a robust immune response and develop protective immunity; however, since the first case of documented reinfection of COVID-19 in August 2020, there have been a number of cases with reinfection. Many cases are lacking genomic data of the two infections, and it remains unclear whether they were caused by different strains. In the present study, we undertook a rapid systematic review to identify cases infected with different genetic strains of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by PCR and viral genome sequencing. A total of 17 cases of genetically confirmed COVID-19 reinfection were found. One immunocompromised patient had mild symptoms with the first infection but developed severe symptoms resulting in death with the second infection. Overall, 68.8% (11/16) had similar severity; 18.8% (3/16) had worse symptoms; and 12.5% (2/16) had milder symptoms with the second episode. Our case series shows that reinfection with different strains is possible, and some cases may experience more severe infections with the second episode.

It is characterized by airway and respiratory problems, cardiovascular collapse, mucosal inflammation, and other complications, all severe symptoms that can cause death. IgE-dependent anaphylaxis involves mast cells (MCs) which are the main sources of biologically active mediators that contribute to the pathological and lethal phenomena that can occur in anaphylaxis. Antibody-mediated anaphylaxis can follow multiple pathways such as that mediated by MCs carrying the FcRI receptor, which can be activated by very small amounts of antigen including a vaccine antigen and trigger an anaphylactic reaction. In addition, anaphylaxis can also be provoked by high concentrations of IgG antibodies that bind to the FcR receptor present on basophils, neutrophils, macrophages and MCs. For this reason, the IgG concentration should be kept under control in vaccinations. Activation of MCs is a major cause of anaphylaxis, which requires immediate treatment with epinephrine to arrest severe lethal symptoms. MCs are activated through the antigen binding and cross-linking of IgE with release of mediators such as histamine, proteases, prostaglandins, leukotrienes and inflammatory cytokines. The release of these compounds causes nausea, vomiting, hives, wheezing, flushing, tachycardia, hypotension, laryngeal edema, and cardiovascular collapse. mRNA and viral vector vaccines have been cleared by the United States, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), generating hope of prevention and cure for COVID-19 around the world. Scientists advise against giving the vaccine to individuals who have had a previous history of anaphylaxis. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises people with a previous history of any immediate allergic reaction to remain under observation for approximately 30 minutes after COVID-19 vaccination. To date, vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection have not raised major concerns of severe allergic reactions, although, in some cases, pain and redness at the injection site and fever have occurred after administration of the vaccine. These reactions occur in the first 24-48 hours after vaccination. It has been reported that probable forms of anaphylaxis could also occur, especially in women approximately 40 years of age. But after tens of millions of vaccinations, only a few patients had this severe reaction with a low incidence. Anaphylactic and severe allergic reactions can also occur to any component of the vaccine including polysorbates and polyethylene glycol. To date, there is no precise information on allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines. Individuals with MCs and complement with higher activation than others may be at greater allergic risk. Moreover, the reactions called anaphylactoids, are those not mediated by IgE because they do not involve this antibody and can also occur in COVID-19 vaccination. These not-IgE-mediated reactions occur through direct activation of MCs and complement with tryptase production, but to a lesser extent than IgE-mediated anaphylaxis. However, at the moment it is not known exactly which component of the vaccine causes the allergic reaction and which vaccine causes the most side effects, including anaphylaxis. Thus, individuals who have a known allergy to any component of the vaccine should not be vaccinated. However, should an anaphylactic reaction occur, this requires immediate treatment with epinephrine to arrest severe lethal symptoms. In conclusion, the purpose of this editorial is to encourage the population to be vaccinated in order to extinguish this global pandemic that is afflicting the world population, and to reassure individuals that anaphylactic reactions do not occur with a higher incidence than other vaccinations.","output":"Anaphylaxis is a rare reaction in COVID-19 vaccination."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed deficiencies in the adequacy of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers. Endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery is thought to be among the highest-risk aerosol-generating procedures for surgeons and operating room personnel. OBJECTIVE: To validate the efficacy and clinical feasibility of a novel surgical device. METHODS: A low-cost, modifiable, and easily producible negative pressure, face-mounted antechamber was developed utilizing 3D printing and silicone molding. Efficacy was evaluated using an optical particle sizer to quantify aerosols generated during both cadaver and intraoperative human use with high-speed drilling. RESULTS: Particle counts in the cadaver showed that drilling led to a 2.49-fold increase in particles 0.3 to 5 m (P = .001) and that the chamber was effective at reducing particles to levels not significantly different than baseline. In humans, drilling led to a 37-fold increase in particles 0.3 to 5 m (P < .001), and the chamber was effective at reducing particles to a level not significantly different than baseline. Use of the antechamber in 6 complex cases did not interfere with the ability to perform surgery. Patients did not report any facial discomfort after surgery related to antechamber use. CONCLUSION: The use of a negative pressure facial antechamber can effectively reduce aerosolization from endoscopic drilling without disturbing the flow of the operation.

Internet search volume is a useful data that can sensitively detect trends of public's attention in a situation of a pandemic outbreak. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to identify the interest and correlation between the proliferation of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), interest in immunity and products that have been discussed to confer an enhancement of immunity, while suggesting the measures of intervention to be undertaken from a health and medical point of view. METHODS: To assess the level of public interest in infectious disease during the initial days of the outbreak of COVID-19, we extracted Google search data from the past year based on the date of 15th of March 2020, which is approximately two months after the COVID-19 outbreak. In order to determine whether the public became interested in the immune system, we selected 'coronavirus', 'immune', 'vitamin' as our final search term. RESULTS: The increase in cumulative confirmed cases of coronavirus after January 20 had a strong positive correlation with search volumes for the terms 'coronavirus' (R = 0.786, P < .0001), 'immune' (R = 0.745, P < .0001) and 'vitamin' (R = 0.778, P < .0001), and the variables were all mutually statistically significant. Moreover, these correlations were confirmed on a country-basis when we restricted analyses to the US, the UK, Italy, and Korea. Our findings revealed that increases in search volumes for 'coronavirus' and 'immune' preceded the actual occurrences of confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our study implicates that during the initial phase of the COVID-19 crisis, the public's desire and actions to strengthen their own immune systems were enhanced. Further, in the early stage of a pandemic there is a high potential of social media to inform the public about potentially helpful measures to prevent the spread of an infectious disease and provide relevant information about immunity and thereby increase the knowledge.","output":"Public interest in immunity: justification for intervention in the early stages of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that nationwide social distancing and other preventive measures for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were associated with reduced detection of other respiratory viruses in South Korea. METHODS: We analyzed national surveillance data to compare incidence of respiratory viruses during 2016-2019 vs. 2020. Results of multiplex reverse transcriptaseCpolymerase chain reaction assays for eight respiratory viruses were included: adenovirus (ADV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (IFV), human coronavirus (HCoV; non-SARS-CoV-2), human rhinovirus (HRV), human bocavirus (HBoV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). RESULTS: During 2016-2019, rates of detection of respiratory viruses were relatively stable: ADV, 3.7%-9.2%; PIV, 1.4%-17.0%; RSV, 0.3%-15.3%; IFV, 0.4%-35.6%; HCoV, 1.5%-8.4%; HRV, 7.0%-25.1%; HBoV, 0.6%-6.3%; and HMPV, 0.7%-14.5%. Following implementation of social distancing in February 2020, rates of detection of enveloped viruses (HCoV, HMPV, IFV, PIV and RSV) were significantly reduced by up to 100%. However, non-enveloped viruses (ADV, HRV and HBoV) persisted throughout 2020, and HRV rates in hospitalized patients significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS: After implementation of social distancing for SARS-CoV-2 in South Korea, rates of detection of enveloped respiratory viruses decreased significantly, whereas non-enveloped viruses persisted, suggesting that enhanced infection prevention strategies are required to mitigate spread of these viruses.","output":"Shifting patterns of respiratory virus activity following social distancing measures for COVID-19 in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is one of the most terrifying diabetic complications for patients, due to the high mortality rate and risk for amputation.

The current diagnostic criteria appear inadequate, and the early diagnosis frequently remains challenging with high risk of coronary damage. This review focuses on recent data concerning Kawasaki disease etiology and pathogenesis, and emphasizes the proposal of including altered laboratory values in revised diagnostic criteria aimed at identifying patients with incomplete disease. RECENT FINDINGS Despite a timely treatment, approximately 15% of children have persistent or recurrent fever, thus requiring additional intravenous immunoglobulin, corticosteroids, immunosuppressant, and eventually biologic drugs. Recent cardiologic tests strongly suggest that endothelial damage may lead to coronary stenosis and myocardial ischemia over time, even in children apparently normal at initial cardiac evaluation. New noninvasive tools are suggested to monitor coronary artery aneurysm outcome. Giant coronary artery aneurysms still represent a severe life-threatening complication. There is as yet no agreement regarding the prevention of thrombosis and stenosis in children with giant aneurysms. SUMMARY Due to earlier recognition, aggressive medical treatment, and surgical procedures, the quality of life in patients with Kawasaki disease is significantly improved. The identification of children at high risk for coronary artery aneurysms is crucial in order to reduce the occurrence of sudden death in adolescence and early adulthood. High parameters of inflammation, anemia, and low sodium and albumin levels, along with persistent unexplained fever, should alert clinicians to suspect the disease even though all clinical symptoms are lacking.","output":"Kawasaki disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To explore the relationship between intrauterine device (IUD) use and risk of ovarian cancer through systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis.

There are several cardiac manifestations of TA and an association with Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) C but not coronary vasospasm - has been previously reported. The role of emotional stress in this context is unknown. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old Caucasian female elementary school teacher, with a history of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), severe asymptomatic aortic regurgitation (AR), and TA in remission under corticosteroids, was admitted in the emergency department with worsening chest pain and dyspnea, initiated after a period of intense emotional stress (increased workload during COVID-19 pandemic). Physical examination revealed signs of heart failure (HF) with hemodynamic stability and an early diastolic heart murmur. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, T wave inversion in left precordial and lateral leads, and a corrected QT of 487 ms. Laboratorial evaluation presented high values of high-sensitivity troponin I (3494 ng/L) and B-type natriuretic peptide (4759 pg/mL). The transthoracic echocardiogram revealed severe dilation of left ventricle (LV) with moderate systolic dysfunction, due to apical and midventricular akinesia, and severe AR. The coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries. An acetylcholine provocative test induced spasm of both the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries, accompanied by chest pain and ST depression, completely reverted after intracoronary nitrates administration. The patient was switched to diltiazem and a drug multitherapy for HF was started. A cardiac magnetic resonance revealed severe dilation of the LV, mild apical hypokinesia, improvement of ejection fraction to 53%, signs of myocardial edema and increased extracellular volume in apical and mid-ventricular anterior and anterolateral walls, and absence of myocardial late gadolinium enhancement, compatible with TTS. At discharge, the patient was clinically stable, without signs of HF, and a progressive reduction of troponin and BNP levels was observed. A final diagnosis of TTS and coronary vasospasm in a patient with GAD and TA was done. DISCUSSION: We present the first case of acute HF showing coexistence of TA, TTS and coronary vasospasm. TA is a rare inflammatory disease that can be associated with TTS and coronary vasospasm. Besides that, coronary vasospasm may also be involved in TTS pathophysiology, suggesting a complex interplay between these diseases. Mood disorders and anxiety influence the response to stress, through a gain of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and an increased cardiovascular system sensitivity to catecholamines. Therefore, although the mechanisms behind these three pathologies are not yet fully studied, this case supports the role of inflammatory and psychiatric diseases in TTS and coronary vasospasm.","output":"Case Report: Acute Heart Failure Induced by the Combination of Takayasu's, Takotsubo and Coronary Vasospasm in an Elementary School TeacherCA Reaction to Return-to-Work Stress After COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Demands, resources, and work engagement of nurses during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic - A cross-sectional study Abstract. Background: Nurses are assigned a key role in managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Of particular importance is their work engagement, depending on job demands and resources. So far, there have only been scattered and first-wave related indications of nurses' job demands, resources and work engagement in Germany during the pandemic. Aim: To systematically assess key job demands, key job resources and work engagement of nursing staff for the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, also differentiating between various groups of nurses. Method: The study was realized in a cross-sectional design and included nurses in direct health care settings in Germany. Data was collected with an online questionnaire using valid and reliable measures during the second wave of the pandemic. The dataset for analyses comprised 1027 cases in total. Results: Regarding demands, work overload was even higher than before the pandemic, but work-life interferences were less pronounced. Nurses' resource architecture was not fundamentally changed by the pandemic, but interpersonal relationships and autonomy were rated more positively. Domiciliary care workers assessed demands and resources more positively than nurses in nursing homes or hospitals, whereas nurses caring for COVID-19 patients evaluated demands and resources more critically. Nurses' work engagement was higher during the second pandemic wave than in the first wave, but still low overall. Conclusions: Due to the importance of work engagement for nurses' health and performance and thus the quality of care, demands and resources must be further improved. Starting points are, e. g., fostering team cohesion, strengthening autonomy, and managing workload.","output":"Anforderungen, Ressourcen und Arbeitsengagement Pflegender w?hrend der zweiten Welle der COVID-19-Pandemie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chlamydia pecorum (designated 22C58) was isolated in 2010 in HmLu-1 cells from the jejunum of a calf which died of necrotizing enterocolitis in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan.

To support patient management and capacity planning in hospitals, we estimated the length of stay (LoS) in hospital and odds of intensive care (ICU) admission and in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients []18 years who had been vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine, compared to unvaccinated patients. Methods Using national registry data, we conducted a cohort study on SARS-CoV-2 positive patients hospitalised in Norway between 1 February and 30 September 2021, with COVID-19 as the main cause of hospitalisation. We used a Cox proportional hazards model to examine the association between vaccination status and LoS. We used logistic regression to examine the association between vaccination status and ICU admission and in-hospital mortality. Results We included 2,361 patients, including 70 (3%) partially vaccinated and 183 (8%) fully vaccinated. Fully vaccinated patients 18-79 years had a shorter LoS in hospital overall (adjusted hazard ratio for discharge: 1.35, 95%CI: 1.07-1.72), and lower odds of ICU admission (adjusted odds ratio: 0.57, 95%CI: 0.33-0.96). Similar estimates were observed when collectively analysing partially and fully vaccinated patients. We observed no difference in the LoS for patients not admitted to ICU, nor odds of in-hospital death between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Conclusions Vaccinated patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in Norway have a shorter LoS and lower odds of ICU admission than unvaccinated patients.

DESIGN: A retrospective observational study. SETTING: Two medical centers in Taiwan. PATIENTS: Forty-four patients with SARS who received ribavirin and 7 patients with SARS who did not receive ribavirin. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The mean peak C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels were higher in SARS patients who were receiving ribavirin therapy than in SARS patients who were not receiving ribavirin therapy. The mortality was also higher, but the difference was not statistically significant. On multivariate analysis, hemoglobin level was an independent prognostic correlate of hypoxemia or mortality (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.8; p = 0.03). The hemoglobin began decreasing in two thirds of SARS patients (32 of 44 patients; 73%) who were receiving ribavirin 3 days after therapy with the antiviral drug was started. Patients with a drop in hemoglobin level of > 2 g/dL had a significantly higher mortality rate than the other patients. Hypoxemia developed in one third of SARS patients (17 of 44 patients; 39%) who were receiving ribavirin, all of whom were anemic. Of the 17 hypoxemic patients, 11 (65%) had a drop in hemoglobin of > 2 g/dL, and 4 patients (24%) required a blood transfusion. The mean slope of the hemoglobin decrease was significantly steeper (p = 0.001) in hypoxemic patients with SARS who were receiving ribavirin than in the nonhypoxemic patients with SARS who were receiving ribavirin. Only one of seven SARS patients (14%) who was not receiving ribavirin became anemic, but this individual was not hypoxemic. Eventually, 5 of 17 hypoxemic and anemic SARS patients (29%) who were receiving ribavirin died. The combination of hypoxia with anemia was thus significantly associated with a higher mortality (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxia combined with anemia increased the risk for death in SARS patients.

We analysed qualitative free-text data from two independent UK-wide online surveys to describe in depth the experiences of 881 people bereaved during the Covid-19 pandemic using. We analysed the data in two phases, conducting an inductive thematic analysis and then applying Stroebe and Schut Dual Process Model (DPM) (1999; 2010) as an analytic lens to further contextualise and interpret the data. The DPM identifies loss-oriented and restoration-oriented coping processes between which grieving people naturally oscillate. Loss-oriented coping involves coming to terms with the death and lost relationship, while restoration-oriented coping involves adapting to new ways of life. We identified six main themes: troubled deaths (guilt, anger and unanswered questions); mourning, memorialisation and death administration; mass bereavement, the media and the ongoing threat of the pandemic; grieving and coping (alone and with others); work and employment; and support from the health and social care system. Examples of loss-oriented stressors included being unable to visit or say goodbye, the sudden and traumatic nature of many deaths, and restricted funeral and memorialisation practices. Associated reactions were feelings of guilt and anger, and problems accepting the death and starting to grieve. Examples of restoration-oriented stressors and reactions were stressful death-related administration and severely curtailed social networks, support systems and social/recreational activities, which impacted peoples ability to cope. Study results demonstrate the exceptionally difficult sets of experiences associated with pandemic bereavement, and the utility of the DPM for conceptualizing these additional challenges and their impacts on grieving. Our analysis builds and expands on previous use of the DPM (Stroebe and Schut, 2021) in explicating the impact of the pandemic on bereavement.

There is concern a proportion of patients will progress to develop pulmonary fibrosis. We aimed to assess the temporal change in CXR infiltrates in a cohort of patients following hospitalisation for COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a single-centre prospective cohort study of patients admitted to University Hospital Southampton with confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection between 20th March and 3rd June 2020. Patients were approached for standard-of-care follow-up 12-weeks after hospitalisation. Inpatient and follow-up CXRs were scored by the assessing clinician for extent of pulmonary infiltrates; 0C4 per lung (Nil = 0, < 25% = 1, 25C50% = 2, 51C75% = 3, > 75% = 4). RESULTS: 101 patients with paired CXRs were included. Demographics: 53% male with a median (IQR) age 53.0 (45C63) years and length of stay 9 (5C17.5) days. The median CXR follow-up interval was 82 (77C86) days with median baseline and follow-up CXR scores of 4.0 (3C5) and 0.0 (0C1) respectively. 32% of patients had persistent CXR abnormality at 12-weeks. In multivariate analysis length of stay (LOS), smoking-status and obesity were identified as independent risk factors for persistent CXR abnormality. Serum LDH was significantly higher at baseline and at follow-up in patients with CXR abnormalities compared to those with resolution. A 5-point composite risk score (1-point each; LOS  15 days, Level 2/3 admission, LDH > 750 U/L, obesity and smoking-status) strongly predicted risk of persistent radiograph abnormality (0.81).

The spread of COVID-19 has become unstoppable, infecting around 93.5 million people worldwide, with the infections and deaths still increasing. Today, the entire planet has changed due to the greatest threat on the planet since the introduction of this lethal disease. This pandemic has left the world in turmoil and various measures have been taken by many countries including movement control order or lockdown, to slow down or mitigate the infection. Since the lockdown has been implemented almost in all affected countries, there has been a significant reduction in anthropogenic activity, including a reduction in industrial operations, vehicle numbers, and marine-related activities. All of these changes have also led to some unexpected environmental consequences.

However, its preparation process is complex and time-consuming. Herein, we fabricated an innovative hydrophilic rhodamine B-loaded / boronic acid-modified graphene oxide (HRBGO) nanocomposite, used as a substitute of enzyme-labeled second antibody. The synthetic HRBGO was loaded with generous rhodamine B and modified with boronic acid. Therefore, the HRBGO could selectively label the carbohydrate chains of Fc fragment of primary antibody through specific boronate affinity recognition, and then perform signal output and amplification by releasing rhodamine B. To verify the practicability of HRBGO, trastuzumab as a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) was selected as model antibody. A glycosylation site-blocked / HER2-immobilized magnetic nanoparticles (GHMN) was also prepared for selectively capturing trastuzumab from complex samples via specific immunoaffinity. Because the glycosylation sites of HER2 can also be labeled with the HRBGO by boronate affinity recognition, these sites were blocked by a masking agent to minimize the background signal. For specific and ultrasensitive detection of trastuzumab, the integration of GHMN and HRBGO was proposed and optimized in detail. Trastuzumab detection based on HRBGO consisted of three steps: specific capture, selective labeling, and output signal. The proposed strategy provided ultrahigh sensitivity with limit of detection of 0.35 fg mL-1 and was successfully applied in the detection of trastuzumab in spiked serum sample with recovery and relative standard deviation in the range of 98.7-103.8% and 3.8-6.0%, respectively.

The primary etiology of myocarditis is a viral infection, with studies demonstrating that infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can lead to myocarditis. This enzyme is involved in many body tissues, including the gastrointestinal system and the cardiac system. This enzyme is responsible for converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the renin-angiotensin system of our body. This review aims to characterize the symptomatology and comorbidities of males, females, and pediatric patients who developed the SARS-CoV-2-related myocarditis (SARS-CoV-2RM) or the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-related myocarditis (SARS-CoV-2VRM). From July 10 to July 20, 2021, a PubMed database search for SARS CoV-2 Related Myocarditis was conducted. From July 21 to July 30, 2021, the search for SARS CoV-2 Vaccine Related Myocarditis was conducted. The search completed was specific for title/abstract fields using keywords Covid-19 AND Myocarditis AND Vaccine and specifying Males or Females, respectively. Inclusion criteria included articles discussing comorbidities and symptomatology. Exclusion criteria included autopsy/postmortem reports, letters to the editor, retrospective studies, and observational studies. In the end, 49 articles were found and included in this review. We found that 27 of 40 pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2RM presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, and 12 of 40 pediatric patients had no comorbidities. In female cases, eight of 12 patients with SARS-CoV-2RM presented with noncardiac symptoms, and only four of 12 had comorbidities such as asthma, diabetes, and obesity. In male patients with SARS-CoV-2RM, 10 of 12 presented with respiratory and/or cardiac symptoms, and seven of 12 had cardiac and/or diabetic comorbidities. Furthermore, 22 of 31 male patients with SARS-CoV-2VRM presented with chest pain with no previous comorbidities; four of six females with SARS-CoV-2VRM presented with chest pain, and three of six females had no comorbidities; and seven of 11 pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2VRM had no comorbidities, but 11 of 11 pediatric patients presented with chest pain. In conclusion, males, females, and pediatric patients with previous SARS-CoV-2VRM showed mostly chest pain with no comorbidities. Males presenting with SARS-CoV-2RM showed mostly respiratory and cardiac symptoms with cardiac and diabetic comorbidities. Females with SARS-CoV-2RM described various symptoms from flu-like, respiratory, to cardiac and had no previous comorbidities. The bulk of pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2RM mainly presented with GI symptoms and no past comorbidities.

OBJECTIVE We assessed the efficacy of combined pre-anaesthetic forced-air warming in combination with warmed intravenous fluid infusion for preventing hypothermia and shivering during caesarean delivery under spinal anaesthesia. DESIGN A randomised controlled study. SETTING A tertiary care teaching hospital from July 2017 to April 2018. PATIENTS A total of 50 pregnant women, American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status 2, aged 20 to 45 years, scheduled for caesarean delivery under spinal anaesthesia. INTERVENTION Patients were enrolled and randomised into two groups: an active warming group (n = 25), which received combined pre-anaesthetic whole body forced-air warming for 15 min and prewarmed intravenous fluids, and a control group, which received no active warming or warmed fluids (C group; n = 25). Spinal anaesthesia was induced with 10 mg bupivacaine containing fentanyl (10 g). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Tympanic membrane temperature and shivering severity were measured at baseline and every 10 min during surgery, and then every 10 min for 1 h postoperatively. Neonatal outcomes (tympanic membrane temperature at birth, umbilical venous blood pH, Apgar score) were also recorded. RESULTS The incidences of peri-operative hypothermia (0 vs. 48%, P < 0.001) and shivering (22 vs. 52%, P = 0.031) were significantly lower in the active warming than in the C group. The maximum temperature change was also significantly lower in the active warming than in the C group. Maternal thermal comfort scores were higher in the active warming than in the C group. Neonatal parameters were not significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSION The combination of pre-anaesthetic forced-air warming and warmed intravenous fluid infusions appears to be effective for preventing hypothermia and shivering during caesarean delivery under spinal anaesthesia.

We aimed to assess the clinical effect of corticosteroids on intensive care unit (ICU) mortality among mechanically ventilated COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of prospectively collected data conducted in 70 ICUs (68 Spanish, one Andorran, one Irish), including mechanically ventilated COVID-19-associated ARDS patients admitted between February 6 and September 20, 2020. Individuals who received corticosteroids for refractory shock were excluded. Patients exposed to corticosteroids at admission were matched with patients without corticosteroids through propensity score matching. Primary outcome was all-cause ICU mortality. Secondary outcomes were to compare in-hospital mortality, ventilator-free days at 28 days, respiratory superinfection and length of stay between patients with corticosteroids and those without corticosteroids. We performed survival analysis accounting for competing risks and subgroup sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: We included 1835 mechanically ventilated COVID-19-associated ARDS, of whom 1117 (60.9%) received corticosteroids. After propensity score matching, ICU mortality did not differ between patients treated with corticosteroids and untreated patients (33.8% vs. 30.9%; p = 0.28). In survival analysis, corticosteroid treatment at ICU admission was associated with short-term survival benefit (HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.39C0.72), although beyond the 17th day of admission, this effect switched and there was an increased ICU mortality (long-term HR 1.68; 95% CI 1.16C2.45). The sensitivity analysis reinforced the results. Subgroups of age < 60 years, severe ARDS and corticosteroids plus tocilizumab could have greatest benefit from corticosteroids as short-term decreased ICU mortality without long-term negative effects were observed. Larger length of stay was observed with corticosteroids among non-survivors both in the ICU and in hospital. There were no significant differences for the remaining secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that corticosteroid treatment for mechanically ventilated COVID-19-associated ARDS had a biphasic time-dependent effect on ICU mortality. Specific subgroups showed clear effect on improving survival with corticosteroid use. Therefore, further research is required to identify treatment-responsive subgroups among the mechanically ventilated COVID-19-associated ARDS patients.

They were divided into training (70%; n = 496) and validation (30%; n = 213) cohorts. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to develop a risk nomogram model. Concordance index values, calibration plot, decision curve analysis, and the area under the curve (AUC) were examined. RESULTS: PRAEs were found in 226 of 496 patients (45.6%) and 88 of 213 patients (41.3%) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The perioperative risk factors associated with PRAEs were age, obesity, degree of upper respiratory tract infection, premedication, and passive smoking. The risk nomogram model showed good discrimination power, and the AUC generated to predict survival in the training cohort was 0.760 (95% confidence interval, 0.695C0.875).

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is heavily glycosylated and host-derived glycan modifications contribute to the formation of specific immunogenic epitopes, enhance the virus-cell interaction or affect virus transmission. On recombinant viral antigens used as subunit vaccines or for serological assays, distinct glycan structures may enhance the immunogenicity and are recognized by naturally occurring antibodies in human sera. Here, we performed an in vivo glycoengineering approach to produce recombinant variants of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) with blood group antigens in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. SARS-CoV-2 RBD and human glycosyltransferases for the blood group ABH antigen formation were transiently co-expressed in N. benthamiana leaves. Recombinant RBD was purified and the formation of complex N-glycans carrying blood group A antigens was shown by immunoblotting and MS analysis. Binding to the cellular ACE2 receptor and the conformation-dependent CR3022 antibody showed that the RBD glycosylation variants carrying blood group antigens were functional. Analysis of sera from RBD-positive and RBD-negative individuals revealed further that non-infected RBD-negative blood group O individuals have antibodies that strongly bind to RBD modified with blood group A antigen structures. The binding of IgGs derived from sera of non-infected RBD-negative blood group O individuals to blood group A antigens on SARS-CoV-2 RBD suggests that these antibodies could provide some degree of protection from virus infection.","output":"In Planta Production of the Receptor-Binding Domain From SARS-CoV-2 With Human Blood Group A Glycan Structures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of the study was to find the effectiveness of contract tracing and containment measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study used a gradient boosting algorithm to evaluate risk of COVID-19 infection (ie, presence of at least 1 confirmed COVID-19 resident) in NHs. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The model was trained on outcomes from 1146 NHs in Massachusetts, Georgia, and New Jersey, reporting COVID-19 case data on April 20, 2020. Risk indices generated from the model using data from May 4 were prospectively validated against outcomes reported on May 11 from 1021 NHs in California. METHODS: Model features, pertaining to facility and community characteristics, were obtained from a self-constructed dataset based on multiple public and private sources. The model was assessed via out-of-sample area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity in the training (via 10-fold cross-validation) and validation datasets. RESULTS: The mean AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the model over 10-fold cross-validation were 0.729 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.690a??0.767], 0.670 (95% CI 0.477a??0.862), and 0.611 (95% CI 0.412a??0.809), respectively. Prospective out-of-sample validation yielded similar performance measures (AUC 0.721; sensitivity 0.622; specificity 0.713). The strongest predictors of COVID-19 infection were identified as the NH's county's infection rate and the number of separate units in the NH; other predictors included the county's population density, historical Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services cited health deficiencies, and the NH's resident density (in persons per 1000 square feet). In addition, the NH's historical percentage of non-Hispanic white residents was identified as a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: A machine-learning model can help quantify and predict NH infection risk.

Methods: In this single-center retrospective analysis, we studied the outcomes of 72 patients who underwent surgery for pHPT. We evaluated two groups: those with cinacalcet therapy before operationthe cinacalcet group (CG)and those without medical therapy preoperatively (non-CG). In order to perform a between-group comparison of time trends, we fit a linear mixed-effects model with PTH as the response variable and predictors PTH levels preoperatively, group (cinacalcet yes/no), time, the group-by-time interaction, and a random intercept (per subject). Results: Our cohort included 51 (71%) women and 21 (29%) men, who were operated upon for pHPT in the period from January 2018 until August 2021. All patients were diagnosed with pHPT and 54% of the cohort were symptomatic for hypercalcemia. Moreover, 30% of the patients were treated with cinacalcet as a bridging therapy preoperatively, and this increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, as 64% of this group were treated in the last two years. Calcium values were significantly different before (p < 0.001) and after (p = 0.0089) surgery, but calcium level change did not differ significantly between the CG and non-CG. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels dropped significantly in both groups during 10 min IOPTH monitoring (p < 0.001), but there was no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.212).

Cerebrospinal fluid leaks from congenital and spontaneous encephaloceles can be clinically occult and have devastating consequences if undetected for prolonged periods of time. This report highlights a unique case of meningitis after CSF leak caused by ruptured congenital meningocele during a routine nasopharyngeal swab. CASE REPORT: A 54-year-old female with diagnosed CSF leak presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute onset of severe headache, and neck and back pain. Prior to this presentation, the patient had experienced two months of persistent headache and rhinorrhea since her coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) nasopharyngeal swab. As part of her outpatient workup, an otolaryngology consultation with subsequent beta-2 transferrin testing and magnetic resonance imaging was performed and she was diagnosed with a CSF leak from ruptured congenital meningocele. On ED presentation, she was afebrile, but with mild tachycardia, leukocytosis, and meningismus. Lumbar puncture revealed acute streptococcal meningitis. This patients meningitis developed due to prolonged occult CSF leak after her COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab ruptured a pre-existing congenital meningocele. CONCLUSION: Nasopharyngeal swabs are being performed much more frequently due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All front-line providers should be aware of the potential presence and rupture of congenital meningoceles in patients who have undergone recent nasopharyngeal swab when risk-stratifying for potential CSF leak and meningitis.","output":"Case Report: An Intracranial Complication of COVID-19 Nasopharyngeal Swab"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the onset of the COVID-19's global spread we have been following the debate around contact tracing apps -- the tech-enabled response to the pandemic. As corporations, academics, governments, and civil society discuss the right way to implement these apps, we noticed recurring implicit assumptions. The proposed solutions are designed for a world where Internet access and smartphone ownership are a given, people are willing and able to install these apps, and those who receive notifications about potential exposure to the virus have access to testing and can isolate safely. In this work we challenge these assumptions. We not only show that there are not enough smartphones worldwide to reach required adoption thresholds but also highlight a broad lack of internet access, which affects certain groups more: the elderly, those with lower incomes, and those with limited ability to socially distance. Unfortunately, these are also the groups that are at the highest risks from COVID-19. We also report that the contact tracing apps that are already deployed on an opt-in basis show disappointing adoption levels. We warn about the potential consequences of over-extending the existing state and corporate surveillance powers. Finally, we describe a multitude of scenarios where contact tracing apps will not help regardless of access or policy.

However, data about the consistent performance of RT-PCR assay on throat and anal swabs remain limited in paediatric patients. Here, we retrospectively reviewed RT-PCR-testing results of 212 paediatric patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at Wuhan Children's Hospital. The diagnostic potential of these two types of specimens showed significant difference (positive rate: 78.2% on throat swabs vs. 52.6% on anal swabs, McNemar Test P = 0.0091) and exhibited a weak positive consistency (Kappa value was 0.311, P < 0.0001) in paediatric patients.

The objective of this study was to investigate patterns in symptomatology and COVID-19 outcomes by race/ethnicity among adults in Arkansas. Data on COVID-19 symptoms was collected at day of testing, 7th day and 14th day among participants at UAMS mobile testing units throughout the state of Arkansas. Diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed via nasopharyngeal swab and RT-PCR methods. Data analysis was conducted using Chi-square test and Poisson regression to assess the differences in characteristics by race/ethnicity. A total of 60,648 individuals were RT-PCR tested from March 29, 2020 through October 7, 2020. Among adults testing positive, except shortness of breath, Hispanics were more likely to report all symptoms than NH-whites or NH-blacks. NH-whites were more likely to report fever (19.6% vs. 16.6%), cough (27.5% vs. 26.1%), shortness of breath (13.6% vs. 9.6%), sore throat (16.7% vs. 10.7%), chills (12.5% vs. 11.8%), muscle pain (15.6% vs. 12.4%), and headache (20.3% vs. 17.8%). NH-blacks were more likely to report loss of taste/smell (10.9% vs. 10.6%). To conclude, we found differences in COVID-19 symptoms by race/ethnicity, with NH-blacks and Hispanics more often affected with specific or all symptoms, compared to NH-whites. Due to the cross-sectional study design, these findings do not necessarily reflect biological differences by race/ethnicity; however, they suggest that certain race/ethnicities may have underlying differences in health status that impact COVID-19 outcomes.","output":"Racial Disparities in Symptomatology and Outcomes of COVID-19 among Adults of Arkansas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fake news, viruses on computer systems or infectious diseases on communities are some of the problems that are addressed by researchers dedicated to study complex networks.

Local teaching was impacted upon by social distancing, rota redesign, redeployment and home working, and was completely paused in many units.ObjectivesAcknowledging the potential impact of this on trainees, particularly those in departments with no teaching, or those shielding at home, and keen to facilitate an equitable training experience for all, we formed a novel collaborative pan-region virtual Paediatric teaching network.MethodsDepartments who had established virtual teaching early were offered the opportunity to contribute towards a pan-region virtual education network. A wide range of departments generously shared educational opportunities;mostly held via Zoom. A comprehensive virtual teaching schedule, listing these opportunities, was shared with all trainees every week on our regional trainee website. A total of 100 events (average 6 per week) were included between April - September 2020, covering General Paediatrics, Neonatology, PICU, PEM, Community Paediatrics and sub-specialties, plus trainee wellbeing-related sessions.ResultsFeedback was sought to evaluate the impact of the pan-region virtual teaching network. We received responses from 59 trainees, covering all training grades from ST1 to ST8. In terms of departmental teaching, 50% (n = 29) of trainees reported that teaching within their department had continued throughout the pandemic. However, 15% (n = 9) reported it had only been available for 2C4 weeks, and a further 14% (n = 8) reported no local teaching at any point during the pandemic. Overall, 95% (n = 55) of trainees felt that the virtual education network should continue. Just 5% (n = 3) of trainees felt it should not continue once formal regional teaching restarted, stating reasons such as if it is in addition to regional days, it might feel like you can never have a day off!. Other comments include helps to standardise teaching that trainees receive across the region, good social interaction for shielding trainees, has had a positive impact on my learning, the main benefit is for trainees in smaller units where departmental teaching was reduced or completely stopped during the pandemic C the shared learning is invaluable for those trainees, and virtual teaching has been fantastic and has lessened the impact of COVID-19 on our training.ConclusionsThanks to the generosity of the departments which were able to deliver virtual teaching throughout the pandemic, we were able to create a pan-region collaborative network of enthusiastic Paediatric educators. This meant we were able to share a wide range of excellent virtual teaching opportunities with all trainees in the region, throughout the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Feedback indicates that this initiative reduced the impact of the pandemic on trainee education and had a positive impact on trainee welfare during a challenging time. However, in this new virtual learning environment, where educational opportunities are so readily available, we also recognise the importance of trainees being able to safeguard their downtime. In view of this, we have continued sharing virtual teaching opportunities, but have reduced the number since formal HEE regional teaching restarted.","output":"Zooming in on the silver lining: a collaborative virtual education network formed during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To compare presentation of infectious keratitis during COVID-19 lockdown with previous years, assess relative severity, and compare outcomes between COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 era groups. METHODS: Acute presentations of infectious keratitis during a strict government-mandated COVID-19 lockdown period were analysed retrospectively (MarchCMay 2020). Data were compared with the same periods in 2018-2019. The clinical notes of patients undergoing corneal scrapes were reviewed, and data were collected on treatment, culture growth, surgical interventions, visual outcomes, admission rates, and risk factors. RESULTS: There were 37% fewer presentations of infectious keratitis to the ED in 2020 (N = 29, 47, and 45, respectively). Risk factor profiles and microbial data were similar across all periods. Admission rates and use of fortified antibiotics were lower in 2020. COVID-19 era cases recovered less vision (LogMAR 0.26, 0.67, and 0.45, respectively; p = 0.04) and were more likely to require surgical intervention (10%, 4%, and 2%, respectively; OR 3.4 (CI 0.7C17.9, p = 0.1)). CONCLUSION: A concerning fall in presentations of infectious keratitis to ED during the pandemic lockdown was observed. Though societal behaviour changed during the lockdown, our data suggest it is unlikely that the incidence of infectious keratitis fell significantly. It is unclear how and where these patients were treated. We postulate that lower levels of visual recovery and higher rates of surgical intervention may have been caused by delays in accessing care.

We evaluated the utility of the FRIDU during 1 year of operation. We analyzed 1,562 patients who were hospitalized after FRIDU screening between August 2015 and July 2016. The level of isolation recommended during their screening at the FRIDU was compared with the level deemed appropriate given their final diagnosis. Of the 1,562 patients screened at the FRIDU, 198 (13%) were isolated, 194 (12%) were reverse isolated, and 1,170 (75%) were not isolated. While hospitalized, 97 patients (6%) were confirmed to have a contagious disease requiring isolation, such as tuberculosis; 207 patients (13%) were confirmed to be immunocompromised and to require reverse isolation, mainly due to neutropenia; and the remaining 1,258 patients (81%) did not require isolation. The correlation coefficient for isolation consistency was 0.565 (P < 0.001). The sensitivity and negative predictive value of FRIDU screening for diagnosing contagious disease requiring isolation are 76% and 98%, respectively. No serious nosocomial outbreaks of contagious diseases occurred. During FRIDU screening, 114 patients were admitted to the resuscitation zone due to clinical instability, and three of these patients died. The initial isolation levels resulting from FRIDU screening were moderately well correlated with the isolation levels required by the final diagnosis, demonstrating the utility of pre-hospitalization screening units.

Saliva samples (879) previously tested using the FDA-EUA method were reevaluated with the optimized SalivaSTAT protocol using two widely available commercial RT-PCR kits. A five-sample pooling strategy was evaluated as per FDA guidelines. Results: Saliva collection (done without any media) showed performance comparable to that of the FDA-EUA method. The SalivaSTAT protocol was optimized by incubating saliva samples at 95 C for 30-min and homogenization, followed by RT-PCR assay.

DESIGN: Longitudinal analysis of nursing-home COVID-19 reports and other databases. Multivariable negative binomial models were used to estimate disparities in COVID-19 incidence and fatality rates across nursing-home groups with varying proportions of racial and ethnic minority residents, defined as low-, medium-, medium-high-, and high-proportion groups. Trends in such disparities were estimated from week 1 (April 13) to week 10 (ending on June 19, 2020). SETTING: The study was conducted across 211 nursing homes. RESULTS: The average number of cases ranged from 6.1 cases per facility for the low-proportion group to 11.7 cases per facility for the high-proportion group in week 1, and from 26.7 to 58.5 cases per facility in week 10. Compared to the low-proportion group, the adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for the high-proportion group were 1.18 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-1.80; P > .10) in week 1 and 1.54 (95% CI, 1.05-2.25; P < .05) in week 10, showing a 30% (95% CI, 5%-62%) relative increase (P < .05).

Clinically, COVID-19 is characterized by clinical manifestations, such as fever, dry cough, headache, and in more severe cases, respiratory distress. Moreover, neurological-, cardiac-, and renal-related symptoms have also been described. Clinical evidence suggests that migration of immune cells to the affected organs can produce an exacerbated release of proinflammatory mediators that contribute to disease and render the immune response as a major player during the development of the COVID-19 disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multidisciplinary, geographically representative group of individuals with expertise spanning transfusion medicine, infectious diseases and haematology was tasked with the development of a guidance document for CCP, drawing on expert opinion, survey of group members and review of available evidence. Three subgroups (i.e. donor, product and patient) were established based on self-identified expertise and interest. Here, the donor and product-related challenges are summarized and contrasted between HICs and LMICs with a view to guide related practices. RESULTS: The challenges to advance CCP therapy are different between HICs and LMICs. Early challenges in HICs related to recruitment and qualification of sufficient donors to meet the growing demand. Antibody testing also posed a specific obstacle given lack of standardization, variable performance of the assays in use and uncertain interpretation of results. In LMICs, an extant transfusion deficit, suboptimal models of donor recruitment (e.g. reliance on replacement and paid donors), limited laboratory capacity for pre-donation qualification and operational considerations could impede wide adoption. CONCLUSION: There has been wide-scale adoption of CCP in many HICs, which could increase if clinical trials show efficacy of use. By contrast, LMICs, having received little attention, require locally applicable strategies for adoption of CCP.","output":"Guidance for the procurement of COVID-19 convalescent plasma: differences between high- and low-middle-income countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper uses the mixed frequency vector autoregression model to explore the impact of economic fluctuations on infectious diseases mortality (IDM) from China perspective.

We also collected patient age, sex, insurance, preoperative weight, type of procedure, hospital stay, postoperative complications, and weight loss from the electronic medical record. To assess the impact of Facebook group participation we compared patient outcomes between frequent users (those checking the Facebook groups activity at least once a week), infrequent users, and a control group of all patients operated on during the year prior to the establishment of the Facebook group. The groups were compared after adjusting for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: 250 out of 1400 Facebook group patients responded to the survey (18%). 195 patients were frequent and 55 were infrequent users. Outcomes were compared with 211 control patients. The groups did not differ in their baseline characteristics apart from their sex. Frequent users had a higher weight loss compared to the other groups up to 2 years postoperatively but no difference in the overall complications. On multivariable analysis, frequency of Facebook use was the main factor associated with 0.5-, 1-, and 2-year weight loss. CONCLUSION: Frequent participation in a Facebook support group after bariatric surgery was associated with improved early weight loss outcomes. If additional longer-term studies confirm our findings, offering similar social support groups may become essential after bariatric surgery, especially during times of social isolation when in-person social support meetings may not be feasible.","output":"Social support provided to bariatric surgery patients through a facebook group may improve weight loss outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ambient-storage-friendly, ready-to-eat (RTE) meat products are convenient in emergencies, such as earthquakes, flash floods and the current global Covid-19 lockdown. However, given the processing and long storage time of such food products, the lipid and protein components may be more susceptible to oxidation. Chicken serunding is a low-moisture, high-lipid, high-protein, RTE product that is prone to lipid oxidation and protein co-oxidation, causing product quality deterioration. The present study assessed the effects of storage temperature (25, 40, 60 C), antioxidant (butylated hydroxyanisole, BHA), and multilayer packaging materials [metallised polyethene terephthalate (MPET) and aluminium] on the lipid oxidation and protein co-oxidation of chicken serunding during six months of storage. All lipid and protein markers elevated with increasing temperature (25 < 40 < 60 C), indicating that storage of low-moisture meat at high temperature is not feasible. BHA was effective against lipid oxidation, as indicated by the significantly lower (p <0.05) extracted lipid content and delayed formation of malondialdehyde, a secondary lipid oxidation product. However, BHA is not effective against protein co-oxidation, as shown by the insignificant (p >0.05) effect on preventing tryptophan loss, protein carbonyl formation and Schiff base accumulation. MPET packaging with a superior light and oxygen barrier provided significant protection (p <0.05) compared to aluminium. In conclusion, low temperature (25 C) storage of low-moisture, high-lipid, high-protein, cooked meat systems in MPET packaging is recommended for long-term storage to delay the progression of lipid oxidation and protein co-oxidation.","output":"Lipid oxidation and protein co-oxidation in ready-to-eat meat products as affected by temperature, antioxidant, and packaging material during 6 months of storage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The study aims to assess the COVID-19 event in three European countries (Germany, Italy and the UK) by investigating the quality of their performance management of it Design/methodology/approach Pragmatic constructivism (PC) is employed as a lens through which the performance management of each country can be examined and compared over a period encompassing the first wave of COVID-19 Findings Official statistics show that one of the countries has a significantly lower death rate It developed and operated a more detailed and precise system of performance management From the perspective of PC, this system supported efforts to build a functioning reality construction integrating facts, possibilities, values and communication Originality/value The evaluation of different national approaches to the performance management of the COVID-19 reality is novel to the literature on management accounting PC is used as a diagnostic tool to pinpoint strengths and weaknesses of the performance management of public sector activities in different countries","output":"Evaluating performance management of COVID-19 reality in three European countries: a pragmatic constructivist study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Understanding the diversity, breadth, magnitude, and functional profile of the T cell response against SARS-CoV-2 in recovered COVID-19 individuals is critical to evaluate the contribution of T cells to produce a potentially protective immune response. METHODS: We used a multiplexed peptide-MHC tetramer approach to screen a total of 408 SARS-CoV-2 candidate peptide epitopes for CD8+ T cell recognition in a cohort of 30 individuals recovered from COVID-19. The peptides spanned the whole viral genome and were restricted to six prevalent HLA alleles; T cells were simultaneously characterized by a 28-marker phenotypic panel. The evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses was then statistically modeled against time from diagnosis, and in relation to humoral and inflammatory response. Workflow for Study. A multiplexed peptide-MHC tetramer approach was used to screen SARS-CoV-2 candidate peptide epitopes in a cohort of 30 COVID-19 recovered patients across 6 prevalent HLA alleles, and T cells profiled with a 28-marker phenotypic panel. [Image: see text] Multiplex tetramer screen. One representative COVID-19 recovered patient and one healthy donor were screened for HLA- relevant SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, as well as epitopes for CMV, EBV, Influenza, Adenovirus and MART-1. Shown are the frequencies of tetramer-positive CD8 T cells from 2 technical replicates per subject. [Image: see text] RESULTS: Almost all individuals screened showed a T cell response against SARS-CoV-2 (29/30): 132 SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells hits were detected, corresponding to 52 unique reactive epitopes. Twelve of the 52 unique SARS-CoV-2-specific epitopes were recognized by more than 40% of the individuals screened, indicating high prevalence in the subjects. Importantly, these CD8+ T cell responses were directed against both structural and non-structural viral proteins, with the highest magnitude against nucleocapsid derived peptides, but without any antigen-driven bias in the phenotype of specific T cells. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 T cells showed specific states of differentiation (stem-cell memory and transitional memory), which differed from those of MART-1, influenza, CMV and EBV-specific T cells. UMAP visualization revealed a phenotypic profile of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cells in COVID-19 convalescent donors that is distinct from other viral specificities, such as influenza, CMV, EBV and Adenovirus. [Image: see text] SARS-CoV-2 epitope screening revealed CD8+ T cell responses directed against both structural and non-structural viral proteins, with the highest magnitude response against nucleocapsid derived peptides [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The kinetics modeling demonstrates a dynamic, evolving immune response characterized by a time-dependent decrease in overall inflammation, increase in neutralizing antibody titer, and progressive differentiation of a broad SARS-CoV-2 CD8 T cell response.

Mouse erythrocytes were used as a reagent to explore the question of whether erythrocyte sialic acid functions as a nonspecific negative charge or whether the sialic acid is a necessary structural part of the receptor for merozoites. Human erythrocytes contain N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), whereas mouse erythrocytes, which are also invaded by P. falciparum merozoites, contain 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac(2)) and N-glycoloylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), in addition to Neu5Ac.

Sialidase-treated mouse erythrocytes were refractory to invasion by P. falciparum merozoites and failed to bind EBA-175. Influenza C virus esterase, which converts Neu5,9Ac(2) to Neu5Ac, increased both invasion efficiency and EBA-175 binding to mouse erythrocytes.

Meanwhile, cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has attracted increasing attention for its positive effects on the cardiovascular system. There is overwhelming evidence that CR for patients with CVD is effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. To learn more about the development of CR, 5,567 papers about CR and related research were retrieved in the Web of Science Core Collection from 2001 to 2020. Then, these publications were scientometrically analyzed based on CiteSpace in terms of spatiotemporal distribution, author distribution, subject categories, topic distribution, and references. The results can be elaborated from three aspects. Firstly, the number of annual publications related to CR has increased year by year in general over the past two decades. Secondly, a co-occurrence analysis of the output countries and authors shows that a few developed countries such as the United States, Canada, and the UK are the most active in carrying out CR and where regional academic communities represented by Sherry Grace and Ross Arena were formed. Thirdly, an analysis of the subject categories and topic distribution of the papers reveals that CR is a typical interdiscipline with a wide range of disciplines involved, including clinical medicine, basic medicine, public health management, and sports science. The research topics cover the participants and implementers, components, and the objectives and requirements of CR. The current research hotspots are the three core modalities of CR, namely patient education, exercise training and mental support, as well as mobile health (mHealth) dependent on computer science. In conclusion, this work has provided some useful information for acquiring knowledge about CR, including identifying potential collaborators for researchers interested in CR, and discovering research trends and hot topics in CR, which can offer some guidance for more extensive and in-depth CR-related studies in the future.","output":"Cardiac Rehabilitation: A Bibliometric Review From 2001 to 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A recent innovation adapted from the world of commercial computer hacking is known as a Hackathon event Hackathons are characterized by problem-solving in small groups, under time pressure, to develop creative solutions to a challenging problem This paper presents the evaluation of a Hackathon applied in two courses on trauma-informed practice (one BSW and the other at MSW level) Students (N = 57) developed interventions to address group and community trauma presented in case studies Social work doctoral students served as judges (N = 5), evaluated the presentations and selected the winning team The evaluation showed that the students and judges felt that the Hackathon promoted learning, creativity, teamwork and the incorporation of concepts learned in the course The competitiveness and being judged were viewed as negative aspects by the students and the judges concurred that the competition detracted from the educational experience More research is needed on how to apply the Hackathon model to other types of social work curricula including the teaching of various research methods The current COVID-19 pandemic is challenging the social work profession to address its myriad social implications How to adapt social work practice toward the incorporation of e-therapy and e-consultation might benefit from Hackathon brainstorming [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Social Work Education is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Using the Hackathon Model in Social Work Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Problem: Due to the spread of SARS CoV-2 virus infection and COVID-2019 disease, there is an urgent need to analyze COVID-2019 epidemic perception in Poland.

Methods: We study the perception of COVID-2019 epidemic in Polish society using quantitative analysis of its digital footprints on the Internet (on Twitter, Google, YouTube, Wikipedia and electronic media represented by Event Registry) from January 2020 to 12.03.2020 (before and after official introduction to Poland on 04.03.2020). To this end we utilize data mining, social network analysis, natural language processing techniques. Each examined internet platform was analyzed for representativeness and composition of the target group. Results: We identified three major cluster of the interest before disease introduction on the topic COVID-2019: China- and Italy-related peaks on all platforms, as well as a peak on social media related to the recent special law on combating COVID-2019. Besides, there was a peak in interest on the day of officially confirmed introduction as well as an exponential increase of interest when the Polish government declared war against disease with a massive mitigation program. From sociolingistic perspective, we found that concepts and issues of threat, fear and prevention prevailed before introduction. After introduction, practical concepts about disease and epidemic dominate. Twitter reflected the clear, structural division of the Polish political sphere. We were able to identify potential sources of misinformation as well as key actors (especially early adopters) and influencers. Conclusions: Traditional and social media not only reflect reality, but also create it. Polish authorities, having a reliable analysis of the perception of the problem, could optimally prepare and manage the social dimension of the current epidemic and future ones. Due to filter bubbles observed on Twitter, public information campaigns might have less impact on society than expected.

Although it is well known that attention can modulate neural responses in many brain areas, the computational principles underlying attentional modulation remain unclear. Contrary to the prevailing view of a high-dimensional, distributed neural representation, here we show a surprisingly simple, biased neural representation for feature-based attention in a large dataset including five human fMRI studies. We found that when human participants (both sexes) selected one feature from a compound stimulus, voxels in many cortical areas responded consistently higher to one attended feature over the other. This univariate bias was consistent across brain areas within individual subjects. Importantly, this univariate bias showed a progressively stronger magnitude along the cortical hierarchy. In frontoparietal areas, the bias was strongest and contributed largely to pattern-based decoding, whereas early visual areas lacked such a bias. These findings suggest a gradual transition from a more analog to a more abstract representation of attentional priority along the cortical hierarchy. Biased neural responses in high-level areas likely reflect a low-dimensional neural code that can facilitate a robust representation and simple readout of cognitive variables.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT It is typically assumed that cognitive variables are represented by distributed population activities. Although this view is rooted in decades of work in the sensory system, it has not been rigorously tested at different levels of cortical hierarchy. Here we show a novel, low-dimensional coding scheme that dominated the representation of feature-based attention in frontoparietal areas.

Purpose: To estimate the central tendency and dispersion for incubation period of COVID-19 and, in turn, assess the effect of a certain length of quarantine for close contacts in active monitoring. Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, medRxiv, bioRxiv, and arXiv, searched up to April 26, 2020 Study Selection: COVID-19 studies that described either individual-level incubation period data or summarized statistics for central tendency and dispersion measures of incubation period were recruited. Data Extraction: From each recruited study, either individual-level incubation period data or summarized statistics for central tendency and dispersion measures were extracted, as well as population characteristics including sample size, average age, and male proportion. Data Synthesis: Fifty-six studies encompassing 4 095 cases were included in this meta-analysis. The estimated median incubation period for general transmissions was 5.8 days [95% confidence interval (95%CI), 5.3 to 6.2 d]. Median and dispersion were higher for SARS-CoV-2 incubation compared to other viral respiratory infections. Furthermore, about 20 in 10 000 contacts in active monitoring would develop symptoms after 14 days, or below 1 in 10 000 for young-age infections or asymptomatic transmissions. Limitation: Small sample sizes for subgroups; some data were possibly used repeatedly in different studies; limited studies for outside mainland China; non-negligible intra-study heterogeneity. Conclusion: The long, dispersive incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 contributes to the global spread of COVID-19.

This study aimed to determine COVID-19 knowledge, attitude, and practice among Sari Birth Cohort (SBC) members. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study linked to the SBC in north of Iran, mothers living in Sari and its suburbs from March 28 to April 8, 2020 were evaluated. The measurement tool was an online researcher-made, self-reported knowledge, attitude, and practice questionnaire related to COVID-19. RESULTS: In total, 1449 mothers with a mean age of 31.51  5.73 years participated. Of them, 82.4% had good knowledge (98.6% in healthcare workers and 79.2% in housewives, p = 0.000). Most of them were worried about spread of the disease in the country (97.4%) and agreed that COVID-19 will finally be successfully controlled around the world (72.2%). Sleep disturbance was reported in 42.7% of mothers. Eighty-eight percent of cases wore masks and gloves when leaving home, 99.4% washed their hands frequently while 12.9% went to any crowded places. People with better knowledge followed safer practices (p = 0.000) and were more worried about the spread of the disease in the country and infection (among themselves and their first-degree relatives) (p = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the SBC members had a good level of knowledge about COVID-19 but were worried about a long-term pandemic period.

Using an integrated dataset from Chile, we estimated the direct and indirect (spillover) causal effects of localized lockdowns on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Our results show that the effectiveness of localized lockdowns is strongly modulated by duration and is affected by spillover effects from neighboring geographic areas.

The awareness of COVID-19 clinical manifestations can improve the early detection of mild cases, possibly reducing further transmission to colleagues and patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was carried out in March-May 2020, involving medical school physicians in a teaching hospital in northern Italy, with a working population of 881 medical doctors. Data collection was performed using a structured form investigating clinical and epidemiological information. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-two medical doctors contacted the Occupational Health Service reporting acute respiratory symptoms or close contact exposure to a confirmed COVID-19 case. Among the confirmed COVID-19 cases, most were male doctors during residency, and 85% presented a mild clinical picture. Fever (70.3%) and cough (51.4%) represented the most prevalent symptoms of COVID-19. As revealed by the univariate analysis, the prevalence of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positivity increased with age (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02-1.14, p = 0.012), working in a COVID-19 ward (OR = 3.33, 95% CI: 1.09-10.21, p = 0.031), presenting alteration or loss of smell/taste (OR = 10.00, 95%CI: 2.80-35.69, p < 0.001) and myalgia (OR = 3.20, 95% CI: 1.00-10.26, p = 0.046), while being a resident (OR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.05-0.80, p = 0.030) was associated with reduced odds of being infected, compared to staff physicians. Age and loss of smell/taste were the only factors independently associated with RT-PCR positivity. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of COVID-19 cases showed a mild clinical syndrome, ranging from absence or paucity of symptoms to common cold or influenza-like symptoms.

Considerable evidence now shows that m6A alters gene expression, thereby regulating cell self-renewal, differentiation, invasion, and apoptotic processes. M6A methylation disorders are directly related to abnormal RNA metabolism, which may lead to tumor formation. M6A methyltransferase is the dominant catalyst during m6A modification; it removes m6A demethylase, promotes recognition by m6A binding proteins, and regulates mRNA metabolic processes. Bladder cancer (BC) is a urinary system malignant tumor, with complex etiology and high incidence rates. A well-differentiated or moderately differentiated pathological type at initial diagnosis accounts for most patients with BC. For differentiated superficial bladder urothelial carcinoma, the prognosis is normally good after surgery. However, due to poor epithelial cell differentiation, BC urothelial cell proliferation and infiltration may lead to invasive or metastatic BC, which lowers the 5-years survival rate and significantly affects clinical treatments in elderly patients.

The functionality of convalescent plasma varies greatly, but the association of antibody epitope specificities with plasma functionality remains uncharacterized. We assessed antibody functionality and reactivities to peptides across the CoV2 and the 4 endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) genomes in 126 CCP donations. We found strong correlation between plasma functionality and polyclonal antibody targeting of CoV2 spike protein peptides. Antibody reactivity to many HCoV spike peptides also displayed strong correlation with plasma functionality, including pan-coronavirus cross-reactive epitopes located in a conserved region of the fusion peptide. After accounting for antibody cross-reactivity, we identified an association between greater alphacoronavirus NL63 antibody responses and development of highly neutralizing antibodies against CoV2. We also found that plasma preferentially reactive to the CoV2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD), versus the betacoronavirus HKU1 RBD, had higher neutralizing titer. Finally, we developed a 2-peptide serosignature that identifies plasma donations with high anti-spike titer, but that suffer from low neutralizing activity. These results suggest that analysis of coronavirus antibody fine specificities may be useful for selecting desired therapeutics and understanding the complex immune responses elicited by CoV2 infection.","output":"Antibody responses to endemic coronaviruses modulate COVID-19 convalescent plasma functionality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Declaring the end of an outbreak is an important step in controlling infectious disease outbreaks. An objective estimation of the probability of cases arising in the future is important to reduce the risk of post-declaration flare-ups. We developed a simulation-based model to quantify that probability. We tested it on simulated Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) data and found this probability was most sensitive to the instantaneous reproduction number, the reporting rate, and the delay between symptom onset and recovery or death of the last detected case. For EVD, our results suggest that the current WHO criterion of 42 days since the outcome of the last detected case is too short and very sensitive to underreporting. The 90 days of enhanced surveillance period after the end-of-outbreak declaration is therefore crucial to capture potential flare-ups of cases. Hence, we suggest a shift to a preliminary end-of-outbreak declaration after 63 days from the symptom onset day of the last detected case. This should be followed by a 90-day enhanced surveillance, after which the official end-of-outbreak can be declared. This corresponds to less than 5% probability of flare ups in most of the scenarios examined.

We used Students t and MannCWhitney tests to compare the results between groups. The participants presented some coping strategies (social support seeking, wishful thinking, and professional support seeking) and several early maladaptive schemes (emotional deprivation, defectiveness/shame, social isolation/alienation, failure to achieve, attachment, and subjugation) associated with their reactions facing a situation of humiliation with children as witnesses. When the humiliation was against the body image, their reactions were associated with some coping strategies (wishful thinking, professional support seeking, autonomy, negative auto-focus coping, and positive reappraisal) and one maladaptive scheme (defectiveness/shame). Women who reacted avoidantly showed higher social and professional support seeking but experienced higher indicators of discomfort and deterioration of self-esteem than those who opted for assertive decisions. The presence of children as witnesses seems to be a factor of stress in the configuration of coping strategies and maladaptive schemes in female victims of domestic violence.

METHODS The COVID-19 Imaging Registry Study Aachen (COVID-19-Bildgebungs-Register Aachen, COBRA) collects data on imaging in patients with COVID-19. Two of the COBRA partner hospitals (RWTH Aachen University Hospital and Dueren Hospital) systematically perform reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs as well as LDCT in all patients presenting with manifestations that are compatible with COVID-19. In accordance with the COV-RADS protocol, the LDCT scans were prospectively evaluated before the RT-PCR findings were available in order to categorize the likelihood of COVID-19. RESULTS From 18 March to 5 May 2020, 191 patients with COVID-19 manifestations (117 male, age 65  16 years) underwent RT-PCR testing and LDCT. The mean time from the submission of the sample to the availability of the RT-PCR findings was 491 minutes (interquartile range [IQR: 276-1066]), while that from the performance of the CT to the availability of its findings was 9 minutes (IQR: 6-11). A diagnosis of COVID-19 was made in 75/191 patients (39%). The LDCT was positive in 71 of these 75 patients and negative in 106 of the 116 patients without COVID-19, corresponding to 94.7% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [86.9; 98.5]), 91.4% specificity [84.7; 95.8], positive and negative predictive values of 87.7% [78.5; 93.9] and 96.4% [91.1; 98.6], respectively, and an AUC (area under the curve) of 0.959 [0.930; 0.988]. The initial RT-PCR test results were falsely negative in six patients, yielding a sensitivity of 92.0% [83.4; 97.0]; these six patients had positive LDCT findings. 47.4% of the LDCTs that were negative for COVID-19 (55/116) exhibited pathological pulmonary changes, including infiltrates, that were correctly distinguished from SARS-CoV-2 related changes. CONCLUSION In patients with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, LDCT can esablish the diagnosis of COVID-19 with comparable sensitivity to RT-PCR testing. In addition, it offers a high specificity for distinguishing COVID-19 from other diseases associated with the same or similar clinical symptoms. We propose the systematic use of LDCT in addition to RT-PCR testing because it helps correct false-negative RT-PCR results, because its results are available much faster than those of RT-PCRtesting, and because it provides additional diagnostic information useful for treatment planning regardless of the type of the infectious agent.","output":"Low-Dose Chest CT for the Diagnosis of COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Asian Seismological Commission (ASC) completed 25 years in August 2021 after fulfilling its primary aim of bringing together, Earth scientists from Asia and Oceania regions.

Methods: It is a prospective observational study conducted in residential/private nursing colleges, St. Lukes School and College of Nursing and Smt. Vijaya Lukes College of Nursing, Visakhapatnam during the period July 2021. Fifty-three student nurses affected with mild COVID-19, 35 student nurses affected with moderate COVID-19, aged 18C23 years were enrolled after taking thorough history about COVID-19 that is after 2 months of complete recovery. They were classified based on the symptom history in which the subjects without symptoms or mild symptoms were taken as mildly affected, whereas subjects with severe symptoms with mild fluctuations in SpO2 who didnt require hospitalization were classified as moderately affected. The study included 109 normal control cases who are never affected with COVID-19 viral infection. In all the subjects, the oxygen saturation was measured using pulse oxymeter and their Breath holding times were also measured using standard protocols. Results: The mean value of BHT was significantly reduced from normal 16.73393.4 to 12.85715.1 (p<0.05) in moderate cases. When oxygen saturation levels were compared before and after the breath holding in normal, mild and moderate cases the results were significant. However, when the oxygen saturation levels were compared between normal and mild COVID-19 cases the values were insignificant (p=0.4) and at the same time when the oxygen saturation levels were compared between normal and moderate COVID-19 cases the values were significant (p=0.0001). Conclusion: According to the findings, breath-holding does not need greater energy expenditure or cardiac output, and it eliminates walking and the related contamination of bystanders as occurring with pulse oximeter. Breath holding time is a determinant of respiratory capacity, when used as parameter helps in assessing the progression of lung injury, it gives an idea about respiratory fitness especially in this COVID era. Breath holding time and fluctuations in SpO2 when used conjointly we can assess degree of lung damage so that further treatment such as the continuity of medication, practicing of breathing exercises with or without medical treatment can be planned.

There is a need to define the types of take-home naloxone programs being offered to support future research designs in implementing and evaluating standardized programs that fill pharmacist and patient knowledge gaps and lift current barriers for optimal community pharmacy naloxone provision. The objective of this paper is to summarize the literature on community pharmacy-based THN programs, including specific program interventions used to increase naloxone dispensing, naloxone availability and dispensing patterns, facilitators and barriers for the THN programs, and knowledge gaps. Online databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA) and a search of the grey literature were used to identify eligible sources. Sources were screened by two reviewers for eligibility in COVIDENCE software. Both reviewers compared screening results and resolved conflicts through discussion. A data extraction form for all identified full texts was completed by both reviewers and results were compiled through reviewer discussion. Fifty-two sources met the eligibility criteria. The top three barriers identified were: cost/coverage of naloxone, stigma, and education/training for pharmacists. THN program interventions included screening tools, checklists, pocket cards, patient brochures, and utilizing the pharmacy management system to flag eligible patients. Patient knowledge gaps included naloxone misinformation and lack of awareness, while pharmacists demonstrated administrative, clinical, and counselling knowledge gaps. Naloxone availability was found to be highly variable, where independent and rural pharmacies were less likely to stock or dispense naloxone. Further, pharmacies located in districts with higher rates of opioid overdose deaths and lower household income were also less likely to have naloxone available. This review identified multiple new programs, showcasing that the implementation and evaluation of THN programs are an expanding area of research.

METHODS: This was a single-center, cross-sectional study. We evaluated the feasibility of a strategy based on the conversion of face-to-face visits to telephone consultations to manage IBD outpatients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A 4-item telephone survey (3 closed questions and a 100-point numeric description scale) was conducted to evaluate satisfaction of patients with telephone consultations. RESULTS: Between March 11 and April 8, 2020, 98% of the 216 scheduled face-to-face visits could be converted to telephone consultations, and we resolved an additional 162 urgent consultations by telephone. The rate of IBD-related hospitalization and visits to the emergency department decreased by 50% and 58%, respectively, compared with rates in the same period the previous year. The 4-item survey was conducted in 171 outpatients. In closed questions, patients reported a very high degree of satisfaction with telephone consultations, with no differences between scheduled (n = 123) and urgent consultations (n = 48; P = NS). The overall satisfaction rating with the telephone consultation evaluated with the numerical description scale was 94% and 93% for scheduled and urgent consultations, respectively (P < 0.82). Less than 20% of patients would have preferred a face-to-face visit to the telephone consultation at the time. CONCLUSIONS: A strategy based on the conversion of face-to-face visits to telephone consultations was able to guarantee a minimum standard quality of care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Such a network could prove valuable during public health emergencies such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our objective was to determine whether LHDs in the United States were tied together in an informal network to share information and advice about innovative community health practices, programs, and policies. METHODS: In January and February 2020, we conducted an online survey of 2,303 senior LHD leaders to ask several questions about their sources of advice. We asked respondents to rank up to 3 other LHDs whose practices informed their work on new public health programs, evidence-based practices, and policies intended to improve community health. We used a social network analysis program to assess answers. RESULTS: A total of 329 LHDs responded. An emergent network appeared to operate nationally among 740 LHDs. Eleven LHDs were repeatedly nominated by peers as sources of advice or examples (ie, opinion leaders), and 24 acted as relational bridges to hold these emergent networks together (ie, boundary spanners). Although 2 LHDs played both roles, most LHDs we surveyed performed neither of these roles. CONCLUSION: Opinion leading and boundary spanning health departments can be accessed to increase the likelihood of affecting the rate of interest in and adoption of innovations.

Sources of Information: We performed a rapid review of articles describing preprint servers and their use. We approached the 20 highest impact nephrology journals regarding their policy towards the use of preprint servers. We evaluated the average time from study completion to publication of impactful articles in nephrology. Finally, we evaluated the number of nephrology articles submitted to preprint servers. Findings: To date over 600 kidney-related articles have been uploaded to bioRxiv and medRxiv. The average time from study completion to publication was over 10 months. 16 of the top 20 nephrology journals currently accept research submitted to a preprint server. Transparency and collaboration, visibility and recognition, and rapid dissemination of results were identified as benefits of preprint servers. Concerns exist regarding the potential risk of non-peer reviewed medical research being publicly available. Limitations: Preprint servers remain a recent phenomenon in health sciences and their long-term impact on the medical literature remains to be seen.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted that improvements are urgently needed to reach high quality, efficient, accessible, health promoting, people-centred, resilient, health and care systems for all EU citizens. The workshop will be built around the preparations for a proposed EU Partnership on Transforming health and care systems as part of the new Horizon Europe Programme. In a first presentation, the Partnership will be clarified in more detail, including its main objectives to be achieved by 2030. The presentation will also share the outcomes of a consultation process among European stakeholders, among others involving decision makers and research funding bodies to identify common goals and priorities, which will feed into a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda. Second, the work of the Expert Panel on effective ways of investing in Health (EXPH) will be presented, and in particular its Opinion on the Organisation of Resilient Health and Social Care Following the COVID-19 Pandemic. One of its main recommendations has been the need for investment in the development and implementation of health systems data collection methodologies to generate meaningful, actionable results for health system transformation. Similarly, it is important to establish corresponding learning communities within and across Member States to share lessons learned through this process. What does this mean for a future Partnership and what should be its priorities? As third presentation, the Partnership is evaluated from the context of the EU Presidency by Slovenia in the second half of 2021. What are the goals of the EU Presidency and how can a Partnership facilitate alignment with the overall EU political ambition to accelerate the transformation towards sustainable health and care systems?

The aim of this retrospective single-center study was to investigate the impact of hypovitaminosis D and secondary hyperparathyroidism on respiratory outcomes of COVID-19. METHODS: Three-hundred-forty-eight consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at the IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital, Rozzano, Milan (Italy) were evaluated for arterial partial pressure oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio, serum 25hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D], parathyroid hormone (PTH) and inflammatory parameters at study entry and need of ventilation during the hospital stay. RESULTS: In the entire population, vitamin D deficiency (i.e., 25(OH)D values < 12 ng/mL) was significantly associated with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure at the study entry [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.48, 95% confidence interval 1.29-4.74; P = 0.006], independently of age and sex of subjects, serum calcium and inflammatory parameters. In patients evaluated for serum PTH (97 cases), secondary hyperparathyroidism combined with vitamin D deficiency was significantly associated with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure at study entry (P = 0.001) and need of ventilation during the hospital stay (P = 0.031).

The resulting lung lesions compromise patient pulmonary function and increase mortality, or end in permanent lung damage for those who have recovered from the COVID-19 disease. Therefore, local pulmonary fibrinolysis can be efficacious in degrading pre-existing fibrin clots and reducing the conversion of lung lesions into lasting scars. Plasminogen is considered a key player in fibrinolysis processes, and in view of a bench-to-bedside translation, we focused on the aerosolization of an orphan medicinal product (OMP) for ligneous conjunctivitis: human plasminogen (PLG-OMP) eye drops. As such, the sterile and preservative-free solution guarantees the pharmaceutical quality of GMP production and meets the Ph. Eur. requirements of liquid preparations for nebulization. PLG-OMP aerosolization was evaluated both from technological and stability viewpoints, after being submitted to either jet or ultrasonic nebulization. Jet nebulization resulted in a more efficient delivery of an aerosol suitable for pulmonary deposition. The biochemical investigation highlighted substantial protein integrity maintenance with the percentage of native plasminogen band > 90%, in accordance with the quality specifications of PLG-OMP. In a coherent way, the specific activity of plasminogen is maintained within the range 4.8C5.6 IU/mg (PLG-OMP pre-nebulization: 5.0 IU/mg). This is the first study that focuses on the technological and biochemical aspects of aerosolized plasminogen, which could affect both treatment efficacy and clinical dosage delivery. Increasing evidence for the need of local fibrinolytic therapy could merge with the availability of PLG-OMP as an easy handling solution, readily aerosolizable for a fast translation into an extended clinical efficacy assessment in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Repurposing of Plasminogen: An Orphan Medicinal Product Suitable for SARS-CoV-2 Inhalable Therapeutics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE to construct and validate educational technology on COVID-19 and essential care for families of children/adolescents with sickle cell disease.

With the advent of the Chinese Spring Festival, this disease spread rapidly throughout the country. The information about the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan is limited. Methods: : All of the patients with confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to the First Hospital of Changsha City, the designated hospital for COVID-19 assigned by the Changsha City Government. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics, data of laboratory, radiological picture, treatment, and outcomes records of 201 COVID-19 patients were collected using electronic medical records. Results: : This study population consisted of 201 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Changsha by April 28, 2020. The median age of the patients was 45 years (IQR 34C59). About half (50.7%) of the patients were male, and most of the infected patients were staff (96 [47.8%]). Concerning the epidemiologic history, the number of patients linked to Wuhan was 92 (45.8%). The most common symptoms were fever (125 [62.2%]), dry cough (118 [58.7%]), fatigue (65 [32.3%]), and pharyngalgia (31 [15.4%]). One hundred and forty-four (71.6%) enrolled patients showed bilateral pneumonia. Fifty-four (26.9%) patients showed unilateral involvement, and three (1.5%) patients showed no abnormal signs or symptoms. The laboratory findings differed significantly between the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and non-ICU groups. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had depressed white blood cell (WBC), neutrocytes, lymphocytes, and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Moreover, higher plasma levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), alanine aminotransferase (ALA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), creatinine (CREA), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were detected in the ICU group. Conclusions: : In this single-center study of 201 COVID-19 patients in Changsha, China, 22.4% of patients were admitted to ICU. Based on our findings, we propose that the risk of cellular immune deficiency, hepatic injury, and kidney injury should be monitored.

Comorbidities of pemphigoid have not been well-described. Identification of comorbidities associated with pemphigoid is important to decrease morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE To identify the comorbid health conditions of bullous pemphigoid. METHODS This was a case-control study of 91 cases of pemphigoid verified by clinical and laboratory diagnosis and 546 age- and sex-matched controls with complete follow-up at a large metropolitan quaternary care medical center. RESULTS The average age of bullous pemphigoid patients was 76 years and 53% of patients were female. Forty-eight (53%) of the BP patients had a history of inpatient hospitalization, of which 22 (24.2%) were hospitalized for either previously undiagnosed BP or an exacerbation of BP.

Although several factors may account for this disparity, striking differences within and between populations indicate that ethnicity might impact COVID-19 clinical outcomes, reflecting the 'color of disease'. Therefore, the role of key biological variables that could interplay with viral spreading and severity indices has attracted increasing attention, particularly among non-Caucasian populations. Although the links between vitamin D status and the incidence and severity of COVID-19 remain elusive, several lines of emerging evidence suggest that vitamin D signaling, targeting several immune-mediated pathways, may offer potential benefits at different stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given that the vitamin D status is modulated by several intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including skin type (pigmentation), melanin polymers may also play a role in variable COVID-19 outcomes among diverse population settings. Moreover, apart from the well-known limiting effects of melanin on the endogenous production of vitamin D, the potential crosstalk between the pigmentary and immune system may also require special attention concerning the current pandemic.

We present the results of a clinical study on prophylaxis of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis undergoing cytoreduction and hyperthermic intraperitoneal intraoperative chemotherapy (HIPEC-cisplatin). Prophylaxis was with imipenem/cilastatin. Cilastatin is a selective inhibitor of renal dehydropeptidase I in the proximal renal tubule cells that can reduce the nephrotoxicity of cisplatin. Unfortunately, cilastatin is not currently marketed alone, and can only be administered in combination with imipenem. The study has a retrospective part that serves as a control (n = 99 patients receiving standard surgical prophylaxis) and a prospective part with imipenem/cilastatin prophylaxis corresponding to the study group (n = 85 patients). In both groups, we collected specific data on preoperative risk factors of renal damage, fluid management, hemodynamic control, and urine volume during surgery (including the hyperthermic chemotherapy perfusion), as well as data on hemodynamic and renal function during the first seven days after surgery. The main finding of the study is that cilastatin may exert a nephroprotective effect in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis undergoing cytoreduction and hyperthermic intraperitoneal cisplatin perfusion.

Few nationwide data are available to compare risk factors, treatment and outcomes of COVID-19 patients after ICU admission. OBJECTIVE To evaluate baseline characteristics, treatments and 30-day outcomes of patients admitted to Swedish ICUs with COVID-19. DESIGN Registry-based cohort study with prospective data collection. SETTING Admissions to Swedish ICUs from 6 March to 6 May 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 disease. PARTICIPANTS Adult patients admitted to Swedish ICUs. EXPOSURES Baseline characteristics, intensive care treatments and organ failures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. A multivariable model was used to determine the independent association between potential predictor variables and death. RESULTS We identified 1563 patients with complete 30-day follow-up. The 30-day all-cause mortality was 26.7%. Median age was 61 [52 to 69], Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III) was 53 [46 to 59] and 62.5% had at least one comorbidity. Median PaO2/FiO2 on admission was 97.5 [75.0 to 140.6] mmHg, 74.7% suffered from moderate-to-severe acute respiratory failure. Age, male sex [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.5 (1.1 to 2.2)], SAPS III score [aOR 1.3 (1.2 to 1.4)], severe respiratory failure [aOR 3.0 (2.0 to 4.7)], specific COVID-19 pharmacotherapy [aOR 1.4 (1.0 to 1.9)] and continuous renal replacement therapy [aOR 2.1 (1.5 to 3.0)] were associated with increased mortality. Except for chronic lung disease, the presence of comorbidities was not independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS Thirty-day mortality rate in COVID-19 patients admitted to Swedish ICUs is generally lower than previously reported despite a severe degree of hypoxaemia on admission. Mortality was driven by age, baseline disease severity, the presence and degree of organ failure, rather than pre-existing comorbidities.

This is mainly because of the problem of sterilizing natural orifices, which prevents the use of any prosthetic material because of unacceptable risks of infection. Single-incision laparoscopic ventral hernia repair has gained more wide-spread acceptance by specialized hernia centers. Even so, there is a special subset of patients who are young and/or scar conscious and find any visible scar unacceptable. This study illustrates an innovative way of performing single-incision laparoscopic ventral hernia repair by a transverse suprapubic incision below the pubic hair/bikini line in 2 young male patients who had both umbilical and epigastric hernias as well as attenuated linea alba in the upper abdomen. CASE DESCRIPTION Both patients underwent successful laparoscopic repair, and both were highly satisfied with the procedure, which produced no visible scars on their abdomen.

The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a high burden on healthcare systems globally. Many countries announced lockdowns which restricted residents' movement. There is a reported reduction in AHF admissions during the pandemic in several countries, potentially leading to adverse outcomes such as increased morbidity and mortality. To date, little is known on whether similar trends are observed in Southeast Asian (SEA) countries. PURPOSE: We aim to evaluate whether AHF admissions have been affected by the pandemic and the lockdown restrictions in a multi-ethnic, urban SEA country. We hypothesized that the pandemic and lockdown restrictions (called a circuit breaker (CB)) will influence heart failure (HF) admission rates. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who were admitted with a principal diagnosis of HF to a tertiary hospital in a SEA country. The study period was from the first confirmed case of COVID-19 (January 23, 2020) to July 31, 2020 (n=378). This was further divided into 3 sub-periods for inter-year and intra-year subgroup analysis. Pre-CB: January 23, 2020 to April 6, 2020, CB: April 7, 2020 to June 1, 2020, and Post-CB reopening (Phase 1 & 2): June 2, 2020 to July 31, 2020. The control period was the same timeframe in the preceding year (January 23, 2019 to July 31, 2019) (n=398) and was similarly divided into 3 subgroups. The primary outcome was the overall HF admission rate. Where appropriate, Poisson regression or Negative Binomial regression was utilised to compare the incidence rate ratios of the HF admissions between the periods. Mann-Whitney test or student's t-test was used to compare the length of stay (LOS) and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores. RESULTS: Details on the study cohort can be found in Table 1. The study period's overall mean admission rate was 2.08 per day, which was not significantly different from the control (2.00 per day). Subgroup analysis showed that the CB admission rates were significantly lower compared to (i) the control (1.39 per day vs. 2.02 per day) and (ii) pre-CB period in the same year (1.39 per day vs. 2.44 per day) (Fig. 1). Phase 1 & 2 admission rates were significantly higher compared to the control (2.28 per day vs. 1.68 per day), and CB admission rates (2.28 per day vs. 1.39 per day). There were no inter-year or intra-year differences for LOS. There was a significant inter-year difference in CCI scores during the CB period (CB: 2.88 vs. control: 1.97). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed significant decreases in AHF admissions during the CB period, and a significant increase in AHF admissions from CB to Post-CB reopening. These suggest that the lockdown restrictions had an influence on patients' health seeking behaviour. We also recognise the need to raise public awareness to encourage HF patients to seek timely treatment, prevent complications and adverse events.

Still, little is known about physiotherapists use, perceptions and needs with regards to telerehabilitation services. AIMS: To describe physiotherapists use and perceptions of, as well as needs for, telerehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of people with neurological diseases or older adults in Sweden. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, an author-created survey was sent out to members of the Swedish Association of Physiotherapists including questions about the use and perceptions of existing telerehabilitation services (e.g. telephone, internet-based applications and mobile applications) as well as needs of future telerehabilitation services. The results were presented descriptively as numbers and percentages. RESULTS: Three hundred seven physiotherapists were included in this study with 139 (45%) treating people with neurological diseases and 168 (55%) treating older adults. Most respondents did not provide telerehabilitation before (74%) or during (51%) the COVID-19 pandemic. Telephone, which was predominantly used for administrative tasks, was the most frequent utilised ICT used by 68% of the physiotherapist using ICTs several days/week. Few respondents used internet-based applications (12%), mobile applications (3%) or SMS services (8%) and videoconferencing (3%). A majority of the respondents were interested in ICT (78%), felt comfortable using ICT (57%) and were interested in learning how ICT can be used in rehabilitation (92%). Still, few respondents perceived that people with neurological diseases or older adults can use existing ICTs for rehabilitation purposes (18%) and that existing reimbursement system within health care facilitates remote rehabilitation (16%). Important functionality of future ICT perceived by physiotherapists covered patient communication (e.g. chat, SMS and video), assessments (e.g. digital surveys and assessment of physical activity) and treatment (e.g. exercise prescription). CONCLUSION: While physiotherapists had an overall positive perception to use and willingness to learn about telerehabilitation, few used telerehabilitation services before nor during the COVID-19 pandemic and they also perceived multilevel barriers for implementation, ranging from patients ability to use ICT to existing reimbursement systems within health care. Our findings emphasize the need to strengthen the expertise regarding remote services among physiotherapists.

SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids were more readily detected in respiratory tract samples (35.0%). In analyses of environmentally derived samples, the positivity rate of air samples was higher than that of surface samples, probably due to differences in virus concentrations. Digital PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 in several samples that had previously been deemed negative, including 3 patient-derived samples and 5 environmentally derived samples. In this study digital PCR exhibited higher sensitivity than conventional RT-PCR, suggesting that it may be a useful new method for clinical SARS-CoV-2 detection.

The changes were measured absolutely and relatively, which made it possible to identify the types of their dynamics: catastrophic, strong, medium, moderate, weak, and insignificant declines. Geographically, the spread of COVID-19 was extremely uneven: at first, the epidemic covered large countries of Europe (Northern Italy became the main center after Wuhan), then closely related neighboring and more distant countries were involved; last but not least, the Balkan countries and countries in post-Soviet Eastern Europe. The disease spread hierarchically. The first cases arrived by air, first from the main centers, whence coronavirus infection was then transmitted to other countries by new groups of air passengers. Then, the infection was transmitted by ground transport passengers within the zones of influence of the largest airports. The airports of European countries are characterized by a strong decline in passenger turnover (65C85%); Russian regions, by moderate (30C45%) and weak (15C30%) declines. The retrodegression time lag (return to the values of the distant past) turned out to be the largest (27C40 years) for the largest European airports with a large share of international passengers and transit, relatively medium (16C26 years)for medium-sized or large airports with a large share of domestic transportation, relatively short (9C16 years)for the largest airports in Russia with a high proportion of international passengers, short (4C8 years)for almost all other airports in Russia, very short (2C3 years)for resort and tourist airports in Russia and some airports with an increased share of domestic passengers. Since different airports had different dynamics of passenger turnover, the ranks of their hierarchy in 2020 changed somewhat: before, the largest airports gave way to others, which bypassed the first ones due to a smaller level of recession and rapid recovery in the volume of domestic air traffic.","output":"Geography of the Passenger Turnover Dynamics at Airports in Europe and Russias Regions in the First Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently (mid May 2020), most active cases of COVID-19 are found in Europe and North America while it is still in the initial phases in Africa.

We calculated standardised mortality ratios (SMR) using age-specific case fatality rates for COVID-19 and the age structure of the population of Africa and of other continents. Compared to a European or Northern American population, the standardised mortality ratio was only 0.22 and 0.25, respectively, corresponding to reduction of deaths rates to a quarter.

A subset of these syndromes promotes higher in-hospital mortality than is predicted by traditional parameters defining critical care illness. This suggests that deregulation of components of the central and peripheral nervous systems compromises the interplay with systemic cellular, tissue and organ interfaces to mediate numerous atypical manifestations of COVID-19 through impairments in organismal homeostasis. This unique dyshomeostasis syndrome involves components of the ACE-2/1 lifecycles, renin-angiotensin system regulatory axes, integrated nervous system functional interactions and brain regions differentially sculpted by accelerated evolutionary processes and more primordial homeostatic functions. These biological contingencies suggest a mechanistic blueprint to define long-term neurological sequelae and systemic manifestations such as premature aging phenotypes, including organ fibrosis, tissue degeneration and cancer. Therapeutic initiatives must therefore encompass innovative combinatorial agents, including repurposing FDA-approved drugs targeting components of the autonomic nervous system and recently identified products of SARS-CoV-2-host interactions.","output":"Nervous System-Systemic Crosstalk in SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19: A Unique Dyshomeostasis Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to understand the relationship between area level deprivation and monthly COVID-19 cases in England in response to government policy throughout 2020.

A GEE population-averaged panel-data model was employed to model trends in monthly COVID-19 cases with the population of each MSOA included as the exposure variable. Area level deprivation is significantly associated with COVID-19 cases from March 2020; however, this relationship is reversed in December 2020. Follow up analysis found that this reversal was maintained when controlling for the novel COVID-19 variant outbreak in the South East of England. This analysis indicates that changes in the role of deprivation and monthly reported COVID-19 over time cases may be linked to two government policies: (1) the premature easing of national restrictions in July 2020 when cases were still high in the most deprived areas in England and (2) the introduction of a regional tiered system in October predominantly in the North of England.

A weeklater after surgery patient's state worsens because of necrosis of autotransplant followed by patient's death. Our second patient - 69 years old, had oesophagus reresection in January 2020. Postoperative period with complications asthe patient has a leakage of newly formed anastomosis and we decided to insert SEMS for further support. Afterwards 4 months delay due to the pandemic, as patient comes for follow up only in July 2020. In this case we were ableto remove the embedded stent with stent-in-stent technique and instruct the patient to continue follow up every month fordilatation procedures.

Overall, the RV abnormalities were more common than LV abnormalities. The majority of the studies showed that there was a significant association between RV abnormalities and the severe forms and death of COVID-19.

METHODS A retrospective review was performed of patients presenting to the emergency room from December 2017 to February 2019 who underwent upper urinary tract decompression due to concern for infection in the setting of obstructing urolithiasis. Over 30 clinical parameters were assessed and a composite risk score was created. Univariate and multivariate forward stepwise regression were performed to identify predictors of true UTI. RESULTS 98 patients met inclusion criteria, of which a true UTI was identified in 50 (51%). The standard model of serum WBC>15 or temperature>38C had an AUC of only 0.67 to predict UTI. A multivariable regression-based 4-point risk score (1-point for each of the following: positive urinary gram stain, perinephric fat stranding on CT, serum C-reactive protein >21.95, and serum procalcitonin >0.36) had an AUC of 0.91 to predict UTI.

We aimed to describe the clinical presentation of COVID-19 among frail and nonfrail older hospitalised patients and to evaluate the potential association between frailty and clinical course, decision of treatment level with outcomes change in functional capacity and survival. METHODS: We performed a multi-center, retrospective cross-sectional cohort study examining data on clinical presentation and frailty-related domains for hospitalised people aged 75 + years with a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test. Frailty was assessed at admission using record-based MPI (rMPI) and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Decision on treatment level about invasive ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), change in CFS-score from admission to discharge, changed need of home care, and in-hospital, 30-day and 90-day mortality were registered. RESULTS: 100 patients (median age 82 years (IQR 78-86), 56% female) with COVID-19 were included. 54 patients were assessed moderately or severely frail (rMPI-score = 2 or 3) and compared to non-frail (rMPI-score = 1). At admission, frail patients presented more frequently with confusion. At discharge, functional decline measured by change in CFS and increased home care was more prevalent among frail than the non-frail. Decisions about no invasive ventilation or CPR were more prevalent among frail older patients with COVID-19 than non-frail. Ninety-day mortality was 70% among frail patients versus 15% in non-frail. CONCLUSION: Frailty seems to be associated with confusion, more frequent decisions about treatment level, larger functional decline at discharge and a higher mortality rate among older patients with COVID-19.","output":"Clinical presentation and outcomes of COVID-19 in older hospitalised patients assessed by the record-based multidimensional prognostic index, a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Health professionals participating in multidisciplinary team (MDT) cancer meetings may not be aware of their medicolegal obligations.

Overall, 529 of 530 eligible patients participated; these patients all attended a 1st follow-up appointment ~6 months post-conization, at which time high-risk human-papillomavirus (HPV) testing, liquid-based cytology and colposcopy were performed. Full data on margin excision status, other aspects of initial treatment and comorbidity were obtained. At least one subsequent follow-up was attended by 88% of patients. A total of 22 recurrent cases were detected during follow-up. Detected recurrence was the outcome of focus for multiple logistic regression analysis, with odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) computed. Four significant independent risk factors were identified: Age 45 years or above (OR=3.5, 95% CI=1.3C9.9), one or both unclear or uncertain margins (OR=5.3, 95% CI=2.0C14.2), positive HPV at 1st follow-up (OR=5.8, 95% CI=2.0C16.8), and abnormal cytology at 1st follow-up (OR=3.9, 95% CI=1.4C11.0). Bivariate analysis revealed that persistent HPV positivity was associated with recurrence (P<0.01). These findings indicated that incomplete excision of the CIN lesion may warrant more intensive subsequent screening, regardless of early post-conization HPV findings. Although early post-conization positive HPV was a powerful, independent predictor of recurrent high-grade CIN, over one-third of the patients with detected recurrence had a negative early post-conization HPV finding. These patients returned for routine screening, at which time, in most cases, HPV status was positive, thus indicating the need for repeated HPV evaluation. Especially during the on-going pandemic, home vaginal self-sampling is recommended. Particular attention is required for women aged 45 years. In addition, although not statistically significant, relevant comorbidities, especially autoimmune conditions, warrant consideration in clinical decision-making.

Survey topics spanned socio-demographic data, students' health status and behavior, COVID-19 specific impact, concerns, information sources, adherence to containment measures, and trust in government bodies. Group comparisons by gender and multivariate ordinal regression models assessing adherence to restrictions of mobility and social contacts were conducted (n = 2373). RESULTS: Mean age was 26.4 (SD = 5.6), 70% were female. 43.5% reported some concern about their own health, 2.7% stated major worries. Women experienced more conflicts (p < 0.000) and, enjoyed time with the family more (p < 0.000). Men felt less locked up (p = 0.001).

Citation-related publication productivity metrics, such as the h-index, are increasingly used for hiring, salary, grants, retention, promotion, and tenure decisions. Exploring sex differences in these metrics across academic medicine provides deeper insight into why differences are observed in career outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To systematically examine the available literature on sex differences in h-index of academic faculty physicians across all medical specialties and all levels of academic rank. DATA SOURCES: Medical literature with the term h-index found in PubMed and published between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2018, was used. STUDY SELECTION: A PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes), PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses), and MOOSE (Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) selection protocol was used to find observational studies that published h-indexes for faculty physicians that were stratified by sex. Studies were excluded if they were review articles, retracted, or unavailable online. Ultimately, 14 of 786 studies (1.78%) met the inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data from 9 studies across 16 specialties were examined using weighted random-effects meta-analyses. Five studies were excluded because of overlapping specialties with another study or because they were missing appropriate statistics for the meta-analysis. Four of these studies were included in qualitative synthesis to bring the total to 13 studies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary study outcome was the h-index. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 10 665 North American unique academic physicians across 9 different studies from the years 2009 to 2018. Of the 10 665 physicians, 2655 (24.89%) were women. Summary effect sizes for mean h-indexes of men and women and mean h-index difference between men and women were determined for all faculty physicians and at each academic rank. Overall, female faculty had lower h-indexes than male faculty (mean difference, ?4.09; 95% CI, ?5.44 to ?2.73; P < .001). When adjusting for academic rank, female faculty still had lower h-indexes than male faculty at the ranks of assistant professor (mean difference, ?1.3; 95% CI, ?1.90 to ?0.72; P < .001), associate professor (mean difference, ?2.09; 95% CI, ?3.40 to ?0.78; P = .002), and professor (mean difference, ?3.41; 95% CI, ?6.24 to ?0.58; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, women had lower h-indexes than men across most specialties and at all academic ranks, but it is unclear why these differences exist. These findings suggest that future investigation should be conducted regarding the causes of lower h-indexes in women and that interventions should be developed to provide a more equitable environment for all physicians regardless of sex.","output":"Sex Differences in Academic Productivity Across Academic Ranks and Specialties in Academic Medicine: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Per la Sanit pubblica l'anno 2020 appena trascorso si pu rappresentare con due avvenimenti: la grande pandemia da coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (cos chiamato per la sua immagine circondata da \\"spine\\") e il bicentenario della nascita di Florence Nightingale (cos chiamata perch nata a Firenze il 12 maggio 1820).

Based on this, our objective was to build a computable co-occurrence network embeddings to assist association detection amongst COVID-19 related biomedical entities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Leveraging a Linked Data version of CORD-19 (i.e., CORD-19-on-FHIR), we first utilized SPARQL to extract co-occurrences among chemicals, diseases, genes, and mutations and build a co-occurrence network. We then trained the representation of the derived co-occurrence network using node2vec with four edge embeddings operations (L1, L2, Average, and Hadamard). Six algorithms (Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Multi-layer Perceptron) were applied to evaluate performance on link prediction. An unsupervised learning strategy was also developed incorporating the t-SNE and DBSCAN algorithms for case studies. RESULTS: Random Forest classifier showed the best performance on link prediction across different network embeddings. For edge embeddings generated using the Average operation, Random Forest achieved the optimal average precision of 0.97 and F1 score of 0.90. For unsupervised learning, 63 clusters were formed with silhouette score of 0.128. Significant associations were detected for five coronavirus infectious diseases in their corresponding subgroups.

The program was standardized to include (1) in-person initial consultation with a clinical dietitian; (2) in-person review with a diabetes specialist doctor; (3) 1 continuous glucose monitoring device; (4) access to the mobile app for dietary intake and physical activity tracking, and communication via messaging with the dietitian and doctor; and (5) context-sensitive digital health coaching over the mobile app. Medical support was rendered to the patients on an as-needed basis when they required advice on adjustment of medications. Measurements of weight, height, and glycated hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) were conducted at 2 in-person visits at the start and end of the program. At the end of the program, patients were asked to complete a short acceptability feedback survey to understand the motivation for joining the program, their satisfaction, and suggestions for improvement. RESULTS: Over a 4-week recruitment period, 130 individuals were screened, the enrollment target of 30 patients was met, and 21 patients completed the program and were included in the final analyses; 9 patients were lost to follow-up (full data were not available for the final analyses). There were no differences in the baseline characteristics between patients who were included and excluded from the final analyses (age category: P=.23; gender: P=.21; ethnicity: P>.99; diabetes status category: P=.52, medication adjustment category: P=.65; HbA(1c) category: P=.69; BMI: P>.99). The 21 patients who completed the study rated a mean of 9.0 out of 10 on the Likert scale for both satisfaction questions. For the Yes-No question on benefit of the program, all of the patients selected Yes. Mean HbA(1c) decreased from 7.6% to 7.0% (P=.004). There were no severe hypoglycemia events (glucose level <3.0 mmol/L) reported. Mean weight decreased from 76.8 kg to 73.9 kg (P<.001), a mean decrease of 3.5% from baseline weight. Mean BMI decreased from 27.8 kg/m(2) to 26.7 kg/m(2) (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The personalized mHealth program was feasible, acceptable, and produced significant reductions in HbA(1c) (P=.004) and body weight (P<.001) in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Such mHealth programs could overcome challenges posed to chronic disease management by COVID-19, including disruptions to in-person health care access.","output":"A Personalized Mobile Health Program for Type 2 Diabetes During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Single-Group PreCPost Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Limited data are available for pregnant women affected by SARS-CoV-2.

There are six fontanels in the newborn skull, namely anterior, posterior, two mastoid, and two sphenoid fontanels. The anterior fontanel is the largest, prominent, and most important for clinical evaluation. Sex, race, genetics, gestational age, and region are the principal factors that influence anterior fontanel size. There exist inconclusive findings on the size of anterior fontanel in newborns. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the pooled mean size of anterior fontanel among term newborns and to identify the pooled mean difference of anterior fontanel size between males and females. Methods: PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, Science Direct, JBI Library, embase, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched. All essential data were extracted using a standardized data extraction format. The heterogeneity across studies was assessed using the Cochrane Q test statistic, I2 test statistic, and p-values. A fixed-effect model and random effect model were used to estimate the pooled mean size of anterior fontanel and the pooled mean difference between male newborns and female newborns, respectively. To deal with heterogeneity, sub-group analysis, meta-regression analysis, and sensitivity analysis were considered. JBI quality appraisal checklist was used to evaluate the quality of studies. Results: In this meta-analysis, 8, 661 newborns were involved in twenty-six studies. Among studies, 13 conducted in Asia, 7 in Africa, 5 in America, and 1 in Europe. The pooled mean size of anterior fontanel was 2.58 cm (95% CI: 2.31, 2.85 cm). The pooled mean size of anterior fontanel for Asia, Africa, America, and Europe region was 2.49, 3.15, 2.35, and 2.01 cm, respectively. A statistically significant mean difference was detected between male and female newborns (D + L pooled MD = 0.15 cm, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.29 cm). Conclusion: The pooled estimate of this review does provide the mean value of the anterior fontanel size in the newborns. There was a statistically significant mean fontanel size difference between male and female newborns. Therefore, male newborns had a significantly larger mean size than female newborns.","output":"Anterior Fontanel Size Among Term Newborns: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This cohort study examines the association of participation in a summer college academic enrichment program with diversity of students in medical school and intent to practice in underserved areas.","output":"Association of Summer College Academic Enrichment Program Participation With Medical Student Diversity and Intent to Practice in Underserved Areas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an important risk factor for both severe disease and death due to coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19). About 19 million of the 463 million persons living with DM (PLWD) globally are found in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The dual burden of DM and poverty in SSA, coupled with the rising number of cases of COVID-19 in this region, predisposes PLWD to inadequate care and poor glycemic controls due to the disruption to the economy and the healthcare system. The risk of acquisition of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) among PLWD is the same as those in the general population. Therefore, the standard preventive measures outlined by the World Health Organization must be strictly adhered to. In addition, maintaining adequate glycemic control is associated with better outcomes in DM patients with COVID-19. In SSA, adequate supply of DM medication while patients stay at home is crucial to minimize routine hospital visits since DM clinics are usually overcrowded and have longer waiting times, which may maximize risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to PLWD across the region. Psychosocial support to improve adherence to anti-hyperglycemic medications may improve COVID-19 outcomes. Trained healthcare professionals should diagnose and evaluate severity comprehensively as well as evaluate the need for in-patient care for PLWD with COVID-19 irrespective of disease severity. Due to the increased risk of severe disease, a multi-disciplinary approach to the management of COVID-19 in PLWD should preferably be in a setting where close monitoring is available, typically a health facility, even for mild disease that may require home management according to local guidelines. In conclusion, DM complicates COVID-19 outcomes and the on-going COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects DM care at individual and global public health levels.

There was a more positive intention towards Oxford-AstraZeneca in relation to Sinovac-CoronaVac. For the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, less uncertainty regarding vaccines and greater fear of COVID-19 led the study to predict 26.6% of the intention to use it. In the case of Sinovac-CoronaVac, in addition to the previous variables, a left-wing political orientation led to a prediction of 44.3% in the intention to use it.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and result of MTSR in acute cardioembolic stroke. Methods Twenty consecutive patients with acute cardioembolic stroke were treated by MTSR. The angiographic outcome was assessed by thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) grade. TICI grade 2a, 2b, or 3 with a measurable thrombus that was retrieved was considered as a success when MTSR was performed in the site of primary vessel occlusion, and TICI grade 2b or 3 was considered as a success when final result was reported. Clinical and radiological results were compared between two groups divided on the basis of final results of MTSR. Persistent thrombus compression sign on angiogram was defined as a stenotic, tapered arterial lumen whenever temporary stenting was performed. The clinical outcomes were assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months. Results The failure rate of MTSR was 20% (4/20) and other modalities, such as permanent stenting, were needed. Final successful recanalization (TICI grade 2b or 3) was 80% when other treatments were included. The rate of good outcome (mRS2) was 35% at the 3-month follow-up. Failure of MTSR was significantly correlated with persistent thrombus compression sign (p=0.001).

Currently, the predictive value of body temperature for acute infection is inhibited by failure to account for other readily available variables that affect temperature values. In this proof-of-concept study, we sought to improve COVID-19 pretest probability estimation by incorporating covariates known to be associated with body temperature, including patient age, sex, comorbidities, month, and time of day. METHODS: For patients discharged from an academic hospital emergency department after testing for COVID-19 in March and April of 2020, we abstracted clinical data. We reviewed physician documentation to retrospectively generate estimates of pretest probability for COVID-19. Using patients' COVID-19 PCR test results as a gold standard, we compared AUCs of logistic regression models predicting COVID-19 positivity that used: (1) body temperature alone; (2) body temperature and pretest probability; (3) body temperature, pretest probability, and body temperature-relevant covariates. Calibration plots and bootstrap validation were used to assess predictive performance for model #3. RESULTS: Data from 117 patients were included. The models' AUCs were: (1) 0.69 (2) 0.72, and (3) 0.76, respectively. The absolute difference in AUC was 0.029 (95% CI -0.057 to 0.114, p=0.25) between model 2 and 1 and 0.038 (95% CI -0.021 to 0.097, p=0.10) between model 3 and 2.

The RCT compared the DES with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and provisional bare-metal stent (BMS) placement. BACKGROUND Local drug delivery for superficial femoral artery lesions has been investigated with the intent of limiting restenosis similarly to DES for the coronary arteries. One-year outcomes of DES in the superficial femoral artery are promising, but longer-term benefits have not been established. METHODS In the RCT, patients were randomly assigned to primary DES implantation (n = 236) or PTA (n = 238). Acute PTA failure occurred in 120 patients, who underwent secondary randomization to DES (n = 61) or BMS (n = 59) placement. The single-arm study enrolled 787 patients with DES treatment. RESULTS Compared with the control group, the primary DES group demonstrated significantly superior 2-year event-free survival (86.6% vs. 77.9%, p = 0.02) and primary patency (74.8% vs. 26.5%, p < 0.01). In addition, the provisional DES group exhibited superior 2-year primary patency compared with the provisional BMS group (83.4% vs. 64.1%, p < 0.01) and achieved higher sustained clinical benefit (83.9% vs. 68.4%, p = 0.05).

According to the result of GO and KEGG enrichment, PPI network and Networkanalyst, we screened out six genes (IFI6, MX1, XAF1, HERC6, IFI44L, IFI44). Interestingly, among PLA2R, THSD7A and NELL1, which are the target antigens of podocyte in MN, the expression level of NELL1 in MN glomerulus is significantly higher than that of LN, while there is no significant difference in the expression level of PLA2R and THSD7A. Conclusion: Our study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of MN and LN by analyzing the differences in gene expression levels between MN and LN kidney samples, and is expected to be used to prepare an animal model of MN that is more similar to human.","output":"Exploring the Differences in Molecular Mechanisms and Key Biomarkers Between Membranous Nephropathy and Lupus Nephritis Using Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is one of the most serious issues worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 was first observed in Wuhan, China, on December 31, 2019;this disease has been rapidly spreading worldwide. Iran was the first Middle East country to report a coronavirus death, it has been severely affected. Therefore, it is crucial to forecast the pandemic spread in Iran. This study aims to develop a prediction model for the daily total confirmed cases, total confirmed new cases, total deaths, total new deaths, growth rate in confirmed cases, and growth rate in deaths. The model utilizes SARS-CoV-2 daily data, which are mainly collected from the official website of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control from February 20 to May 04, 2020 and other appropriated references. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) is employed to forecast the trend of the pandemic spread. The ARIMA model predicts that Iran can easily exhibit an increase in the daily total confirmed cases and the total deaths, while the daily total confirmed new cases, total new deaths, and growth rate in confirmed cases/deaths becomes stable in the near future. This study predicts that Iran can control the SARS-CoV-2 disease in the near future.

We changed our approach to single-port donor nephrectomy in 2009 and have compared outcomes with traditional multiple-port laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. BACKGROUND The development of minimally invasive surgical techniques to procure kidneys from living donors has allowed expansion of living donor renal transplantation to account for one third of all renal transplants. Recent technical advancement allows for the entire surgical procedure to be done through a single incision contained within the umbilicus. METHODS We compared outcomes from 135 single-port donor nephrectomies with an immediately preceding cohort of 100 multiple-port laparoscopic donor nephrectomies. Survey data were collected from both groups to compare outcomes. Additional comparisons were made to total center experience with 1300 laparoscopic donor nephrectomies. RESULTS A total of 135 patients completed successful single-port donor nephrectomy without major complication or open conversion. Another 16 patients required additional port placement because of excessive intra-abdominal fat or limited abdominal domain. Compared with multiple-port donor nephrectomy, single-port patients had similar operative times to cross clamp (2.8 vs 2.6 hours; P = 0.11) that normalized after a learning curve of approximately 50 cases. Recipient creatinine levels were similar at 1 week and 1 month posttransplant. Although 36-Item Short Form Health Surveys demonstrated no significant differences, additional survey data revealed that single-port patients were more satisfied with cosmetic outcomes (P < 0.01) and the overall donation process (P = 0.01). Single-port approach had similar outcomes compared with all previous laparoscopic donor nephrectomies. CONCLUSIONS Single-port donor nephrectomy can be integrated as a standardized approach for renal donation without additional donor risk, and with benefits of improved patient satisfaction with cosmetic and overall outcomes. Although the primary benefit is cosmetic, (a single incision predominantly contained within the umbilicus) outcomes justify application for kidney donors in experienced centers and may motivate additional living kidney donation.","output":"Single-port donor nephrectomy provides improved patient satisfaction and equivalent outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How, in 20 short years, did we go from the promise of the internet to democratize access to knowledge and make the world more understanding and enlightened, to the litany of daily horrors that is today's internet?

Considering the transmission route of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, a similar increased risk can be hypothesized for other respiratory infections. However, no study has specifically assessed the risk of contracting COVID-19 within the dental profession. METHODS: An online survey was conducted within a population of French dental professionals between April 1 and April 29, 2020. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to explore risk indicators associated with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and COVID-19-related clinical phenotypes (i.e. phenotypes present in 15% or more of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases). RESULTS: 4172 dentists and 1868 dental assistants responded to the survey, representing approximately 10% of French oral health-care workers. The prevalence of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was 1.9% for dentists and 0.8% for dental assistants. Higher prevalence was found for COVID-19-related clinical phenotypes both in dentists (15.0%) and dental assistants (11.8%). Chronic kidney disease and obesity were associated with increased odds of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, whereas working in a practice limited to endodontics was associated with decreased odds. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, use of public transportation and having a practice limited to periodontology were associated with increased odds of presenting a COVID-19-related clinical phenotype. Moreover, changes in work rhythm or clinical practice were associated with decreased odds of both outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Although oral health-care professionals were surprisingly not at higher risk of COVID-19 than the general population, specific risk indicators could exist, notably among high aerosol-generating dental subspecialties such as periodontology. Considering the similarities between COVID-19-related clinical phenotypes other viral respiratory infections, lessons can be learned from the COVID-19 pandemic regarding the usefulness of equipping and protecting oral health-care workers, notably during seasonal viral outbreaks, to limit infection spread. IMPACT: Results from this study may provide important insights for relevant health authorities regarding the overall infection status of oral health-care workers in the current pandemic and draw attention to particular at-risk groups, as illustrated in the present study. Protecting oral health-care workers could be an interesting public health strategy to prevent the resurgence of COVID-19 and/or the emergence of new pandemics.","output":"Prevalence and risk indicators of first-wave COVID-19 among oral health-care workers: A French epidemiological survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, cancer care has had to adapt rapidly given the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Surgeons (ACS) issuing recommendations to postpone nonurgent surgeries.

Many published commentaries have proposed plans for pandemic control that are primarily based on mortality rates among older individuals without considering long-term morbidity among individuals of all ages. Reliable estimates of such morbidity are important for patient care, prognosis, and development of public health policy. Objective: To conduct a systematic review of studies examining the frequency and variety of persistent symptoms after COVID-19 infection. Evidence Review: A search of PubMed and Web of Science was conducted to identify studies published from January 1, 2020, to March 11, 2021, that examined persistent symptoms after COVID-19 infection. Persistent symptoms were defined as those persisting for at least 60 days after diagnosis, symptom onset, or hospitalization or at least 30 days after recovery from the acute illness or hospital discharge. Search terms included COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, long-term, after recovery, long-haul, persistent, outcome, symptom, follow-up, and longitudinal. All English-language articles that presented primary data from cohort studies that reported the prevalence of persistent symptoms among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection and that had clearly defined and sufficient follow-up were included. Case reports, case series, and studies that described symptoms only at the time of infection and/or hospitalization were excluded. A structured framework was applied to appraise study quality. Findings: A total of 1974 records were identified; of those, 1247 article titles and abstracts were screened. After removal of duplicates and exclusions, 92 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility; 47 studies were deemed eligible, and 45 studies reporting 84 clinical signs or symptoms were included in the systematic review. Of 9751 total participants, 5266 (54.0%) were male; 30 of 45 studies reported mean or median ages younger than 60 years. Among 16 studies, most of which comprised participants who were previously hospitalized, the median proportion of individuals experiencing at least 1 persistent symptom was 72.5% (interquartile range [IQR], 55.0%-80.0%). Individual symptoms occurring most frequently included shortness of breath or dyspnea (26 studies; median frequency, 36.0%; IQR, 27.6%-50.0%), fatigue or exhaustion (25 studies; median frequency, 40.0%; IQR, 31.0%-57.0%), and sleep disorders or insomnia (8 studies; median 29.4%, IQR, 24.4%-33.0%). There were wide variations in the design and quality of the studies, which had implications for interpretation and often limited direct comparability and combinability. Major design differences included patient populations, definitions of time zero (ie, the beginning of the follow-up interval), follow-up lengths, and outcome definitions, including definitions of illness severity. Conclusions and Relevance: This systematic review found that COVID-19 symptoms commonly persisted beyond the acute phase of infection, with implications for health-associated functioning and quality of life. Current studies of symptom persistence are highly heterogeneous, and future studies need longer follow-up, improved quality, and more standardized designs to reliably quantify risks.","output":"Assessment of the Frequency and Variety of Persistent Symptoms Among Patients With COVID-19: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modern information systems have to support the user in managing, understanding and interacting with, more and more data. Visualization could help users comprehend information more easily and reach conclusions in relative shorter time. However, the bigger the data is, the harder the problem of visualizing it becomes.

We present a novel family of algorithms that produces spiral-like layouts where the biggest values are placed in the centre of the spiral and the smaller ones in the peripheral area, while respecting the relative sizes. The derived layout is suitable not only for the visualization of medium-sized collections of values, but also for collections of values whose sizes follow power-law distribution because it makes evident the bigger values (and their relative size) and it does not leave empty spaces in the peripheral area which is occupied by the majority of the values which are small. Therefore, the produced drawings are both informative and compact. The algorithm has linear time complexity (assuming the values are sorted), very limited main memory requirements, and produces drawings of bounded space, making it appropriate for interactive visualizations, and visual interfaces in general.

Here, we present a case of a retiform purpuric patch on the sacrum/buttocks in a hospitalized patient prior to subsequent diagnosis of COVID-19 and an eventual fatal disease course. Two lesional biopsy specimens at different time points in the disease course revealed thrombotic vasculopathy, despite therapeutic anticoagulation. Detailed histopathologic evaluation using immunohistochemical markers suggest the etiology of the vasculopathy involves both persistent complement activation and platelet aggregation, which possibly promote ongoing thrombus formation. This case highlights that sacral/buttock retiform purpuric patches may be a presenting sign of infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus and may represent an ominous sign supporting a future severe disease course. In addition, biopsy specimen findings at separate time points demonstrate that cutaneous vasculopathy may persist despite adequate systemic anticoagulation, possibly due to the combination of persistent complement and platelet activation. Finally, occlusive thrombi in sacral/buttock retiform purpuric patches may contribute to future ulceration and significant cutaneous morbidity in patients who survive COVID-19.","output":"Development of sacral/buttock retiform purpura as an ominous presenting sign of COVID-19 and clinical and histopathologic evolution during severe disease course"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is currently causing an unprecedented pandemic.

We aimed to evaluate the association between the COVID-19-related lockdown and pregnancy outcomes in maternity hospitals in France. Study design: This was a retrospective cohort study from six tertiary referral hospitals in different regions of France. Three 55-day periods were compared: pre-lockdown from 22 January 2020, lockdown from 17 March 2020, and post-lockdown from 11 May 2020 to 4 July 2020. We included all women who delivered singleton or multiple pregnancies, who delivered at 24 weeks of gestation and with birthweights 500 g. We documented gestational ages at the delivery of liveborn and stillborn infants (stillbirths). These were categorized as having a very low birthweight (VLBW, <1500 g), or a low birthweight (LBW, <2500 g). Adjustments were made for place of birth, maternal age, parity and diabetes, and hypertensive disorders, as well as for multiple pregnancies. Results: In total, 11,929 women delivered in the six selected centers. This figure is constituted of 4093, 3829, and 4007 deliveries in the pre-lockdown (1), peri-lockdown (2), and post-lockdown (3) periods, respectively. There were no differences in pregnancy outcomes between these three periods. Overall, birth rates <27(+6) weeks, between weeks 28(+0) and 31(+6), and between 32(+0) and weeks 36(+6) were 1.0%, 1.9%, and 4.4%, respectively. After adjustment, these rates were stable between periods 1 and 2 (adjusted odds ratio, aOR 0.90; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.69C1.19) and between periods 2 and 3 (aOR 1.04; 95% CI 0.80C1.36). Although more VLBW neonates were born during lockdown (3.5% vs. 2.6%, p = 0.03), this difference did not persist after adjustment (aOR 0.84, CI 95% 0.64C1.10). The LBW rates were similar during the three periods at 12.5% overall. The stillbirth rate was unaffected by the lockdown. Conclusion: The pregnancy outcomes (preterm birth, LBW, VLBW, and stillbirth rates) were not modified by the COVID-19 lockdown in our cohort study in France.

SETTING: Interviews by telephone or video call in Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty participants: 16 women, 93% reporting white ethnicity, 18+ years, 47% from deprived areas, 47% reported mental and/or physical health conditions. RESULTS: Four main themes described the impact of physical distancing restrictions on (1) health behaviours; (2) healthcare access; (3) physical health; and (4) mental health. Changes in impact over the two time points were compared. For example, health behaviours in May/June, such as reduced physical activity and increased calorie intake, appeared to improve by August. From May/June to August, an increasing number of participants expressed dissatisfaction with healthcare they received. Participants with existing physical health conditions reported continued negative impact of restrictions on their physical health. All participants reported some negative mental health impact, mostly anxiety. An increasing number reported mental health improvements in August, with those with mental health conditions or under 30 years reporting improvement most frequently. CONCLUSIONS: In line with previous research, our participants felt able to return to prepandemic health habits. Our findings corroborate evidence of reduced preventive healthcare use and help-seeking behaviours. People with existing health conditions appear to be most vulnerable to negative mental and physical health impacts of physical distancing. These negative impacts and periods of unhealthy behaviours have potential long-term consequences, especially among already underserved groups.

Evasion strategies can involve preventing initial virus detection, via the disruption of the Toll\\\\like receptors or the retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG\\\\I) \\\\like receptors, or by avoiding the initial production of the ligands recognized by these receptors. An alternative approach is to preclude IFN production by disarming or degrading the transcription factors involved in the expression of IFN, such as interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)/IRF7, nuclear factor\\\\B (NF\\\\B), or ATF\\\\2/c\\\\jun, or by inducing a general block on host cell transcription. Viruses also oppose IFN signalling, both by disturbing the type I IFN receptor and by impeding JAK/STAT signal transduction upon IFN receptor engagement. In addition, the global expression of IFN\\\\stimulated genes (ISGs) can be obstructed via interference with epigenetic signalling, and specific ISGs can also be selectively targeted for inhibition. Finally, some viruses disrupt IFN responses by co\\\\opting negative regulatory systems, whereas others use antiviral mechanisms to their own advantage.

Through statistical data analysis, the status of COVID-19 cases in Baguio City, Philippines can be monitored which can help the local government fight virus transmission. From March 2 to November 15, 2020, there have been 2,805 confirmed cases recorded C 1,588 asymptomatic, 1,168 mild cases, 10 severe cases, and 39 deaths. For the said period, this paper describes the rate of infection using the 7-day moving average, two-week growth rate, daily attack rate, case doubling time, and case fatality rate. Moreover, it characterizes the distribution of infection based on sex, age, common symptoms, occupation, severity, and travel history of cases. Results show an increasing trend for the number of cases. Most of the positive cases recorded are males, individuals aged 20-29 years old, asymptomatic, and working outside their homes. Cough is found to be the most reported symptom of symptomatic cases. Local transmission of the virus within the city is also evident. ? 2021 American Institute of Physics Inc..

To help inform state policies and initiatives aimed at physician deployment during COVID-19, we used predictions of peak patient volume for hospitals and intensive care units (ICU) and regional physician workforce estimates to measure patient to physician ratios at the peak of the pandemic for each state. METHODS: We estimated the number of potentially available physicians based on Medicare Part B billings for the care of hospitalized and critically ill patients in 2017, adjusted for attrition due to exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and relevant experience. We used estimates from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation to determine the number of hospitalized and ICU patients expected at the peak of the pandemic in each state. We then determined the expected ratio of patients per physician for each state at the peak of the pandemic. RESULTS: The median number of hospitalized patients per physician was 13 (low estimate) to 18 (high estimate). At the high estimate of hospitalized patients, 35 states would have a patient to physician ratio of more than 15:1 (patient to physician ratios above 15:1 have been associated with poor outcomes). For ICU patients, the median number of patients each physician would treat across states would be 8C11 patients. Nine states would experience patient to physician ratios above 15:1 at the higher end of estimates. Patient-physician ratios decreased if the available physician pool was broadened to include physicians without recent experience treating hospitalized patients, and physicians in surgical specialties with experience treating acutely hospitalized patients. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: We estimate that most states will have sufficient physician capacity to manage hospitalized patients at the peak of the pandemic. However, at the high estimates of hospitalized patients, some Midwestern states will experience high patient to provider ratios that may adversely affect patient outcomes.

In elderly individuals, information on the immunogenicity of booster vaccinations is limited. In countries where the CoronaVac inactivated vaccine is the primary vaccine, the appropriate boosting regimen is not clear. Immunologic studies of the effects of booster vaccination against VOCs, particularly Delta and Omicron, following CoronaVac in elderly individuals are helpful for policy makers. In this study, we determined the immune responses against VOCs following ChAdOx-1 or BNT162b2 boosting in elderly individuals previously immunized with CoronaVac. RESULTS: Before boosting, the median % inhibition of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against the wild-type (WT), Alpha, Beta, Delta and Omicron variants in the ChAdOx-1 and BNT162b2 groups was 52.8% vs. 53.4, 36.6% vs. 39.9, 5.2% vs. 13.7, 34.3% vs. 44.9, and 20.8% vs. 18.8%, respectively. After boosting with ChAdOx-1 or BNT162b2, the % inhibition of NAbs were increased to 97.3% vs. 97.4, 94.3% vs. 97.3%, 79.9 vs. 93.7, 95.5% vs. 97.5, and 26.9% vs. 31.9% for WT, Alpha, Beta, Delta and Omicron variants, respectively. Boosting with BNT162b2 induced significantly higher NAb levels than boosting with ChAdOx-1 against the Alpha, Beta and Delta variants but not the WT and Omicron variants. NAb levels against Omicron variant were not significantly different before and after boosting with ChAdOx-1 or BNT162b2. To evaluate T-cell responses, S peptides of the WT, Alpha, Beta and Delta variants were used to stimulate T cells. Upon stimulation, the expression of IL-17A in CD8 T cells was higher in the BNT162b2 group than in the ChAdOx-1 boosting group. However, IFN- production in CD4 and CD8 T cells did not significantly differ under all vaccination regimens. The expression of FasL in CD4 T cells, but not CD8 T cells, was higher in the BNT162b2-boosted group. CONCLUSION: Boosting with either ChAdOx-1 or BNT162b2 in CoronaVac-primed healthy elderly individuals induced high NAb production against all examined VOCs except Omicron. BNT162b2 stimulated higher NAb and some T-cell responses than ChAdOx-1. Vaccine boosting is, therefore, recommended for elderly individuals previously immunized with CoronaVac.

Here, to explore the role of the gut microbiome in the host immune responses in COVID-19, we conducted shotgun metagenomic sequencing and immune profiling of 14 severe/critical and 24 mild/moderate COVID-19 cases as well as 31 healthy control samples. We found that the diversity of the gut microbiome was reduced in severe/critical COVID-19 cases compared to mild/moderate ones. We identified the abundance of some gut microbes altered post-SARS-CoV-2 infection and related to disease severity, such as Enterococcus faecium, Coprococcus comes, Roseburia intestinalis, Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides cellulosilyticus and Blautia obeum. We further analyzed the correlation between the abundance of gut microbes and host responses, and obtained a correlation map between clinical features of COVID-19 and 16 severity-related gut microbe, including Coprococcus comes that was positively correlated with CD3(+)/CD4(+)/CD8(+) lymphocyte counts. In addition, an integrative analysis of gut microbiome and the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) showed that genes related to viral transcription and apoptosis were up-regulated in Coprococcus comes low samples. Moreover, a number of metabolic pathways in gut microbes were also found to be differentially enriched in severe/critical or mild/moderate COVID-19 cases, including the superpathways of polyamine biosynthesis II and sulfur oxidation that were suppressed in severe/critical COVID-19.

Modifications are needed to overcome the drawbacks of pure online teaching. Our study aimed at testing a hybrid method of live online practical anatomy sessions in which an element of face-to-face teacher-student interaction is maintained. METHODS: We performed an experiment with a one-group design in which medical and medical laboratory sciences students were taught different practical anatomy topics using either purely online or live in front of students teaching sessions (LISTS). Students performance and perceptions were quantitatively assessed. RESULTS: For 108 medical laboratory sciences students, the mean quiz scores were significantly higher for the topics taught by the LISTS approach (p = 0.025). For two groups of 13 and 17 medical students, the performance in exams was significantly higher for the topics taught using the LISTS method (p = 0.000 and 0.011, respectively) with large effect sizes. Students perceptions of preference, enjoyment, and satisfaction were all in favor of LISTS.

We here described our 24-month experience SILS cholecystectomy. METHODS Between February 2009 and 2011, patients referred for cholecystectomy to the General and Endocrine Unit of our institution who agreed to undergo SILS were included in a prospective study. All operations were performed by the same surgical team specially trained in this type of surgery. The umbilicus was the sole point of entry for all patients. The same operative technique was used in all patients. Data of patients undergoing SILS cholecystectomy were compared with those from an uncontrolled group of patients undergoing standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the same study period. RESULTS The SILS and standard cholecystectomy groups included 120 patients each. SILS was performed in all patients and none of them required conversion to an open procedure. The median operating time of 45 minutes in the SILS group was not significantly different from that in the standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. We suture fascial edge with simple stitches under direct vision, thus reducing the risk of incisional hernia in SILS group (P=.046).

We initially characterized RBD(330-526 )biochemically and( )investigated its thermal stability, humoral and T cell immune response of various RBD protein formulations (with or without adjuvant) to evaluate the inherent immunogenicity and immunomodulatory effect. Our result showed that the purified RBD immunogen is stable up to 72 h, without any apparent loss in affinity or specificity of interaction with the ACE2 receptor. Upon immunization in mice, RBD generates a high titer humoral response, elevated IFN- producing CD4+ cells, cytotoxic T cells, and robust neutralizing antibodies against live SARS-CoV-2 virus. Our results collectively support the potential of RBD(330-526) as a promising vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Comparative Immunomodulatory Evaluation of the Receptor Binding Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein; a Potential Vaccine Candidate Which Imparts Potent Humoral and Th1 Type Immune Response in a Mouse Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this paper is to perform a meta\\\\analysis regarding the chest computed tomography (CT) manifestations of coronavirus disease\\\\2019 (COVID\\\\19) pneumonia patients.

Multivariate logistic regressions were used to calculate significant predictors of the outcomes of interest. A gender and AB0 blood type difference in adverse vaccine reactions was found. The multivariate logistic regression model showed that female gender, city residence, blood type A+ and B?, and chronic underlying medical conditions or comorbidities were more strongly implicated in the occurrence of adverse reactions, whereas blood type 0 Rh+ or blood type A Rh? were protective factors of adverse reactions to the Vaxzevria vaccine. Both genders did not show serious adverse reactions to the Vaxzevria vaccine.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in service delivery, working practices and decision-making role of diagnostic radiographers during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an electronic cross-sectional survey of diagnostic radiographers working in CT during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was open for 6-weeks, with radiographers from all geographical regions encouraged to respond. The questionnaire explored social distancing, patient scheduling and departmental organisation; PPE usage; recognition and escalation of COVID-19 changes, patient management pathways and any training. Additionally, we sought the personal perspectives of radiographers through free text comments. RESULTS: Following exclusions, 180 responses were analysed. Service delivery changes included social distancing (59.4%; n= 107), restriction of referrals to those considered time-critical (63.3%; n=114) and dedicated COVID-19 scanners (66.1%; n=119). Working practices were impacted by a need to implement PPE, although variation in PPE worn for different scenarios was seen. Half of the radiographers were routinely reviewing asymptomatic outpatient images for common COVID-19 signs, despite 63.5% of respondents not receiving formal training. Ad hoc patient pathways were in place in 90.5% of cases with 35% indicating that this was radiographer-led. CT staff had experienced anxiety, fatigue, and low morale, but praised teamwork. CONCLUSIONS: Radiographers were able to reduce the risk of transmission through social distancing, designated scanners, and PPE. This study has demonstrated that despite variance in practice, radiographers play a key role in identifying and triaging high-risk patients.","output":"Computed tomography during the COVID-19 pandemic: A survey of changes to service delivery, working practices and decision-making role of radiographers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine the plausibility of aerial transmission of pathogens (including the SARS-CoV-2 virus) through respiratory droplets that might be carried by exhaled e-cigarette aerosol (ECA). Given the lack of empiric evidence on this phenomenon, we consider available evidence on cigarette smoking and respiratory droplet emission from mouth breathing through a mouthpiece as convenient proxies to infer the capacity of vaping to transport pathogens in respiratory droplets. Since both exhaled droplets and ECA droplets are within the Stokes regime, the ECA flow acts effectively as a visual tracer of the expiratory flow. To infer quantitatively the direct exposure distance, we consider a model that approximates exhaled ECA flow as an axially symmetric intermittent steady starting jet evolving into an unstable puff, an evolution that we corroborate by comparison with photographs and videos of actual vapers. On the grounds of all this theoretical modeling, we estimate for low-intensity vaping (practiced by 80C90% of vapers) the emission of 6C210 (median 39.9, median deviation 67.3) respiratory submicron droplets per puff and a horizontal distance spread of 1C2 m, with intense vaping possibly emitting up to 1000 droplets per puff in the submicron range with a distance spread over 2 m. The optical visibility of the ECA flow has important safety implications, as bystanders become instinctively aware of the scope and distance of possible direct contagion through the vaping jet.","output":"Modeling Aerial Transmission of Pathogens (Including the SARS-CoV-2 Virus) through Aerosol Emissions from E-Cigarettes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A middle-aged woman presented with symptomatic complete heart block and underwent an uneventful dual chamber pacemaker implantation.

In this study, we estimated the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in a representative population-based cohort of Iquitos, one of the regions with the highest mortality rates from COVID-19 in Peru, where a devastating number of cases occurred in March 2020. Methods: We conducted a population-based study of transmission tested each participant using the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test from Orient Gene Biotech and used survey analysis methods to estimate seroprevalence accounting for the sampling design effect and test performance characteristics. Here we report results from the baseline (13 to 18 July 2020) and the first month of follow-up (13 to 18 August 2020) study. Findings: We enrolled a total of 716 participants and estimated seroprevalence of 70.0% (95% CI: 67.0%-73.4%), a test-re-test positivity of 65% (95% CI: 61.0%-68.3%), and an incidence of new exposures of 1.8% (95% CI: 0.9%-3.2%) data that suggest that transmission is ongoing but is occurring at low levels. We observed significant differences in the seroprevalence between age groups, with participants 18 to 29 years of age having lower seroprevalence than children <12 years of age (Prevalence ratio =0.85 [PR]; 95% CI: 0.73-0.98), suggesting that children were not refractory to infection in this setting. Interpretation: Iquitos demonstrates one of the highest rates of seroprevalence of COVID-19 worldwide.

DESIGN: Multicentre prospective observational study of mechanically ventilated ward patients. Modified Poisson regression was used to assess association between nurse to patient ratio (NPR) and 90-day mortality, adjusted for designated medical team, Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) triage priority and centre effect. NPR was divided into low (1:9.6 to 1:10), medium (1:6 to 1:8) and high (1:2.6). Sensitivity analysis was conducted for pneumonia with or without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to assess magnitude of association. SETTING: 7 acute public hospitals in Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS: All 485 mechanically ventilated patients in wards from participating hospitals between 18 January 2016 and 17 April 2016 were recruited. Three hundred patients were included after excluding patients with limitation of therapy within 24 hours of intubation. MAIN OUTCOMES: 90-day mortality, Mortality Prediction Model III Standardised mortality ratio (MPMIII(0) SMR). RESULTS: 201 patients died within 90 days after intubation (67.0%, 95% CI 61.5% to 72.1%), with MPMIII(0) SMR 1.88, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.17.

Blended learning (BL) combines these two mediums and provides flexible learning opportunities. While faculty development programs have utilized these two mediums separately, BL has not been fully implemented locally until recently. Identifying elements that enable or hinder faculty within a newly implemented BL program can enhance the learning experience and support professional development. The current study aims to identify how junior and senior faculty members of medical departments at a Turkish university perceive enablers and barriers in a new BL faculty development program. Methods This research is a multiple case study with qualitative inquiry using in-depth interviews and thematic analysis. Using a BL approach, the research team designed faculty development activities based on the Four-Component Instructional Design model. Participants accessed the activities on a Moodle learning management system. Faculty experiences in blended faculty development were examined. The study group consisted of 26 participants, with 14 junior faculty in case 1 and 12 senior faculty in case 2 from different medical departments at a Turkish university. Data were collected and analyzed using qualitative methods. Results This study identified enablers and barriers within a BL faculty development program. While participants identified three barriers, they identified eight enabling elements in a BL program. A lack of time was the most critical barrier to participation in the program. Setting goals for personal development and obtaining skills in teaching were essential enablers within the BL program. Conclusion The use of an online platform to support face-to-face faculty development programs is beneficial in several ways for faculty. Faculty developers can utilize BL to foster engagement and motivate faculty for increased participation, especially if they seek to mitigate known barriers to a successful BL program.

Ideally, forecasts should be robust across time and locations. During the COVID-19 pandemic in England, it is an ongoing concern that demand for hospital care for COVID-19 patients in England will exceed available resources. METHODS: We made weekly forecasts of daily COVID-19 hospital admissions for National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England between August 2020 and April 2021 using three disease-agnostic forecasting models: a mean ensemble of autoregressive time series models, a linear regression model with 7-day-lagged local cases as a predictor, and a scaled convolution of local cases and a delay distribution. We compared their point and probabilistic accuracy to a mean-ensemble of them all, and to a simple baseline model of no change from the last day of admissions. We measured predictive performance using the Weighted Interval Score (WIS) and considered how this changed in different scenarios (the length of the predictive horizon, the date on which the forecast was made, and by location), as well as how much admissions forecasts improved when future cases were known. RESULTS: All models outperformed the baseline in the majority of scenarios. Forecasting accuracy varied by forecast date and location, depending on the trajectory of the outbreak, and all individual models had instances where they were the top- or bottom-ranked model. Forecasts produced by the mean-ensemble were both the most accurate and most consistently accurate forecasts amongst all the models considered. Forecasting accuracy was improved when using future observed, rather than forecast, cases, especially at longer forecast horizons. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming no change in current admissions is rarely better than including at least a trend. Using confirmed COVID-19 cases as a predictor can improve admissions forecasts in some scenarios, but this is variable and depends on the ability to make consistently good case forecasts. However, ensemble forecasts can make forecasts that make consistently more accurate forecasts across time and locations. Given minimal requirements on data and computation, our admissions forecasting ensemble could be used to anticipate healthcare needs in future epidemic or pandemic settings.","output":"Comparative assessment of methods for short-term forecasts of COVID-19 admissions in England at the local level"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cheryl Cohen talks to Gary Humphreys about how the COVID-19 pandemic is encouraging respiratory disease surveillance collaboration in South Africa.","output":"Cheryl Cohen: tracking respiratory diseases, informing policy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clostridioides difficile is the leading cause of health-care-associated infection throughout the developed world and contributes significantly to patient morbidity and mortality.

Among these, strong emphasis has been placed on pro-inflammatory cytokines, associating severity of COVID-19 with so-called \\"cytokine storm.\\" More recently, peptide bradykinin, its dysregulated signaling or \\"bradykinin storm,\\" has emerged as a primary mechanism to explain COVID-19-related complications. Unfortunately, this important development may not fully capture the main molecular players that underlie the disease severity. To this end, in this focused review, several lines of evidence are provided to suggest that in addition to bradykinin, two closely related vasoactive peptides, substance P and neurotensin, are also likely to drive microvascular permeability and inflammation, and be responsible for development of COVID-19 pathology. Furthermore, based on published experimental observations, it is postulated that in addition to ACE and neprilysin, peptidase neurolysin (Nln) is also likely to contribute to accumulation of bradykinin, substance P and neurotensin, and progression of the disease.

This study aims to analyse the underlying epidemiological situation in India and explain possible impacts of policy and technological changes. METHODS: Secondary data were utilized, including recently published literature from government sources, the COVID-19 India website and local media reports. These data were analysed, with a focus on the impact of policy and technological interventions. RESULTS: The spread of COVID-19 in India was initially characterized by fewer cases and lower case fatality rates compared with numbers in many developed countries, primarily due to a stringent lockdown and a demographic dividend. However, economic constraints forced a staggered lockdown exit strategy, resulting in a spike in COVID-19 cases. This factor, coupled with low spending on health as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), created mayhem because of inadequate numbers of hospital beds and ventilators and a lack of medical personnel, especially in the public health sector. Nevertheless, technological advances, supported by a strong research base, helped contain the damage resulting from the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Following nationwide lockdown, the Indian economy was hit hard by unemployment and a steep decline in growth. The early implementation of lockdown initially decreased the doubling rate of cases and allowed time to upscale critical medical infrastructure. Measures such as asymptomatic testing, publicCprivate partnerships, and technological advances will be essential until a vaccine can be developed and deployed in India.

Low spending on health as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) meant there was a shortage of hospital beds and ventilators and a lack of medical personnel, especially in the public health sector. Nevertheless, technological advances, supported by a strong research base, helped contain the health and economic damage resulting from the pandemic. In the future, measures such as asymptomatic testing, publicCprivate partnerships, and technological advances will be essential until a vaccine against COVID-19 can be developed and rolled-out in India.","output":"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in India: An analysis of policy and technological interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: During the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the physicians are using various off-label therapeutics to manage COVID-19.

METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on CRC patients admitted between January 1, 2020 and May 3, 2020; the control group comprised patients admitted between January 1, 2019 and May 3, 2019. RESULTS: During the pandemic, outpatient volumes decreased significantly, especially those of nonlocal and elderly patients, whereas the number of patients who received chemotherapy and surgery remained the same. During the pandemic, 710 CRC patients underwent curative resection. The proportion of patients who received laparoscopic surgeries was 49.4%, significantly higher than the 39.5% during the same period in 2019. The proportion of major complication during the pandemic was not significantly different from that of the control group. The mean hospital stay was significantly longer than that of the control group. CONCLUSIONS: CRC patients confirmed to be infection-free can receive routine treatment. Using online medical counseling and appropriate identification, treatment and follow-up can be effectively maintained. Adjuvant and palliative chemotherapy should not be discontinued.

Observational studies, however, are subject to biases, even when there is no true effect. Cluster randomized trials provide a means to conduct valid hypothesis tests of the effect of interventions on community transmission. While they may only require a short duration, they often require large sample sizes to achieve adequate power. However, the sample sizes required for such tests in an outbreak setting are largely undeveloped and the question of whether these designs are practical remains unanswered. We develop approximate sample size formulae and simulation-based sample size methods for cluster randomized trials in infectious disease outbreaks. We highlight key relationships between characteristics of transmission and the enrolled communities and the required sample sizes, describe settings where cluster randomized trials powered to detect a meaningful true effect size may be feasible, and provide recommendations for investigators in planning such trials. The approximate formulae and simulation banks may be used by investigators to quickly assess the feasibility of a trial, and then more detailed methods may be used to more precisely size the trial. For example, we show that community-scale trials requiring 220 clusters with 100 tested individuals per cluster are powered to identify interventions that reduce transmission by 40% in one generation interval, using parameters identified for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. For more modest treatment effects, or settings with extreme overdispersion of transmission, however, much larger sample sizes are required.","output":"The required size of cluster randomized trials of non-pharmaceutical interventions in epidemic settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) expressing CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) can suppress antitumor immune responses and are associated with poor prognoses in several cancers.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN This study (NCT02476123) comprised dose-escalation (3+3 design) and expansion parts. Patients received nivolumab (3.0 mg/kg) every 2 weeks, with mogamulizumab (0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg in dose-escalation, 1.0 mg/kg in expansion) once weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks, until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary objective was safety; secondary objectives were antitumor effects, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity. Exploratory biomarker analyses were conducted. RESULTS 96 patients were enrolled (July 2015-November 2016): six patients in the dose-escalation part and 90 in the expansion part. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed in the dose-escalation part. Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 29% of patients in the expansion part (no grade 5 TRAEs). The most frequent TRAEs were rash (39%), rash maculo-papular (20%), diarrhea (13%), stomatitis (12%), and pruritus (11%). There were four (27%) confirmed tumor responses among 15 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and one confirmed and two unconfirmed responses among 15 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

The study group was divided into a restrictive (n = 39) and a non-restrictive subgroup (n = 40) based on TLC z-score. Restriction was associated with a history of intubation, neuromuscular blockade use and critical illness polyneuropathy. Restriction significantly improved over time, but was not resolved by 6 months (median TLC z-score of -2.2 [IQR: -2.7; -1.5] at 6 months versus -2.7 [IQR: -3.1; -2.1] at 10 weeks). LCI did not evolve between both follow-up visits. Symptoms and chest CT score improved irrespective of restriction. CONCLUSION: We observed a disconnect between the improvement of COVID-19 related symptoms, chest CT lesions, and corresponding lung function. While CT imaging is almost normalized at 6 months, a further reduction of pulmonary restriction may be hoped for beyond 6 months in those patients showing restriction at their first follow-up visit.","output":"Evolution of lung function and chest CT 6 months after COVID-19 pneumonia: Real-life data from a Belgian University Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world has gone through unprecedented changes since the global pandemic hit. During the early phase of the pandemic, the absence of known drugs or pharmaceutical treatments forced governments to introduce different policies in order to help reduce contagion rates and manage the economic consequences of the pandemic. This paper analyses the causal impact on mobility and COVID19 incidence from policy makers in Cataluna, Spain. We use annonimized phone-based mobility data together with reported incidence and apply a series of causal impact models frequently used in econometrics and policy evaluation in order to measure the policies impact.. We analyse the case of Cataluna and the public policy decision of closing all bars and restaurants down for a 5 week period between the 2020-16-10 to 2020-23-11. We find that this decision led to a significant reduction in mobility. It not only led to reductions in mobility but from a behavioural economics standpoint we highlight how people responded to the policy decision. Moreover, the policy of closing bars and restaurants slowed the incidence rate of COVID19 after a time lag has been taken into account. These finding are significant since governments worldwide want to restrict movements of people in order to slow down COVID19 incidence without infringing on their rights directly.","output":"Evaluating the policy of closing bars and restaurants in Cataluya and its effects on mobility and COVID19 incidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We are in unprecedented times with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has impacted public health, the economy and our society on a global scale. In addition, the impacts of COVID-19 permeate into our environment and wildlife as well. Here, we discuss the essential role of wastewater treatment and management during these times. A consequence of poor wastewater management is the discharge of untreated wastewater carrying infectious SARS-CoV-2 into natural water systems that are home to marine mammals. Here, we predict the susceptibility of marine mammal species using a modelling approach. We identified that many species of whale, dolphin and seal, as well as otters, are predicted to be highly susceptible to infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In addition, geo-mapping highlights how current wastewater management in Alaska may lead to susceptible marine mammal populations being exposed to the virus. Localities such as Cold Bay, Naknek, Dillingham and Palmer may require additional treatment of their wastewater to prevent virus spillover through sewage. Since over half of these susceptibility species are already at risk worldwide, the release of the virus via untreated wastewater could have devastating consequences for their already declining populations. For these reasons, we discuss approaches that can be taken by the public, policymakers and wastewater treatment facilities to reduce the risk of virus spillover in our natural water systems. Thus, we indicate the potential for reverse zoonotic transmission of COVID-19 and its impact on marine wildlife; impacts that can be mitigated with appropriate action to prevent further damage to these vulnerable populations.","output":"Pandemic danger to the deep: the risk of marine mammals contracting SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We believe that forensic medicine should play a significant role in the COVID-19 pandemic.

These systemic failures may be associated with cytokine release syndrome, characterized by hyperpyrexia, thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinemia, and the elevation of other inflammatory markers. Rhabdomyolysis with high fever is a complication that is rarely found in COVID-19. The exact relations of these clinical conditions in patients with COVID-19 remain unknown. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 36-year-old man with severe COVID-19 complicated by rhabdomyolysis and high fever. After admission, his condition continued to deteriorate, with a high body temperature. On day 9, the patient had elevated creatine kinase and myoglobin levels consistent with rhabdomyolysis (26,046 U/L and 3668 ng/mL, respectively). In addition to viral therapy, he was immediately treated with hydration. However, the patient had persistent fever and elevated creatine kinase levels. The patient was diagnosed with malignant hyperthermia as a late complication of COVID-19, although he had no hereditary predisposition to malignant hyperthermia or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The administration of dantrolene with muscle relaxation and anti-inflammatory function showed potential efficacy for rhabdomyolysis, high fever, and increased plasma inflammatory markers. CONCLUSIONS: Malignant hyperthermia is triggered by not only anesthetic agents but also viral infections. A possible mechanism of malignant hyperthermia is hypersensitivity of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. These include mutations in or the activation of the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor calcium release channel. Dantrolene is a ryanodine receptor antagonist and is used as an anti-inflammatory agent. The administration of dantrolene showed potential efficacy for rhabdomyolysis, high body temperature due to inflammation, and increased inflammatory markers. The underlying mechanism of the association of rhabdomyolysis and high fever in COVID-19 might be similar to the pathogenesis of malignant hyperthermia.","output":"Beneficial effects of dantrolene in the treatment of rhabdomyolysis as a potential late complication associated with COVID-19: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has propelled patient-facing research to shift to digital and telehealth strategies. If these strategies are not adapted for minority patients of lower socioeconomic status, health inequality will further increase. Patient-centered models of care can successfully improve access and experience for minority patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to present the development process and preliminary acceptability of altering in-person onboarding procedures into internet-based, remote procedures for a mobile health (mHealth) intervention in a population with limited digital literacy. METHODS: We actively recruited safety-net patients (English- and Spanish-speaking adults with diabetes and depression who were receiving care at a public health care delivery system in San Francisco, United States) into a randomized controlled trial of text messaging support for physical activity. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we modified the in-person recruitment and onboarding procedures to internet-based, remote processes with human support. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of how the composition of the recruited cohort might have changed from the pre-COVID-19 period to the COVID-19 enrollment period. First, we analyzed the digital profiles of patients (n=32) who had participated in previous in-person onboarding sessions prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Next, we documented all changes made to our onboarding processes to account for remote recruitment, especially those needed to support patients who were not very familiar with downloading apps onto their mobile phones on their own. Finally, we used the new study procedures to recruit patients (n=11) during the COVID-19 social distancing period. These patients were also asked about their experience enrolling into a fully digitized mHealth intervention. RESULTS: Recruitment across both pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods (N=43) demonstrated relatively high rates of smartphone ownership but lower self-reported digital literacy, with 32.6% (14/43) of all patients reporting they needed help with using their smartphone and installing apps. Significant changes were made to the onboarding procedures, including facilitating app download via Zoom video call and/or a standard phone call and implementing brief, one-on-one staff-patient interactions to provide technical assistance personalized to each patient's digital literacy skills. Comparing recruitment during pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, the proportion of patients with digital literacy barriers reduced from 34.4% (11/32) in the pre-COVID-19 cohort to 27.3% (3/11) in the COVID-19 cohort. Differences in digital literacy scores between both cohorts were not significant (P=.49). CONCLUSIONS: Patients of lower socioeconomic status have high interest in using digital platforms to manage their health, but they may require additional upfront human support to gain access. One-on-one staff-patient partnerships allowed us to provide unique technical assistance personalized to each patient's digital literacy skills, with simple strategies to troubleshoot patient barriers upfront. These additional remote onboarding strategies can mitigate but not eliminate digital barriers for patients without extensive technology experience.

While less frequent, the management of concomitant acute circulatory collapse has its own challenges and nuances. Early identification of acute circulatory collapse requires appropriate imaging and precise diagnosis of cardiogenic shock. Escalation to mechanical circulatory support such as intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), Impella and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have been useful in patients with circulatory collapse from COVID. Case Report 42-year-old obese female presented with COVID bronchopneumonia 6 days after a positive outpatient COVID swab. In the ED, she was given 3L of fluid bolus for severe sepsis and developed flash pulmonary edema requiring emergent intubation. She also developed hemodynamic collapse, requiring inotrope and pressor support and a TTE demonstrated severely depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of < 10%. Peripheral VA ECMO was placed, and the patient was transferred to our tertiary care center for further management of fulminant COVID-myocarditis with cardiogenic shock. Patient did not have any significant obstructive coronary artery disease on catheterization. An Impella CP was placed for hemodynamic support. She was started on a high-dose steroid, one dose of tocilizumab for severe LV dysfunction, two rounds of IVIG, and CRRT for volume removal. On Day 11 she had improved hemodynamics and there were signs of LV recovery, after which she was decannulated. Impella support was continued until there was complete recovery. Patient was extubated on Day 17 and continues to recover at a long-term acute care facility. Summary Acute circulatory collapse in COVID-19 infection is a serious complication with high morbidity and mortality. Early recognition of depressed LV function and cardiogenic shock by echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and/or Swan-Ganz catheter assessment is critical. ICU management of hemodynamic function, fluid status, and blood pressure management remains standardized, but prompt medical management with inotropes and mechanical support maximizes patient outcomes. IABP, Impella, and ECMO all play a key role in managing acute circulatory collapse.","output":"Acute Circulatory Collapse and Advanced Therapies in Patients with COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected more than 210 million people worldwide. An optimal therapeutic approach for COVID-19 remains uncertain, to date. Since the history of cancer was linked to higher mortality rates due to COVID-19, the establishment of a safe and effective vaccine coverage is crucial in these patients. However, patients with cancer were mostly excluded from vaccine candidates clinical trials. This systematic review aims to investigate the current available evidence about the immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with cancer (PsC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: All prospective studies that evaluated safety and efficacy of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were included, with immunogenicity after the first and the second dose as the primary endpoint, when available. RESULTS: Vaccination against COVID-19 for PsC seems overall safe and immunogenic after well-conducted vaccinations schedules. Yet, the seroconversion rate remains lower, lagged or both compared to the general population. Patients with hematologic malignancies, especially those receiving B cell depleting agents in the last 12 months are the most at risk of poor seroconversion.

Animal data have shown that hemostatic bandages reduce hemorrhage and improve survival. This article reports recent clinical observations regarding the efficacy and evolution of use of two new hemostatic bandages employed in the global war on terrorism. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort review of soldiers treated with either the QuikClot or HemCon hemostatic bandages between April and October 2006. Hemostatic dressings were placed on wounds either in the field or at the combat support hospital (CSH). RESULTS During the 6-month study period, 1691 trauma patients were admitted to the CSH. Fifty uses of hemostatic dressings in 44 patients (2.6% of admissions) were identified. Forty patients were treated with HemCon dressings, three patients with QuikClot, and one with both QuikClot and HemCon. Eighteen percent of the dressings were used in the field, predominantly on extremity wounds (7/8). In contrast, most dressings used in the CSH were for truncal wounds (26/36 patients). Hemostatic dressings were applied to extremity wounds in prehospital and hospital settings, either alone or in conjunction with tourniquets. In surviving patients (95%), the treating surgeon determined that the hemorrhage was either stopped or greatly decreased by use of hemostatic dressings. Two of the four patients treated with QuikClot had burns from exothermic reactions, while no adverse reactions were noted with HemCon. CONCLUSIONS Hemostatic agents stop or decrease bleeding. Whereas HemCon appears to be safe, QuikClot may produce superficial burns.

In addition, packaged (input) mRNAs appeared to serve as templates for their own early replication. mRNA replication continued throughout establishment and maintenance of persistent infection (studied for 120 days), which is consistent with our hypothesis that mRNA replication contributes mechanistically to virus persistence.

Given uncertainties around the severity of upcoming RSV bronchiolitis epidemics, debate exists whether palivizumab (RSV prophylaxis) should be administered to infants with Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH), who may be vulnerable due to lung hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension. AIM: To evaluate (1) if CDH infants have higher risk of admission with RSV bronchiolitis than infants in the general population; (2) if palivizumab prophylaxis may reduce this risk. METHODS: We included all eligible studies examining the risk(s) of RSV-positive bronchiolitis requiring hospital admission in (1) CDH infants without palivizumab prophylaxis versus infants in the general population and (2) CDH infants with prophylaxis versus CDH infants without prophylaxis. The primary outcome evaluated was the risk of admission with RSV bronchiolitis. Data are reported descriptively and meta-analysed when appropriate. RESULTS: Three eligible retrospective cohort studies were identified: one study found CDH to be an independent risk factor for RSV hospitalisation (odds ratio, 3.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.01-4.4); two studies compared RSV hospitalisation rates in CDH patients who had palivizumab versus those that did not. The pooled risk ratio was 1.11 (95% CI, 0.29-4.23; p = .88). Overall, the quality of evidence was considered poor and one study was industry funded.

METHODS Sixty-seven TA patients, who had IL-6 levels detected at the first visit and had a regular follow-up of at least 2 years, were enrolled. Data recorded up to March 31, 2019, including clinical presentations, laboratory indices, treatments, and radiological images were collected and used for analysis. The value of IL-6 in predicting disease relapse and imaging progression was analyzed. RESULTS IL-6 levels were positively related with disease activity index, including Kerr scores, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Patients were divided into three groups according to baseline serum IL-6 levels: low group (< 5.4 pg/mL, n = 29), medium group (5.4-11.5 pg/mL, n = 20), and high group (> 11.5 ng/mL, n = 18). Patients in the medium and high group had higher disease activity than those in the low group (p < 0.01). Baseline IL-6 levels were correlated with luminal stenosis (p < 0.05), although no significant correlations with long-term imaging progression were observed. Patients with more than 2 episodes of disease relapses were most commonly seen in the medium group (p < 0.05). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis indicated that medium and high IL-6 levels were positive predictors for disease relapse (HR 4.3, 95%CI 1.3-18.7 p = 0.07 for medium group; HR 2.1, 95% CI 0.7-48.9, p = 0.19 for high group) with disease status and treatment adjusted. CONCLUSIONS IL-6 may be a valuable predictor of TA disease relapse during long-term follow-up. Treatments targeted at IL-6 pathways might reduce disease relapse and have better prognostic effects for TA.Key Points? Positive relationships between IL-6 levels and disease activity index, including Kerr scores, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, etc. were indicated.? Medium and high baseline IL-6 levels were valuable for predicting disease relapse during the 2-year follow-up.? Baseline IL-6 levels were positively correlated with luminal stenosis on imaging.","output":"The value of interleukin-6 in predicting disease relapse for Takayasu arteritis during 2-year follow-up."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter analyzes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases alongside environmental and demographic data in a case study of Italy, the first European country to experience a rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths in 2020.

METHOD: We prospectively studied all microbiologically-confirmed COVID-19 patients in Singapore, who were referred for any neurological complaint within three months of COVID-19 onset. Neurological diagnoses and relationship to COVID-19 was made by consensus guided by contemporaneous literature, refined using recent case definitions. RESULTS: 47,572 patients (median age 34 years, 98% males) were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Singapore between 19 March to 19 July 2020. We identified 90 patients (median age 38, 98.9% males) with neurological disorders; 39 with varying certainty of relationship to COVID-19 categorised as: i) Central nervous system syndromes-4 acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and encephalitis, ii) Cerebrovascular disorders-19 acute ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack (AIS/TIA), 4 cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), 2 intracerebral haemorrhage, iii) Peripheral nervous system-7 mono/polyneuropathies, and a novel group, iv) Autonomic nervous system-4 limited dysautonomic syndromes. Fifty-one other patients had pre/co-existent neurological conditions unrelated to COVID-19. Encephalitis/ADEM is delayed, occurring in critical COVID-19, while CVT and dysautonomia occurred early in relatively mild infection. AIS/TIA was variable in onset, occurring in patients with differing COVID-19 severity; remarkably 63.2% were asymptomatic. CVT was more frequent than expected and occurred in mild/asymptomatic patients. There were no neurological complications in all 81 paediatric COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 neurology has a wide spectrum of dysimmune-thrombotic disorders. We encountered relatively few neurological complications, probably because our outbreak involved largely young men with mild/ asymptomatic COVID-19.

Whether this asymmetry persisted later in the pandemic or was accompanied with a loss of access to care remains unknown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using patient data from a multicenter healthcare system in New York City. We identified all established pediatric or adult neurology patients with at least two prior outpatient visits between June 16th, 2019 and March 15th, 2020 using our electronic medical record. For this established pre-COVID cohort, we identified telephone, in-person, video TN or emergency department visits and hospital admissions for any cause between March 16th and December 15th, 2020 (COVID period). We determined clinical, sociodemographic, income, and visit characteristics. Our primary outcome was video TN utilization, and our main secondary outcome was loss to follow-up during the COVID period. We used multivariable logistic regression to model the relationship between patient-level characteristics and both outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 23,714 unique visits during the COVID period, which corresponded to 14,170 established patients from our institutional Neurology clinics during the pre-COVID period. In our cohort, 4,944 (34.9%) utilized TN and 4,997 (35.3%) were entirely lost to follow-up during the COVID period. In the adjusted regression analysis, Black or African-American race [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.60, 97.5%CI 0.52C0.70], non-English preferred language (aOR 0.49, 97.5%CI 0.39C0.61), Medicaid insurance (aOR 0.50, 97.5%CI 0.44C0.57), and Medicare insurance (aOR 0.73, 97.5%CI 0.65C0.83) had decreased odds of TN utilization. Older age (aOR 0.98, 97.5%CI 0.98C0.99), female sex (aOR 0.90 97.5%CI 0.83C0.99), and Medicaid insurance (aOR 0.78, 0.68C0.90) were associated with decreased odds of loss to follow-up. CONCLUSION: In the first 9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, we found sociodemographic patterns in TN utilization that were similar to those found very early in the pandemic. However, these sociodemographic characteristics were not associated with loss to follow-up, suggesting that lack of TN utilization may not have coincided with loss of access to care.","output":"Trends in the Utilization of Teleneurology and Other Healthcare Resources Prior to and During the COVID-19 Pandemic in an Urban, Tertiary Health System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To examine risk perception and negative emotions during two periods of the COVID-19 and provide plausible intervention points for the psychological aid under a stressful condition.

The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score has been used to predict the clinical outcomes of patients with multiple organ failure requiring intensive care. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics, risk factors, and relationship between the SOFA score and the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Methods: : Clinical variables were compared between patients with mild and severe COVID-19. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for severe COVID-19. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze risk factors for hospital-related death. Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival differences were assessed by the log-rank test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the SOFA score in different situations were drawn, and the area under the ROC curve was calculated. Results: : The median SOFA score of all patients was 2 (IQR, 1-3). Patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited a significantly higher SOFA score than patients with mild COVID-19 [3 (IQR, 2-4) vs 1 (IQR, 0-1);P< 0.001]. The SOFA score increased the risk of severe COVID-19, with an odds ratio of 5.851 (95% CI: 3.044-11.245;P <0.001). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the SOFA score in predicting severe COVID-19 [cutoff value = 2;AUC = 0.908 (95% CI: 0.857-0.960);sensitivity: 85.20%;specificity: 80.40%] and the risk of death in COVID-19 patients [cutoff value = 5;AUC = 0.995 (95% CI: 0.985-1.000);sensitivity: 100.00%;specificity: 95.40%]. Regarding the 60-day mortality rates of patients in the two groups classified by the optimal cutoff value of the SOFA score (5), patients in the high SOFA score group (SOFA score 5) had a significantly greater risk of death than those in the low SOFA score group (SOFA score <5). Conclusion: The SOFA score could be used to evaluate the severity and 60-day mortality of COVID-19.

MRI scan was used to identify the area of fungal infiltration and presence of necrotic material. Early surgery in the form of transconjunctival orbitotomy was performed for disease in the infraorbital fissure area, and superior transcutaneous lid crease approach was employed for disease in the superomedial orbit or medial orbit. Most patients had lid edema, ptosis, and proptosis; this resolved with the medication. Systemic antifungals were given and the follow-up ranged from 1 to 5 months. RESULTS: The ptosis, proptosis, and lid edema subsided in all, except in one patient who had residual ptosis and in one who had residual ophthalmoplegia. Vision deficit did not occur in any patient.

OBJECTIVE To examine long-term survival in a large multisite cohort of patients who underwent bariatric surgery compared with matched control patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In a retrospective cohort study, we identified 2500 patients (74% men) who underwent bariatric surgery in Veterans Affairs (VA) bariatric centers from 2000-2011 and matched them to 7462 control patients using sequential stratification and an algorithm that included age, sex, geographic region, body mass index, diabetes, and Diagnostic Cost Group. Survival was compared across patients who underwent bariatric surgery and matched controls using Kaplan-Meier estimators and stratified, adjusted Cox regression analyses. EXPOSURES Bariatric procedures, which included 74% gastric bypass, 15% sleeve gastrectomy, 10% adjustable gastric banding, and 1% other. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All-cause mortality through December 2013. RESULTS Surgical patients (n = 2500) had a mean age of 52 years and a mean BMI of 47. Matched control patients (n = 7462) had a mean age of 53 years and a mean BMI of 46. At the end of the 14-year study period, there were a total of 263 deaths in the surgical group (mean follow-up, 6.9 years) and 1277 deaths in the matched control group (mean follow-up, 6.6 years). Kaplan-Meier estimated mortality rates were 2.4% at 1 year, 6.4% at 5 years, and 13.8% at 10 years for surgical patients; for matched control patients, 1.7% at 1 year, 10.4% at 5 years, and 23.9% at 10 years. Adjusted analysis showed no significant association between bariatric surgery and all-cause mortality in the first year of follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.28 [95% CI, 0.98-1.68]), but significantly lower mortality after 1 to 5 years (HR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.36-0.56]) and 5 to 14 years (HR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.39-0.58]). The midterm (>1-5 years) and long-term (>5 years) relationships between surgery and survival were not significantly different across subgroups defined by diabetes diagnosis, sex, and period of surgery. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among obese patients receiving care in the VA health system, those who underwent bariatric surgery compared with matched control patients who did not have surgery had lower all-cause mortality at 5 years and up to 10 years following the procedure.

The method takes a collection of highly detailed compartmental models (with different initial conditions, initial times, epidemiological parameters and numerous compartments) and learns a model with few compartments which best fits the available health data and which is used to provide the forecasts. We illustrate the promising potential of the approach to the spread of the current COVID-19 pandemic in the case of the Paris region during the period from March to November 2020, in which two epidemic waves took place. ABSTRACT: We propose a forecasting method for predicting epidemiological health series on a two-week horizon at regional and interregional resolution. The approach is based on the model order reduction of parametric compartmental models and is designed to accommodate small amounts of sanitary data. The efficiency of the method is shown in the case of the prediction of the number of infected people and people removed from the collected data, either due to death or recovery, during the two pandemic waves of COVID-19 in France, which took place approximately between February and November 2020.

Exploring daily ridership data of the Seoul bus transportation system, along with the number of infected patients and search volume in web portals, we observe that ridership decreased abruptly while attention was heavily focused online. Then this temporal reduction recovered exponentially with a characteristic time of 3 weeks when newly confirmed cases began to decrease. We also find with the data of ranked keywords of web portals that areas with severely reduced ridership tended to cluster and spatiotemporal variations of such clusters were highly associated with general hospitals where MERS patients were treated. On the other hand, the spatial reduction in ridership relaxed algebraically with the distance from a general hospital while the outbreak was severe. We further probe the influence of the epidemic outbreak in the framework of linear response theory, which relates the responses to the epidemic outbreak (perturbation) with correlations in the absence of the perturbation. Indeed, the spatial correlation function of the ridership changes is observed to follow a power law, sharing the same exponent as the spatial relaxation of the response function. This new theoretical approach offers a useful tool for understanding responses of public transportation system to epidemic or accidental disasters.","output":"Spatiotemporal behaviors of the ridership of a public transportation system during an epidemic outbreak: case of MERS in Seoul"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel 2019 SARS-2-CoV causing COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on the entire world.

We aimed to investigate the association of Type D personality, job and organizational determinants with burnout, stress and work engagement as outcome factors among emergency physicians and hospital physicians working in intensive care and surgery departments. We specifically focused on our group of emergency physicians. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, self-report questionnaires were distributed via social media using a specific survey link to 531 Belgian hospital physicians working at the Emergency Department, Intensive Care, and Surgery Department between October 21, 2018, and April 11, 2019. The survey instrument included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, job characteristics, organizational factors, job satisfaction, social support by supervisors and colleagues (Leiden Quality of Work Questionnaire for Medical Doctors) and Type D personality (Distress Scale-14) and as outcomes burnout (Oldenburg Burnout Inventory) and work engagement (Utrecht Work Engagement Scale). A multiple regression analysis was used to examine the associations between the determinants and each of the outcomes with emergency physicians as the study population. RESULTS: Eligible data were available for 436 questionnaires and involved 212 emergency physicians, 162 other hospital physicians (Intensive Care and Surgery Department) and 62 residents concerning both groups of physicians. Type D personality ranged from 28.5 to 29.1% in emergency physicians and other hospital physicians. Additionally, even after correcting for job-related and organizational factors, emergency physicians with Type D personality were seven times more likely to have a high risk for burnout. CONCLUSION: As a result, this study offers a new perspective on the associations between burnout, stress and Type D personality. Type D personality might be a personality-related risk factor for burnout among emergency physicians. Therefore, we recommend enhanced prevention measures that take into account this individual factor in the further development of coaching programs. Improving the professional well-being of emergency physicians is necessary, especially in the scope of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which has put a high demand on acute and emergency care departments.","output":"Burnout, stress and Type D personality amongst hospital/emergency physicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Sepsis induces pulmonary P2X7 receptor (P2X7 R) expression, and P2X7 R-knockout reduced lung inflammation in mice. This study investigated expression of circular RNA (circRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) in sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) treated with a P2X7 R antagonist. METHODS Sepsis was induced by tracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the mice were then divided into two groups: without (sepsis + DMSO) or with P2X7 R antagonist treatment (sepsis + P2X7 A). Sham mice was administrated sterile normal saline. Serum levels of interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), pathological changes, cell apoptosis, and P2X7 R expression in lung were assessed, following with RNA-seq and bioinformatics analyses. RT-qPCR was used to validate circRNAs and mRNAs RESULTS: Compared with sham group, LPS-induced sepsis produced obvious pathological changes in lung tissue, increased apoptotic lung cells, serum TNF- and IL-1 levels, and P2X7 R expression; P2X7 R antagonism significantly ameliorated these changes. RNA-seq identified many dysregulated circRNAs and mRNAs during sepsis, while changed with P2X7 R antagonism. RT-qPCR confirmed that Mus musculus (mmu)_circ_0001679, mmu_circ_0001212, Pln, Cdh2, and Nprl3 expression were significantly increased in sepsis + DMSO group compared with that in the sham group but were decreased in the sepsis + P2X7 A group compared with that in the sepsis + DMSO group. circRNA-miRNA-mRNA coexpression network indicated that mmu_circ_0001679 may regulate Nprl3 and that mmu_circ_0001212 may similarly regulate Pln, Cdh2, and Nprl3 as a ceRNA.

Recently, a connection between the limbic part of the STN and side effects of DBS-STN has been increasingly recognized. Animal studies have shown that DBS-STN influences behavior and provokes neurochemical changes in regions of the limbic system. Some of these regions, which are activated during DBS-STN, are involved in neuroimmunomodulation. The therapeutic effects of DBS-STN in PD treatment are clear, but the influence of DBS-STN on peripheral immunity has not been reported so far. In this study, we examined the effects of unilateral DBS-STN applied in male Wistar rats with 6-hydroxydopamine PD model (DBS-6OHDA) and rats without nigral dopamine depletion (DBS) on corticosterone (CORT) plasma concentration, blood natural killer cell cytotoxicity (NKCC), leukocyte numbers, lymphocyte population and apoptosis numbers, plasma interferon gamma (IFN-), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-) concentration. The same peripheral immune parameters we measured also in non-stimulated rats with PD model (6OHDA). We observed peripheral immunity changes related to PD model. The NKCC and percentage of T cytotoxic lymphocytes were enhanced, while the level of lymphocyte apoptosis was down regulated in 6OHDA and DBS-6OHDA groups. After DBS-STN (DBS-6OHDA and DBS groups), the plasma CORT and TNF- were elevated, the number of NK cells and percentage of apoptosis were increased, while the number of B lymphocytes was decreased. We also found, changes in plasma IFN- and IL-6 levels in all the groups. These results suggest potential peripheral immunomodulative effects of DBS-STN in the rat model of PD.

METHODS: Pregnant people were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG during antenatal care or delivery in Seattle, Washington with Abbott Architect chemiluminescent immunoassay which provides quantitative index (positive 1.4). Participants with IgG+ results or identified with RT-PCR+ results via medical records were invited to enroll in a longitudinal evaluation of antibody responses. We report preliminary results of an ongoing seroprevalence and longitudinal study with planned 18-month follow-up. RESULTS: Between September 9, 2020CMay 7, 2021, we screened 1304 pregnant people; 62 (4.8%) tested SARS-CoV-2 IgG+, including 28 (45%) with known prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among participants testing IgG+, median age was 32 years (interquartile range [IQR] 26C35) and median gestational age was 21 weeks (IQR 12C38) at screening; median IgG index was 3.2 (IQR 2.1C4.9, range 1.4C9.9), including 3.9 (IQR 2.3C5.8) among those with vs. 2.7 (IQR 1.9C4.2) among those without prior RT-PCR+ results (p=0.05 by Wilcoxon rank-sum). Of 30 longitudinal study participants enrolled, 24 tested IgG+ at baseline (75% with prior RT-PCR+ result) and 6 tested IgG- on enrollment but were identified as previously RT-PCR+ via medical records; 24/30 (80%) reported previous symptoms. Of 24 participants testing IgG+ at baseline, 14 (58%) had first follow-up IgG results at median of 66 days (IQR 42C104) since initial testing, with median IgG index of 2.0 (IQR 1.0C3.8). 9/14 (64%) participants with repeat IgG testing remained IgG+ at first follow-up (280 days after first RT-PCR+ result for those with and 104 days after first IgG detection for those without prior RT-PCR+ results), while 5/14 (26%) had a negative Abbott IgG test at a median of 81 days (IQR 75C112) since initial testing.

The effect this has on urologists and the patients they care for is not fully understood and presents the challenge of prioritizing the most urgent cases. We aim to review the impact on urology services and evaluate strategies to minimize disruption. RECENT FINDINGS: Various healthcare systems have been forced to postpone treatment for many urological conditions as resources are dedicated to the treatment of COVID-19. Training has been postponed as staff are reallocated to areas of need. Face-to-face contact is largely minimized and innovative, virtual communication methods are used in the outpatient setting and multidisciplinary team meetings. Surgical practice is changing because of the risks posed by COVID-19 and procedures can be prioritized in a nonurgent, low priority, high priority or emergency category. SUMMARY: Although the COVID-19 pandemic will inevitably affect urological services, steps can be taken to mitigate the impact and prioritize the patients most in need of urgent care.

Several epidemiological studies have linked PFOA to different lung injuries and diseased conditions. However, the implication of PFOA in affecting epigenetic regulators and SARS-CoV-2 infection pathways in the lung are unknown. The present work explores the accumulation of PFOA in lungs and changes in mRNA expression of DNA methylation regulator genes DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) and ten-eleven translocation (Tets) along with the membrane proteins angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (Ace2) and transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (Tmprss2) genes involved in the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. CD1 mice were orally exposed to 5 and 20 mg/kg/day PFOA for 10 days and the lung tissues were analyzed using LCMS, qPCR, and pyrosequencing techniques. PFOA was shown to accumulate in the lung tissues and increase in a dose-dependent manner. Dnmts and Tets were significantly downregulated upon at least one of the PFOA dosing concentration, whereas Ace2 and Tmprss2 show significant increase in their expression level. Further, CpG islands in the promotor region of Tmprss2 exhibited significant hypomethylation in PFOA treated groups, which supports its increased gene expression level. Current study reveals the implication of PFOA induced DNA methylation changes in lungs and their possible role in upregulation of Ace2 and Tmprss2. It is possible that increased expression of these membrane receptors due to PFOA exposure can lead to higher susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infections.","output":"PFOA induces alteration in DNA methylation regulators and SARS-CoV-2 targets Ace2 and Tmprss2 in mouse lung tissues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spike (S) protein of human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) mediates both cell attachment by binding to its receptor hACE2 and membrane fusion during virus entry. We have previously identified the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and residues important for RBDChACE2 association. Here, we further characterized the S protein by investigating the roles of the cytoplasmic tail and 19 residues located in the RBD in protein accumulation, receptor binding, and pseudotype virus entry. For these purposes, we first identified an entry-efficient S gene template from a pool of gene variants and used it as a backbone to generate a series of cytoplasmic tail deletion and single residue substitution mutants. Our results showed that: (i) deletion of 18 aa from the C-terminus enhanced the S protein accumulation and virus entry, which might be due to the deletion of intracellular retention signals; (ii) further deletion to residue 29 also enhanced the amount of S protein on the cell surface and in virion, but reduced virus entry by 25%, suggesting that residues 19C29 contributes to membrane fusion; (iii) a 29 aa-deletion mutant had a defect in anchoring on the plasma membrane, which led to a dramatic decrease of S protein in virion and virus entry; (iv) a total of 15 residues (Y498, V499, V531, G534, G537, D538, S540, G575, S576, E582, W585, Y590, T591, V593 and G594) within RBD were important for receptor binding and virus entry.

However, there is a shortage of research into how acculturative stress might affect international students quality of life in light of their academic standing and experience. The lack of research is particularly pronounced among Chinese international students, representing the largest body of international students studying in the United States (U.S.). Thus, to bridge the research gap, this study aims to examine the interplay between international students acculturative stress, academic standing, and quality of life among a nationally representative sample of Chinese international students studying in the United States. METHODS: An online survey that gauges Chinese international students levels of acculturative stress, academic standing, and quality of life was developed. Over 350 higher education institutions across the United States were approached, including public universities, private universities, and community colleges, among which approximately 220 institutions responded positively and supported survey distribution. A total of 751 students completed the survey. Multiple regression analyses were carried out to examine the associations between students acculturative stress, academic standing, and quality of life. RESULTS: Findings reveal that acculturative stress negatively affects all four domains of Chinese international students quality of life, irrespective of their academic standing. Data analyses also show that compared to masters and doctoral students, undergraduates experience the highest levels of acculturative stress. Furthermore, a significant difference emerged among undergraduate and doctoral international students acculturative stress levels, but not among undergraduate and masters students, or masters and doctoral students. CONCLUSION: Our study found that, compared to masters and doctoral students, undergraduates had more significant acculturative stress associated with lower levels of quality of life. This finding highlights the potentially positive role of academic experience C while acculturative stress deteriorates international students quality of life, students academic standing and experience could be the protective factor in the equation. Future research could further examine how universities and colleges can capitalize on their academic apparatuses and resources to improve international students academic performance and students acculturation experience and quality of life.","output":"Chinese International Students in the United States: The Interplay of Students Acculturative Stress, Academic Standing, and Quality of Life"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this concise review, we present an overview of research on dream recall/affect and of the hypothalamicCpituitaryCadrenal (HPA) axis, discussing caveats regarding the action of hormones of the HPA axis (mainly cortisol and its free form, cortisol-binding globulin and glucocorticoid receptors).

DESIGN Phase II randomised, single blinded, parallel clinical trial. SETTING Eight tertiary neonatal intensive care units in eight European countries. PARTICIPANTS 166 extremely preterm infants born before 28 weeks of gestation: 86 were randomised to cerebral NIRS monitoring and 80 to blinded NIRS monitoring. The only exclusion criterion was a decision not to provide life support. INTERVENTIONS Monitoring of cerebral oxygenation using NIRS in combination with a dedicated treatment guideline during the first 72 hours of life (experimental) compared with blinded NIRS oxygenation monitoring with standard care (control). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure was the time spent outside the target range of 55-85% for cerebral oxygenation multiplied by the mean absolute deviation, expressed in %hours (burden of hypoxia and hyperoxia). One hour with an oxygenation of 50% gives 5%hours of hypoxia. Secondary outcomes were all cause mortality at term equivalent age and a brain injury score assessed by cerebral ultrasonography. RANDOMISATION Allocation sequence 1:1 with block sizes 4 and 6 in random order concealed for the investigators. The allocation was stratified for gestational age (<26 weeks or  26 weeks). BLINDING Cerebral oxygenation measurements were blinded in the control group. All outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation. RESULTS The 86 infants randomised to the NIRS group had a median burden of hypoxia and hyperoxia of 36.1%hours (interquartile range 9.2-79.5%hours) compared with 81.3 (38.5-181.3) %hours in the control group, a reduction of 58% (95% confidence interval 35% to 73%, P<0.001).

METHODS: Patients who complained cough or chest pain with or without fever were enrolled after laboratory confirmed of SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid via qRT-PCR. Chest computed tomography (CT) was then performed to classify the patients into mild, moderate and severe pneumonia groups according to the interim management guideline. Then linear regression models were applied to analyze the association between c-reactive protein (CRP) levels and severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: When compared to mild pneumonia, the adjusted-Odds Ratio were 11.46, p = 0.029 and 23.40, p = 0.025 in moderate and severe pneumonia, respectively. The area under receiver operation curve was 0.898 (95% CI 0.835, 0.962, p < 0.001). Higher plasma CRP level indicated severe COVID-19 pneumonia and longer inpatients duration.

To minimize the risk of health problems, visitors should be able to access information on the health care systems of the places they visit. Most short-term overseas visitors are young adults. Although they are not very likely to get sick from noncommunicable diseases, they are at high risk for injury and often experience stomach ailments, fever, or nausea when travelling. The objective of this study is to evaluate culturally and linguistically appropriate health information on preventive health behaviours and the health care system in Japan. We will examine the level of satisfaction of overseas visitors to Japan with health care-related educational materials using a five-minute digital game named Sa-Chan Japan. METHODS: Our study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT). We will assess both satisfaction and motivation before, during, and after the interventions and examine the changes over time. The intervention group will comprise overseas visitors who will view and answer questions in an animation named Sa-Chan Japan. The control group will comprise overseas visitors who will watch an English digital animation named Mari Info Japan. We will recruit 1002 participants through the Macromill Internet portal. We will contact overseas visitors who have either visited or wish to visit Japan from the United Kingdom, United States, and Australia. The participants will fill out a self-administered questionnaire online in the first quarter of 2021.

The recent rise of PEDV outbreaks in Asia and North America warrants an urgent search for effective vaccines. However, PEDV vaccine research has been hampered by difficulties in isolating and propagating the virus in mammalian cells, thereby complicating the recovery of infectious PEDV using a full-length infectious clone. Here, we engineered VeroE6 cells to stably express porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) and used them as a platform to obtain a high-growth variant of PEDV, termed PEDVAVCT12. Subsequently, the full-length cDNA clone was constructed by assembling contiguous cDNA fragments encompassing the complete genome of PEDVAVCT12 in a bacterial artificial chromosome. Infectious PEDV could be recovered, and the rescued virus displayed phenotypic properties identical to the parental virus. Interestingly, we found that PEDVAVCT12 contained a C-terminal deletion of the spike gene, resulting in disruption of the ORF3 start codon. When a functional ORF3 gene was restored, the recombinant virus could not be rescued, suggesting that ORF3 could suppress PEDV replication in vitro. In addition, a high-growth and genetically stable recombinant PEDV expressing a foreign protein could be rescued by replacing the ORF3 gene with the mCherry gene. Together, the results of this study provide a means to generate genetically defined PEDV as a promising vaccine candidate.","output":"Genetic manipulation of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus recovered from a full-length infectious cDNA clone."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a serious disease that can have a range of symptoms, from very mild to severe.

We introduce ASMODEE (automatic selection of models and outlier detection for epidemics), a new tool for detecting sudden changes in COVID-19 incidence. Our approach relies on automatically selecting the best (fitting or predicting) model from a range of user-defined time series models, excluding the most recent data points, to characterize the main trend in an incidence. We then derive prediction intervals and classify data points outside this interval as outliers, which provides an objective criterion for identifying departures from previous trends. We also provide a method for selecting the optimal breakpoints, used to define how many recent data points are to be excluded from the trend fitting procedure. The analysis of simulated COVID-19 outbreaks suggests ASMODEE compares favourably with a state-of-art outbreak-detection algorithm while being simpler and more flexible. As such, our method could be of wider use for infectious disease surveillance. We illustrate ASMODEE using publicly available data of National Health Service (NHS) Pathways reporting potential COVID-19 cases in England at a fine spatial scale, showing that the method would have enabled the early detection of the flare-ups in Leicester and Blackburn with Darwen, two to three weeks before their respective lockdown.

METHODS: COVID-19 infections and mortalities among the Asian countries were retrieved from the Worldometer website. Information on prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and mean vitamin D values in each Asian country was retrieved through literature searching on PubMed? and Google scholar. The associations between COVID-19 infections and mortalities with prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and mean vitamin D level were explored with correlation coefficients.

METHODS: Electronic databases were systematically searched in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from the beginning of 2019 to 3rd of March 2020. Heterogeneity across included studies was determined using Cochranes Q test and the I(2) statistic. We used the fixed or random-effect models to pool the weighted mean differences (WMDs) or standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). FINDINGS: Out of a total of 3009 citations, 17 articles (22 studies, 21 from China and one study from Singapore) with 3396 ranging from 12 to1099 patients were included. Our meta-analyses showed a significant decrease in lymphocyte, monocyte, and eosinophil, hemoglobin, platelet, albumin, serum sodium, lymphocyte to C-reactive protein ratio (LCR), leukocyte to C-reactive protein ratio (LeCR), leukocyte to IL-6 ratio (LeIR), and an increase in the neutrophil, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), Procalcitonin (PCT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), fibrinogen, prothrombin time (PT), D-dimer, glucose level, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the severe group compared with the non-severe group. No significant changes in white blood cells (WBC), Creatine Kinase (CK), troponin I, myoglobin, IL-6 and K between the two groups were observed.

We show that because of an early onset of infectiousness, which is reported to be synchronous or even precede the onset of detectable symptoms, the tracing and immediate testing of everyone who came in contact with the detected infected individual reduces the spread of epidemics, hospital load, and fatality rate. We hope that this more precise node dynamics could be incorporated into complex large-scale epidemiological models to improve the accuracy and credibility of predictions.","output":"Epidemiological

stressful conditions and experience discomfort from multiple sources, such as the environment or related to care provided in the ICU, depending on the care organizations and patient health status This discomfort may have short-term and long-term consequences for ICU survivors, such as various degrees of anxiety and/or depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (1) which may affect patient's quality of life Reducing discomfort in the ICU has therefore become a major issue IT has already been demonstrated that the implementation of a tailored multicomponent program for discomfort prevention in adult ICUs (named the IPREA3 program): 1) may decrease the selfperceived discomfort in general adult ICU survivors of at the end of their ICU stay, according the results of the IPREA3 study, a cluster-randomized controlled study (2);2) may reduce substantial PTSD symptoms assessed 1 year after ICU discharge, according the results of the AQVAR study, a prospective cohort study inluding patients who were exposed and unexposed to the IPREA3 program (3) These promising results justify the need for a confirmatory study using a randomized design, the PTSD-REA study Methods: The PTSD-REA study is a stepped wedge cluster-randomized interventional study involving 18 French ICUs The cluster level comprises the ICUs, which are the units of randomization Patients hospitalized in the ICUs comprise the individual level The intervention is the implementation of the IPREA3 program, a tailored multicomponent program consisting of assessment of ICUrelated self-perceived discomforts, immediate and monthly feedback to the healthcare team, and site-specific tailored interventions The whole duration of the inclusion period will be 15 months and patients will be followed-up 1 year after ICU discharge During the first month of the inclusion period, no ICU is exposed to the IPREA3 program Every following month, 2 new ICUS of the 18 participating ICUs are randomized to the application of IPREA3 until the end of the inclusion period, leading to 9 steps We considered 3 periods, a control period, an unvariable 5-month learning period for each ICU, and an interventional period during which the IPREA3 program will be applied during more than 5 months until the end of the inclusion period Patients will be included only during the control period and the interventional period For each participating ICU, the durations of the control period and the interventional period range from 1 to 9 months, according the randomization date for crossing over to the IPREA3 program The eligible patients are patients who survived an ICU stay of at least 3 calendar days with an affiliation to a social security scheme The exclusion criteria include death prior to the 1-year follow-up after the index ICU hospitalization, patients under trusteeship, patients with cognitive incapacity, and patients who did not understand French sufficiently to complete the questionnaires exploring psychiatric morbidity All participants provided written informed consent We planned to include 4500 patients during the study, 2250 patients in each group The primary outcome measure is the presence of substantial PTSD symptoms at one year after ICU discharge assessed from the posttraumatic stress-disorder checklist (PCL-5) which is a 20-item selfreport measure for PTSD symptoms according the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) The secondary outcomes are the following : the ICU stay's duration, the number of days with mechanical ventilation, the overall score of discomfort assessed from the IPREA3 questionnaire, the duration of hospital stay after ICU discharge The other secondary outcomes will be asseseed at 1 year after ICU discharge: the number of symptoms in categories A,B,C, D and E, respectively, assessed from the PCL-5, the scores of the sub-scales A and D, respectively, of the questionnaire HAD-S (Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale), the score obtained from he World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF), the number of emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and consulations with a psychologist or psychiatrist during the past year since ICU discharge, return to own home, and occupational status Results: The inclusion period started on November 1, 2020, but was interrupted on March 19, 2020 due to the consequences of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the functionning of French ICUs, when 1252 patients had already been included It is planned to resume the inclusions in the ICUs on September 1,

area of screen time and digital media use in children, adolescents, and young adults, (2) synthesising existing research paradigms and measurement tools that quantify these dimensions, and (3) highlighting important areas of need to guide future measure development. DESIGN: A scoping review of 140 sources (126 database, 14 grey literature) published between 2014 and 2019 yielded 162 measurement tools across a range of domains, users, and cultures. Database sources from Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Scopus were extracted, in addition to grey literature obtained from knowledge experts and organisations relevant to digital media use in children. To be included, the source had to: (1) be an empirical investigation or present original research, (2) investigate a sample/target population that included children or young persons between the ages of 0 and 25 years of age, and (3) include at least one assessment method for measuring digital media use. Reviews, editorials, letters, comments and animal model studies were all excluded. MEASURES: Basic information, level of risk of bias, study setting, paradigm, data type, digital media type, device, usage characteristics, applications or websites, sample characteristics, recruitment methods, measurement tool information, reliability and validity. RESULTS: Significant variability in nomenclature surrounding problematic use and criteria for identifying clinical impairment was discovered. Moreover, there was a paucity of measures in key domains, including tools for young children, whole families, disadvantaged groups, and for certain patterns and types of usage.

Hepatocytes are the functional units of the liver parenchyma and not only responsible for turnover of biomolecules but also act as central immune signaling platforms. Hepatotropic viruses infect liver tissue, resulting in inflammatory responses, tissue damage and hepatitis. Combining well-established in vitro and in vivo model systems with transcriptomic analyses, we show that type I interferon signaling initiates a robust antiviral immune response in hepatocytes. Strikingly, we also identify IFN-I as both, sufficient and necessary, to induce wide-spread metabolic reprogramming in hepatocytes. IFN-I specifically rewired tryptophan metabolism and induced hepatic tryptophan oxidation to kynurenine via Tdo2, correlating with altered concentrations of serum metabolites upon viral infection. Infected Tdo2-deficient animals displayed elevated serum levels of tryptophan and, unexpectedly, also vast increases in the downstream immune-suppressive metabolite kynurenine. Thus, Tdo2-deficiency did not result in altered serum homeostasis of the tryptophan to kynurenine ratio during infection, which seemed to be independent of hepatocyte-intrinsic compensation via the IDO-axis. These data highlight that inflammation-induced reprogramming of systemic tryptophan metabolism is tightly regulated in viral hepatitis.","output":"Hepatocyte-intrinsic type I interferon signaling reprograms metabolism and reveals a novel compensatory mechanism of the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway in viral hepatitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid\\\\19 is an acute respiratory infection and presents various clinical features ranging from no symptoms to severe pneumonia and death.

To describe patterns of multimorbidity among fatal cases of COVID-19, and to propose a classification of patients based on age and multimorbidity patterns to begin the construction of etiological models. METHODS. Data of Colombian confirmed deaths of COVID-19 until June 11, 2020, were included in this analysis (n=1488 deaths). Relationships between COVID-19, combinations of health conditions and age were explored using locally weighted polynomial regressions. RESULTS. The most frequent health conditions were high blood pressure, respiratory disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease. Dyads more frequents were high blood pressure with diabetes, cardiovascular disease or respiratory disease. Some multimorbidity patterns increase probability of death among older individuals, whereas other patterns are not age-related, or decrease the probability of death among older people. Not all multimorbidity increases with age, as is commonly thought. Obesity, alone or with other diseases, was associated with a higher risk of severity among young people, while the risk of the high blood pressure/diabetes dyad tends to have an inverted U distribution in relation with age. CONCLUSIONS. Classification of individuals according to multimorbidity in the medical management of COVID-19 patients is important to determine the possible etiological models and to define patient triage for hospitalization. Moreover, identification of non-infected individuals with high-risk ages and multimorbidity patterns serves to define possible interventions of selective confinement or special management.","output":"Multimorbidity patterns among COVID-19 deaths: proposal for the construction of etiological models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Deprescribing is of particular importance in older adults with limited life expectancy since this population group is highly susceptible to the potential harms of inappropriate medications. OBJECTIVE This systematic review aimed to explore attitudes towards deprescribing among older adults with limited life expectancy and their relatives. METHODS A systematic literature review was conducted in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception to October 2019. Inclusion criteria were studies specifically describing attitudes towards deprescribing among older adults ( 65 years) with limited life expectancy and/or their relatives regardless of study type. Results were analyzed, inspired by the Joanna Briggs Institute's method for synthesis of qualitative data. RESULTS A total of 842 studies were identified and screened; 84 were full-text assessed for eligibility and 7 were ultimately included. Two studies investigated the attitudes of older adults with limited life expectancy and their relatives towards deprescribing of statins and donepezil, respectively, while the five remaining studies related to attitudes towards deprescribing in general. Four main themes were identified: (1) the well-being of older adults with limited life expectancy; (2) involvement of older adults and their relatives in deprescribing; (3) the role of health care professionals in deprescribing; and (4) medication-related factors affecting deprescribing. Within each of these themes, several subthemes were identified. CONCLUSIONS Attitudes towards deprescribing among older adults with limited life expectancy and their relatives vary and highlight several barriers and enablers to the deprescribing process. Several of these factors must be addressed to successfully implement deprescribing initiatives in this patient group.","output":"Attitudes Towards Deprescribing Among Older Adults with Limited Life Expectancy and Their Relatives: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide.

Our department integrated virtual assessment into the incoming referral pathway to enable continuation of high-quality care. This study aimed to assess any potential efficiency benefit of this change in service whilst ensuring no compromise to clinical outcomes. METHOD: A prospective analysis was undertaken of all hand fractures referred virtually during a seven-week period starting at the initiation of national lockdown. Cost analysis using NHS reference costs, inflated to 2019/20 prices, was performed. Clinical performance was assessed using the British Society for Surgery for the Hand (BSSH) Standards for Open and Closed Hand Fractures. RESULTS: Seventy-six hand fractures were referred; FTF attendance was avoided in 35 cases, with an estimated per-patient cost saving of 179.16. Of the 33 patients who attended FTF, 13 achieved same day non-operative treatment; 20 underwent operative intervention with 95% compliance to BSSH standards. No complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot model demonstrates potentially significant cost savings of 6270 over a relatively short period, as well as clinical non-inferiority. This supports sustained integration of virtual patient assessment in the new normal.

The importance of vaccines cannot be overstated during the outbreak of a pandemic, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The understanding of genomics, structural biology, and innate/adaptive immunity have expanded the toolkits available for current vaccine development. However, sudden outbreaks and the requirement of population-level immunization still pose great challenges in todays vaccine designs. Well-established vaccine development protocols from previous experiences are in place to guide the pipelines of vaccine development for emerging viral diseases. Nevertheless, vaccine development may follow different paradigms during a pandemic. For example, multiple vaccine candidates must be pushed into clinical trials simultaneously, and manufacturing capability must be scaled up in early stages. Factors from essential features of safety, efficacy, manufacturing, and distributions to administration approaches are taken into consideration based on advances in materials science and engineering technologies. In this review, we present recent advances in vaccine development by focusing on vaccine discovery, formulation, and delivery devices enabled by alternative administration approaches.

Management of adverse events should be retained within optometric systems if possible, to minimise the impact on the wider healthcare service, which will be stretched. Optimal CL care behaviours should be the same as those under normal circumstances, which include appropriate hand washing (thoroughly with soap and water) and drying (with paper towels) before both CL application and removal. Daily CL cleaning and correct case care for reusable CL should be followed according to appropriate guidelines, and CL exposure to water must be avoided. Where the availability of local clinical care is restricted, practitioners could consider advising patients to reduce or eliminate sleeping in their CL (where patients have the appropriate knowledge about correct daily care and access to suitable lens-care products) or consider the option of moving patients to daily disposable lenses (where patients have appropriate lens supplies available).

It extends the scope of previous analyses in three areas. First, we use a Granger-causality approach to identify synchronization. Second, trade is broken down to the sector level and third, we distinguish between upstream and downstream connections. These developments allow for a directed approach in the analysis. We use conditional logit regressions to estimate the effect of trade openness on the probability of shock-transmission. The results presented in this study contribute to the literature in two ways. First, in addition to revealing a positive effect of aggregate two-way trade on shock-contagion, it also points out that this overall effect hides diverse behavior in specific trading sectors as well as upstream and downstream channels. Second, while some sectors are not significant channels of shock-transmission in either directions, upstream channels seem to be important in agriculture while downstream channels dominate machinery and other manufactures.

We aimed to evaluate the evidence on potential effects of vitamin C treatment on mortality in adult septic patients. METHODS: Data search included PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. A meta-analysis of eligible peer-reviewed studies was performed in accordance with the PRISMA statement. Only studies with valid classifications of sepsis and intravenous vitamin C treatment (alone or combined with hydrocortisone/thiamine) were included. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies including 3133 patients fulfilled the predefined criteria and were analyzed. Pooled analysis indicated no mortality reduction in patients treated with vitamin C when compared to reference (risk difference ? 0.05 [95% CI ? 0.11 to ? 0.01]; p = 0.08; p for Cochran Q = 0.002; I(2) = 56%). Notably, subgroup analyses revealed an improved survival, if vitamin C treatment was applied for 3C4 days (risk difference, ? 0.10 [95% CI ? 0.19 to ? 0.02]; p = 0.02) when compared to patients treated for 1C2 or > 5 days.

Despite their single-use disposable nature, the need to disinfect and repurpose FFRs is paramount during this global emergency. The objectives of this study were to (1) determine if UV treatment has an observable impact on respirator integrity; (2) test the impact of UV treatment on N95 FFR user fit; and (3) test the impact of UV treatment on FFR integrity. Ultraviolet (UV) disinfection was assessed in maintaining N95 FFR integrity. Two models of FFRs were exposed to UV fluences ranging from 0 to 10,000 mJ cm-2 per side and subsequently tested for fit, respirator integrity, and airflow. Inspection of N95 FFRs before and after UV treatment via microscopy methods showed no observable or tactile abnormalities in the integrity of respirator material or straps. Tensile loading tests on UV-treated and untreated respirator straps also demonstrated no impact on breaking strength. Standardized fit test methods showed no compromise in user fit following UV treatment. Evaluation of particle penetration and airflow through N95 FFRs showed no impact on integrity, and average filtration efficiency did not fall below 95% for any of the respirator types or fluence levels. This work provides evidence that UV disinfection does not compromise N95 FFR integrity at UV fluences up to 10,000 mJ cm-2. UV disinfection is a viable treatment option to support healthcare professionals in their strategy against the spread of COVID-19.","output":"Assessing the impact of multiple ultraviolet disinfection cycles on N95 filtering facepiece respirator integrity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Despite the risk of new persistent opioid use after cardiac surgery, post-discharge opioid use has not been quantified and evidence-based prescribing guidelines have not been established. METHODS Opioid-na?ve patients undergoing primary cardiac surgery via median sternotomy between January-December 2019 at 10 hospitals participating in a statewide collaborative were selected. Clinical data were linked to patient-reported outcomes collected at 30-day follow-up. An opioid prescribing recommendation stratified by inpatient opioid use on the day before discharge (0, 1-3, or 4 pills) was implemented in July 2019. Interrupted time-series analyses were performed for prescription size and post-discharge opioid use before (January-June) and after (July-December) guideline implementation. RESULTS Among 1495 patients (729 pre- and 766 post-recommendation), median prescription size decreased from 20 to 12 pills after recommendation release (p<0.001), while opioid use decreased from 3 to 0 pills (p<0.001). Change in prescription size over time was +0.6 pills/month before and -0.8 pills/month after the recommendation (difference: -1.4 pills/month, p=0.036). Change in patient use was +0.6 pills/month before and -0.4 pills/month after the recommendation (difference: -1.0 pills/month, p=0.017). Pain levels during the first week after surgery and refills were unchanged. Patients using 0 pills before discharge (n=710) were prescribed a median of 0 pills and used 0, while those using 1-3 pills (n=536) were prescribed 20 and used 7, and those using 4 pills (n=249) were prescribed 32 and used 24.

CKD patients are at high risk of being exposed to COVID-19 and suffer complications and poor outcome. In Sweden, mitigation strategies did not include lockdown. During MarchCApril of 2020, wide-spread infection occurred in Stockholm. METHODS: Management and outcomes in forty hemodialysis (HD) patients and 4 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, with symptomatic COVID-19 in greater Stockholm during March and April of 2020 are reported. RESULTS: Twenty-four HD patients (60%) required medical care and hospitalization, whereas 16 patients (40%) were treated at home. Nine patients died (mortality rate of 22.5%), of whom 8 were men. The median age in non-survivors (78 years) was significantly higher than in survivors (p = 0.003). The median time in dialysis (11.5 years) was also significantly longer in non-survivors (p = 0.01). C-reactive protein (CRP) at diagnosis in 7 of non-survivors (median 213 mg/L, range 86C329 mg/L) was significantly higher than the CRP in 25 survivors (median 87 mg/L, range 1C328 mg/L) (p = 0.0003). Maximum CRP also indicated poorer outcome among hospitalized patients (p = 0.0004). The gender imbalance was striking with only men dying apart from 1 elderly woman. Only 4 PD patients were hospitalized with symptomatic COVID-19. One patient died, 2 were discharged, and 1 was treated at the intensive care unit and survived. CONCLUSION: HD patients >70 years were reported with longer dialysis vintage, higher CRP, and males were at an increased risk of dying from COVID-19, whereas those <70 years seemed to have a milder disease. Mitigation strategies to reduce rates of infection in high-risk populations remain essential. Follow-up focusing on long-term prognosis for extrapulmonary manifestations is likely to be important also in dialysis patients.","output":"The COVID-19 Epidemic: Management and Outcomes of Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis Patients in Stockholm, Sweden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This narrative medicine essay describes the emotions and challenges of being a frontline physician during COVID-19 (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Juggling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Decarbonation has been a primary policy prerogative for Sweden, and carbon tax has been a primary policy instrument in this pursuit, and the revenue generated out of carbon tax has been a driver for energy innovation.

It reveals which aspects of teacher-student interaction in online classes positively correlate with international students' satisfaction. This study is of a quantitative nature with four (independent variables (IVs) and one dependent variable (DV). The four IVs are the four dimensions of teacher-student interaction, namely interaction strength (IS), interaction time (IT), interaction content (IC), and interaction distance (ID). The DV is international student satisfaction (ISS) with online courses. This study was conducted in a university in Zhejiang Province, China. To answer the questionnaire, one hundred international students who were unable to enter China during COVID-19 were selected by stratified random sampling. The study used SPSS 21 to conduct descriptive and multiple linear regression analysis on the collected quantitative data. A total of 93 valid questionnaire data was collected. The analysis results showed that both IVs (IC & ID) have a positive correlation with the DV (ISS).

Both officially designated and spontaneously chosen mentors can be useful for protgs as they navigate through their training and professional work environment while striving to obtain the optimal workClife balance. Different genders can have variable experiences, in both their personal lives managing family obligations and their professional lives as dermatologists, which may affect the advice and guidance offered. OBJECTIVE: We studied the impact of gender on the mentorCmentee relationship for both official and spontaneous mentorships through a voluntary survey with a focus on reported outcomes from the perspective of the mentee. METHODS: Participants were selected through e-mail invitation via the Women's Dermatologic Society and program directors of the Association of Professors of Dermatology membership lists and given a link to the anonymous survey tool. The survey included 13 questions looking at official and spontaneous mentorships, the role of gender, and success in the dermatology field. RESULTS: Of the 288 respondents, 202 (69.9%) were women, 86 (29.8%) were men, and one identified as other. Of the survey participants, 81% had official mentors and 91% had spontaneous mentors, with the overlap indicating that there may have been a history of multiple mentors per individual. Mentoring had an overall significant positive impact, and 98.5% of those in the spontaneous-mentor group rated the mentor as helpful compared with 87.6% in the official-mentor cohort. For official mentorships, 60.1% involved gender-similar mentors, and of those who had officially designated mentors of any type, 55% indicated a preference for mentors of the same gender. When specifically looking at respondents who participated in same-gender official mentorships, 65.5% preferred this type; of those who had a gender-dissimilar equivalent, only 36.7% indicated a preference for gender similarity in a mentor. Comparably, 59% of protgs with spontaneous mentors had a gender-similar one, and of those who had spontaneous mentors of any type, 59.2% preferred gender similarity. When considering only those in gender-similar spontaneous mentorships, 74.5% favored a same-gender pairing compared with 32.9% of those in the gender-dissimilar group. For femaleCfemale official mentorships, 75% preferred a female mentor, similar to 80.5% of the spontaneous-mentor cohort. CONCLUSION: Spontaneous mentors may provide a greater benefit than officially designated ones. For the majority of the categories, there was no statistical difference between female same-gender mentorships and gender-dissimilar relationships, which is in contrast with previously published literature. Overall, based on the feedback provided, the respondents believed that the quality of the relationship was the most important defining factor, but some noted that same-gender mentorships can provide additional benefit geared toward similar interests and experiences in life.","output":"The impact of gender in mentorCmentee success: Results from the Women's Dermatologic Society Mentorship Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This study aimed to determine the attitude and stress levels of midwives, nurses and physicians working in gynecology and obstetrics clinics towards the COVID-19 pandemic.

Understanding how the variants originate is critical for effective control of the spread of the virus and the global pandemic. The study of the virus evolution so far has been dominated by phylogenetic tree analysis, which however is inappropriate for a few important reasons. Here we used phylogenetic network approach to study the origin of the VOC202012/01 (Alpha) or so-called UK variant (PANGO Lineage B.1.1.7). The multiple network analyses using different methods consistently revealed that the VOC202012/01 variant was a result of recombination, in contrast to the common assumption that the variant evolved from step-wise mutations in a linear order. The study provides an example for the power and application of phylogenetic network analysis in studying virus evolution, which can be applied to study the evolutionary processes leading to the emergence of other variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as many other viruses. Significance The emergence of new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including the Alpha variant first found in U.K., poses serious challenges to the control of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding how new variant originated is paramount to end the pandemic as effectively and quickly as possible. The dominant phylogenetic tree approach to study virus evolution has been inadequate and even misleading. Here we used a phylogenetic network approach to study the origin of the VOC202012/01 (Alpha) variant which was first reported in U.K. last year but has soon spread into many other countries, leading to dramatic increase in infection and death.

Cases and deaths will increase as the virus continues its global march outward. In the absence of effective pharmaceutical interventions or a vaccine, wide-spread virological screening is required to inform where restrictive isolation measures should be targeted and when they can be lifted(2C6). However, limitations on testing capacity have restricted the ability of governments and institutions to identify individual clinical cases, appropriately measure community prevalence, and mitigate transmission. Group testing offers a way to increase efficiency, by combining samples and testing a small number of pools(7C9). Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of group testing designs for individual identification or prevalence estimation of SARS-CoV-2 infection when testing capacity is limited. To do this, we developed mathematical models for epidemic spread, incorporating empirically measured individual-level viral kinetics to simulate changing viral loads in a large population over the course of an epidemic. We used these to construct representative populations and assess pooling strategies for community screening, accounting for variability in viral load samples, dilution effects, changing prevalence and resource constraints. We confirmed our group testing framework through pooled tests on de-identified human nasopharyngeal specimens with viral loads representative of the larger population. We show that group testing designs can both accurately estimate overall prevalence using a small number of measurements and substantially increase the identification rate of infected individuals in resource-limited settings.","output":"Efficient prevalence estimation and infected sample identification with group testing for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, the causative viral pathogen of COVID-19, has driven the biomedical community to action Cto uncover and develop anti-viral interventions.

Complications are respiratory and multiorgan failure; risk factors for complicated disease are higher age, hypertension, diabetes, chronic cardiovascular, chronic pulmonary disease and immunodeficiency. Nosocomial and infections in medical personnel have been reported. Drastic reductions of social contacts have been implemented in many countries with outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, leading to rapid reductions. Most interventions have used bundles, but which of the measures have been more or less effective is still unknown. The current estimate for the infection's fatality rate is 0.5-1%. Using current models of age-dependent infection fatality rates, upper and lower limits for the attack rate in Germany can be estimated between 0.4 and 1.6%, lower than in most European countries. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a rapid worldwide spread, attack rates have been low in most regions, demonstrating the efficacy of control measures.","output":"Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Encephalopathy is one of the most frequent neurological complications of severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Cytokine storm and sepsis, hypercatabolic states, the use of furosemide and dialytic therapy represent risk factors for thiamine deficiency and are also found in patients with severe COVID-19. In this retrospective case series, we report clinical and neurological findings of fifteen patients with COVID-19-associated Wernicke Encephalopathy (WE) and their response to treatment with intravenous thiamine. All patients had encephalopathy, with 67% displaying at least one additional sign of classic WE triad (ophthalmoparesis and ataxia). Two patients (13%) had the classic triad. All COVID-19 patients had significant improvement of the neurological manifestations between two to five days after intravenous thiamine administration. Eleven patients (73%) had good neurological outcome at hospital discharge and only two patients (13%) died.

To address this problem, surgical instruments with articulated joints and multiple degrees of freedom have been developed. The articulations in currently available surgical instruments use mainly wire or link mechanisms. These mechanisms are generally robust and reliable, but the miniaturization of the mechanical parts required often results in problems with size, weight, durability, mechanical play, sterilization, and assembly costs. METHODS We thus introduced a compliant mechanism to a laparoscopic surgical instrument with multiple degrees of freedom at the tip. To show the feasibility of the concept, we developed a prototype with two degrees of freedom articulated surgical instruments that can perform the grasping and bending movements. The developed prototype is roughly the same size of the conventional laparoscopic instrument, within the diameter of 4 mm. The elastic parts were fabricated by Ni-Ti alloy and SK-85M, rigid parts ware fabricated by stainless steel, covered by 3D- printed ABS resin. The prototype was designed using iterative finite element method analysis, and has a minimal number of mechanical parts. RESULTS The prototype showed hysteresis in grasping movement presumably due to the friction; however, the prototype showed promising mechanical characteristics and was fully functional in two degrees of freedom. In addition, the prototype was capable to exert over 15 N grasping that is sufficient for the general laparoscopic procedure. The evaluation tests thus positively showed the concept of the proposed mechanism. CONCLUSION The prototype showed promising characteristics in the given mechanical evaluation experiments. Use of a compliant mechanism such as in our prototype may contribute to the advancement of surgical instruments in terms of simplicity, size, weight, dexterity, and affordability.","output":"Articulated minimally invasive surgical instrument based on compliant mechanism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores conditions and enablers for teacher professional learning in religious education in Catholic schools.

METHODS: Here, we report a 48-year-old man presenting with persistent dysgeusia and hypoalgesia of the lower legs, hands, and cheeks after COVID-19 infection in Spring 2020. RESULTS: Upon clinical examination 7 months after the infection, the patient could not feel pain after pinprick stimuli. Quantitative sensory testing revealed increased thermal detection thresholds at the face but no changes at the foot. Electrical C-fiber stimulation elicited lower pain ratings at the distal leg compared with the proximal leg, but overall higher pain ratings than in healthy control subjects. The axon flare reaction in response to histamine and acetylcholine was almost absent with no pain sensation. Skin punch biopsy revealed a reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density at the lower leg, and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 and calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity were similar to a healthy control. Symptoms and positive tests improved 5 months later. CONCLUSION: In summary, we describe a case of hypoalgesia after COVID-19 disease.

Various anti-inflammatory therapeutics have shown mixed efficacy in treating COVID-19, and the mechanisms by which hyperinflammation occurs are not well understood. Previous research indicated that monocytes, a key innate immune cell, undergo metabolic reprogramming and produce inflammatory cytokines when stimulated with SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized that binding by the viral spike protein mediates this effect, and that drugs which regulate immunometabolism could inhibit the inflammatory response in monocytes. Monocytes stimulated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit 1 showed a dose-dependent increase in glycolytic metabolism that was associated with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-. This response was dependent on hypoxia-inducible factor-1, as chetomin inhibited glycolysis and cytokine production. Inhibition of glycolytic metabolism by 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) or glucose deprivation also inhibited the glycolytic response, and 2-DG strongly suppressed cytokine production. Glucose-deprived monocytes rescued cytokine production by upregulating oxidative phosphorylation, an effect which was not present in 2-DG-treated monocytes due to the known effect of 2-DG on suppressing mitochondrial metabolism. Finally, pre-treatment of monocytes with metformin strongly suppressed spike protein-mediated cytokine production in monocytes, and abrogated glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism. Likewise, metformin pre-treatment blocked cytokine induction by SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020 in direct infection experiments in monocytes. In summary, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces a pro-inflammatory immunometabolic response in monocytes that can be suppressed by metformin, and metformin likewise suppresses inflammatory responses to live SARS-CoV-2. This has potential implications for the treatment of hyperinflammation during COVID-19.","output":"Metformin Suppresses Monocyte Immunometabolic Activation by SARS-CoV-2 and Spike Protein Subunit 1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter analyzes PPP under a legal perspective.

METHODS: In this retrospective IRB-approved study, we identified COVID-19 patients who had a standard-of-care contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan within 5 days of their COVID-19 diagnosis at our institution (training set; n = 45, mean age 65 years, M/F 23/22) and at a second institution (validation set; n = 41, mean age 61 years, M/F 22/19). The CT renal perfusion parameter, cortex-to-aorta enhancement index (CAEI), was measured in both sets. A multivariate logistic regression model for predicting AKI was constructed from the training set with stepwise feature selection with CAEI together with demographical and baseline laboratory/clinical data used as input variables. Model performance in the training and validation set was evaluated with ROC analysis. RESULTS: AKI developed in 16 patients (35.6%) of the training set and in 6 patients (14.6%) of the validation set. Baseline CAEI was significantly lower in the patients that ultimately developed AKI (P = 0.003). Logistic regression identified a model combining baseline CAEI, blood urea nitrogen, and gender as most significant predictor of AKI. This model showed excellent diagnostic performance for prediction of AKI in the training set (AUC = 0.89, P < 0.001) and good performance in the validation set (AUC 0.78, P = 0.030).

The aim was to assess the effectiveness and safety of magnesium supplementation for older adults with insomnia. METHODS A search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine, clinicaltrials.gov and two grey literature databases comparing magnesium supplementation to placebo or no treatment. Outcomes were sleep quality, quantity, and adverse events. Risk of bias and quality of evidence assessments were carried out using the RoB 2.0 and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approaches. Data was pooled and treatment effects were quantified using mean differences. For remaining outcomes, a modified effects direction plot was used for data synthesis. RESULTS Three randomized control trials (RCT) were identified comparing oral magnesium to placebo in 151 older adults in three countries. Pooled analysis showed that post-intervention sleep onset latency time was 17.36 min less after magnesium supplementation compared to placebo (95% CI - 27.27 to - 7.44, p = 0.0006). Total sleep time improved by 16.06 min in the magnesium supplementation group but was statistically insignificant. All trials were at moderate-to-high risk of bias and outcomes were supported by low to very low quality of evidence. CONCLUSION This review confirms that the quality of literature is substandard for physicians to make well-informed recommendations on usage of oral magnesium for older adults with insomnia. However, given that oral magnesium is very cheap and widely available, RCT evidence may support oral magnesium supplements (less than 1 g quantities given up to three times a day) for insomnia symptoms.","output":"Oral magnesium supplementation for insomnia in older adults: a Systematic Review & Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been established as an effective therapeutic intervention for the treatment of depression.

We searched for studies on AKI according to Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage kidney disease (RIFLE); Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN); and/or Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria in burn patients admitted to the ICU. We collected data on AKI incidence, risk factors, use of RRT, renal recovery, length of stay (LOS), mortality, and health care costs. RESULTS: We included 33 observational studies comprising 8200 patients. Overall study quality, scored according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, was moderate. Random effect model meta-analysis revealed that the incidence of AKI among burn patients in the ICU was 38 (30C46) %. Patients with AKI were almost evenly distributed in the mild, moderate, and severe AKI subgroups. RRT was used in 12 (8C16) % of all patients. Risk factors for AKI were high age, chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high Total Body Surface Area percent burnt, high Abbreviated Burn Severity Index score, inhalation injury, rhabdomyolysis, surgery, high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, sepsis, and mechanical ventilation. AKI patients had 8.6 (4.0C13.2) days longer ICU LOS and higher mortality than non-AKI patients, OR 11.3 (7.3C17.4). Few studies reported renal recovery, and no study reported health care costs. CONCLUSIONS: AKI occurred in 38% of burn patients admitted to the ICU, and 12% of all patients received RRT. Presence of AKI was associated with increased LOS and mortality.

The aim of the study was to identify and characterize the actions taken by food retail chain entities during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the context of the food security of consumers in Poland (using the example of Wielkopolska). A basic research hypothesis (H0) was generated, stating that the adaptation activities of food retail chain actors varied during the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland with regard to ensuring consumer food security. It was detailed in five sub-hypotheses. In their verification and in the realization of the aim of the study, the methods of literature study and other secondary sources, and induction, survey, comparative, visualization, modeling and descriptive statistics, were used. The research results include (a) the authors' diagnosis of threats to the food security of companies in the food system resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and applied ways of adaptation to the new requirements of the environment, based on secondary sources;(b) analysis of data from the empirical survey conducted by the authors in November 2020 on the adaptive actions of companies, among managers/owners of food retail stores of a selected network of a particular franchise type in Greater Poland;(c) the construction of an empirical model of the typical behaviors of food retail units in the chain under study, distinguishing three of their types in the model;and (d) suggestions concerning the directions of future scientific research areas.

Our results showed that light intensity was a beneficial parameter for dye removal. The results showed that in the presence of S(2)O(8)(2?), the photooxidation quantum yield obtained was higher than direct photolysis quantum yield, suggesting that photodecay of BY2 was dominated by photooxidation. The electrical energy per order (E(EO)) values for decolorization of BY2 solution was calculated.

RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), which has no counterpart in human cells, is an excellent target for drug development. Given the time-consuming process of drug development, repurposing drugs approved for other indications or at least successfully tested in terms of safety and tolerability, is an attractive strategy to rapidly provide an effective medication for severe COVID-19 cases. Areas covered: The currently available data and upcoming studies on RdRp which can be repurposed to halt SARS-CoV-2 replication, are reviewed. Expert opinion: Drug repurposing and design of novel compounds are proceeding in parallel to provide a quick response and new specific drugs, respectively. Notably, the proofreading SARS-CoV-2 exonuclease activity could limit the potential for drugs designed as immediate chain terminators and favor the development of compounds acting through delayed termination. While vaccination is awaited to curb the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, even partially effective drugs from repurposing strategies can be of help to treat severe cases of disease. Considering the high conservation of RdRp among coronaviruses, an improved knowledge of its activity in vitro can provide useful information for drug development or drug repurposing to combat SARS-CoV-2 as well as future pandemics.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase as a therapeutic target for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bacterial ghosts (BGs) are empty bacterial envelopes of Gram-negative bacteria produced by controlled expressions of cloned gene E, forming a lysis tunnel structure within the envelope of the living bacteria.

Across the globe, governments have put mandates for the use of face masks, which have received both positive and negative reaction. Online social media provides an exciting platform to study the use of masks and analyze underlying mask-wearing patterns. In this article, we analyze 2.04 million social media images for six US cities. An increase in masks worn in images is seen as the COVID-19 cases rose, particularly when their respective states imposed strict regulations. We also found a decrease in the posting of group pictures as stay-at-home laws were put into place. Furthermore, mask compliance in the Black Lives Matter protest was analyzed, eliciting that 40% of the people in group photos wore masks, and 45% of them wore the masks with a fit score of greater than 80%. We introduce two new datasets, VAriety MAsks - Classification (VAMA-C) and VAriety MAsks - Segmentation (VAMA-S), for mask detection and mask fit analysis tasks, respectively. For the analysis, we create two frameworks, face mask detector (for classifying masked and unmasked faces) and mask fit analyzer (a semantic segmentation based model to calculate a mask-fit score). The face mask detector achieved a classification accuracy of 98%, and the semantic segmentation model for the mask fit analyzer achieved an Intersection Over Union (IOU) score of 98%.

RECENT FINDINGS Recent advances in AIS management by EVT have led to significant reduction in morbidity and mortality in selected patients with LVO within the anterior circulation. Until recently, use of EVT was strictly based on time criteria, within 4.5 to 12 h of symptom onset with many patients presenting with \\"wake-up\\" stroke who were not considered for EVT. The positive results of the DAWN and DEFUSE-3 trials have shown benefit in extending the therapeutic window for EVT to 24 and 16 h, respectively, after last known normal (LKN) time in the setting of large ischemic penumbra. These trials represent a paradigm shift in contemporary treatment of AIS, changing from a purely time-based decision to treat to an individualized decision based on clinical and radiographic findings of salvageable tissue. Overall, acute stroke management has evolved considerably over the years from intravenous thrombolysis to include EVT, with paralleled improvements in patient selection and thrombectomy devices. Since the results of the DAWN and DEFUSE-3, EVT is now considered the standard of care in select patients with anterior circulation LVO up to 24 h from LKN time. Despite these developments, post-stroke disability remains pervasive and further studies are warranted in establishing the role of EVT in posterior circulation and distal vessel occlusions, with need for development of new and effective techniques for revascularization of small vessels.","output":"Endovascular Thrombectomy for Acute Ischemic Stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Already overwhelmed by the burden of communicable diseases, the health systems in South Asia face six global and regional transformational trends, which pose opportunities, challenges and threats.

There is an urgent need for identification and understanding of clinical and laboratory parameters related to progression towards a severe and fatal form of this illness, often preceded by a so-called cytokine-storm syndrome (CSS). Therefore, we explored the hemocytometric characteristics of COVID-19 patients in relation to the deteriorating clinical condition CSS, using the Sysmex XN-10 hematology analyzer. Methods From March 1st till May 16th, 2020, all patients admitted to our hospital with respiratory complaints and suspected for COVID-19 were included (n=1,140 of whom n=533 COVID-19 positive). The hemocytometric parameters of immunocompetent cells in peripheral blood (neutrophils [NE], lymphocytes [LY] and monocytes [MO]) obtained upon admission to the emergency department (ED) of COVID-19 positive patients were compared with those of the COVID-19 negative ones. Moreover, patients with CSS (n=169) were compared with COVID-19 positive patients without CSS, as well as with COVID-19 negative ones. Results In addition to a significant reduction in leukocytes, thrombocytes and absolute neutrophils, it appeared that lymphocytes-forward scatter (LY-FSC), and reactive lymphocytes (RE-LYMPHO)/leukocytes were higher in COVID-19-positive than negative patients. At the moment of presentation, COVID-19 positive patients with CSS had different neutrophils-side fluorescence (NE-SFL), neutrophils-forward scatter (NE-FSC), LY-FSC, RE-LYMPHO/lymphocytes, antibody-synthesizing (AS)-LYMPHOs, high fluorescence lymphocytes (HFLC), MO-SSC, MO-SFL, and Reactive (RE)-MONOs.

We compared several clinical measures between patients admitted for bacteremia during the two months of the COVID-19 pandemic and those admitted during the same period in 2019. We hypothesized that the pandemic has led to delayed treatment of bacteremia. METHODS: This retrospective observational study compared several measures undertaken for patients who visited the emergency unit in two hospitals between March 1 and May 31, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic and whose blood cultures tested positive for bacteremia with those for corresponding patients treated during the same period in 2019. The primary measure was time from consultation to blood culture/antimicrobials. RESULTS: We included 29 eligible patients from 2020 and 26 from 2019. In 2020, the time from consultation to antimicrobial administration was significantly longer than in 2019 (mean [range], 222 [145-309] min vs. 139 [102-179] min, p=0.002).

In the first 12 months, participant exercise 2x/week under the supervision of YMCA trainers, and 2x/week on their own. In months 13\\\\18, participants continue to exercise 4x/week but without supervision. Here we describe the impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on delivery of this support\\\\intensive intervention that involved many challenges but also opportunities for innovation. METHOD: In February 2020, EXERT met the recruitment goal with 296 enrolled. In March 2020 when COVID\\\\19 incidence rates began to climb in the US, study assessments and per\\\\protocol intervention delivery were paused. During the pause, all YMCAs were closed, and the majority of study\\\\certified YMCA trainers were furloughed. RESULT: At the time of the pause (March 23), 153 participants were in the supervised phase of the study, and 65 participants were in the unsupervised phase. To keep participants engaged and encourage adherence to the intervention, sites initiated weekly calls with active participants to provide support, address barriers to exercise and collect self\\\\report adherence data. By September, 7 of 14 sites resumed study activities. Weekly call completion rates during the pause exceeded 85%, and participants reported completing a mean of 3.3 40\\\\minute exercise sessions per week.

Overall, 45.5% were hospitalized, 12.1% required intensive care, and 9.1% necessitated invasive mechanical ventilation. The total CFR was 9.1% in HSCT recipients, 22.2% in patients with active hematologic malignancy, and 4.2% in patients without active hematologic malignancy. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that mortality of HSCT recipients is lower in patients whose primary disease is in remission compared to ones that are not in remission. Further studies with larger group patients are needed in order to delineate the effects of COVID-19 on HSCT patients.","output":"The clinical course of COVID-19 in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 protein subunit vaccines are being evaluated by multiple manufacturers to fill the need for low-cost, easy to scale, safe, and effective COVID-19 vaccines for global access. Vaccine candidates relying on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been the focus of our development program. In this paper, we report on the generation of the RBD203-N1 yeast expression construct, which produces a recombinant protein that when formulated with alum and the TLR-9 agonist, CpG1826 elicits a robust immune response and protection in mice. MethodThe RBD203-N1 antigen was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris X33. After fermentation at the 5 L scale, the protein was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography followed by anion exchange chromatography. The purified protein was characterized biophysically and biochemically, and after its formulation, the immunogenicity and efficacy were evaluated in mice. Results, Conclusions, and SignificanceThe RBD203-N1 production process yielded 492.9 {+/-} 3.0 mg/L of protein in the fermentation supernatant. A two-step purification process produced a >96% pure protein with a recovery rate of 55 {+/-} 3% (total yield of purified protein: 270.5 {+/-} 13.2 mg/L fermentation supernatant). The protein was characterized as a homogeneous monomer with well-defined secondary structure, thermally stable, antigenic, and when adjuvanted on alum and CpG, it was immunogenic and induced robust levels of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. These characteristics show that this vaccine candidate is well suited for technology transfer with feasibility of its transition into the clinic to evaluate its immunogenicity and safety in humans.","output":"Yeast-expressed Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain, RBD203-N1 as a COVID-19 Protein Vaccine Candidate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, increasing public concern about hygiene has been driving many studies to investigate antimicrobial and antiviral agents. However, the use of any antimicrobial agents must be limited due to their possible toxic or harmful effects. In recent years, due to previous antibiotics lesser side effects, the use of herbal materials instead of synthetic or chemical drugs is increasing. Herbal materials are found in medicines. Herbs can be used in the form of plant extracts or as their active components. Furthermore, most of the worlds populations used herbal materials due to their strong antimicrobial properties and primary healthcare benefits. For example, herbs are an excellent material to replace nanosilver as an antibiotic and antiviral agent. The use of nanosilver involves an ROS-mediated mechanism that might lead to oxidative stress-related cancer, cytotoxicity, and heart diseases. Oxidative stress further leads to increased ROS production and also delays the cellular processes involved in wound healing. Therefore, existing antibiotic drugs can be replaced with biomaterials such as herbal medicine with high antimicrobial, antiviral, and antioxidant activity. This review paper highlights the antibacterial, antiviral, and radical scavenger (antioxidant) properties of herbal materials. Antimicrobial activity, radical scavenger ability, the potential for antimicrobial, antiviral, and anticancer agents, and efficacy in eliminating bacteria and viruses and scavenging free radicals in herbal materials are discussed in this review. The presented herbal antimicrobial agents in this review include clove, portulaca, tribulus, eryngium, cinnamon, turmeric, ginger, thyme, pennyroyal, mint, fennel, chamomile, burdock, eucalyptus, primrose, lemon balm, mallow, and garlic, which are all summarized.","output":"Antioxidant, Antimicrobial and Antiviral Properties of Herbal Materials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, numerous cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the infection of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) have been confirmed in Wuhan, China.

Three stable psoriatic plaques were selected for evaluation in every patient. Different samples were applied on each lesion twice a day: vehiculum without an active agent, containing 1% DCI and 0.25% DCI. The lesions were assessed using the PSI, VAS scale, and the objective measurement of hydration, TEWL, elasticity and thickness (DermaLab Combo) at 0, 3 and 6 weeks. PSI and VAS were improved in all groups without significant statistical differences. 1% DCI sample presented the highest statistically significant increase in the hydration of 50%, but it was still significantly lower than in healthy controls. TEWL increased for 1% DCI, which was a statistically significant difference compared to 0.25% DCI and still higher than in controls.

PDeathLabs is intended for use as a summary metric for baseline metabolic status in multivariate models for COVID-19 death. Methods: Cases were identified through the COVID-19 Shared Data Resource (CSDR) of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The diagnosis required at least one positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). The primary outcome was death within 60 days of the first positive test. We retrieved all values for systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), O2 saturation (O2SAT), body mass index (BMI), estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum albumin (ALB), hematocrit (HCT), LDL cholesterol (LDL) hemoglobin A1c (A1C), and HDL cholesterol (HDL) if they were done at least 14 days prior to the NAAT. Clinicians evaluate several attributes of CM that are of critical importance: metabolic control, disease burden, chronicity, refractoriness, tendency to relapse, temporal trends, and lability. We derived 1-3 parameters for each of these attributes: the most recent value (metabolic control); time-weighted average and abnormal area under a severity versus time curve (disease burden); time and number of readings above or below goal (chronicity); longest abnormal cluster and time/number of consecutive readings above goal if the last value was abnormal (refractoriness); number of abnormal clusters (tendency to relapse); long- and short-term changes (temporal trends); and coefficient of variation and mean deviation between consecutive readings (lability). We created computer programs to derive cumulative values for these 13 parameters for all 11 CM as each new value is added. A fitted logistic model was developed for each CM to determine which of the 13 parameters contributed to the risk of death. A main logistic model was developed to determine which of the 13 * 11 = 143 metabolic parameters were independently predictive of death. The resulting model was used to derive PDeathLabs for each patient and the area under its receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve calculated. Single variable logistic models were also derived for age at diagnosis, the Charlson 2-year (Charl2Yr) and lifetime (CharlEver) scores, and the Elixhauser 2-year (Elix2Yrs) and lifetime (ElixEver) scores. Stata was used to compare the ROCs for PDeathDx and each of the other metrics. Results: On September 30, 2021 there were 347,220 COVID-19 patients in the CSDR. 329,491 (94.9%) patients had CM performed at least 14 days prior to the COVID-19 diagnosis and form the basis for this report. 17,934 (5.44%) died within 60 days of the diagnosis. On the subset regressions, the number of significant parameters ranged from all 13 for SBP to 7 for HDL. 239,393 patients had complete sets of data for developing the main model. Of 143 candidate predictors, 49 parameters were identified as statistically significant, independent predictors of death. The most influential domains were the most recent value, disease burden, temporal trends, and tendency to relapse. The ROC area for PDeathLabs was 0.785 +/- 0.002. No difference was found in the ROC areas of PDeathLabs and age at diagnosis (0.783 +/- 0.002; P = NS). However, the ROC area for PDeathLabs was significantly greater than that of Charl2Yrs (0.704 +/- 0.002; P < 0.001), CharlEver (0.729 +/- 0.002; P < 0.001), Elix2Yrs (0.675 +/- 0.002; P < 0.001), and ElixEver (0.707 +/- 0.002; P < 0.001). A poor prognosis was found for chronic systolic hypertension. On the other hand, a higher BMI was protective once SBP, DBP, HDL, LDL and A1C were considered. Conclusions: Our study confirms that parameters derived for 11 CM are significant determinants of COVID-19 death. The most recent value should not be selected over other parameters for multivariate modeling unless there is a physiologic basis for doing so. PDeathLabs has the same discriminating power as age at diagnosis and outperforms comorbidity indices as a summary metric for pre-existing conditions. If validated by others, this approach provides a robust approach to handling CM in multivariate models.","output":"BASELINE METABOLIC PROFILING AND RISK OF DEATH FROM COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Confinement, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, could have problems on the mental health of the population. Teachers responsible for giving distance courses during this period could be psychologically stressed. The aim is to assess the magnitude results of burnout and associated factors among primary school teachers in Kenitra in Morocco during this confinement period. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study, which was conducted during the two months of April and May 2020. Burnout was evaluated by the Maslach Burnout Inventory MBI with 16 items, specific to the context of Moroccan teachers and the factors of stress were assessed using a questionnaire developed by the research team. We used the Chi-square test to determine the association between two qualitative variables anda logistic regression for an overall statistical analysis. RESULTS: The average age was 38.6  9.9 years. The MBI revealed that 68 teachers (54%) were victims of burnout, of which 47 (38%) had a low level; 15 (12%) had a moderate level and six (5%) had a severe burnout. Logistic regression analysis has shown that the risk factors for burnout during this confinement period are: the use and development of skills in new information and communication technologies (p<0,05); work/family conflict (p<0,05); social support (p<0,05); and the workload related to distance education (p0,05).

A survey evaluating TM perceptions was distributed to patients and their families following an encounter between March and July 2020. Our diabetes clinic currently cares for 1504 unique patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) with 46% being publicly insured. A total of 1,653 encounters including in person and TM were included in the analysis. TM visits became available in March 2020, with a total of 571 encounters by July 2020. There was a significantly lower number of completed TM encounters by publicly insured patients when compared with privately insured (p value=0.03523) and a threefold increase in no-shows and same day cancelations by the publicly insured group. Perception of TM was addressed with a survey completed by 40 patients. TM perception was positive with 86% of patients being very satisfied with the visit. TM encounter was thought to be the same as in person encounter by 60% and better than in person visit by 37% of patients. Reported benefits associated with TM included: overall time saved, no missed school day for the patient or workday for the parent, decreased childcare and transportation costs. In conclusion, although TM is perceived as positive by patients with T1D, low-income families showed lower TM visit attendance rate when compared to privately insured families.

Children with NDD during the COVID-19 pandemic have had worrying trends regarding their worsening well-being and poorer parental mental health. This studys aim was to test whether these two factors were associated in a survey of Australian parents. Methods: This cross-sectional study of Australian parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders (n = 304, ages 2 C 17, 63.8% male) sought to test the association between parental distress (as captured by the Kessler-6 distress scale) and two child outcomes, worsening NDD symptoms and worsening health behaviours (i.e., sleep, diet, exercise, and media use). Results: Parent distress was significantly associated with a worsening of symptoms of NDD and associated mental health comorbidities, and poorer child well-being. These results were significant even when including other variables of interest such as the families sociodemographic characteristics, indicating parental distress is a key factor for the well-being of children and parents. Conclusions: Overall, this study found relatively high levels of parental psychological distress, anxiety and poor well-being and demonstrated that parental psychological distress was significantly associated with parent-reported worsening of child diagnostic symptoms as well as poorer child well-being in relation to sleep, diet, exercise, and use of electronics. Together these findings suggest that deteriorating parental mental health (distress) due to COVID-19 is associated with adverse child mental health symptoms and well-being, as indexed by the behaviours described above.","output":"A Cross-sectional Examination of the Association Between Parental Distress and the Well-being of Children With Neurodevelopmental Disorders During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gamma irradiation using a cobalt-60 source is a commonly used method for the inactivation of infectious specimens to be handled safely in subsequent laboratory procedures.

Over a year since distance education was fully implemented in the country, it is essential to understand the general attitudes towards distance learning of Filipino teachers who have been teaching at various educational levels, including elementary, secondary, and tertiary levels, particularly in terms of student interaction, student performance, tool use, and availability, the support they have received from their schools, their willingness to handle distance and learning classes, as well as their experience in online teaching. The quantitative study was conducted with 151 respondents, using an online survey. Regarding their general attitude towards distance learning, the majority believe that distance education is not a viable alternative to face-to-face learning. In terms of student performance, a big majority believe that students learn less in distance-education classes;and academic dishonesty is more prevalent in such a setting. Teachers also had a more negative attitude towards the availability of an infrastructure for distance learning and the difficulty of managing the technology needed. Still, they have a more positive attitude regarding the support they receive from their schools. Overall, the study revealed that respondents have mixed attitudes towards distance learning, although there is a statistically significant difference between their gender and their attitudes towards distance learning. Moreover, the benefits of distance learning can be maximized, if appropriate training and support are provided to both teachers and students. ?Authors","output":"Filipino Teachers Attitudes towards Distance Learning during the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To quantify the levels of circulating exosomes derived from T-cells and monocytes and their possible associations with leukocyte subpopulations and cytokine milieu in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Methods: Total circulating exosomes (CD9(+)-Ex) and those derived from T-cells (CD3(+)-Ex) and monocytes (CD14(+)-Ex) were quantified by flow cytometry in 82 SLE patients and 32 controls. Leukocyte subsets and serum cytokines were analyzed by flow cytometry or by immunoassays. IFN-score was evaluated by real time RT-PCR in whole blood samples from a subgroup of 73 patients and 24 controls. Results: Activation markers (IFNR1 and BLyS) on monocytes, neutrophils and B-cells correlated inversely with circulating exosomes (CD9(+)-Ex, CD3(+)-Ex, and CD14(+)-Ex) in controls but directly with CD3(+)-Ex in patients (all p < 0.05). Although CD9(+)-Ex were increased in SLE, no differences were found in CD3(+)-Ex, supporting that exosome content accounts for this opposite role. Interestingly, CD4(+)CD28(null) cells correlated with CD3(+)-Ex in patients and controls, and displayed similar associations with leukocyte subsets in both groups. Additionally, CD3(+)-Ex correlated in patients with the expression of CD25 in CD4(+)CD28(null) cells. Furthermore, the activated status of this senescent subset was related to IFN serum levels in controls and to IFN-score in SLE patients. Finally, patients presenting high IFN-score, in addition to elevated CD25(+)CD28(null) cells associated with the activation of myeloid cells, displayed higher levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Conclusion: Our results support a relationship between T-cell exosomes and cellular subsets in SLE according to type I IFN-signaling, which could amplify chronic immune activation and excessive cytokine/chemokine response.","output":"Relationship Between T-Cell Exosomes and Cellular Subsets in SLE According to Type I IFN-Signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a 38-year-old married registered nurse diagnosed with ultra-rapid cycling bipolar disorder presenting with an unusual picture of primarily manic/hypomanic episodes (at a ratio of approximately 10:1) vs. depressive episodes.

We aimed to assess the predictive performance of automating the process of building ML models (AutoML) in-hospital mortality prediction modelling of triage COVID-19 patients at ICU admission versus expert-based predictor pre-selection followed by logistic regression. METHODS: We conducted an observational study of all COVID-19 patients admitted to Dutch ICUs between February and July 2020. We included 2,690 COVID-19 patients from 70 ICUs participating in the Dutch National Intensive Care Evaluation (NICE) registry. The main outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. We asessed model performance (at admission and after 24 hours, respectively) of AutoML compared to the more traditional approach of predictor pre-selection and logistic regression. Findings: Predictive performance of the autoML models with variables available at admission shows fair discrimination (average AUROC = 075-076 (sdev = 003), PPV = 070-076 (sdev = 01) at cut-off = 03 (the observed mortality rate), and good calibration. This performance is on par with a logistic regression model with selection of patient variables by three experts (average AUROC = 078 (sdev = 003) and PPV = 079 (sdev = 02)). Extending the models with variables that are available at 24 hours after admission resulted in models with higher predictive performance (average AUROC = 077-079 (sdev = 003) and PPV = 079-080 (sdev = 010-017)). CONCLUSIONS: AutoML delivers prediction models with fair discriminatory performance, and good calibration and accuracy, which is as good as regression models with expert-based predictor pre-selection. In the context of the restricted availability of data in an ICU quality registry, extending the models with variables that are available at 24 hours after admission showed small (but significantly) performance increase.","output":"Can we reliably automate clinical prognostic modelling?

We aimed to evaluate whether ibuprofen use in individuals with COVID-19 was associated with more severe disease, compared with individuals using paracetamol or no antipyretics. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 from Shamir Medical Centre, Israel, we monitored any use of ibuprofen from a week before diagnosis of COVID-19 throughout the disease. Primary outcomes were mortality and the need for respiratory support, including oxygen administration and mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: The study included 403 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with a median age of 45 years. Of the entire cohort, 44 patients (11%) needed respiratory support and 12 (3%) died. One hundred and seventy-nine (44%) patients had fever, with 32% using paracetamol and 22% using ibuprofen, for symptom-relief. In the ibuprofen group, 3 (3.4%) patients died, whereas in the non-ibuprofen group, 9 (2.8%) patients died (p 0.95). Nine (10.3%) patients from the ibuprofen group needed respiratory support, compared with 35 (11%) from the non-ibuprofen group (p 1).

In this study, we measured the angles of the posterior fossa, specifically focusing on the surgical corridors used in MVD surgery for hemifacial spasm (HFS), to identify the proper surgical position. METHOD: The following parameters were assessed on preoperative magnetic resonance images (MRI): petrous angle (PA), sigmoid angle (SA), sigmoid diameter (SD), and root exit zone-sigmoid sinus edge angle (REZ-SEA). RESULTS: The mean PA was 59.7  5.6 degrees, SA was 16.8  8.6 degrees, SD was 13.4  3.5 mm, and the mean REZ-SEA was 59.6  5.8 degrees. The difference between the maximum SA to avoid cerebellar hemisphere injury and the minimum REZ-SEA required to verify the facial nerve REZ is assumed to be the usable range of angles for the operative microscope; the average midpoint of this range was 38.2  6.4 degrees. CONCLUSION: Turning the patient's head 10 degrees away from the affected side was generally appropriate for performing MVD surgery because it provided a mean microscope angle of 48 degrees. However, some patients had corner values for the sigmoid angle, REZ-SEA, and sigmoid sinus diameter.

Local, regional, and global food systems are unable to provide consumers with nutritious and affordable diets. Suboptimal diets exacerbate the triple burden of malnutrition, with micronutrient deficiencies affecting more than two billion people, two billion people suffering from overweight, and more than 140 million children who are stunted. The unaffordability of nutritious diets represents an obstacle for many, especially in low- and middle-income countries where healthy diets are five times more expensive than starchy staple diets. Food system transformations are urgently required to provide consumers with more affordable and nutritious diets that are capable of meeting social and environmental challenges. In this review, we underline the critical role of innovation within the food system transformation discourse. We aim to define principles for implementing evidence-based and long-term food system innovations that are economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable and, above all, aimed at improving diets and public health. We begin by defining and describing the role of innovation in the transformation of food systems and uncover the major barriers to implementing these innovations.

It is assumed that the process generating the conditional expected ranges at each time point switches between two regimes, labeled as upward market and downward market states. The disturbance term of the error process is also allowed to switch between two distributions depending on the regime. It is assumed that a self-adjusting threshold component that is driven by the past values of the time series determines the current market regime. The proposed model is able to capture aspects such as asymmetric and heteroscedastic behavior of volatility in financial markets. The proposed model is an attempt at addressing several potential deficits found in existing price range models such as the Conditional Autoregressive Range (CARR), Asymmetric CARR (ACARR), Feedback ACARR (FACARR) and Threshold Autoregressive Range (TARR) models. Parameters of the model are estimated using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method. A simulation study shows that the ML method performs well in estimating the TACARR model parameters. The empirical performance of the TACARR model was investigated using IBM index data and results show that the proposed model is a good alternative for in-sample prediction and out-of-sample forecasting of volatility.

Cerebral rSO2 before HD was monitored using the INVOS 5100c oxygen saturation monitor. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that cerebral rSO2 was independently associated with natural logarithm (Ln)-HD duration (standardized coefficient: -0.36), mean blood pressure (standardized coefficient: 0.13), pH (standardized coefficient: -0.10), serum albumin (standardized coefficient: 0.14), presence of diabetes mellitus (standardized coefficient: -0.20), and Hb level (standardized coefficient: 0.29). Furthermore, a generalized linear model with restricted cubic spline function was used to investigate the non-linear association between cerebral rSO2 and Hb levels. In the multivariable analysis for the adjustment with Ln-HD duration, mean blood pressure, pH, serum albumin, and presence of diabetes mellitus, a linear relationship was demonstrated between the two variables (p for linearity = 0.79). Hb levels revealed the positive and significant association with cerebral rSO2 in this study. Moreover, the relationship between cerebral rSO2 and Hb level was proven to be linear.

In the present study, we compared the harbour seal's timing abilities with the timing abilities of an otariid, the South African fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus). This comparison seemed essential as phocids and otariids differ in many respects and might, thus, also differ regarding their timing abilities. We determined time difference thresholds for sub- and suprasecond time intervals marked by a white circle on a black background displayed for a specific time interval on a monitor using a staircase method. Contrary to our expectation, the timing abilities of the fur seal and the harbour seal were comparable. Over a broad range of time intervals, 0.8-7 s in the fur seal and 0.8-30 s in the harbour seal, the difference thresholds followed Weber's law. In this range, both animals could discriminate time intervals differing only by 12 % and 14 % on average. Timing might, thus be a fundamental cue for pinnipeds in general to be used in various contexts, thereby complementing information provided by classical sensory systems. Future studies will help to clarify if timing is indeed involved in foraging decisions or the estimation of travel speed or distance.","output":"Visual timing abilities of a harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) and a South African fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus) for sub- and supra-second time intervals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: During this COVID\\\\19 pandemic, Taiwan is one of the few countries where fecal immunochemical test and endoscopic activity for colorectal cancer screening keeps ongoing.

To better understand the tradeoffs between economic and epidemic costs of lockdown interventions, we here focus on a simple SIR epidemic model and study lockdowns as solutions to an optimal control problem. We first show numerically that the optimal lockdown policy exhibits a phase transition from suppression to mitigation as the time horizon grows, i.e., if the horizon is short the optimal strategy is to impose severe lockdown to avoid diffusion of the infection, whereas if the horizon is long the optimal control steers the system to herd immunity to reduce economic loss. We then consider two alternative policies, motivated by government responses to the COVID19 pandemic, where lockdown levels are selected to either stabilize the reproduction number (i.e., \\"flatten the curve\\") or the fraction of infected (i.e., containing the number of hospitalizations). We compute analytically the performance of these two feedback policies and compare them to the optimal control.

METHODS: We collected and manually coded 3856 UK tweets and 9299 Chinese Sina Weibo posts mentioning COVID-19 testing from June 1 to July 15, 2020. Adapted from the World Health Organizations 3C Model of Vaccine Hesitancy, we employed social listening analysis examining key factors of COVID-19 testing hesitancy (confidence, complacency, convenience, and communication). Descriptive analysis, time trends, geographical mapping, and chi-squared tests were performed to assess the temporal, spatial, and sociodemographic characteristics that determine the difference in attitudes or uptake of COVID-19 tests. RESULTS: The UK tweets demonstrated a higher percentage of support toward COVID-19 testing than the posts from China. There were much wider reports of public uptake of COVID-19 tests in mainland China than in the United Kingdom; however, uncomfortable experiences and logistical barriers to testing were more expressed in China. The driving forces for undergoing COVID-19 testing were personal health needs, community-wide testing, and mandatory testing policies for travel, with major differences in the ranking order between the two countries.

After qPCR testing, the screening gray zone samples can be successfully checked by the CRISPR/Cas12a method. Furthermore, to conduct CRISPR reaction assay more conveniently and prevent possible aerosol contamination in the operational process, a gray zone checking cassette is designed. African swine fever virus (ASFV) is selected as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of the CRISPR-based checking method. Of 28 real swine blood samples, 6 ASFV qPCR gray zone samples are successfully checked. The CRISPR-based checking method provides a novel solution to eliminate gray zone sample problems with no additional effects on the PCR, which is operable and applicable in practical detection. The entire process can be completed within 10-15 min. This method will be a good supplementary and assistance for qPCR-based detection, especially in the diagnosis of diseases such as COVID-19.","output":"CRISPR/Cas12a-Based Versatile Method for Checking Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction Samples with Cycles of Threshold Values in the Gray Zone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a patient in whom the deep inferior epigastric artery served as a collateral pathway to the lower extremities, and free latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap transfer was successfully used for reconstruction instead of the originally planned free rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap. A 74-year-old woman underwent subtotal tongue resection, followed by free flap tongue reconstruction for tongue cancer. Reconstruction using a free rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap was considered; however, preoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed complete occlusion of the bilateral external iliac arteries. Doppler ultrasonography revealed retrograde blood flow via the deep inferior epigastric artery, and the internal thoracic artery-deep inferior epigastric artery pathway served as a collateral pathway that supplied the lower extremities. The patient underwent reconstructive surgery using a free latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap, and the flap completely survived. The internal thoracic artery-deep inferior epigastric artery pathway serves as a critical collateral pathway to the lower extremities in patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease. Blockage of the deep inferior epigastric artery in patients in whom this vessel shows retrograde blood flow may result in lower extremity ischemia. Therefore, preoperative Doppler ultrasonography is warranted to confirm the direction of the blood flow, in addition to evaluation of the deep inferior epigastric artery and its perforators before planning rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap or deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap surgery.","output":"Deep inferior epigastric artery as a collateral pathway to the lower extremities: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The on-going SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 discovered in December 2019, is responsible for a global pandemic.

METHODS: A retrospective observational study with prospective health related quality of life (HRQoL) assessment was conducted in ARDS patients who had ECMO as a rescue therapy for reversible refractory hypoxemia from January 2009 until April 2011 in a tertiary Australian centre. Survival and long-term quality of life assessment, using the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and the EuroQol health related quality of life questionnaire (EQ5D) were assessed and compared to international data from other research groups. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (mean age 36.3 years) with ARDS receiving ECMO for refractory hypoxemia were studied. Eighteen (86%) patients were retrieved from external intensive care units (ICUs) by a dedicated ECMO retrieval team. Eleven (55%) had H1N1 influenza A-associated pneumonitis. Eighteen (86%) patients survived to hospital discharge. Of the 18 survivors, ten (56%) were discharged to other hospitals and 8 (44%) were discharged directly home. Sequelae and health related quality of life were evaluated for 15 of the 18 (71%) long-term survivors (assessment at median 8 months). Mean SF-36 scores were significantly lower across all domains compared to age and sex matched Australian norms. Mean SF-36 scores were lower (minimum important difference at least 5 points) than previously described ARDS survivors in the domains of general health, mental health, vitality and social function. One patient had long-term disability as a result of ICU acquired weakness. Only 26% of survivors had returned to previous work levels at the time of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This ARDS cohort had a high survival rate (86%) after use of ECMO support for reversible refractory hypoxemia. Long term survivors had similar physical health but decreased mental health, general health, vitality and social function compared to other ARDS survivors and an unexpectedly poor return to work.","output":"Long-term quality of life in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for refractory hypoxaemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: on March 17th, 2020, Oyo State recorded her first case of COVID-19 through a United Kingdom returnee Oyo State Ministry of Health with the support of technical and development partners responded quickly and effectively to contain the outbreak The outbreak was characterized by place, person and time Methods: field investigations were conducted and contact tracing and follow up done, all confirmed cases were identified, line-listed and analyzed using Epi-info version 7 Results: a total of 34 confirmed cases were identified all within the capital city of Oyo State and two transferred from other states The mean age was 49 1  2 0 years with over 40% within the age group 50-59 years There were 11(35 5%) health care workers infection The case-fatality was 6 5% The epidemic curve initially shows a typical propagated pattern, followed by a point source;though atypical Conclusion: outbreak of COVID-19 was confirmed in Oyo State Field investigation provided information on the characteristics of persons, time and place Intensified surveillance activities such as contact tracing and follow-up, drive through testing and active case search were useful in early case detection and control of the outbreak ?

On polysomnography, rapid eye movement associated sleep apnea with an increased hypopnea index during rapid eye movement phases of 36.8 and 19.5 events per hour was found. Based on the patients' burdensome fatigue symptoms, we initiated automatic positive airway pressure therapy, which diminished sleep apnea (rapid eye movement index: 0.0 in both patients) and, consequently, also the fatigue symptoms.

With more than 266 million confirmed cases, over 5.26 million deaths already recorded at the time of writing, COVID-19 continues to spread in many parts of the world. Consequently, mass testing for SARS-CoV-2 will remain at the forefront of the COVID-19 response and prevention for the near future. Due to biosafety considerations the standard testing process requires a significant amount of manual handling of patient samples within calibrated microbiological safety cabinets. This makes the process expensive, effects operator ergonomics and restricts testing to higher containment level laboratories. We have successfully modified the process by using industrial catering ovens for bulk heat inactivation of oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swab samples within their secondary containment packaging before processing in the lab to enable all subsequent activities to be performed in the open laboratory. As part of a validation process, we tested greater than 1200 clinical COVID-19 samples and showed less than 1 Cq loss in RT-qPCR test sensitivity. We also demonstrate the bulk heat inactivation protocol inactivates a murine surrogate of human SARS-CoV-2. Using bulk heat inactivation, the assay is no longer reliant on containment level 2 facilities and practices, which reduces cost, improves operator safety and ergonomics and makes the process scalable. In addition, heating as the sole method of virus inactivation is ideally suited to streamlined and more rapid workflows such as direct to PCR assays that do not involve RNA extraction or chemical neutralisation methods.","output":"Heat inactivation of clinical COVID-19 samples on an industrial scale for low risk and efficient high-throughput qRT-PCR diagnostic testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results, postoperative outcomes, and cost of robotic assistance in right hemicolectomy and determine its safety, feasibility, and efficacy as compared with the conventional laparoscopic approach. METHODS From August 2005 to February 2009, 40 robot-assisted right hemicolectomies were performed by the authors at a single institution. These were compared with 135 laparoscopic right hemicolectomies performed by the authors, at the same hospital and during the same time period. Cost data from July 2006 until the end of the study period were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS Both groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists' class, history of prior abdominal surgery, and diagnosis. There was no significant difference in the lymph node harvest, estimated blood loss, conversion rate, length of stay, or incidence of complications and wound infection between the 2 groups. A robotic procedure was associated with a longer operative time (P < .001) and a higher cost (P = .003). CONCLUSION Robotic assistance in right hemicolectomy is safe and feasible but is associated with a longer operative time and, at present, with a higher cost compared with laparoscopy.

This study describes unintentional exposures (oral or ocular) to these substances by children during the first year (2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the previous year (2019). METHODS This was a retrospective observational study of unintentional exposures reported to the Victorian Poisons Information Centre for the period 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2020. Substances included topical antiseptics (including hand sanitisers), bleach, multipurpose cleaners, disinfectants and high-percentage ethanol products. We analysed data for two age groups; under 5 years and 5 to 14 years. RESULTS Oral exposures (ingestion or buccal) to topical antiseptics increased from 435 in 2019 to 882 in 2020 in the under 5 age group, with peak call numbers in 2020 coinciding with peaks in active COVID-19 daily case numbers. Oral exposures in older children (5-14 years) were lower (23 and 77 in 2019 and 2020, respectively). No children had moderate or severe symptoms at the time of the call to the Poisons Centre. Ocular exposures to topical antiseptics more than doubled from 2019 to 2020 (from 20 to 53 among children under 5 years, and 8 to 18 in older children). The majority of children with ocular exposure presented with mild symptoms; one had moderate symptoms. Changes in exposures to disinfectants, bleach and cleaners were smaller and not consistent with peaks in active COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS Unintentional oral exposures to topical disinfectants (mainly hand sanitiser) by young children increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and were more prevalent during periods of increased COVID-19 cases. While there were no cases of severe harm identified, the high number of exposures suggests that appropriate use and storage of hand sanitisers should be promoted.","output":"Exposure to hand sanitisers and other cleaning products in Victoria, Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article provides the findings of an exploratory, qualitative study on distance learning policies and practices from a purposeful sample of five California school districts and 25 district and school leaders with large numbers and/or larger percentages of current or former English Learners To understand the extent to which leaders address English Learners/Emergent Bilinguals (EL/EM) needs during the pandemic, we posed the following research question: What are leaders local policies and practices in designing and implementing distance learning to promote equity for English Learners?

To understand the role of these molecules in AAV and their potential as therapeutic targets we have studied 1) The relationship between these DAMPS and disease activity, 2) The expression of RAGE and sRAGE in biopsy tissue and peripheral blood and 3) The effect of these molecules on ANCA-mediated cytokine production. METHODS: We examined circulating levels of calgranulins (S100A8/A9 and S100A12), HMGB1 and sRAGE by ELISA. RAGE was examined in AAV kidney and lung biopsies by immunohistochemistry and RAGE expression was monitored in peripheral blood by qPCR. In vitro, the effect of co-stimulating PBMC with ANCA and S100A8/A9 on cytokine production was studied by ELISA. RESULTS: We found significantly raised levels of calgranulins and HMGB1 in active AAV regardless of clinical phenotype (PR3+/MPO+ AAV). Levels of calgranulins showed significant correlations with each other. RAGE protein and message was raised in peripheral blood and in cells infiltrating kidney and lung biopsy tissue, whilst sRAGE was lowered. Furthermore, ANCA-mediated production of IL-8 from PBMC was significantly enhanced by the presence of S100A8/A9 in a RAGE/TLR4 dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Raised circulating calgranulins provide a good marker of disease activity in AAV and are unlikely to be counteracted by sRAGE. Increased RAGE expression in AAV indicates receptor stimulation in active disease which may exacerbate ANCA induced cytokine production.

METHODS: We surveyed 100 consecutive patients participating in orthopaedic virtual phone clinic (VPC) at an academic hospital to evaluate patient satisfaction against face-to-face (F2F) consultations and obtain suggestions for improving patient experience, and we surveyed 23 clinicians who conducted orthopaedic VPCs in 2020. Data were correlated with clinic outcomes, reason for consultation, diagnosis, patient age and clinician grade. Consultation duration, clinician-associated costs and reimbursement were analysed. Significance was tested using two-tailed Students t-test and Fishers exact test. RESULTS: Patient satisfaction (out of 5) for VPC was significantly lower than F2F (4.1 vs 4.5, p=0.0003), and a larger proportion of VPC scored <3 compared with F2F (11% vs 2%). Higher VPC scores were associated with appointments for delivering results and where patients felt clinical examination was not needed. Patients suggested introducing video capability, adhering to appointment time and offering the choice of VPC or F2F. Mean clinician satisfaction scores for VPC were 4.3/5 and suggested indications for VPC included: routine surveillance, communication of results, discussing/consenting for surgery and vulnerable patients. Integrating video, providing private rooms and offering patients time intervals for VPC were recommended. Current National Health Service VPC structures uses greater clinician resources and generates lower reimbursement than F2F consultations, resulting in 11.5% reduction in reimbursement. CONCLUSION: VPC plays a valuable role when clinical evaluation has been performed or considered not necessary. Offering the choice of VPC or F2F, adding video capability and providing a time interval for VPC may reduce resource use and increase satisfaction.

Objective: This study aimed to analyze the usefulness of telemedical systems for providing personal care in the prevention of CVD. Methods: A systematic review analysis was conducted on the literature available from libraries such as PubMed (Medline), Scopus (Embase), and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Data available in the last 10 years (2011C2020) were also examined by PRISMA guidelines. The selected studies were divided into two categories: (1) benefits of telemedicine in CVD prevention, and (2) recent progress in telemedical services for personalized care of CVD. Results: The literature search produced 587 documents, and 19 articles were considered in this review. Results highlighted that the timely delivery of preventive care for CVD which can be implemented virtually can benefit and modify morbidity and mortality.

Conclusions: Telemedicine platforms can be used for regular checkups for CVD and contribute to preventing the occurrence of acute events and more in general the progression of CVD.","output":"The Benefits of Telemedicine in Personalized Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD): A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) is more complicated than laparoscopic distal gastrectomy, especially during a surgeon's initial experience with the technique. In this study, we evaluated the short-term outcomes of and learning curve for LTG during the initial cases of a single surgeon compared with those of open total gastrectomy (OTG). MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 2009 and 2013, 134 OTG and 74 LTG procedures were performed by a single surgeon who was experienced with OTG but new to performing LTG. Clinical characteristics, operative parameters, and short-term postoperative outcomes were compared between groups. RESULTS Advanced gastric cancer and D2 lymph node dissection were more common in the OTG than LTG group. Although the operation time was significantly longer for LTG than for OTG (175.743.1 minutes vs. 217.563.4 minutes), LTG seems to be slightly superior or similar to OTG in terms of postoperative recovery measures. The operation time moving average of 15 cases in the LTG group decreased gradually, and the curve flattened at 54 cases. The postoperative complication rate was similar for the two groups (11.9% vs. 13.5%). No anastomotic or stump leaks occurred. CONCLUSIONS Although LTG is technically difficult and operation time is longer for surgeons experienced in open surgery, it can be performed safely, even during a surgeon's early experience with the technique. Considering the benefits of minimally invasive surgery, LTG is recommended for early gastric cancer.","output":"Short-Term Outcomes of Laparoscopic Total Gastrectomy Performed by a Single Surgeon Experienced in Open Gastrectomy: Review of Initial Experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Headache is an important manifestation during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, the aim was to identify factors associated with headache in COVID-19 and headache characteristics. METHODS: This case-control study includes COVID-19 hospitalized patients with pneumonia during March 2020. Controls comprise COVID-19 patients without headache and the cases are COVID-19 patients with headache. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were obtained from the medical records. Headache characteristics were evaluated by semi-structured telephonic interview after discharge. RESULTS: Of a total of 379 COVID-19 patients, 48 (13%) developed headache. Amongst these, 30 (62%) were men and the median age was 57.9 (47-73) years. Headache was associated with younger age, fewer comorbidities and reduced mortality, as well as with low levels of C-reactive protein, mild acute respiratory distress syndrome and oropharyngeal symptoms. A logistic multiple regression model revealed that headache was directly associated with D-dimer and creatinine levels, the use of high flow nasal cannula and arthromyalgia, whilst urea levels, beta-lactamic treatment and hypertension were negatively associated with headache. COVID-19-associated headache characteristics were available for 23/48 (48%) patients. Headache was the onset symptom in 8/20 (40%) patients, of mild or moderate intensity in 17/20 (85%) patients, with oppressive characteristics in 17/18 (94%) and of holocranial 8/19 (42%) or temporal 7/19 (37%) localization. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that headache is associated with a more benign SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19-associated headache appears as an early symptom and as a novel headache with characteristics of headache attributed to systemic viral infection. Further research addressing the underlying mechanisms to confirm these findings is warranted.","output":"Headache during SARS-CoV-2 infection as an early symptom associated with a more benign course of disease: a case-control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasing geographical mobility and international travel augment the ease and speed by which infectious diseases can spread across large distances. It is therefore incumbent upon each state to ensure that immunisation programmes are effective and that herd immunity is achieved. Across Europe, a range of immunisation policies exist: compulsion, the offer of financial incentives to parents or healthcare professionals, social and professional pressure, or simply the dissemination of clear information and advice. Until recently, immunisation against particular communicable diseases was compulsory in Italy. The Italian National Vaccination Plan (NVP) (2005-7) paved the way for regions to suspend the sanctions associated with compulsory vaccinations for children when certain criteria are met--for example when immunisation coverage is high and when effective monitoring/surveillance systems are in place--and thus marked a milestone in the move from compulsory to voluntary immunisation. The forthcoming NVP for 2008-10 confirms the liberal approach to vaccination in Italy as it entrusts to the regions responsibility for the achievement and maintenance of herd immunity. This paper reviews the arguments for and against compulsory and voluntary immunisation in relation to the Italian NVP (2005-7) and in the context of the diverse immunisation policies that exist across Europe. It concludes with cautious support for the NVP and an associated shift from compulsory to voluntary immunisation in Italy, and draws similarities between issues concerning regional variation in immunisation policy in Italy and national variation in immunisation policy across Europe and beyond.","output":"From compulsory to voluntary immunisation: Italy's National Vaccination Plan (2005-7) and the ethical and organisational challenges facing public health policy-makers across Europe."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unexpected development and quick;however, the uncontrolled overall spread of the Coronavirus shows us the disappointment of existing human services observation frameworks to convenient handle general wellbeing crises In spite of the fact that upgrades in medicinal services observation have been understood, these still miss the mark in forestalling commotion Absence of important advances taken to guarantee control and following of the infection have bothered the circumstance Blockchain innovation has progressively been referenced as an instrument to help with different parts of various applications This paper highlights the role of blockchain in forestalling the future of pandemics Various use cases of blockchain technology that can help in the battle against the COVID-19 are also highlighted in this paper ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Role of blockchain in forestalling pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on the spectral representation method of random function and combined with memoryless nonlinear translation theory, this paper analyzes the transformation relationship between potential Gaussian random process and non-Gaussian random process, and successfully generates a stationary non-Gaussian random process that conforms to the target non-Gaussian random process. For the non-stationary non-Gaussian random process simulation, on the basis of the stationary Gaussian random process, the intensity non-stationary uniform modulation model is used to modulate it, and combined with the nonlinear translation theory, the non-stationary non-Gaussian random process conforming to the target non-Gaussian random process is obtained. Aiming at the single-leg bouncing model based on the flexible rotary hip joint, the stability of its bouncing motion under passive motion is studied, and the influence of the flexible hip rotary joint on the motion stability is analyzed by comparing the single-leg bouncing motion characteristics of the free rotary hip joint. Based on the inverse dynamic control of the air phase, the fixed point distribution of the single-leg bounce of the flexible rotary hip joint was improved, and the function of the flexible rotary hip joint in the energy conversion of the bouncing motion was studied by establishing the energy consumption evaluation function. The kinematic performance verification, dynamic performance verification, dynamic parameter identification verification, and modal experiment simulation analysis were carried out for the built experimental platform, and the comparison and analysis with its theoretical model were carried out. The results show that the theoretical motion trajectory of the test mobile platform is basically consistent with the actual motion trajectory in the X and Y directions, and there is a small error in the Z-axis direction, and the error is within an acceptable range, indicating that the experimental platform system can be used to simulate the human hip joint. There is a large error between the theoretical value of the driving torque calculated by the theoretical value of the dynamic parameters and the measured value, and the dynamic theoretical model cannot accurately predict the driving torque. The predicted value of the driving torque calculated by using the identification value of the dynamic parameters is in good agreement with the measured torque, and its confidence is increased by 10C16%, indicating that the dynamic parameter identification method in this paper has a high degree of confidence.","output":"Detection and Analysis of Bionic Motion Pose of Single Leg and Hip Joint Based on Random Process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Regional labour markets and their properties are named as potential reasons for regional variations in SARS-CoV-2 infections rates, but empirical evidence is missing. Methods Using notification data on laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, we calculated weekly age-standardised incidence rates (ASIRs) for working-age populations at the regional level of Germanys 400 districts. Data covered nearly two years (March 2020 till December 2021), including four main waves of the pandemic. For each of the pandemic waves, we investigated regional differences in weekly ASIRs according to three regional labour market indicators: (1) employment rate, (2) employment by sector, and (3) capacity to work from home. We use spatial panel regression analysis, which incorporates geospatial information and accounts for regional clustering of infections. Results For all four pandemic waves under study, we found that regions with higher proportions of people in employment had higher ASIRs and a steeper increase of infections during the waves. Further, the composition of the workforce mattered: rates were higher in regions with larger secondary sectors or if opportunities of working from home were comparatively low. Associations remained consistent after adjusting for potential confounders, including a proxy measure of regional vaccination progress. Conclusions If further validated by studies using individual-level data, our study calls for increased intervention efforts to improve protective measures at the workplace, particularly among workers of the secondary sector with no opportunities to work from home.

Although often distinct and evolving relatively independently, health disparity, social vulnerability and environmental justice research and practice intertwine and inform one another. Together, they increasingly provide evidence of how social processes intensify disasters almost predictably giving rise to inequitable disruptions and consequences. The domino and cumulative effects of cascading disasters invariably reveal inequities through differential impacts and recovery opportunities across communities and subgroups of people. Not only do cascading disasters reveal and produce inequitable effects, the cascade itself can emerge out of compounded nested social structures. Drawing on, and integrating, theory and practice from social vulnerability, health inequity, and environmental justice, this paper presents a comprehensive conceptual model of cascading disasters that offers a people-centric lens. The CHASMS conceptual model (Cascading Hazards to disAsters that are Socially constructed eMerging out of Social Vulnerability) interrogates the tension between local communities and the larger structural forces that produce social inequities at multiple levels, capturing how those inequities lead to cascading disasters. We apply the model to COVID-19 as an illustration of how underlying inequities give rise to foreseeable inequitable outcomes, emphasizing the U.S. experience. We offer Kenya and Puerto Rico as examples of cumulative effects and possible cascades when responding to other events in the shadow of COVID-19. COVID-19 has vividly exposed the dynamic, complex, and intense relevance of placing social conditions and structures at the forefront of cascading disaster inquiry and practice. The intensity of social disruption and the continuation of the pandemic will, no doubt, perpetuate and magnify chasms of injustice.","output":"The CHASMS conceptual model of cascading disasters and social vulnerability: The COVID-19 case example"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: to describe and discussing the challenges of SUS in the current scenario and also the role of Health Surveillance in the context of the new coronavirus pandemic Method: Theoretical essay anchored in national and international scientific literature, plus authors' critical analysis Based on the theoretical construction on reflective thinking, the following were discussed, the Health Surveillance in the context of the epidemic of the new coronavirus;and the challenges of SUS in contemporary times Results: The biggest challenge nowadays remains political and resisting the attacks and risks of dismantling the SUS due to fiscal adjustment policies Other challenges including, the economic and financial interests linked to healthcare companies;political proposal for Universal Health Coverage;divestment;insufficient public infrastructure;reproduction of the hegemonic medical model Conclusion: It is expected that the COVID-19 pandemic will arouse reflections in the population regarding repoliticization of society in defense of SUS as a UHS Objetivo: describir y discutir los desafos del SUS en el escenario actual y el rol de la Vigilancia en Salud en el contexto de la pandemia de coronavirus Mtodo: Ensayo terico anclado en la literatura cientfica nacional e internacional, ms anlisis crtico de los autores A partir de la construccin terica sobre el pensamiento reflexivo, se discuti, la Vigilancia de la Salud en el contexto de la epidemia del COVID-19;y los desafos del SUS en la actualidad Resultados: El mayor desafo en la actualidad sigue siendo poltico y resistir los ataques y riesgos de desmantelar el SUS por las polticas de ajuste fiscal Otros desafos incluyen, los intereses econmicos y financieros vinculados a las empresas de salud;propuesta poltica de Cobertura Universal de Salud;despojo;infraestructura pblica insuficiente;reproduccin del modelo mdico hegemnico Conclusin: Se espera que la pandemia COVID-19 suscite reflexiones en la poblacin sobre la repolitizacin de la sociedad en defensa del SUS como Sistema de Salud Universal Objetivo: descrever e discutir sobre os desafios do SUS na atualidade e a atua??o da Vigilancia em Sade no contexto da pandemia do novo coronavrus Mtodo: Ensaio terico ancorado na literatura cientfica nacional e internacional, acrescida da anlise crtica dos autores Com base na constru??o terica sobre o pensar reflexivo, foram abordados, a Vigilancia em Sade no contexto da epidemia do novo coronavrus;e os desafios do SUS na contemporaneidade Resultados: O maior desafio na atualidade continua sendo poltico, e resistir aos ataques e riscos de desmantelamento do SUS pelas polticas de ajuste fiscal Outros desafios incluem, os interesses econ?micos e financeiros ligados s empresas de sade;proposta poltico-ideolgica da Cobertura Universal em Sade;desfinanciamento;insuficincia da infraestrutura pblica;reprodu??o do modelo mdico hegem?nico Conclus?o: Espera- se que a pandemia de COVID-19 desperte reflex?es na popula??o em rela??o  repolitiza??o da sociedade em defesa do SUS enquanto Sistema Universal de Sade","output":"Vigilancia em Sade na pandemia de COVID-19 e os desafios do SUS na atualidade"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The grass-roots civil servants are the final implementers and executors of a series of government policies and the fundamental force for social stability and harmonious development. However, the mental health problems of grass-roots civil servants have not got full attention. This study aimed to assess the impact of resilience on anxiety and depression among grass-roots civil servants in China. METHOD: From Oct to Dec 2019, 302 civil servants completed a series of questionnaires. The Civil Servants Stress Scale (CSSS) was used to assess the stress of civil servants. The Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) and the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) were used to evaluate the depression and anxiety of participants, respectively. The resilience of civil servants evaluates by the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RSCI). We conducted the moderating and mediating analysis on the impact of resilience on depression and anxiety in grass-roots civil servants. RESULTS: There were significant differences in gender, education, position, relationship with coworkers, physical exercise, and monthly income for stress in grass-roots civil servants (P < 0.05). Resilience can negatively regulate the stress of grass-roots civil servants, and an effective mediator and moderator in the relationship between stress and anxiety and depression and the mediating effect ratios of 7.77 and 22.79%. CONCLUSION: Resilience has moderating and mediating effects on the relationship between stress and depression, and anxiety. The negative effects of stress on depression and anxiety of grass-roots civil servants can be buffered by resilience as a dynamic moderator directly and indirectly. These findings contribute to society and government better understand the mental health status of grass-roots civil servants and provide references and guidance for the formulation of corresponding management and prevention measures.","output":"The impact of resilience on anxiety and depression among grass-roots civil servants in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions can be considered as important symptoms to screen for the mild cases of the COVID-19 disease. However, there are limited studies on the specificity of olfactory and gustatory changes in patients with COVID-19, and it is unclear to what extent the changes may be unique to the disease. This study aimed to evaluate the duration and outcome of olfactory and gustatory disorders in patients with COVID-19. Methods: The study population was patients with COVID-19 at Afzalipour Hospital whose disease was confirmed by nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. 20 patients with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions were studied. Data were collected using two forms, which were completed at the time of diagnosis and two weeks after the onset of the disease. Results: In 20% of the patients, olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions were among the early symptoms. In 85% of the cases, these dysfunctions were permanent during the disease. 30% of the cases had a chronic underlying disease such as sinusitis, nasal polyps, and allergy. In follow-up, 13 patients (60%) reported that their olfactory dysfunctions had completely improved. Conclusion: The patients whose only symptom is the sudden olfactory or gustatory dysfunction or the dysfunctions are among their early symptoms, should be screened for COVID-19.

In the post-meiotic spermatogenic cells, BRDT protein binds to the hyperacetylated histones and facilitates their replacement with transition proteins (TPs), particularly protamines, which are essential for chromatin condensation. The current research was conducted to assess the expression and epigenetic profile of BRDT in the testis tissues of infertile men. Materials and Methods In this case-control study, three groups were included: positive control group: obstructive azoospermia (OA, n=10), round spermatid maturation arrest group (SMA, n=10) and negative control group: sertoli cellonly syndrome (SCOS, n=10). Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the expression profile of BRDT was generated. Also, ChIP-real time PCR was used to measure the following histone marks: H3K9ac, H3K9me3, H3K4me3, H3K27me3 on the promoter region of BRDT. Results Our data indicated that BRDT expression decreased in the SMA group in comparison with the positive control group and this finding is in line with the ChIP results obtained in this group. Conclusion Based on these data, we postulate that BRDT gene has a vital role in the spermatogenesis and its decreased expression due to an aberrant epigenetic signaling might be associated with male infertility.","output":"Epigenetic Dysregulation of BRDT Gene in Testis Tissues of Infertile Men: Case-Control Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The United States has experienced a surge of COVID-19 cases and deaths Regardless of the overall increase in the prevalence and mortality, there are disagreements about the consequences of exposure and contracting COVID-19, specifically in rural areas Rural areas have inherent characteristics that increase their vulnerability to contracting COVID-19 The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in death rates from COVID-19 between urban and rural areas in the United States METHODS: This study used county-level data The data set consisted of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths along with county-level demographics The sample consisted of all counties in the 50 US states and DC Counties were designated as metropolitan, micropolitan, and rural A zero-inflated negative binomial regression was used to estimate county-level number of deaths conditional on contracting COVID-19 The study focused on COVID-19-related mortality from February 10, 2020, to June 12, 2020 FINDINGS: After controlling for county-level characteristics, the rate of COVID-19 deaths was 70 3% (P &lt; 001) for rural counties and 53 4% (P &lt; 001) for micropolitan counties, both significantly lower than metropolitan counties during the study time period CONCLUSION: Over time, rural geography and social isolation may not provide sustainable protection to rural residents from the pandemic The slow progression provides rural areas additional time and opportunity to learn from the experiences in urban areas that were most affected Rural areas need to be proactive and develop prevention strategies and response plans to manage and control the spread of COVID-19","output":"Deaths From COVID-19 in Rural, Micropolitan, and Metropolitan Areas: A County-Level Comparison"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic powerfully demonstrates the consequences of biothreats. Countries will want to know how to better prepare for future events. The Global Health Security Index (GHSI) is a broad, independent assessment of 195 countries preparedness for biothreats that may aid this endeavour. However, to be useful, the GHSIs external validity must be demonstrated. We aimed to validate the GHSI against a range of external metrics to assess how it could be utilised by countries. METHODS: Global aggregate communicable disease outcomes were correlated with GHSI scores and linear regression models were examined to determine associations while controlling for a number of global macroindices. GHSI scores for countries previously exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome and Ebola and recipients of US Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) investment were compared with matched control countries. Possible content omissions in light of the progressing COVID-19 pandemic were assessed. RESULTS: GHSI scores for countries had strong criterion validity against the Joint External Evaluation ReadyScore (rho=0.82, p<0.0001), and moderate external validity against deaths from communicable diseases (?0.56, p<0.0001). GHSI scores were associated with reduced deaths from communicable diseases (F(3, 172)=22.75, p<0.0001). The proportion of deaths from communicable diseases decreased 4.8% per 10-point rise in GHSI. Recipient countries of the GHSA (n=31) and SARS-affected countries (n=26), had GHSI scores 6.0 (p=0.0011) and 8.2 (p=0.0010) points higher than matched controls, respectively. Biosecurity and biosafety appear weak globally including in high-income countries, and health systems, particularly in Africa, are not prepared. Notably, the GHSI does not account for all factors important for health security. CONCLUSION: The GHSI shows promise as a valid tool to guide action on biosafety, biosecurity and systems preparedness. However, countries need to look beyond existing metrics to other factors moderating the impact of future pandemics and other biothreats. Consideration of anthropogenic and large catastrophic scenarios is also needed.","output":"Validation analysis of Global Health Security Index (GHSI) scores 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The flipped classroom method requires that students engage with homework before coming to the classroom so that class time can be spent on active and collaborative learning exercises. Research has demonstrated that this can improve student performance versus traditional lecturer-led teaching methods. Objective: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the vast majority of teaching has been entirely online such that even in-class time has been virtual. The current article examined whether online-only delivery affects the efficacy of the flipped classroom approach. Method: Grades for a research methods and statistics module and a statistics portfolio assignment were compared across consecutive cohorts of undergraduate psychology students taught by different methods. Results: Overall grades on the module did not differ significantly across teaching methods but student performance on statistics tests did. Flipped classrooms, whether accompanied by on-campus or synchronous online classes, led to significantly better performance than traditional methods. No detriment was observed by teaching entirely online. Conclusion: The key advantages of the flipped classroom method appear driven by active learning which can occur irrespective of classroom context. Teaching Implications: Using flipped classrooms can be a useful tool, particularly in subjects where students may otherwise be less engaged with the content.

Therefore, effective containment strategies, such as sanitizing, are critical. Nanotechnology can represent an alternative to reduce the COVID-19 spread, particularly in critical areas, such as healthcare facilities and public places. Nanotechnology-based products are effective at inhibiting different pathogens, including viruses, regardless of their drug-resistant profile, biological structure, or physiology. Although there are several approved nanotechnology-based antiviral products, this work aims to highlight the use of nanomaterials as sanitizers for the prevention of the spread of mainly SARS-Cov-2. It has been widely demonstrated that nanomaterials are an alternative for sanitizing surfaces to inactivate the virus. Also, antimicrobial nanomaterials can reduce the risk of secondary microbial infections on COVID-19 patients, as they inhibit the bacteria and fungi that can contaminate healthcare-related facilities. Finally, cost-effective, easy-to-synthesize antiviral nanomaterials could reduce the burden of the COVID-19 on challenging environments and in developing countries.","output":"Nanotechnology as an Alternative to Reduce the Spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hintergrund Die COVID-19-Pandemie (?coronavirus disease 2019) stellt im Gesundheitsbereich eine Herausforderung dar.

The management of vascular access during the epidemic is currently unknown. METHODS In this multicenter cross-sectional study, we collected vascular access data from hemodialysis patients treated at 44 hospitals in Hubei from 22 January to 10 March 2020. We estimated the management of vascular access during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. RESULTS Of the 9231 hemodialysis patients included, 5387 patients (58.4%) were men and 2959 patients (32.1%) were older than 65 years. Arteriovenous fistula was the predominant type of vascular access, accounting for 76.5%; 496 patients (5.4%) developed vascular access complications; catheter flow reduction was the most common vascular access complication, and stenosis was the predominant complication among those with arteriovenous access. Overall, 280 vascular access sites were placed in patients newly diagnosed with uremia, of whom 260 (92.8%) underwent catheter insertion; 149 rescue procedures were carried out to treat the vascular access complications, which consisted of 132 catheters, 7 percutaneous transluminal angioplasties, 6 arteriovenous fistula repairs, and 4 arteriovenous fistulas. Occlusion of the arteriovenous access had the highest rescue rate (92.7%), while many other vascular access complications remained untreated; 69 and 142 patients were diagnosed with confirmed and suspected coronavirus disease 2019, respectively. A total of 146 patients died, of whom 29 patients (19.9%) died due to vascular access complications. CONCLUSION Catheter flow reduction and stenosis of arteriovenous access were the major vascular access complications. Most of the vascular access sites established were catheters, and many of the vascular access complications remained untreated.","output":"The management of vascular access in hemodialysis patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic: A multicenter cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A persistently coronavirus-infected embryonic stem (ES) cell line A3/MHV was established by infecting an ES cell line, A3-1, with mouse hepatitis virus type-2.

However, the health literacy of urban and rural populations in China has been little known. Thus, this study aims to assess the status of health literacy and explore the differences of its possible determinants (e.g., socio-economic factors) among urban and rural populations in Henan, China. A cross-sectional study, 78,646 participants were recruited from a populous province in central China with a multi-stage random sampling design. The Chinese Resident Health Literacy Scale was adopted to measure the health literacy of the respondents. In the participants, the level of health literacy (10.21%) in central China was significantly lower than the national average, and a big gap was identified between urban and rural populations (16.92% vs. 8.09%). A noticeable difference was reported in different aspects and health issues of health literacy between urban and rural populations. The health literacy level was lower in those with lower levels of education, and a significant difference was identified in the level of health literacy among people of different ages and occupations in both urban and rural areas. Note that in rural areas, as long as residents educated, they all had higher odds to exhibit basic health literacy than those uneducated; in rural areas, compared with those aged 15 to 24 years, residents aged 45 to 54 years (OR = 0.846,95% CI (0.730, 0.981)), 55 to 64 years (OR = 0.716,95% CI (0.614, 0.836)) and above 65 years (OR = 0.679, 95% CI (0.567, 0.812)) were 84.6%, 71.6%, and 67.9%, respectively, less likely to exhibit basic health literacy.

While this practice has improved livestock production, it is a major cause of antimicrobial resistance in microbes affecting livestock and humans. This has led to the banning of prophylactic antibiotic use in animals in many countries. To compensate for this, alternatives have been sought from natural sources such as plants. While many studies have reported the antimicrobial activity of medicinal plants with potential for use as phytogenic/botanical feed additives, little information exists on their mode of action. This study is based on our earlier work and describes ultrastructural damage induced by acetone crude leaf extracts of Syzygium legatii and Eugenia zeyheri (Myrtaceae) active against diarrhoeagenic E. coli of swine origin using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and fluorescent microscopy (FM). Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to investigate the chemical composition of plant extracts. RESULTS: The extracts damaged the internal and external anatomy of the cytoplasmic membrane and inner structure at a concentration of 0.04 mg/mL. Extracts also led to an increased influx of propidium iodide into treated bacterial cells suggesting compromised cellular integrity and cellular damage. Non-polar compounds such as &#945;-amyrin, friedelan-3-one, lupeol, and ?-sitosterol were abundant in the extracts. CONCLUSIONS: The extracts of S. legatii and E. zeyheri caused ultrastructural damage to E. coli cells characterized by altered external and internal morphology.

These extreme weather events particularly affect the physical and mental health of vulnerable groups such as mothers and infants. From low-income to high income countries, poorly organised disaster response can negatively impact infant and young child feeding practices. AIM To examine challenges and supportive strategies for infant and young child feeding during natural disasters to inform further research and guide disaster recommendations and practice. METHODS A comprehensive search strategy explored the electronic databases PubMed, CINAHL and Cochrane Library. Screening, data extraction and analysis were conducted using Covidence. Quality assessment was conducted using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). Studies were analysed using thematic analysis. FINDINGS This review included 13 studies (4 mixed methods, 1 critical ethnography, 2 quasi-experimental studies, 4 descriptive studies, 1 qualitative study, 1 evidence gap map analysis). Breastfeeding facilitators during natural disaster contexts are privacy for breastfeeding, community and family support, adaptation of professional breastfeeding support to the local context and pre-existing breastfeeding practice. Breastfeeding challenges during natural disasters include decreased breastfeeding self-efficacy, lack of knowledge and resources and over-reliance on formula baby milks. Formula baby milk feeding challenges during natural disasters are the lack of access to resources required for hygienic formula baby milk preparation as well as the lack of availability of formula baby milk in some contexts. CONCLUSION This systematic integrative review demonstrates that interventions which facilitate optimal infant and young child feeding in natural disaster contexts must be culturally and socially appropriate; increasing women's knowledge of optimal breastfeeding and safe formula baby milk feeding practices as well as breastfeeding self-efficacy.","output":"Infant and young child feeding during natural disasters: A systematic integrative literature review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Risk and crisis communication plays an essential role in public health emergency responses. The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered spontaneous and intensive media attention, which has affected people's adoption of personal preventive measures and their mental health. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between exposure to COVID-19-specific information and mental health (depression and sleep quality) and self-reported compliance with personal preventive measures (face mask wearing and hand sanitizing). We also tested whether these associations were moderated by thoughtful consideration of the veracity of the information to which people were exposed. METHODS: A cross-sectional, closed web-based survey was conducted among a sample of 3035 factory workers at the beginning of work resumption following the COVID-19 outbreak in Shenzhen, China. A stratified two-stage cluster sampling design was used for recruitment. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used for the analyses. RESULTS: The prevalence of probable moderate-to-severe depression was 170/3035 (5.6%), while that of good or excellent sleep quality was 2110/3035 (69.5%). The prevalence of self-reported consistent face mask wearing in public places was 2903/3035 (95.7%), while that of sanitizing hands every time after returning from public spaces or touching public installations was 2151/3035 (70.9%). Of the 3035 respondents, 1013 to 1638 (33.3% to 54.0%) reported >1 hour of daily exposure to COVID-19-specific information through web-based media and television. After controlling for significant background variables, higher information exposure via television and via newspapers and magazines was associated with better sleep quality and higher compliance with hand sanitizing. Higher exposure via unofficial web-based media was associated with higher compliance with hand sanitizing but was also associated with higher depressive symptoms. In contrast, higher exposure through face-to-face communication was associated with higher depressive symptoms, worse sleep quality, and lower compliance with hand sanitizing. Exposure to information about positive outcomes for patients with COVID-19, development of vaccines and effective treatments, and heroic stories about frontline health care workers were associated with both better mental health and higher compliance with preventive measures. Higher overall information exposure was associated with higher depressive symptoms among participants who were less likely to carefully consider the veracity of the information to which they were exposed; it was also associated with better sleep quality among people who reported more thoughtful consideration of information veracity. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides empirical evidence of how the amount, sources, and contents of information to which people were exposed influenced their mental health and compliance with personal preventive measures at the initial phase of work resumption in China. Thoughtful consideration of information quality was found to play an important moderating role.

METHODS: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed and Ovid were searched for articles published between 2004 and 2015 using key search terms: infection control/prevention and emergency department(s), triage, and transmission based precautions and emergency department(s), and triage, to identify common themes for discussion. Systematic review/meta-analysis was not in the scope of this exploration. FINDINGS: Themes were identified relating to HAI and ED practices and grouped into: assisted detection of conditions for which TBP is required, ED and TBP, mass-causality event/bioterrorism/pandemic/epidemic, infection control not TBP and multi-resistant organisms not TBP. The literature is heavily influenced by worldwide epidemic/pandemics and bioterrorist risks resulting in increased awareness of the importance of swift identification of syndromes that require TBP, but only in these situations.

Therefore, quantitative fit testing of particulate respirators is crucial for achieving the intended protection level. Millions of fit tests are conducted every year using a US OSHA-accepted standard protocol involving a PortaCount? (TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA) which measures a respirator fit factor.

Materials and Methods A total of 1496 non-duplicate Candida isolates, recovered from blood and other sterile body fluids of IC patients, were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry combined with ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequencing. Broth microdilution-based susceptibility testing using six antifungal agents was also conducted. Results Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species (49.9%), followed by Candida tropicalis (15.5%), Candida glabrata (14.7%) and Candida parapsilosis (14.2%). No significant differences in species distribution were observed when compared with a 2012-2013 dataset. Overall, the rates of susceptibility to fluconazole and voriconazole were high among C. albicans (98% and 97.2%, respectively) and C. parapsilosis species complex (91.1% and 92%, respectively) isolates but low among C. tropicalis (81.5% and 81.1%, respectively) isolates.

All hemorrhages were situated in the ipsilateral hemisphere and were anatomically remote from the treated aneurysm. The four patients were treated with emergency surgery (hematoma evacuation). All patients had a favorable clinical outcome (mRS = 1) at midterm evaluation. Follow-up imaging showed good permeability of the FD in all subjects and complete aneurysm occlusion in all patients. CONCLUSION From the literature review, DIPH appears to be more frequent than delayed aneurysm rupture and may be a cause of increasing concern for the use of flow diverters. However, the mechanisms of DIPH are not completely understood. Surgical evacuation of the hematoma seems to be feasible with acceptable safety and good clinical outcomes.","output":"Delayed ipsilateral parenchymal hemorrhage following treatment of intracranial aneurysms with flow diverter."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pituitary apoplexy is an endocrine emergency, which commonly presents as hypopituitarism.

In this work, we report a highly sensitive strain sensor based on a multi-functionalized fabric through carbonization and polymer-assisted copper deposition. The sensor shows high sensitivity (Gauge factor3557.6 in the strain range from 0 to 48%), and outstanding stretchability up to the strain of 300%, which is capable of detecting different types of deformation of the human body.

To unravel the global features of these processes, we analyse the world data of SARS-CoV-2 infection events, scrutinising two eight-month periods associated with the epidemic's outbreak and initial immunisation phase. Based on the correlation-network mapping, K-means clustering, and multifractal time series analysis, our results reveal universal patterns, suggesting potential predominant drivers of the pandemic. More precisely, the Laplacian eigenvectors localisation has revealed robust communities of different countries and regions that then cluster according to similar shapes of infection fluctuations. Apart from quantitative measures, the immunisation phase differs significantly from the epidemic outbreak by the countries and regions constituting each cluster. While the similarity grouping possesses some regional components, the appearance of large clusters spanning different geographic locations is persevering. Furthermore, cyclic trends are characteristic of the identified clusters, dominating large temporal fluctuations of infection evolution, which are prominent in the immunisation phase. Meanwhile, persistent fluctuations around the local trend occur in intervals smaller than 14 days. These results provide a basis for further research into the interplay between biological and social factors as the primary cause of infection cycles and a better understanding of the impact of socio-economical and environmental factors at different phases of the pandemic.","output":"Worldwide clustering and infection cycles as universal features of multiscale stochastic processes in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PT PRIMA TUNGGAL MANDIRis a company or family business that was founded in 2011 in Semarang Engaged in the automotive industry, which is a tire distributor","output":"Family Business Marketing Practice: A Case Study in the Times of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A unique policy of perimeter closures of Basic Health Zones (small administrative health units) was implemented in the Autonomous Community of Madrid from September 21st 2020 to May 23rd 2021 to face the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: We compare the errors in estimation of two families of mathematical models: ones that include the perimeter closures as explanatory covariables and ones that do not, in search of a significant improvement in estimation of one family over the other. We incorporate leave-one-out cross-validation, and at each step of this process we select the best model in AIC score from a family of 15 differently tuned ones. RESULTS: The two families of models provided very similar estimations, for a 1- to 3-weeks delay in observed cumulative incidence, and also when restricting the analysis to only those Basic Health Zones that were subject to at least one closure during the time under study. In all cases the correlation between the errors yielded by both families of models was higher than 0.98 (10(? 3) 95% CI), and the average difference of estimated 14-days cumulative incidence was smaller than 1.49 (0.33 95% CI).

This paper explores professional stakeholders perspectives of the acceptability, utility and effectiveness of a school-based online health and wellbeing screening tool, the Digital Health Contact (DHC). The DHC, delivered by Public Health School Nurses (PHSN), aims to identify, and put in place strategies to support, unmet health needs among CYP. METHODS: We employed a qualitative study design, using semi-structured interviews. Fourteen key stakeholders involved in the design and implementation of the DHC (commissioners, providers, PHSN and healthcare staff, school leaders) were purposively sampled. Data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Our analysis generated two key themes: the perceived benefits of the DHC; and challenges in delivering the DHC. Stakeholders perceived the universal application of the DHC with linked follow-up intervention as an effective means of identifying and supporting CYP with unmet needs, and an efficient way to target limited service resources. There were barriers around enabling school engagement in the DHC, typically in terms of logistics, school infrastructure, and perspectives of fit with schools. These barriers were seen as being negated through developing effective working relationships between schools and PHSN. Effective relationships could highlight the potential benefits of participation. Overall, the DHC was seen as a valuable and effective use of resources, with a low burden on school staff. CONCLUSIONS: The DHC, as a universal school-based health and wellbeing screening tool with linked follow-up intervention, has great potential in identifying and supporting unmet health needs among CYP. The perspectives and experiences of those involved in delivering the DHC highlight important considerations which may enable effective implementation and delivery of school screening programmes across other areas.

Pharmacists can perform multifaceted tasks in hypertension management such as measuring blood pressure. In a time where the use of educational videos in health professions education has increased, an educational video might be an option for teaching blood pressure measurement skills to pharmacy students. This project aimed to develop an educational video tailored to pharmacy students on oscillometric blood pressure measurement in a community pharmacy setting that can be used as a self-instruction video. Methods: The video was created with support from the university's multimedia center. The video development was roughly divided into pre-production, production, and post-production. Students' satisfaction with and perception of the video was surveyed. Results: An 11-minute 33-second self-instruction video in the German language on proper oscillometric blood pressure measurement tailored for pharmacy students was created. Along with descriptive slides, the video delineates the necessary steps of blood pressure measurement in a community pharmacy setting in a role-play, to support students in communication with the patient. Results of a survey on the satisfaction and perception of the video from thirty-seven pharmacy students were included in the analysis and revealed that the video was well accepted by pharmacy students. Moreover, approximately 95% responded that instructional videos should be included in future pharmacy education. Conclusion: We successfully developed an educational video on oscillometric blood pressure measurement for a community pharmacy setting. This work is a valuable form of support for faculty members, who intend to develop educational videos.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between the rate of human mobility changes and the rate of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used daily travel distance and home dwell time derived from millions of anonymous mobile phone location data from March 11 to April 10, 2020, provided by the Descartes Labs and SafeGraph to quantify the degree to which social distancing mandates were followed in the 50 US states and District of Columbia and the association of mobility changes with rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. EXPOSURE: State-level stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the association of state-specific rates of COVID-19 confirmed cases with the change rates of median travel distance and median home dwell time of anonymous mobile phone users. The increase rates are measured by the exponent in curve fitting of the COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases, while the mobility change (increase or decrease) rates were measured by the slope coefficient in curve fitting of median travel distance and median home dwell time for each state. RESULTS: Data from more than 45 million anonymous mobile phone devices were analyzed. The correlation between the COVID-19 increase rate and travel distance decrease rate was C0.586 (95% CI, C0.742 to C0.370) and the correlation between COVID-19 increase rate and home dwell time increase rate was 0.526 (95% CI, 0.293 to 0.700). Increases in state-specific doubling time of total cases ranged from 1.0 to 6.9 days (median [interquartile range], 2.7 [2.3-3.3] days) before stay-at-home orders were enacted to 3.7 to 30.3 days (median [interquartile range], 6.0 [4.8-7.1] days) after stay-at-home social distancing orders were put in place, consistent with pandemic modeling results. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that stay-at-home social distancing mandates, when they were followed by measurable mobility changes, were associated with reduction in COVID-19 spread. These results come at a particularly critical period when US states are beginning to relax social distancing policies and reopen their economies. These findings support the efficacy of social distancing and could help inform future implementation of social distancing policies should they need to be reinstated during later periods of COVID-19 reemergence.","output":"Association of Mobile Phone Location Data Indications of Travel and Stay-at-Home Mandates With COVID-19 Infection Rates in the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 25-year-old medical student presented in Multan, Pakistan with a high fever, cough, myalgia, and diarrhea consistent with the typical signs and symptoms of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Seropositive frequency, incidence, and reinfection of C. trachomatis were determined by detecting antibody against C. trachomatis Pgp3 using in-house luciferase immunosorbent assay (LISA). The dynamic of anti-Pgp3 antibody was analyzed using the Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) model. The overall Pgp3 seropositive frequency among the 18C65-year-old population was 28.1% (95% CI 24.9C31.5), and significantly increased from 12.0% in those aged 18C29 years to 48.6% in the 60C65 years old. The seropositive frequency was slightly higher in women than in men (31.3% vs. 25.4%) without statistical significance. The C. trachomatis incidence and reinfection rate were 11 and 14 per 1,000 person-years, respectively, and showed no significant difference with respect to age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and education levels.

In our retrospective study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of aPLs on the clinical findings in patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: Seventy-three patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and examined for aPLs were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups according to the test results of aPLs. Clinical and laboratory parameters were compared in both groups to reveal whether there was any difference between the groups. RESULTS: There were 15 patients with a positive aPLs test. Dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, and abdominal pain were significantly higher in the aPLs positive group than those with negative aPLs. The duration of hospital stays and the need for oxygen therapy of the patients in the aPLs positive group were significantly higher than the aPLs negative group.

Heart valve endocarditis associated with COVID infection presents a challenge, not only for physicians but for nurses as well. Considering the situation and implementation of new epidemiological measures, challenging nursing care in changed and difficult working conditions presented an important factor in the treatment of the patient. In this paper we will present a case of 36-year-old patient who was hospitalized in December 2020 in University Hospital Dubrava for infectious endocarditis complicated by COVID-19. Case report: Patient was initially hospitalized in October 2020 at the University Hospital for Infectious Diseases for pneumococcal pneumonia and meningitis. Mechanical ventilation begins due to the development of respiratory insufficiency. Vancomycin antibiotic therapy consequently results in acute renal injury. Renal function recovers after a short period of hemodialysis. During the stay, cardiorespiratory arrest developed and resuscitation was successfully performed. Transthoracic echocardiography finds a perivalvular abscess of the aortic valve without a visible vegetation. After a month of hospitalization, there is a further deterioration of the clinical condition. Testing for coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was performed and a positive finding was confirmed, with the development of bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia with respiratory failure requiring oxygen therapy and further mechanical ventilation. Due to the need for further diagnosis, transesophageal ultrasound of the heart, which could be performed only by trained staff, and implementation of measures to prevent the spread of the virus, the patient was transferred to University Hospital Dubrava which became the central COVID hospital for the Republic of Croatia. Transesophageal ultrasound, in compliance with all safety measures, found an aortic root abscess with pseudoaneurysm with large mobile vegetation on the aortic valve and massive aortic regurgitation, which confirmed the diagnosis of infectious endocarditis. Massive bilateral pleural effusion with signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was verified. Emergency cardiac surgery was indicated for treatment of aortic valve endocarditis. A biological aortic valve was successfully implanted, the aortic root abscess was repaired and the remaining defect was closed with a pericardial patch. Postoperative recovery proceeded without complications. Control echocardiography records normal hemodynamic parameters over the aortic valve. With adequate nursing care and intensive physical therapy, the patient successfully recovered and was discharged home on the twelfth postoperative day. Conclusion: A positive finding for coronavirus led to a prolongation of the diagnosis and treatment of infective endocarditis. Despite all treatment measures taken, COVID infection accelerated the progression of IE symptoms leading to cardiac arrest. The patients condition required urgent cardiac surgery which could be performed only by trained medical staff (physicians, nurses, perfusionists, technicians) and with adherence to epidemiological measures in pre-planned COVID hospitals that could meet the demanding conditions.

Prikaz slu?aja: Bolesnik je u listopadu 2020. godine inicijalno hospitaliziran u Klinici za infektivne bolesti zbog pneumokokne pneumonije i meningitisa. Zbog razvoja respiratorne insuficijencije mehani?ki je ventiliran. Posljedi?no primjeni antibiotske terapije vankomicinom, dolazi do akutne bubre?ne ozljede. Bubre?na funkcija se oporavlja nakon kratkog perioda hemodijalize. Tijekom boravka dolazi do razvoja kardiorespiratornog aresta te je uspje?no provedena reanimacija. Transtorakalnom ehokardiografijom registrira se perivalvularni apsces aortne valvule bez vidljivih vegetacija. Nakon mjesec dana hospitalizacije dolazi do daljnjeg pogor?anja klini?kog stanja. U?injeno je testiranje na korona virus (SARS-CoV-2) te je potvr?en pozitivan nalaz, uz razvoj bilateralne COVID-19 pneumonije s respiratornom insuficijencijom koja je zahtijevala terapiju kisikom i daljnju mehani?ku ventilaciju. Zbog potrebe za daljnjom dijagnostikom, transezofagijskom ehokardiografijom, koji se mogao izvesti samo uz educirano osoblje i provo?enje mjera za sprje?avanje ?irenja virusa, bolesnik je premje?ten u Klini?ku bolnicu Dubrava koja je postala sredi?nja COVID bolnica za Republiku Hrvatsku. U?injenim transezofagijskim ultrazvukom, uz pridr?avanje svih propisanih mjera sigurnosti, na?e se apsces korijena aorte sa pseudoaneurizmom uz veliku mobilnu vegetaciju na aortnoj valvuli i masivna aortna regurgitacija te je potvr?ena dijagnoza infektivnog endokarditisa. Verificiran je masivni bilateralni pleuralni izljev uz znakove akutnog respiracijskog distres sindroma (ARDS). Kod bolesnika je bila indicirana hitna operacija srca zbog lije?enja endokarditisa aortne valvule. Uspje?no je implantirana biolo?ka aortna valvula, apsces korijena aorte je saniran te je ostatni defekt zatvoren perikardijalnom zakrpom. Postoperativni oporavak je protekao bez komplikacija. Kontrolnom ehokardiografijom evidentiraju se uredni hemodinamski parametri nad aortnom valvulom. Uz adekvatnu sestrinsku skrb i intenzivnu fizikalnu terapiju bolesnik se uspje?no oporavio te je otpu?ten ku?i dvanaestog postoperativnog dana. Zaklju?ak: Pozitivan nalaz na korona virus doveo je do prolongacije postavljanja dijagnoze i lije?enja infektivnog endokarditisa. Unato? svim primijenjenim mjerama lije?enja COVID infekcija je ubrzala progresiju simptoma IE dovode?i do sr?anog uru?aja. Bolesnikovo stanje je zahtijevalo hitnu kardiokirur?ku operaciju koja je mogla biti izvedena jedino uz educirano medicinsko osoblje (lije?nici, medicinske sestre, perfuzionisti, tehni?ari) te uz pridr?avanje epidemiolo?kih mjera u za to unaprijed predvi?enim COVID bolnicama koje su mogle ispuniti zahtjevne uvjete.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, enhanced PPE (EPPE) is recommended when performing endoscopy. We aimed to evaluate the impact of EPPE on colonoscopy performance when compared to standard PPE (SPPE). Patients and methods A review of electronic medical records and endoscopy reports of consecutive patients who underwent colonoscopy during two similar one-month time periods (in 2019 and during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020) was performed. SPPE was used in 2019 and EPPE was used in 2020. Patient clinical data and procedure-related information were captured and analyzed. The primary outcomes were time to cecum (TTC) and total procedure time. Secondary outcomes were adenoma detection rate (ADR), polyp detection rate (PDR) and cecal intubation rate (CIR). Statistical analysis was performed using STATA v16.1. Results Two hundred and forty-seven colonoscopy procedures were analyzed. Baseline demographics and indications for colonoscopy of patients in both groups were similar. There were no significant differences in median TTC (10.0 vs 10.0min, P =0.524) or total procedure time (22.5 vs 23.0min, P =0.946) between colonoscopy performed in SPPE and EPPE. The ADR, PDR and CIR were also similar. Conclusion Our findings suggest that use of EPPE does not affect colonoscopy performance.","output":"Impact of enhanced personal protective equipment on colonoscopy performance during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has a huge impact on the plastic waste management in many countries due to the sudden surge of medical waste which has led to a global waste management crisis. Improper management of plastic waste may lead to various negative impacts on the environment, animals, and human health. However, adopting proper waste management and the right technologies, looking in a different perception of the current crisis would be an opportunity. About 40% of the plastic waste ended up in landfill, 25% incinerated, 16% recycled and the remaining 19% are leaked into the environment. The increase of plastic wastes and demand of plastic markets serve as a good economic indicator for investor and government initiative to invest in technologies that converts plastic waste into value-added product such as fuel and construction materials. This will close the loop of the life cycle of plastic waste by achieving a sustainable circular economy. This review paper will provide insight of the state of plastic waste before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study reports on survey responses from 190 analytic therapists on their transition to online therapy via videoconferencing during the pandemic and their previous experience with remote therapy (the majority had such experience). During the pandemic they prepared themselves and their patients for the transition in a variety of ways. The majority of those surveyed reported feeling as confident and as competent in their online sessions as in their earlier in-person work. Moreover, despite technical and relational challenges, they remained as strong, emotionally connected, and authentic in their online therapy sessions as they were in person. These experiences during the pandemic led to more positive views of online therapy than they held before, but a majority still considered online therapy less effective than in-person sessions.","output":"Stretching the Analytic Frame: Analytic Therapists' Experiences with Remote Therapy During COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"WHO declared worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020.

Meanwhile, there is an urgent need to identify alternative means of antiviral defense. Bacillus CalmetteCGurin (BCG) vaccine that has been recognized for its off-target beneficial effects on the immune system can be exploited to boast immunity and protect from emerging novel viruses. METHODS: We developed and employed a systems biology workflow capable of identifying small-molecule antiviral drugs and vaccines that can boast immunity and affect a wide variety of viral disease pathways to protect from the fatal consequences of emerging viruses. RESULTS: Our analysis demonstrates that BCG vaccine affects the production and maturation of na?ve T cells resulting in enhanced, long-lasting trained innate immune responses that can provide protection against novel viruses. We have identified small-molecule BCG mimics, including antiviral drugs such as raltegravir and lopinavir as high confidence hits. Strikingly, our top hits emetine and lopinavir were independently validated by recent experimental findings that these compounds inhibit the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide systems biology support for using BCG and small-molecule BCG mimics as putative vaccine and drug candidates against emergent viruses including SARS-CoV-2.

BCG activates monocytes and innate memory NK cells which are crucial for the antiviral immune response. Therefore, strategies to prevent COVID-19 in health workers (HW) should be carried out to prevent them becoming unwell so that they can continue to work during the pandemic. The hypothesis is that BCG will improve the innate immune response and prevent symptomatic infection or COVID-19 severity. The primary objective is to verify the effectiveness and safety of the BCG vaccine to prevent or reduce incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the city of Goiania (Brazil) among HW previously vaccinated with BCG and also its severity and mortality during the pandemic of the disease. Secondary objectives are to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 among these professionals and the innate immune response elicited to BCG. TRIAL DESIGN: This a phase II trial for repositioning BCG as a preventive strategy against COVID-19. The trial is an open-label, parallel-group randomised clinical trial, comparing HW vaccinated with BCG and HW not vaccinated. PARTICIPANTS: The trial will recruit 800 HW of Goiania - Gois, Brazil to reach a total of 400 HW included after comorbidities questioning and laboratorial evaluation. Eligibility criteria: Any HW presenting BCG vaccination scar with direct contact with suspected COVID-19 patients for at least 8 hours per week, whether in hospital beds, ICU, or in transportation or admission (nurses, doctors, physiotherapists, nutritionists, receptionists, etc.) who have negative IgM and IgG COVID-19 test. Participants with any of the following characteristics will be excluded: - Have had in the last fifteen days any signs or symptoms of virus infection, including COVID-19; - Have had fever in the last fifteen days; - Have been vaccinated fifteen days before the inclusion; - Have a history or confirmation of any immunosuppressive disease such as HIV, presented solid tumour in the last two years or autoimmune diseases; - Are under preventive medication with antibiotics, steroid anti-inflammatories, or chemotherapy; - Have less than 500 neutrophils per mL of blood; - Have previously been diagnosed with tuberculosis; - Are breastfeeding or pregnant; - Are younger than 18 years old; - Are participating as an investigator in this clinical trial. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: HW will be randomized into the BCG vaccinated group or the BCG unvaccinated control group. The BCG vaccinated group will receive in the right arm, intradermally, a one off dose of 0.1 mL corresponding to approximately 2 x105 to 8 x105 CFU of live, freeze-dried, attenuated BCG Moscow 361-I, Bacillus Calmette Guerin vaccine (Serum Institute of India PVT. LTD.). The unvaccinated control group will not be vaccinated. The HW allocated in both groups will be followed up at specific times points until 180 days post inclusion. The vaccinated and control groups will be compared according to COVID-19 related outcomes. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcomes are the incidence coefficient of infection by SARS-CoV-2 determined by RT-PCR of naso-oropharyngeal swab specimen or rapid lateral flow IgG and IgM test, and presence of general COVID-19 symptoms, disease severity and admission to hospital during the 180 days of follow up. The secondary outcome is the innate immune response elicited 15-20 days after vaccination. RANDOMISATION: The vaccine vial contains approximately 10 doses. In order to optimize the vaccine use, the randomisation was performed in blocks of 20 participants using the platform randomization.com [ http://www.jerrydallal.com/random/permute.htm ]. The randomization was prepared before any HW inclusion. The results were printed and inserted in sealed envelopes that were numbered with BCG-001 to BCG-400. The printed results as well the envelopes had the same numbers. At the time of the randomisation, each participant that meets the inclusion criteria will receive a consecutive participant number [BCG-001-BCG-400]. The sealed envelope with the assigned number, blinded to the researchers, will be opened in front of the participant and the arm allocation will be known. BLINDING (MASKING): There is no masking for the participants or for the healthcare providers. The study will be blinded to the laboratory researchers and to those who will be evaluating the outcomes and performing the statistical analyses. In this case, only the participant identification number will be available. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): Four hundred heath workers will be randomised in two groups. Two hundred participants will be vaccinated, and 200 participants will not be vaccinated. TRIAL STATUS: The protocol approved by the Brazilian Ethical Committee is the seventh version, number CAAE: 31783720.0.0000.5078. The trial has been recruiting since September 20th, 2020. The clinical trial protocol was registered on August 5th, 2020. It is estimated that recruitment will finish by March 2021.

There was no significant difference in the distribution of human IL4 vntr genotypic and allelic frequencies between cases and control group as well as among different clinical manifestation.We concluded that IgG1 levels to MSP1-19 were found to be negatively correlated with parasitaemia and anti-PfMSP1-19 IgG was significantly increased in ill and severely ill with age considered as a cofactor. Further studies are needed to ascertain the role of IgG and IgG1 in protection and to investigate the IgG and subclasses response against other antigenic markers.

However, studies regarding the risk factors associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding and the impact of Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r) treatment on viral shedding remain scarce. METHODS: Data were collected from all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who were admitted to isolation wards and had reverse transcription polymerase chain-reaction conversion at the No.3 People's Hospital of Hubei province between 31 January and 09 March 2020. We compared clinical characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding between patients initiated with LPV/r treatment and those without. Logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate the risk factors associated with prolonged viral shedding. RESULTS: Of 120 patients, the median age was 52 years, 54 (45%) were male and 78 (65%) received LPV/r treatment. The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from symptom onset was 23 days (IQR, 18C32 days). Older age (odd ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00C1.05, p=0.03) and the lack of LPV/r treatment (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.10C5.36, p=0.029) were independent risk factors of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. Patients who initiated LPV/r treatment within 10 days from symptom onset, but not initiated from day 11 onwards, had significantly shorter viral shedding duration compared with those without LPV/r treatment (median 19 days versus 28.5 days, Log-rank p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Older age and the lack of LPV/r treatment were independently associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in patients with COVID-19.

In a chronic stress state, elevated catecholamines result in the overstimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors (ARs), specifically 2-AR coupling with Gi protein. Gi signaling increases the activation of receptor-stimulated p38 mitogen-activated-protein-kinases (p38 MAPKs) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). Phosphorylation by these kinases is a common way to positively regulate the catalytic activity of A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17), a metalloprotease that has grown much attention in recent years and has emerged as a chief regulatory hub in inflammation, fibrosis, and immunity due to its vital proteolytic activity. ADAM17 cleaves and activates proinflammatory cytokines and fibrotic factors that enhance cardiac dysfunction via inflammation and fibrosis. However, there is limited information on the cardiovascular aspect of ADAM17, especially in heart failure. Hence, this concise review provides a comprehensive insight into the structure of ADAM17, how it is activated and regulated during chronic catecholamine stress in heart failure development. This review highlights the inflammatory and fibrotic roles of ADAM17s substrates; Tumor Necrosis Factor  (TNF), soluble interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R), and amphiregulin (AREG).

In severe forms, an augmented inflammatory response leads to the fulminant \\"cytokine storm\\", which may result in severe multisystemic end-organ damage. Apart from the acute inflammatory response, it seems that chronic inflammation also plays a major role in the clinical evolution of COVID-19 patients. Pre-existing inflammatory conditions, such as those associated with chronic coronary diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus or obesity, may be associated with worse clinical outcomes in the context of COVID-19 disease.

Although the inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is predominantly centred on the respiratory system, some patients can develop an abnormal inflammatory reaction involving extrapulmonary tissues. The signs and symptoms associated with this excessive immune response are very diverse and can resemble some autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, with the clinical phenotype that is seemingly influenced by epidemiological factors such as age, sex or ethnicity. The severity of the manifestations is also very varied, ranging from benign and self-limiting features to life-threatening systemic syndromes. Little is known about the pathogenesis of these manifestations, and some tend to emerge within the first 2 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas others tend to appear in a late post-infectious stage or even in asymptomatic patients. As the body of evidence comprises predominantly case series and uncontrolled studies, diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making is unsurprisingly often based on the scarcely reported experience and expert opinion.

Human mobility patterns were drastically adjusted as individuals complied with stay-at-home orders, changed their working patterns, and moved increasingly in the proximity of their home. Such behavioural changes brought about many spillover impacts, among which the sharp and immediate reduction in the concentration of nitrogen-based pollutants throughout the country. This work explores the extent to which urban Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) concentration responds to changes in human behaviour, in particular human mobility patterns and commuting. We model the dynamic and responsive change in NO2 concentration in the period directly following national lockdown and respective opening orders. Using the national urban air quality monitoring network we generate a synthetic NO2 concentration series built from a time series of historic data to compare expected modelled trends to the actual observed patterns in 2020. A series of pre- and post-estimators are modelled to understand the scale of concentration responsiveness to human activity and varying ability of areas across the UK to comply with the lockdown closing and response to openings. Specifically, these are linked to workday commuting times and observed patterns of human mobility change obtained from Google mobility reports. We find a strong and robust co-movement of air pollution concentration and work-related mobility C concentrations of NO2 during typical weekday commuting hours saw a higher relative drop, moving in tandem with patterns of human mobility around workplaces over the course of lockdowns and openings. While NO2 concentrations remained relatively low around the time of reopening, particularly during commuting hours, there is a relatively fast responsiveness rate to concentrations increasing quickly in line with human activity. With one of the key Government advice for workers to take staggered transportation into work and lessen the burden of rush hours and adopting more flexible work-home arrangements, our results would suggest that reductions in NO2 in urban areas are particularly responsive to broader human patterns and dynamics over time as we transitioned towards new working routines.","output":"Decomposing the Temporal Signature of Nitrogen Dioxide Declines during the COVID-19 Pandemic in UK Urban Areas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Chronic orofacial pain is associated with substantial pain-related disability and emotional distress. Understanding the relationship between individuals coping strategies and pain-related outcomes is important yet understudied in this population. PURPOSE: To test the cross-sectional association of three coping strategies (pain catastrophizing, kinesiophobia and mindfulness) to four pain-related outcomes (depression, anxiety, pain intensity, and pain-related disability) among individuals with chronic orofacial pain, after accounting for relevant demographic and clinical variables. METHODS: Individuals (N=303) with heterogeneous chronic orofacial pain (eg, trigeminal neuralgia, other trigeminal neuropathic pain, persistent idiopathic facial pain and other types) completed self-report measures of coping (Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, and the 15-item Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire), pain intensity and pain-related disability (Graded Chronic Pain Scale), and PROMIS measure of anxiety and depression. We conducted 4 two-step hierarchical regressions for each of the four pain-related and emotional outcomes, with the first step including demographic and clinical covariates, and the second step including the three coping variables together. RESULTS: Pain catastrophizing was the only coping variable significantly associated with pain intensity (B=0.362, SE=0.115, p=0.002, 3% variance explained) and pain-related disability (B =0.813, SE=0.162, p<0.001, 7% variance explained). Pain catastrophizing (B=0.231-0.267, SE=0.046-0.051-0.050, p<0.001), kinesiophobia (B=0.201-0.316, SE=0.081-0.084, p<0.001-0.018), and mindfulness (B=0.231C0.306, SE=0.046-0.067, p<0.001) were each independently associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression, with the largest incremental variance added by catastrophizing (5C8%) and mindfulness (5%). CONCLUSION: Pain catastrophizing appears to be an important intervention target to improve pain intensity, pain-related disability, anxiety and depression among individuals with chronic orofacial pain.

METHODS This retrospective review and analysis of prospectively collected data compare outcomes during the transition from L-TEP to R-TAPP inguinal hernia repair by a single surgeon at one institution. Operating times and surgical outcomes and complications are analyzed. All consecutive L-TEP cases from November 2012 to August 2014 and all consecutive R-TAPP cases from March 2013 to October 2015 were included in the analysis. RESULTS A total of 157 and 118 patients underwent L-TEP and R-TAPP inguinal hernia repair, respectively. The groups were similar regarding demographics and ASA class. A significantly higher number of complex cases were performed in the R-TAPP group compared to L-TEP group (n = 11 vs. n = 1, p = 0.0001).

The sensitivity and specificity of published herd definitions for PMWS were tested on the study farms to consider the role of PCV2 in PMWS. Herds were defined as PMWS-affected, -unaffected or -recovered based on current and past postweaning mortality (PWM), grower pigs with clinical signs of rapid wasting, hairiness and pallor and no other known cause of death on the farm. PCV2 antigen and antibody were not used in the definition of PMWS. In each PMWS-affected herd, up to three sick pigs with the clinical signs above and one healthy pig of a similar age were taken for postmortem examination (PME). In all other herds at least one healthy pig was taken for PME. Lymph nodes were analysed for PCV2 antigen and histological changes, and serum samples were analysed for PCV2 antibody. PCV2 antibody was present in all the herds sampled. There was a non-linear association between PCV2 antigen and antibody. There was no association between the presence of high scores of PCV2 antigen in pigs and the presence of high PWM in herds. PCV2 antigen score was significantly higher in sick than healthy pigs within farms, and high PCV2 score was associated with giant cells, coalescence and absence of germinal centres in lymph nodes. These results did not vary by PMWS-affected, -unaffected or -recovered farms. PCV2 antigen was present at high scores in approximately 10% of healthy pigs on all farms. All three herd definitions of PMWS were highly sensitive, defining PMWS-affected herds as affected, but had a specificity ranging from 23% to 43%. We conclude that the current diagnostic tests for PCV2 indicated higher scores of virus in sick pigs but were not useful to define pigs or herds with PMWS. The ubiquity of PCV2 and the lack of specificity of the PCV2 tests indicate that PCV2 may be a necessary but not sufficient cause of PMWS disease.

All participants also completed the Profile of Mood State (POMS), General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28), and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). The main result is that the training rate, mental health, life satisfaction, and positive mood have decreased during the home confinement period as compared with the reopening and semi-lockdown phases. However, the need for psychosocial services has increased during the pandemic period. The present study provides the first preliminary evidence that home confinement conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic might have negatively influenced elite athletes mood state, mental health, and life satisfaction, as well as training rates. Monitoring the psychological parameters of elite athletes and developing strategies to improve their mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic should be on the agenda. Next studies, therefore, seem reasonable to focus on active interventions for athletes during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Mental Health Status, Life Satisfaction, and Mood State of Elite Athletes During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Follow-Up Study in the Phases of Home Confinement, Reopening, and Semi-Lockdown Condition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The construct of autonomy appears in literature associated with individual psychological wellbeing.

Some current studies have shown that lateral cephalometric(LC) images can be used to estimate age. However, these methods are based on manually measuring some image features and making age estimates based on experience or scoring. Therefore, these methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and the effect will be affected by subjective opinions. In this work, we propose a saliency map-enhanced age estimation method, which can automatically perform age estimation based on LC images. Meanwhile, it can also show the importance of each region in the image for age estimation, which undoubtedly increases the method's Interpretability. Our method was tested on 3014 LC images from 4 to 40 years old. The MEA of the experimental result is 1.250, which is less than the result of the state-of-the-art benchmark because it performs significantly better in the age group with fewer data. Besides, our model is trained in each area with a high contribution to age estimation in LC images, so the effect of these different areas on the age estimation task was verified. Consequently, we conclude that the proposed saliency map enhancements chronological age estimation method of lateral cephalometric radiographs can work well in chronological age estimation task, especially when the amount of data is small.

Physician Executive Leadership (PEL) Plus is a student-run program that uniquely utilizes both didactic and real-world project-based approaches to deliver a business and management curriculum to medical students. METHODS: We developed and implemented PEL Plus during the 2018-19 and 2019-20 academic years, geared at first- and second-year medical students. We provide an overview of this combined didactic and project-based curriculum, in addition to evaluating if the program was efficacious in teaching the desired skillset. We assessed short-term knowledge acquisition using multiple-choice questions, and investigated student perceptions of their learning and the program using Likert scales and narrative feedback. We also investigated the influence of student demographics on performance, in order to assess the appropriateness of our target audience. RESULTS: 28 students completed PEL Plus over the two years (14 students/year). Average performance on multiple-choice questions showed statistically significant improvement after the majority of sessions. There were no statistically significant effects of demographics on performance in the majority of sessions. Students self-rated stronger understandings of lecture topics after each session, and analysis of narrative feedback demonstrated thematic categories centred on teaching style, new knowledge, lecture content/material, projects, networking, program structure, and generic statements.

PR is recommended in international guidelines for managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other chronic respiratory diseases. PR is still under-recognised in tuberculosis (TB) guidelines and PR is not available in many low and middle-income countries and for people with post-TB lung disease (PTBLD). The main aims of the study are to adapt and define a culturally appropriate PR programme in Kyrgyzstan for people living with PTBLD and to test, in a fully powered randomised controlled trial (RCT), the effectiveness of PR in improving exercise capacity for people living with PTBLD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study will be divided into three stages: stage 1: focus group discussions with patients living with PTBLD and interviews with PR referrers will be conducted to explore initial perceptions and inform the cultural adaptation, structure and content of PR. Stage 2a: a single-blind RCT evaluating the effectiveness of a culturally adapted 6-week PR programme on maximal exercise capacity, assessed by the incremental shuttle walking test, before and after PR. Participants will be additionally followed-up 12 weeks postbaseline. Additional outcomes will include health-related quality of life, respiratory symptoms, psychological well-being and physical function. Stage 2b: participants experience of PR will be collected through interviews and using a log book and a patient evaluation form. Staff delivering PR will be interviewed to explore their experience of delivering the intervention and refining the delivery for future implementation.

Because this is a rapidly evolving situation, our goal was to explore potential risk factors and trends in feelings of anxiety and depression among the general population in Canada over the first five months of the pandemic. Methods: We completed on-line surveys of 3,127 unique individuals representative of the Canadian general population at 4 discreet periods every 6 weeks from April 15th to July 28th 2020. We assessed feelings of anxiety, depression and loss of interest with the interRAI self-reported mood scale using a multivariable generalized estimating equation model to examine factors associated with having a 5+ score on the scale (indicating potentially depressed mood). We also investigated potential longitudinal trends to examine temporal changes in mood scores. Results: More than 30% of participants felt highly anxious, depressed, and disinterested in everyday activities in the first survey (April), but this number decreased to about 20% over 4 months. Feeling lonely, younger age, feeling overwhelmed by one's health needs, having financial concerns, and living outside of Quebec were significantly associated with depressed mood. Interpretation: The prevalence of depressed mood during the pandemic was between 2 and 3 times the pre-pandemic rate (especially among young people), but it can change rapidly in response to social changes. Thus, monitoring of psychological distress among vulnerable groups that may benefit from additional supports should be a priority.","output":"Longitudinal trends and risk factors for depressed mood among Canadian adults during the first wave of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To assess the clinical characteristics and identify mortality-predicting factors in intensive care unit (ICU)-admitted COVID-19 confirmed patients.

Reasons for their oral health conditions include difficult migration trajectories, poor nutrition and limited financial resources. Oral health promotion is crucial for improving oral health-related quality of life of humanitarian migrants. While community-level oral health promotion programmes for humanitarian migrants have been implemented (eg, in host countries and refugee camps), there is scant literature evaluating their transferability or effectiveness. Given that these programmes yield unique context-specific outcomes, the purpose of this study is to understand how community-level oral health promotion programmes for humanitarian migrants work, in which contexts and why. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Realist review, a theory-driven literature review methodology, incorporates a causal heuristic called context-mechanism-outcome configurations to explain how programmes work, for whom, and under which conditions. Using Pawson's five steps of realist review (clarifying scope and drafting an initial programme theory; identifying relevant studies; quality appraisal and data extraction; data synthesis; and dissemination of findings), we begin by developing an initial programme theory using the references of a scoping review on the oral health of refugees and asylum seekers and through hand searching in Google Scholar. Following stakeholder validation of our initial programme theory, we will locate additional evidence by searching in four databases (Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Cochrane Library and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL)) to test and refine our initial programme theory into a middle-range realist programme theory. The resultant theory will explain how community-level oral health promotion programmes for humanitarian migrants work, for whom, in which contexts and why.

However, the evidence for its role in the development of infectious disease is less understood. We aimed to examine prospective associations between depression and risk of hospitalisation for infection in middle-aged adults from the UK Biobank (linked with Hospital Episode Statistics) and assessed the role of several depression-related factors. METHODS We assessed prospective associations between depression status at the baseline assessment (2006-2010) and hospitalisations for infection up to the end of March 2016 in 460,418 middle-aged adults enrolled in the UK Biobank (mean age=56.238.11 years, 53.5% female). Cox regression was used to assess associations between depression and subsequent hospitalisations for any infections, as well as infection subtypes, viral infections, and bacterial infections. Amongst those with depression, we also examined the role of depression duration, the age of onset, and the use of antidepressants in hospitalisation risk. RESULTS Depression at baseline was prospectively associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation for infection (adjusted hazard ration (aHR)=1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.16 to 1.25). This association was found for all infection subtypes apart from infections of the central nervous system (p=0.911) and the skin (p=0.313). Receipt of a depression diagnosis in late adulthood and use of antidepressants (but only in those with none/mild depressive symptoms at baseline) increased the risk of hospitalisation for infection amongst those with depression. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that depression might be a risk factor which could be used to identify those at risk of hospitalisation for infection. Future research is required to understand the underlying factors that might result in this increased risk, so that targeted interventions can be developed.

Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been found to enhance wellbeing and mental health by reducing stress and anxiety and improving emotion regulation. Preliminary evidence suggests that online, synchronous MBIs may produce beneficial effects similar to face-to-face programs. However, the effectiveness of such online-MBIs to support mental health in highly stressful times, such as a global pandemic, requires further study. To this end, we investigated the effect of an online 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program on aspects of mental health during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N=92) who expressed interest in discounted online-MBSR programs were recruited for the study. The division into experimental and control groups was based on actual enrollment to the courses. Those who enrolled in a program were assigned to the experimental condition and those who decided not to enroll served as controls. Participants were assessed pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 1-month post-intervention for levels of mindfulness, perceived stress, anxiety, emotion regulation, and intolerance of uncertainty. Differences between the groups were tested using the general linear mixed effects model (GLMM) and Individual Growth Curve Models (IGCM) in intent to treat analysis. The findings indicated that, relative to the control group, MBSR improved mindfulness abilities (p <0.001), decreased anxiety (p <0.001), and stress (p <0.001) and increased emotion regulation (p <0.001). These effects were found to persist 1 month after the end of the program, despite the increased governmental public-health restrictions due to COVID-19 at that time. The ability to tolerate uncertainty, a central characteristic of the pandemic, was not found to be affected by the program. A mediation analysis revealed that the effect of the intervention on mental health improvement was partially mediated by the improvement in emotion regulation. Overall, the findings provide positive evidence for the feasibility of an online-MBSR program to support the mental health of individuals from the general population through the mediation of emotion regulation in challenging times, such as a global pandemic.","output":"Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Increases Mental Wellbeing and Emotion Regulation During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Synchronous Online Intervention Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are promising vectors of choice to deliver active molecules to mucosal tissues. They are recognized as safe by the World Health Organization and some strains have probiotic properties. The wide range of potential applications of LAB-driven mucosal delivery includes control of inflammatory bowel disease, vaccine delivery, and management of auto-immune diseases. Because of this potential, strategies for the display of proteins at the surface of LAB are gaining interest. To display a protein at the surface of LAB, a signal peptide and an anchor domain are necessary. The recombinant protein can be attached to the membrane layer, using a transmembrane anchor or a lipoprotein-anchor, or to the cell wall, by a covalent link using sortase mediated anchoring via the LPXTG motif, or by non-covalent liaisons employing binding domains such as LysM or WxL. Both the stability and functionality of the displayed proteins will be affected by the kind of anchor used. The most commonly surfaced exposed recombinant proteins produced in LAB are antigens and antibodies and the most commonly used LAB are lactococci and lactobacilli. Although it is not necessarily so that surface-display is the preferred localization in all cases, it has been shown that for certain applications, such as delivery of the human papillomavirus E7 antigen, surface-display elicits better biological responses, compared to cytosolic expression or secretion. Recent developments include the display of peptides and proteins targeting host cell receptors, for the purpose of enhancing the interactions between LAB and host.

But its hard due to the special data structure and the interpretability requirement of methods. The structure of EHR is hierarchical: each patient has a sequence of admissions, and each admission has some co-occurrence diagnoses. However, the existing methods only partially model these characteristics and lack the interpretation for non-specialists. METHODS: This work proposes a time-aware and co-occurrence-aware deep learning network (TCoN), which is not only suitable for EHR data structure but also interpretable: the co-occurrence-aware self-attention (CS-attention) mechanism and time-aware gated recurrent unit (T-GRU) can model multilevel relations; the interpretation path and the diagnosis graph can make the result interpretable. RESULTS: The method is tested on a real-world dataset for mortality prediction, readmission prediction, disease prediction, and next diagnoses prediction. Experimental results show that TCoN is better than baselines with 2.01% higher accuracy. Meanwhile, the method can give the interpretation of causal relationships and the diagnosis graph of each patient. CONCLUSIONS: This work proposes a novel modelTCoN.

From patients submitted to elective surgeries, we had 1 patient with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 (0,6%), with mild symptoms and quick discharge. From the urgencies group, we had 6(13%)patients tested positive; 5 were taken to ICU with 4 deaths.

This study aimed to estimate COVID-19 incidence and mortality in residential care facilities and to compare them with those recorded in nursing homes. DESIGN: Nationwide observational study conducted by French health authorities. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Since March 1, 2020, all LTCFs in France reported all COVID-19 cases and COVID-19-related deaths among their residents. METHODS: Possible cases were those with COVID-19-related symptoms without laboratory confirmation and confirmed cases those with a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test or serology positive for SARS-CoV-2. We included facilities with at least 1 confirmed case of COVID-19 and estimated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases and mortality due to COVID-19 reported until June 30, 2020, using the maximum bed capacity as a denominator. RESULTS: Of the 2288 residential care facilities, 310 (14%) and, of the 7688 nursing homes, 3110 (40%) reported COVID-19 cases among residents (P < .001). The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was significantly lower in residential care facilities as compared with nursing homes (1.10 vs 9.97 per 100 beds, P < .001). Mortality due to COVID-19 was also lower in residential care facilities compared with nursing homes (0.07 vs 1.29 per 100 beds, P < .001). Case fatality was lower in residential care facilities (6.49% vs 12.93%, P < .001).

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) in combination with sequential extracorporeal blood purification therapies (EBP) might support renal function, attenuate systemic inflammation, and prevent or mitigate multiple organ dysfunctions in COVID-19. AIM: Describe overtime variations of clinical and biochemical features of critically ill patients with COVID-19 treated with EBP with a hemodiafilter characterized by enhanced cytokine adsorption properties. METHODS: An observational prospective study assessing the outcome of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU (February to April 2020) treated with EBP according to local practice. Main endpoints included overtime variation of IL-6 and multiorgan function-scores, mortality, and occurrence of technical complications or adverse events. RESULTS: The study evaluated 37 patients. Median baseline IL-6 was 1230 pg/ml (IQR 895) and decreased overtime (p < 0.001 Kruskal-Wallis test) during the first 72 h of the treatment, with the most significant decrease in the first 24 h (p = 0.001). The reduction in serum IL-6 concentrations correlated with the improvement in organ function, as measured in the decrease of SOFA score (rho = 0.48, p = 0.0003). Median baseline SOFA was 13 (IQR 6) and decreased significantly overtime (p < 0.001 at Kruskal-Wallis test) during the first 72 h of the treatment, with the most significant decrease in the first 48 h (median 8 IQR 5, p = 0.001). Compared to the expected mortality rates, as calculated by APACHE IV, the mean observed rates were 8.3% lower after treatment. The best improvement in mortality rate was observed in patients receiving EBP early on during the ICU stay. Premature clotting (running < 24 h) occurred in patients (18.9% of total) which featured higher effluent dose (median 33.6 ml/kg/h, IQR 9) and higher filtration fraction (median 31%, IQR 7.4). No electrolyte disorders, catheter displacement, circuit disconnection, unexpected bleeding, air, or thromboembolisms due to venous cannulation of EBP were recorded during the treatment. In one case, infection of vascular access occurred during RRT, requiring replacement. CONCLUSIONS: EBP with heparin-coated hemodiafilter featuring cytokine adsorption properties administered to patients with COVID-19 showed to be feasible and with no adverse events. During the treatment, patients experienced serum IL-6 level reduction, attenuation of systemic inflammation, multiorgan dysfunction improvement, and reduction in expected ICU mortality rate.","output":"Blood purification therapy with a hemodiafilter featuring enhanced adsorptive properties for cytokine removal in patients presenting COVID-19: a pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Healthcare access has changed drastically during the COVID-19 pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: As hyposmia accompanies cognitive impairment in several neurological disorders, we aimed to study whether hyposmia represents a clinical biomarker for both neurological involvement and cognitive impairment in mild CO-VID-19. We aimed to study whether olfactory dysfunction (OD) represents a clinical biomarker for both neurological involvement and cognitive impairment in mild COVID-19. METHODS: Formal olfactory testing using the Sniffin'Sticks? Screening test, neuropsychological assessment using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and detailed neurological examination were performed in 7 COVID-19 patients with mild disease course and no history of olfactory or cognitive impairment, and 7 controls matched for age, sex, and education.

Although diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure were the main features, the involvement of other organs needs to be explored. Since information on kidney disease in patients with COVID-19 is limited, we determined the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19. Further, we evaluated the association between markers of abnormal kidney function and death in patients with COVID-19. This was a prospective cohort study of 701 patients with COVID-19 admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital that also encompassed three affiliates following this major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020 of whom 113 (16.1%) died in hospital. Median age of the patients was 63 years (interquartile range, 50-71), including 367 men and 334 women. On admission, 43.9% of patients had proteinuria and 26.7% had hematuria. The prevalence of elevated serum creatinine, elevated blood urea nitrogen and estimated glomerular filtration under 60 ml/min/1.73m(2) were 14.4, 13.1 and 13.1%, respectively. During the study period, AKI occurred in 5.1% patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney disease had a significantly higher risk for in-hospital death. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated baseline serum creatinine (hazard ratio: 2.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.36-3.26), elevated baseline blood urea nitrogen (3.97, 2.57-6.14), AKI stage 1 (1.90, 0.76-4.76), stage 2 (3.51, 1.49-8.26), stage 3 (4.38, 2.31-8.31), proteinuria 1+ (1.80, 0.81-4.00), 2+3+ (4.84, 2.00-11.70), and hematuria 1+ (2.99, 1.39-6.42), 2+3+ (5.56,2.58- 12.01) were independent risk factors for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, comorbidity and leukocyte count. Thus, our findings show the prevalence of kidney disease on admission and the development of AKI during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 is high and is associated with in-hospital mortality.

Method: We use mathematical modelling to explore how postponement of MDA and various mitigation strategies affect achievement of the EPHP goal for Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium. Results: In moderate and some high prevalence settings, the disruption may delay the goal by up to two years. In some high prevalence settings EPHP is not achievable with current strategies, and so the disruption will not impact this. Here, increasing SAC coverage and treating adults can achieve the goal. The impact of MDA disruption and the appropriate mitigation strategy varies according to the baseline prevalence prior to treatment, the burden of infection in adults and stage of the programme.

Consequently, merely changing the scale can alter public policy preferences and the level of worry, despite the fact that people are exposed to a lot of COVID-19 related information. Reducing misinformation can help improving the response to COVID-19, thus, mass media and policymakers should always describe the evolution of the pandemic using a graph on a linear scale, or at least they should show both scales.

Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative study consisted of 21 semi-structured interviews with primary care paramedics (PCPs), advanced care paramedics (ACPs) and critical care paramedics (CCPs) with first-hand experience responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario. Qualitative research is best suited to the research objectives of gaining detailed and nuanced understandings of paramedics' experiences during this public health emergency, and identifying in paramedics' accounts what changes to policy and practice might strengthen their sense of safety in future infectious disease outbreaks (Bowling, 2002;Chafe, 2017). Data collection occurred over the course of 3.5 months, from June 2020 until September 2020. Findings: Participants described several factors that heightened their feeling exposed to risk particular to working on the front lines of the COVID-19 public health response. These factors include stress connected to personal protective equipment (PPE) and equipment access, risks of infection to self and family, communications and feelings of being systematically under-considered. Recommendations from this research include, but are not limited to, ensuring a more equitable distribution of protective equipment to paramedics across unevenly funded services, and recognizing paramedics face unique and additional stressors in public health emergencies. Research limitations/implications: A key limitation of this study was the relatively small sample, with 50% of potential participants deciding not to engage in an interview. The authors suspect this is likely a result of timing, as this was conducting during significant periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario. The study identifies and begins to shed light on the way in which feelings of compromised safety and specific stressors in a public health emergency context connect to one another and potentially increase risks of burnout for this healthcare provider group. This study's documentation of paramedics feeling uncertainty about their own and their family's safety, combined with feeling occupational pressure, decisional pressure within constrained frameworks of care delivery, a lack of autonomy and a lack of consideration within their healthcare system in general and within its pandemic response in particular, is important in and of itself. These stressors can have serious implications for the ability of paramedics to sustain their integral role in public health emergency response. Practical implications: A series of pandemic-specific and generalizable recommendations emerged from this research and in collaboration with community-based medical leadership. (1) Consult paramedics on effectiveness of screening questions and equipment. Be sure to illicit and respond to paramedic feedback in a timely manner. (2) Implement operational changes during pandemics in the form of donning and doffing stations, disposable gowns, decontamination teams at hospitals, infectious disease paramedic (IDP) truck, anti-fog sprays for goggles, and safe and controlled areas for eating and taking breaks. (3) Develop an emergency pandemic plan that is resourced and maintained as part of EMS strategic planning. Involve EMS in decisions related to health system emergency planning and sustainability of EMS practice. (4) Establish equitable distribution of resources, such as ensuring PPE is distributed equitably and applying pandemic pay equally to all essential workers. (5) Validate and respect EMS, as they are essential workers. Recognize the expertise of paramedics and community healthcare providers. Finally, an overarching recommendation at the core of this research is the consideration for paramedic knowledge as expertise given their role as critical front line healthcare specialists and the protection of t is crucial human resource as it relates to their resilience and mental wellbeing. Social implications: Evidence-based awareness and improved understanding of paramedic stress during the pandemic is a first step to developing strategies to reduce that stress. This is essential in ensuring access to this essential service during emergencies and the safety of the communities they serve.

This spectrum of threats has led to an expansion of the stakeholders and tools involved in intelligence gathering and threat assessments. The article argues that to strengthen global health security and health intelligence, the traditional state-based intelligence community must actively engage with non-security stakeholders and incorporate space for new sources of intelligence.

It is one of the most common lung pathologies worldwide. Its incidence is on the rise in Pakistan, which may be due to overt environmental pollution or improving screening protocols. Irrespective more and more patients are now being diagnosed as cases of asthma and this has led to renewed interest in research for the subject locally. Vitamin D plays a key component of the immune system and its deficiency has been associated with diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, sepsis, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. The role of vitamin D in exacerbation, prevention, causation, and treatment of asthma is still up for debate. However, as more data emerges, it is becoming evident that vitamin D in one way or another is linked to outcomes in asthma. Especially the deficiency of vitamin D in asthma and its supplementation has garnered great attention in scientific trials. Our research is just one small step in this direction. This study aims to evaluate the frequency of vitamin D deficiency in patients with asthma. Methods This was a retrospective cross-sectional cohort conducted at the Department of Medicine of Abbasi Shaheed Hospital Karachi (ASHK) during March 2019 to August 2019. Patients of either gender aged 18 years that were diagnosed with cases of asthma were eligible to be included in the study. Asthma was defined in accordance with the latest guidelines issued by the Pakistan Chest Society. A vitamin D level of <20 ng/dl was considered deficient. Patient confidentiality was made certain. Results A total of 97 (62.98%) of the 154 patients included in the study had <20 ng/ml of vitamin D level. The mean vitamin D level recorded in this study was 15.344.21 ng/dl. The male-to-female ratio was 1:5. The mean age of our cohort was 42.784.56 years. The mean duration of disease, i.e., asthma was 6.73.68 years. Both the age of the patients and duration of the disease were found to be statistically significant with respect to vitamin D levels in asthmatics. Conclusions The frequency of vitamin D deficiency is very high in patients with asthma. These suboptimal levels are significantly influenced by the age of the patient and the duration of the disease.","output":"Frequency of Vitamin D Deficiency in Patients of Asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explores how to construct a fair and optimal compensation system between the principal and the agent in the face of financial compensation agency problems during a limited period in relation to the concept of sustainability In the construction of the principals compensation system, the agents degree of operational financial effort will affect the overall revenue function for reaching sustainability Both the principal and the agent have a maximum expected utility in the negative exponential pattern of the general hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility function that satisfies their respective objective functions The proposed model and numerical example analysis results prove that the compensation system for sustainability can provide a fair and optimal financial system, from a sustainability perspective The main contribution of this study is the construction and development of an optimal compensation agency model for risk management, which is derived by considering the effect of risk aversion utility on revenue The proposed model can provide a fair and feasible approach within the issue of compensation, from the viewpoint of sustainability, for an optimal compensation agency problem","output":"An Optimal Compensation Agency Model for Sustainability under the Risk Aversion Utility Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a severe clinical phenotype of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that remains poorly understood.

However, available data points to significant barriers to palliative and end-of-life care among minority adults. The main objective of this scoping review was to summarize the current published research and literature on disparities in palliative and hospice care and completion of advance care planning and directives among non-Hispanc Blacks. METHODS: The scoping review method was used because currently published research in disparities in palliative and hospice cares as well as advance care planning are limited. Nine electronic databases and websites were searched to identify English-language peer-reviewed publications published within last 20 years. A total of 147 studies that addressed palliative care, hospice care, and advance care planning and included non-Hispanic Blacks were incorporated in this study. The literature review include manuscripts that discuss the intersection of social determinants of health and end-of-life care for non-Hispanic Blacks. We examined the potential role and impact of several factors, including knowledge regarding palliative and hospice care; healthcare literacy; communication with providers and family; perceived or experienced discrimination with healthcare systems; mistrust in healthcare providers; health care coverage, religious-related activities and beliefs on palliative and hospice care utilization and completion of advance directives among non-Hispanic Blacks. DISCUSSION: Cross-sectional and longitudinal national surveys, as well as local community- and clinic-based data, unequivocally point to major disparities in palliative and hospice care in the United States.

Drawing upon a case study of the 2010 Diamond Island stampede, which killed 347 people, this article focuses on the period leading up to the funeral ceremony, while a companion article discusses events that unfold in the months that follow. An ethnographic study was carried out in Phnom Penh and nine provinces with members of the families of those who were killed, villagers, and monks and Buddhist lay officiants. Buddhist ceremonies conducted at the cremation and at seven- and hundred-days, helped families accept the irreversibility of loss and allow the dead to be reborn. Complications comprised the misidentification of bodies, managing the dangerous ghosts of bad death, getting the souls safely from the mortuary to the cremation site and dealing with disruptions along the way, convincing the souls that they are really dead, and ambiguous losses in the case of counterfeit funerals conducted without the corpse. The mourning hinges on the maintenance of continuing bonds as evidenced by the dream work by the bereft families, enabled by the emergency Buddhist disaster relief provided by the monks. It is proposed that understanding the cultural deathscapes can provide insights into developing culturally-responsive interventions after a disaster. ? 2021 The Author(s)","output":"Diamond Island bridge is falling down: Cultural deathscapes of grief, funeral ceremonies, and continuing bonds after a disaster in Cambodia I C The first days"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The occurrence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in critically ill patients with viral pneumonitis has increasingly been reported in recent years.

Early evidence from New York City (NYC) indicated that these strategies, among decreased travel from China and increased fears of viral transmission and xenophobia, were leading to mass closures of businesses in Manhattans Chinatown. The constantly evolving COVID ?19 crisis has caused research design and methodology to fundamentally shift, requiring adaptable strategies to address emerging and existing public health problems such as food security that may result from closures of food outlets. OBJECTIVE: We describe innovative approaches used to evaluate changes to the food retail environment amidst the constraints of the pandemic in an urban center heavily burdened by COVID-19. Included are challenges faced, lessons learned and future opportunities. METHODS: First, we identified six diverse neighborhoods in NYC: two lower-resourced, two higher-resourced, and two Chinese ethnic enclaves. We then developed a census of food outlets in these six neighborhoods using state and local licensing databases. To ascertain the status (open vs. closed) of outlets pre-pandemic, we employed a manual web-scraping technique. We used a similar method to determine the status of outlets during the pandemic. Two independent online sources were required to confirm the status of outlets. If two sources could not confirm the status, we conducted phone call checks and/or in-person visits. RESULTS: The final baseline database included 2585 food outlets across six neighborhoods. Ascertaining the status of food outlets was more difficult in lower-resourced neighborhoods and Chinese ethnic enclaves compared to higher-resourced areas. Higher-resourced neighborhoods required fewer phone call and in-person checks for both restaurants and food retailers than other neighborhoods. CONCLUSIONS: Our multi-step data collection approach maximized safety and efficiency while minimizing cost and resources. Challenges in remote data collection varied by neighborhood and may reflect the different resources or social capital of the communities; understanding neighborhood-specific constraints prior to data collection may streamline the process.

To facilitate telemedicine, the development and improvement of remote examination systems are required. A system combining an electronic stethoscope and Bluetooth connectivity is a promising option for remote auscultation in clinics and hospitals. However, the utility of such systems remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the utility of real-time auscultation using a Bluetooth-connected electronic stethoscope compared to that of classical auscultation, using lung and cardiology patient simulators. METHODS: This was an open-label, randomized controlled trial including senior residents and faculty in the department of general internal medicine of a university hospital. The only exclusion criterion was a refusal to participate. This study consisted of 2 parts: lung auscultation and cardiac auscultation. Each part contained a tutorial session and a test session. All participants attended a tutorial session, in which they listened to 15 sounds on the simulator using a classic stethoscope and were told the correct classification. Thereafter, participants were randomly assigned to either the real-time remote auscultation group (intervention group) or the classical auscultation group (control group) for test sessions. In the test sessions, participants had to classify a series of 10 lung sounds and 10 cardiac sounds, depending on the study part. The intervention group listened to the sounds remotely using the electronic stethoscope, a Bluetooth transmitter, and a wireless, noise-canceling, stereo headset. The control group listened to the sounds directly using a traditional stethoscope. The primary outcome was the test score, and the secondary outcomes were the rates of correct answers for each sound. RESULTS: In total, 20 participants were included. There were no differences in age, sex, and years from graduation between the 2 groups in each part. The overall test score of lung auscultation in the intervention group (80/110, 72.7%) was not different from that in the control group (71/90, 78.9%; P=.32). The only lung sound for which the correct answer rate differed between groups was that of pleural friction rubs (P=.03); it was lower in the intervention group (3/11, 27%) than in the control group (7/9, 78%). The overall test score for cardiac auscultation in the intervention group (50/60, 83.3%) was not different from that in the control group (119/140, 85.0%; P=.77). There was no cardiac sound for which the correct answer rate differed between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The utility of a real-time remote auscultation system using a Bluetooth-connected electronic stethoscope was comparable to that of direct auscultation using a classic stethoscope, except for classification of pleural friction rubs. This means that most of the real worlds essential cardiopulmonary sounds could be classified by a real-time remote auscultation system using a Bluetooth-connected electronic stethoscope.

Given the current lack of an effective vaccine, several drugs have been repurposed for treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19 in an attempt to find an effective cure. AREAS COVERED: The antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) initially garnered widespread attention following the publication of preliminary results showing that this drug exerts an anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro. EXPERT OPINION: To date, clinical evidence suggests lack of benefit from HCQ use for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In such patients, HCQ also appears to be associated with an increased risk of QT interval prolongation and potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, FDA has recently revoked the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for emergency use of HCQ and chloroquine to treat COVID-19. Conversely, whether HCQ use may represent an effective prophylactic strategy against COVID-19 is a separate question that still remains to be answered. In addition, relevant aspects regarding the potential risks and benefits of HCQ need to be clarified, in pursuit of a rational use of this drug in the COVID-19 pandemic era.","output":"Hydroxychloroquine in the COVID-19 pandemic era: in pursuit of a rational use for prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is a harsh reminder of the fact that, whether in a single human host or a wave of infection across continents, viral dynamics is often a story about the numbers.

Following a theoretical review, this article sets out to establish the sociodemographic profiles and those variables that can correlate and/or explain the inclination towards one or the other, that is, the dependent variable freedom-security, such as victimization or the assessment of surveillance. The analysis is based on the results of a survey prepared by the Center for Sociological Research (CIS, in Spanish) and administered to a sample of 5,920 Spaniards. The conclusions indicate that the majority inclination is for security, especially among older men, with elementary education attainment level and right-wing ideology. Furthermore, although victimization correlated with the dependent variable, the perception of being a possible victim led to a preference for safety rather than the actual experience of having been a victim. Finally, the positive assessment of surveillance through technologies such as video cameras explains or is strongly associated with security, making it a promising line of research for future work and a means to improve the understanding of the analyzed dilemma.","output":"The Security Versus Freedom Dilemma.

STUDY DESIGN: Data were collected from travellers arriving at Christchurch International Airport, New Zealand, during the winter 2008, via a symptom questionnaire, temperature testing, and respiratory sampling. RESULTS: Respiratory viruses were detected in 342 (26.0%) of 1313 samples obtained from 2714 symptomatic travellers. The most frequently identified viruses were rhinoviruses (128), enteroviruses (77) and influenza B (48). The most frequently reported symptoms were stuffy or runny nose (60%), cough (47%), sore throat (27%) and sneezing (24%). Influenza B infections were associated with the highest number of symptoms (mean of 3.4) followed by rhinoviruses (mean of 2.2) and enteroviruses (mean of 1.9). The positive predictive value (PPV) of any symptom for any respiratory virus infection was low at 26%.

This has been an extraordinarily challenging time for both students and instructors, particularly as many were not aware of the affordances and weaknesses of the online learning environment before it was uptaken. Particularly for chemistry and related disciplines, this change in delivery mode is even more disruptive in courses that have laboratory components due to loss of access to laboratories. As a teaching community, it was our responsibility to respond quickly and effectively to students' learning needs during this unprecedented global crisis. In our course, we provided succinct pre-recorded lecture-videos by topic rather than live-streaming of lectures. The recordings were made available to students a minimum of 24 h before the scheduled lecture time. Students were then provided opportunities to attend live tutorial sessions (held on Zoom and live Q&A feature on Piazza) if they had any questions that they wanted to ask the lecturer directly. We believe that the asynchronous sessions were more equitable than synchronous ones. This meant that students with difficult and challenging home/learning environments (i.e., disruptions at home, work/family schedules, poor internet, limited access to devices, etc.) were minimally disadvantaged.

Over 123,000,000 individuals have been infected with the coronavirus since a worldwide pandemic was declared in March 2020.

METHODS: We infected the A549 cell line with betacoronavirus OC43 and then treated it with 100 g/mL Hyunggaeyungyo-tang (HGYGT) or distilled water with a control of HGYGT. We measured the mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) to confirm the effectiveness of HGYGT upon coronavirus infection. RESULTS: We found that the effects of HYGYT decrease the expression level of pPKR, peIF2, IFI6, IFI44, IFI44L, IFI27, IRF7, OASL, and ISG15 when administered to cells with coronavirus infection. The expressions of IL-1, TNF-, COX-2, NF-B, iNOS, and IKK mRNA were also significantly decreased in the HGYGT group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Through the reduction of the amount of coronavirus RNA, our research indicates that HGYGT has antiviral effects. The reduction of IKK and iNOS mRNA levels indicate that HGYGT reduces coronavirus RNA expression and may inhibit the replication of coronavirus by acting on NF-kB/Rel pathways to protect oxidative injury. In addition, decreases in mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines indicate that the HGYGT may relieve the symptoms of coronavirus infections.","output":"Antiviral Effect of Hyunggaeyungyo-Tang on A549 Cells Infected with Human Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study was to evaluate the medium-term results of aortic valve neocuspidalization according to Ozaki compared to Ross procedure for treatment of isolated aortic valve disease in pediatric age. Thirty-eight consecutive patients with congenital or acquired aortic valve disease underwent either Ozaki (n = 22) or Ross (n = 16) operation between 01/2015 and 05/2020. The primary outcome was progression of aortic valve disease and aortic ring and root dimension, whereas secondary outcome was freedom from reintervention or death by type of operation. Median age was 12.4 (8.8C15.8) years and the prevailing lesion was stenosis in 20 cases (52%) and incompetence in 18 (48%). One death occurred in the Ross group in the early postoperative period, while there were no deaths in the Ozaki group. Effective treatment of aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation occurred in both groups and remained stable over a median follow-up of 18.2 (5C32) months. In Ozaki group, 3 patients required aortic valve replacement at 4.9, 3.5, and 33 months, respectively. In Ross group, 1 patient required Melody pulmonary valve replacement, whereas none required aortic valve surgery. Finally, significantly higher aortic transvalvular gradient at follow-up was recorded in Ozaki group compared to Ross group. Overall, there was no significant difference in freedom from reoperation or death between the two groups.

It was found that the window allowing animals susceptible to infections due to low antibody titers became smaller or even completely closed because of increased NDV-specific HI titers when NDV vaccine and GSLS-Se were coadministered for immunization at early life in chickens. In addition, NDV-specific sIgA and the numbers of IgG+, IgA+, IgM+ plasma cells were significantly more in GSLS-Se group than the control in the HGs.

The effect of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women and her neonate is not well-understood, with no clear evidence for vertical transmission. This study aims to determine the maternal and neonatal clinical characteristics and the dyads outcomes among those infected with COVID-19 infection. Methods. An ambispective cross-sectional study involving pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection was conducted at the Philippine General Hospital from April to August 2020. Two hundred nine obstetric patients were included, 14 of whom consented to specimen collection to determine vertical transmission. Results. The majority of pregnant women with COVID-19 infection and their neonates had good outcomes. Labor, delivery, and the immediate postpartum course were generally uneventful. The all-cause maternal morbidity rate was high at 75.6 per 100 cases during the five-month study period. COVID-19 related morbidities included the development of Guillain-Barr Syndrome. The in-hospital all-cause maternal mortality rate was 1.91 per 100 cases. The causes of maternal death were acute respiratory failure, septic shock, and congenital heart disease (atrial septal defect with Eisenmengerization). The in-hospital, all-cause neonatal mortality rate was 1.04 per 100 neonates of cases. The lone mother and infant deaths were in a postmortem rt-PCR swab negative mother with an rt-PCR swab positive live neonate who eventually succumbed after nine days of life. All 14 dyads with collected specimens that included amniotic fluid, placental tissue, umbilical cord, and neonate nasopharyngeal swab tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR. Conclusion. The prognosis for COVID-19 infected pregnant patients was generally good, with most of the patients discharged improved. Almost all of the neonates born to COVID-19-infected mothers were stable-term infants. There was no evidence for vertical transmission, as shown by negative rt-PCR results for all the additional specimens obtained. In general, the prognosis for COVID-19 infected dyads was good.

METHODS: A total of 1,591 patients with HCC or ICC hospitalized at Shandong Provincial Hospital between January 2016 and August 2021 were included and randomly divided into development and validation groups in a ratio of 3:1. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the independent differential factors between HCC and ICC patients in the development cohort. By combining these independent differential factors, the nomogram was established for discriminating ICC from HCC. The accuracy of the nomogram was estimated by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and decision curve analysis (DCA). Furthermore, the predictive nomogram was assessed in the internal testing set. RESULTS: Through multivariate analysis, independent differential factors between HCC and ICC involved hepatitis B virus (HBV), logarithm of alpha-fetoprotein (Log AFP), logarithm of protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (Log PIVKA-II), logarithm of carbohydrate antigen 199 (Log CA199), and logarithm of carbohydrate antigen 125 (Log CA125). A nomogram was finally established by incorporating these five independent differential factors. Comparing a model of conventional tumor biomarkers including AFP and CA199, the nomogram showed a better distinction between ICC and HCC. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of ICC diagnosis was 0.951 (95% CI, 0.938C0.964) for the nomogram. The results were consistent in the validation cohort with an AUC of 0.958 (95% CI, 0.938C0.978). After integrating patient preferences into the analysis, the DCA showed that using this nomogram to distinguish ICC and HCC increased more benefit compared with the conventional model. CONCLUSION: An efficient nomogram has been established for the differential diagnosis between ICC and HCC, which may facilitate the detection and diagnosis of ICC. Further use of the nomogram in multicenter investigations will confirm the practicality of the tool for future clinical application.","output":"An Efficient Nomogram for Discriminating Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma From Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In fields on which decisions need to be taken including health, as we are seeing nowadays in the COVID-19 crisis, decision-makers face multiple criteria and results with a random component.

Traditionally, the shape of a utility function is the only element that represents the decision makers risk attitude. The eduction process of multi-attribute utility functions implies some operational drawbacks, and it is not always easy. In this paper, we propose a new element with which the decision makers risk attitude can be implemented: the selection of the stochastic efficiency concept to be used during a decision analysis. We suggest representing the risk attitude as a conflict between two poles: risk neutral attitude, associated with best expectations, and risk aversion attitude, associated with a lower uncertainty. The Extended Goal Programming formulation has inspired the parameter that is introduced in a new risk attitude formulation.

However, data in the pediatric kidney transplant population (PKT) are lacking. METHODS: Using two commercial immunoassays that measured IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and IgG against the nucleocapsid (N) protein, we screened 72 PKT recipients who attended the outpatient clinic for routine blood work. The majority of patients with positive serology underwent an additional serology test at least once during subsequent clinical follow-up. Patients were confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection if they had two positive tests. RESULTS: Eight patients out of the 72 screened (11.1%) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in both serological tests. Of those who tested positive, 4 had positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results before screening. All patients were asymptomatic or had a history of mild symptoms. All tested patients had persistently positive antibodies at a median follow-up time of 75 days (IQR, 44.5, 86.5 days). One patient had a positive PCR test at 75 days and a positive serology test at 120 days post infection. CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was relatively high (11.1%) in our population.

Double-membrane vesicles, termed autophagosomes, deliver trapped viral cargo to the lysosome for degradation. Specifically, autophagy initiates an innate immune response by cooperating with pattern recognition receptor signalling to induce interferon production. It also selectively degrades immune components associated with viral particles. Following degradation, autophagy coordinates adaptive immunity by delivering virus-derived antigens for presentation to T lymphocytes. However, in an ongoing evolutionary arms race, viruses have acquired the potent ability to hijack and subvert autophagy for their benefit. In this Review, we focus on the key regulatory steps during viral infection in which autophagy is involved and discuss the specific molecular mechanisms that diverse viruses use to repurpose autophagy for their life cycle and pathogenesis.","output":"Autophagy during viral infection  a double-edged sword"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Portal hypertension is a severe complication caused by various chronic liver diseases. The standard methods for detecting portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient and free portal pressure) are available in only a few hospitals due to their technical difficulty and invasiveness; thus, non-invasive measuring methods are needed. This study aimed to establish and assess a novel model to calculate free portal pressure based on biofluid mechanics. RESULT: Comparison of each dogs virtual and actual free portal pressure showed that a biofluid mechanics-based model could accurately predict free portal pressure (mean difference: -0.220, 95% CI: ? 0.738 to 0.298; upper limit of agreement: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.34 to 3.14; lower limit of agreement: -2.68, 95% CI: ? 3.58 to ? 1.78; intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.96 to 0.99; concordance correlation coefficient: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.93 to 0.99) and had a high AUC (0.984, 95% CI: 0.834 to 1.000), sensitivity (92.3, 95% CI: 64.0 to 99.8), specificity (91.7, 95% CI: 61.5 to 99.8), positive likelihood ratio (11.1, 95% CI: 1.7 to 72.8), and low negative likelihood ratio (0.08, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.6) for detecting portal hypertension.

These models are trained on various data, including daily cases and deaths, the diseased age structure, transport availability of the regions, and the unemployment rate. The experimental evaluation of the models shows that the demographic and healthcare indicators can significantly improve mid-term economic impact prediction accuracy.

METHODS: A total of 156 cases of secondary epilepsy with lower cavity hemorrhage in our hospital were selected and divided into the late epilepsy group and the early epilepsy group according to seizure time, and the nonseizure group and the seizure group according to seizure condition. General data of patients were collected, the EEG types of each group were analyzed, and the disease recurrence rate, treatment effect, and symptom onset time were compared. RESULTS: Rapid and slow and rapid blood flow velocity were the main abnormal manifestations of epilepsy secondary to inferior cavity hemorrhage, accounting for 33.3% and 18.6%, respectively. Compared with the seizure group, the proportion of type ii and type iii in the nonseizure group was higher, and the proportion of type ii and type iii in the early epilepsy group was higher than in the late epilepsy group (P < 0.05). The diagnostic accuracy, missed diagnosis rate, misdiagnosis rate, specificity, and sensitivity of the EEG wave pattern were 94.9%, 3.2%, 1.9%, 91.7%, and 96.2%, respectively. Compared with the early epilepsy group, the recurrence rate of type iii and type iv in the late epilepsy group was higher (P < 0.05). The effective rates of the attack group and the nonattack group were 72.7% and 97.0%, respectively. Compared with the attack group, the effective rate of the nonattack group was higher (P < 0.05). The effective rates of the early epilepsy group and the late epilepsy group were 91.7% and 85.0%, respectively. Compared with the late epilepsy group, the effective rate of the early epilepsy group was higher (P < 0.05). Compared with the early epilepsy group, the late epilepsy group had longer tonic-clonic seizures, atonic seizures, and absent seizures, and the difference between the groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In aSAH secondary epilepsy disease prediction, based on indepth study of the scalp EEG wave type prediction, they play an important role, including aSAH high-risk secondary epilepsy wave types for V, III, and IV types, as well as early and late epilepsy associated with disease stage.

Yet, MMTs use of restrictive take-home dose policies that force most patients to attend their clinic on a daily, or near-daily, basis may be unpopular with many patients and lead to low rates of treatment uptake and retention. In response, this article examines how clinics take-home dosing policies have affected patients experiences of treatment and lives in general. METHODS: This article is based on semi-structured, qualitative interviews with a variety of stakeholders in MMT. Interviews explored: reasons for engaging with, or not engaging with MMT; how MMT is conceptualized by patients and treatment providers (e.g., as harm reduction or route to abstinence and/or recovery); experiences with MMT; perception of barriers to MMT (e.g., organizational/regulatory, social) and how MMT might be improved to support peoples substance use treatment needs and goals. RESULTS: Nearly all of the patients with past or present MMT use were highly critical of the limited access to take-home doses and consequent need for daily or near daily clinic attendance. Participants described how the use of restrictive take-home dose policies negatively impacted their ability to meet day-to-day responsibilities and also cited the need for daily attendance as a reason for quitting or avoiding OAT. Responses also demonstrate how such policies contribute to an environment of cruelty and stigma within many clinics that exposes this already-stigmatized population to additional trauma. CONCLUSIONS: Take-home dose policies in MMT are not working for a substantial number of patients and are reasonably seen by participants as degrading and dehumanizing. Revision of MMT regulations and policies regarding take home doses are essential to improve patient satisfaction and the quality and effectiveness of MMT as a key evidence-based treatment and harm reduction strategy.","output":"Its like liquid handcuffs: The effects of take-home dosing policies on Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) patients lives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Respiratory protective equipment recommended in the UK for healthcare workers (HCWs) caring for patients with COVID-19 comprises a fluid-resistant surgical mask (FRSM), except in the context of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs).

We conducted a quality improvement program to immunize pre-dialysis patients. Patients who were found to have a negative baseline serology with a negative hepatitis B surface antibody level (HBsAb) were offered vaccination on a 6-month schedule (0, 1 and 6 months) with one of two available vaccines within the VA system (Recombivax? or Engerix?). HBsAb titers were checked 3C4 months later, and titers  12 mIU/mL were indicative of immunity at VA. Patients who did not seroconvert were offered a repeat schedule of three more doses. We screened 198 patients (187 males and 11 females) with CKD 4 and 5 [glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 29 mL/min/1.73 m(2)]. The median age of this cohort was 72 years (range 38C92 years). During the study period of 5 years (2015C2020), 10 patients were excluded since their GFR had improved to more than 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 24 others had baseline immunity and 2 refused vaccination.

METHODS: We included 12 cases of nontubercular bacterial and fungal CNS infections each, in whom definitive microbiological diagnosis could be made. High-resolution vessel wall imaging (VWI) and time of flight MR angiography (TOF MRA) were incorporated in the routine imaging protocol. All cases were evaluated for the presence of vascular enhancement, pattern of enhancement, and stenosis on VWI. Statistical analysis was done to evaluate association between findings of vessel wall imaging and infarctions. RESULTS: We found infarctions in 5 out of 12 cases (41.7%) of the bacterial group and 7 out of 12 cases (58.3%) of the fungal group. Vessel wall enhancement was seen in 5 cases (41.7%) of the bacterial group and 9 cases (75%) of the fungal group. There was a significant association between infarctions and vessel wall enhancement in the fungal group. However, pattern of enhancement or stenosis on VWI was not significantly associated with presence of infarction. VWI detected more cases of vascular involvement than TOF MRA.

As 50% of mental health conditions present before 14 years of age, access to high-quality mental health care for children is crucial. Barriers to access identified by parents include high costs and long wait times, difficulty navigating the health system, and a lack of recognition of the existence and/or severity of the child's mental health disorder. Often neglected, but equally important, are clinician views about the barriers to and enablers of access to high-quality mental health care. We aimed to determine perspectives of Australian clinicians including child and adolescent psychiatrists, paediatricians, psychologists and general practitioners, on barriers and enablers within the current system and components of an optimal system. METHODS A total of 143 clinicians (approximately 35 each of child and adolescent psychiatrists, paediatricians, child psychologists and general practitioners) from Victoria and South Australia participated in semi-structured phone interviews between March 2018 and February 2019. Inductive content analysis was applied to address the broad study aims. FINDINGS Clinician-identified barriers included multi-dimensional family factors, service fragmentation, long wait times and inadequate training for paediatricians and general practitioners. Rural and regional locations provided additional challenges but a greater sense of collaboration resulting from the proximity of clinicians in rural areas, creating an opportunity to develop support networks.

With unique panel data collected in the course of the COVID-19 in South Korea and the use of individual fixed-effects models, we examined how social trust in various social institutions changed and identified a causal effect of crisis management on social trust. According to the results, trust in South Korean society, people, and the central and local governments improved substantially, whereas trust in judicature, the press, and religious organizations sharply decreased. Improvement in trust in the central and local governments was associated with proactive responses to the pandemic crisis, and failure to take appropriate actions was responsible for the deteriorating trust in religious organizations. These findings illustrate the importance of risk management in trust formation and imply that South Korea may be transforming from a low-trust to a high-trust society.","output":"Social trust in the midst of pandemic crisis: Implications from COVID-19 of South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the infection with the new coronavirus, which appeared in December 2019 in China, as Covid-19, and defined it as a worldwide pandemic.

Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is just one component of BRD complex. Because BRD is moderately heritable, it may be possible to reduce the incidence of BRD through genetic selection. The objectives of this study were to determine the heritability and associative genetic relationships among immune system traits (i.e., cortisol, total IgG, IgG isotypes, and IL-8) in cattle monitored for BRD incidence. At an average of 83 d after weaning (219 d age and mean = 221.7 kg [SD 4.34]), crossbred Bos taurus steer calves (n = 2,869) were received at a commercial feedlot in southeastern Colorado over a 2-yr period. At receiving, jugular blood samples were collected at 212 (yr 1) and 226 d (yr 2) of age for immune trait analyses. The BRD phenotype was defined as a binomial variable (0 = no and 1 = yes) and compared with immune system traits measured at receiving (prior to illness onset). An animal identified as BRD positive exhibited  2 clinical signs (i.e., eye or nasal discharge, cough, lethargy, rapid breathing, acute interstitial pneumonia, or acute upper respiratory syndrome and/or a rectal temperature > 39.7C). Heritability and genetic correlation estimates for categorical variable BRD, cortisol, IgG, IgG1, IgG2, and IL-8 were estimated from a sire model using ASREML.

Cases are clustered in the city, with certain neighborhoods experiencing more cases than others. We investigate whether potential socioeconomic factors can explain between-neighborhood variation in the number of detected COVID-19 cases. Methods: Data were collected from 177 Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) in New York City (99.9% of the population). We fit multiple Bayesian Besag-York-Molli (BYM) mixed models using positive COVID-19 tests as the outcome and a set of 10 representative economic, demographic, and health-care associated ZCTA-level parameters as potential predictors. The BYM model includes both spatial and nonspatial random effects to account for clustering and overdispersion. Results: Multiple different regression approaches indicated a consistent, statistically significant association between detected COVID-19 cases and dependent (under 18 or 65+ years old) population, male to female ratio, and median household income. In the final model, we found that an increase of only 1% in dependent population is associated with a 2.5% increase in detected COVID-19 cases (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6% to 3.4%, p < 0.0005). An increase of 1 male per 100 females is associated with a 1.0% (95% CI: 0.6% to 1.5%, p < 0.0005) increases in detected cases. A decrease of $10,000 median household income is associated with a 2.5% (95% CI: 1.0% to 4.1% p = 0.002) increase in detected COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: Our findings indicate associations between neighborhoods with a large dependent population, those with a high proportion of males, and low-income neighborhoods and detected COVID-19 cases. Given the elevated mortality in aging populations, the study highlights the importance of public health management during and after the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Studies over the last 30 years have demonstrated that HCV contains a highly structured RNA genome and many of these structures play essential roles in the HCV life cycle. Despite the importance of riboregulation in this virus, most of the HCV RNA genome remains functionally unstudied. Here, we report a complete secondary structure map of the HCV RNA genome in vivo, which was studied in parallel with the secondary structure of the same RNA obtained in vitro. Our results show that HCV is folded extensively in the cellular context. By performing comprehensive structural analyses on both in vivo data and in vitro data, we identify compact and conserved secondary and tertiary structures throughout the genome. Genetic and evolutionary functional analyses demonstrate that many of these elements play important roles in the virus life cycle. In addition to providing a comprehensive map of RNA structures and riboregulatory elements in HCV, this work provides a resource for future studies aimed at identifying therapeutic targets and conducting further mechanistic studies on this important human pathogen. IMPORTANCE HCV has one of the most highly structured RNA genomes studied to date, and it is a valuable model system for studying the role of RNA structure in protein-coding genes. While previous studies have identified individual cases of regulatory RNA structures within the HCV genome, the full-length structure of the HCV genome has not been determined in vivo. Here, we present the complete secondary structure map of HCV determined both in cells and from corresponding transcripts generated in vitro. In addition to providing a comprehensive atlas of functional secondary structural elements throughout the genomic RNA, we identified a novel set of tertiary interactions and demonstrated their functional importance. In terms of broader implications, the pipeline developed in this study can be applied to other long RNAs, such as long noncoding RNAs.

Recently, it has been reported the incidence of Kawasaki-like disease among children with COVID-19. Since, children had been known to be less severely affected by the virus in part due to the higher concentration of Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptor, this presentation has emerged concerns regarding the infection of children with SARS-COV2. ACE2 has anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and anti-proliferative characteristics through converting angiotensin (Ag)-II to Ang (1-7). ACE2 receptor is downregulated by the SARS-COV through the spike protein of SARS-CoV (SARS-S) via a process that is tightly coupled with Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945; production. TNF-&#945; plays a key role in aneurysmal formation of coronary arteries in Kawasaki disease (KD). Affected children by COVID-19 with genetically-susceptible to KD might have genetically under-expression of ACE2 receptor that might further decrease the expression of ACE2 due to the downregulation of the receptor by the virus in these patients. It appears that TNF- &#945; might be the cause and the consequence of the ACE2 receptor downregulation which results in arterial walls aneurysm. Conclusion: Genetically under-expression of ACE2 receptor in children with genetically-susceptible to KD who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 possibly further downregulates the ACE2 expression by TNF-&#945; and leads to surge of inflammation including TNF-&#945; and progression to Kawasaki-like disease.","output":"Kawasaki-like disease in children with COVID-19: A hypothesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the effect of electoral politics on government small business lending, employment, and business formation.

RECENT FINDINGS A recent meta-analysis finds reduced influenza infections, hospitalizations and deaths with use of high dose as compared with standard-dose vaccine in the elderly. There remain no randomized clinical trials of vaccine efficacy in dialysis patients. One observational study finds reduced all-cause hospitalization with high-dose as compared with standard-dose vaccine but another study finds no difference in influenza related events. A simulation study, in which the timing of vaccination and antibody waning rates are varied, finds vaccine efficacy among populations prone to premature waning, to be greater if the vaccine is administered later, as long as the opportunity to vaccinate does not decline. In a phase 3 trial involving low-risk patients with uncomplicated influenza, baloxavir (which is of a novel class of antiinfluenza treatment), was associated with a faster decline in virus titers and no difference in resolution of symptoms as compared with oseltamivir. SUMMARY By extension of high-quality evidence in the elderly, we recommend using the high dose vaccine in all dialysis patients. Vaccine efficacy may be enhanced in dialysis patients if vaccination is delayed until late October to mid-November.

We have previously shown that EBOV VP40 in exosomes causes recipient immune cell death. METHODS: Using VP40-producing clones, we analyzed donor cell cycle, extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis, and recipient immune cell death. Transcription of cyclin D1 and nuclear localization of VP40 were examined via kinase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Extracellular vesicle contents were characterized by mass spectrometry, cytokine array, and western blot. Biosafety level-4 facilities were used for wild-type Ebola virus infection studies. RESULTS: VP40 EVs induced apoptosis in recipient T cells and monocytes. VP40 clones were accelerated in growth due to cyclin D1 upregulation, and nuclear VP40 was found bound to the cyclin D1 promoter. Accelerated cell cycling was related to EV biogenesis, resulting in fewer but larger EVs. VP40 EV contents were enriched in ribonucleic acid-binding proteins and cytokines (interleukin-15, transforming growth factor-1, and interferon-). Finally, EBOV-infected cell and animal EVs contained VP40, nucleoprotein, and glycoprotein. CONCLUSIONS: Nuclear VP40 upregulates cyclin D1 levels, resulting in dysregulated cell cycle and EV biogenesis.

Twenty of seventy-seven (25.97%) patients with BECTS reported having side effects; all effects were mild that could be relieved themselves. For Sinopharm (Beijing): BBIBP-CorV (Vero cells), the most frequent local side effect reported by the parents was pain at the site of injection (17.24%) and systematic side effect was fatigue (15.52%). For CanSino: Ad5-nCoV, the most reported local side effect was pain at the site of injection (6.25%). All parents reported that their child's side effects could be relieved by themselves. No patient reported status epilepticus or exacerbation of a pre-existing condition. If non-vaccinated, the cause of hesitation was explored: 40% parents worried about inducing seizures, 19% of parents worried about vaccine side effects, 32% of parents worried about the vaccine-anti epileptic drug interactions, and 9% parents feared for their childs physical condition. More than 34.1% of parents accepted that the decision to get the vaccine for their child was difficult. Over 90% parents believe that research on the safety and tolerability of vaccination would help them to make the decision. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that COVID-19 vaccination is well tolerated and safe in patients below 18 years of age having BECTS, thereby supporting the recommendation of vaccination.","output":"COVID-19 vaccination for patients with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China since December 2019.

In this context, battery-operated wireless sensors allow us to stop using wired sensor networks, providing easy installation processes and low maintenance costs. Nevertheless, wireless transmission of high-rate data such as structural vibration consumes considerable power. Consequently, these wireless networks demand frequent battery replacement, which is problematic for large structures with poor accessibility, such as long-span bridges. This work proposes a low-power multi-hop wireless sensor network suitable for monitoring large-sized civil infrastructures to handle this problem. The proposed network employs low-power wireless devices that act in the sub-GHz band, permitting long-distance data transmission and communication surpassing 1 km. Data collection over vast areas is accomplished via multi-hop communication, in which the sensor data are acquired and re-transmitted by neighboring sensors. The communication and transmission times are synchronized, and time-division communication is executed, which depends on the wireless devices to sleep when the connection is not necessary to consume less power. An experimental field test is performed to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of the designed wireless sensor network to collect and capture the acceleration response of the long-span Manhattan Bridge. Thanks to the high-quality monitoring data collected with the developed low-power wireless sensor network, the natural frequencies and mode shapes were robustly recognized. The monitoring tests also showed the benefits of the presented wireless sensor system concerning the installation and measuring operations.","output":"Long-Range Low-Power Multi-Hop Wireless Sensor Network for Monitoring the Vibration Response of Long-Span Bridges ?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, a severe global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as one of the most threatening transmissible disease. As a great threat to global public health, the development of treatment options has become vital, and a rush to find a cure has mobilized researchers globally from all areas. SCOPE AND APPROACH: This review focuses on deciphering the potential of different secondary metabolites from medicinal plants as therapeutic options either as inhibitors of therapeutic targets of SARS-CoV-2 or as blockers of viral particles entry through host cell receptors. The use of medicinal plants containing specific phytomoieties could be seen in providing a safer and long-term solution for the population with lesser side effects. Key Findings and Conclusions: Considering the high cost and time-consuming drug discovery process, therapeutic repositioning of existing drugs was explored as treatment option in COVID-19, however several molecules have been retracted as therapeutics either due to no positive outcomes or the severe side effects. These effects call for exploring the alternate treatment options which are therapeutically effective as well as safe. Keeping this in mind, phytopharmaceuticals derived from medicinal plants could be explored as important resources in the development of COVID-19 treatment, as their role in the past for treatment of viral diseases like HIV, MERS-CoV, and influenza has been well reported. Considering this fact, different phytoconstituents such as flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins and glycosides etc. Possessing antiviral properties against coronaviruses and possessing potential against SARS-CoV-2 have been reviewed in the present work.","output":"Role of phytoconstituents in the management of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A reverse transcriptase, polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) procedure was used to amplify a segment of the genome of turkey coronavirus (TCV) spanning portions of the matrix and nucleocapsid (MN) protein genes (approximately 1.1 kb).

There are two types of narcolepsy: type 1 (with cataplexy) and type 2 (without cataplexy). Unlike type 1, for which hypocretin is a biomarker, type 2 narcolepsy has no adequate biomarker to identify the causality of narcoleptic phenomenon. Therefore, we aimed to establish new biomarkers for narcolepsy using the body's systemic networks. METHOD: Thirty participants (15 with type 2 narcolepsy, 15 healthy controls) were included. We used the time delay stability (TDS) method to examine temporal information and determine relationships among multiple signals. We quantified and analyzed the network connectivity of nine biosignals (brainwaves, cardiac and respiratory information, muscle and eye movements) during nocturnal sleep. In particular, we focused on the differences in network connectivity between groups according to sleep stages and investigated whether the differences could be potential biomarkers to classify both groups by using a support vector machine. RESULT: In rapid eye movement sleep, the narcolepsy group displayed more connections than the control group (narcolepsy connections: 24.47  2.87, control connections: 21.34  3.49; p = 0.022). The differences were observed in movement and cardiac activity. The performance of the classifier based on connectivity differences was a 0.93 for sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, respectively.

Morevoer, there exists a marked intra- and inter-patient variability in response to diuretics that affects the clinical course and related adverse outcomes. In the present article, we review the mechanisms underlying the development of diuretic resistance. The role of the autonomic nervous system and chronobiology in the pathogenesis of congestive heart failure and response to therapy are also discussed. Establishing a novel model for overcoming diuretic resistance is presented based on a patient-tailored variability and chronotherapy-guided machine learning algorithm that comprises clinical, laboratory, and sensor-derived inputs, including inputs from pulmonary artery measurements. Inter- and intra-patient signatures of variabilities, alterations of biological clock, and autonomic nervous system responses are embedded into the algorithm; thus, it may enable a tailored dose regimen in a continuous manner that accommodates the highly dynamic complex system.","output":"Improving Diuretic Response in Heart Failure by Implementing a Patient-Tailored Variability and Chronotherapy-Guided Algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A practical colorimetric assay was developed for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Between September and October 2020, approximately 1.3 million people (age >15 years) were randomly invited to fill in an electronic questionnaire covering COVID-19 exposures and symptoms. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was determined by point-of care rapid test (POCT) distributed to participants home addresses. In total, 318,552 participants (24.5% invitees) completed the study and 2,519 (0.79%) were seropositive. Of the participants with a prior positive PCR test (n = 1,828), 29.1% were seropositive in the POCT. Although seropositivity increased with age, participants 61 years and over reported fewer symptoms and were tested less frequently. Seropositivity was associated with physical contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (risk ratio [RR] 7.43, 95% CI: 6.57C8.41), particular in household members (RR 17.70, 95% CI: 15.60C20.10). A greater risk of seropositivity was seen in home care workers (RR 2.09, 95% CI: 1.58C2.78) compared to office workers. A high degree of adherence with national preventive recommendations was reported (e.g., >80% use of face masks), but no difference were found between seropositive and seronegative participants. The seroprevalence result was somewhat hampered by a lower-than-expected performance of the POCT. This is likely due to a low sensitivity of the POCT or problems reading the test results, and the main findings therefore relate to risk associations. More emphasis should be placed on age, occupation, and exposure in local communities. IMPORTANCE To date, including 318,522 participants, this is the largest population-based study with broad national participation where tests and questionnaires have been sent to participants homes.

DESIGN: Outbreak investigation. SETTING: Three NHs in southeast Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: All residents (N = 215) at three NHs (total beds = 356) affiliated with a large academic healthcare system. METHODS: Upon detection of confirmed cases within the facility, each NH in collaboration and consultation with local hospital, public health officials, and parent corporation implemented immediate facility-wide testing and the following intervention measures: cohorting of COVID-19 positive residents; communication regarding testing and results with residents, healthcare professionals, and families; personal protective equipment reeducation and use throughout facilities; and dedicated staffing for infected patients cohorted in a dedicated COVID-19 wing. We collected patient data regarding demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, hospitalization, and 14-day outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 29 cases of COVID-19 were identified at three participating NHs. Nineteen cases of COVID-19 were identified through symptom-triggered testing from March 23 to April 23, 2020; 10 (4.7%) additional cases were identified through universal testing of 215 residents conducted from April 7 to 15, 2020.

The COVID-19 pandemic introduces new psychosocial stressors, which may be particularly harmful to youth already experiencing stress in the home environment. Using multi-dimensional (threat vs deprivation) assessments of CM, the present study aimed to test whether COVID-19 related stress intensified the association between maltreatment (abuse vs neglect) and sleep problems among youth. METHODS: This study utilized data from a longitudinal sample of youth (N=126; Mage at T1=12.9) assessed between January 2019 and March 2020 (T1) and after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (May 2020; T2). Latent factors for COVID-19 related stress included three questions asking about negative changes, uncertainty about the future, and stress-induced by disruptions. CM at T1 was measured with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Multidimensional aspects of CM included a threat factor (sum of Emotional, Physical, and Sexual Abuse) and a deprivation factor (sum of Emotional and Physical Neglect). Sleep-related problems at both T1 and T2 were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global score. Structural equation modeling was conducted in Mplus 8.1 to test direct and interaction effects of CM and COVID-19 related stress on sleep problems at T2 while controlling for sleep problems at T1 and demographic covariates. RESULTS: Threat-related abuse was significantly associated with increased sleep problems at T2 ( =.43, p < .01) but neglect was not ( =.03, p = .85). Additionally, COVID-19 related stress significantly intensified the link between abuse and sleep problems ( =.14, p < .05) as well as between neglect and sleep problems ( =.43, p < .01) at T2. Among youth who experienced higher levels of CM, increased COVID-19 related stress exacerbated sleep problems. CONCLUSION: These results bolster extant research on the negative impact CM bears on youth sleep health and indicates that COVID-19 stress may exacerbate sleep problems. Our findings inform future prevention and intervention efforts that aim to reduce sleep problems among youth who experience CM during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This project aims to characterize this collaboration and assess the effectiveness by reviewing interventions made by the nurse and pharmacist, and assessing patient outcomes such as OPAT or infection related hospital admissions or ED visits, infection clearance, and mortality. Methods. A retrospective cohort study was performed on patients started on OPAT between 1/1/19 and 12/31/20. This time period was split into three: Period 1 where the clinic only included the PharmD and they saw patients for in-person appointments, Period 2 where the clinic included both the OPAT RN and PharmD and the PharmD performed in-person appointments, and Period 3 where the clinic included both but due to COVID the in-person PharmD appointments were on hold. OPAT or infection related hospital admissions, ED visits, infection clearance, and death were compared for each period. Results. A total of 388 patients were included in the review. There were 158 (40.7%) and 148 (38.1%) OPAT-related phone calls from the PharmD and RN, respectively. The two most common reasons for both PharmD and RN phone calls were a medication stop order/confirmation, and weekly lab obtainment. The third most common reason for the PharmD was dose change, and for the RN it was patient education. During Periods 1 and 2 the PharmD had in-person appointments with 28.9% of patients. The overall OPAT/infection related hospital admission and ED visit rates were 7.7% and 5.4%, respectively. Periods 2 and 3, which utilized the combined efforts of RN and PharmD, had consistently lower hospital admissions related to OPAT/infection (46-50% vs 62% Period 1), and ED visits due to OPAT/infection (33-36% vs 47% for Period 1). Clearance of infection was high for all 3 periods (89-95%), and mean mortality was low (2.1%). Conclusion.

Here, we report a 43-year-old man with early-onset dementia associated with elevated lipoprotein (a) and a missense variant in the DNAJC5 gene. He presented to the hospital with memory loss and multiple cerebrovascular infarcts. Eight months prior, an MRI revealed small acute and subacute infarcts involving the left PCA for which he was treated with antiplatelet agents and a statin. Three months later, he was readmitted for progressive memory loss. CT imaging showed evolving and new infarcts compared to prior scans. A cardiac echocardiogram excluded thrombus and PFO, and he was diagnosed with early vascular dementia. He was readmitted again 5 months later with additional evaluation revealing multifocal moderate to severe stenosis and irregularities involving the bilateral ICA and bilateral PCAs. MRI showed more pronounced infarcts compared to a previous MRI as well as new infarcts. CSF studies, VDRL, RF, ANA, ANCA, homocysteine, and MMA levels were normal. Lipoprotein (a) was found to be markedly elevated, and genetic testing revealed a missense variant of the DNAJC5 gene, the mutation of which is associated with ceroid lipofuscinosis. In conclusion, in patients with early-onset dementia and evidence of accelerated atherosclerosis, it is reasonable to measure Lp(a) and consider testing for variants in genes such as DNAJC5 and others, particularly when disease severity appears unexplained by known risk factors or circumstances.","output":"Early-Onset Vascular Dementia in a 43-Year-Old Man with Accelerated Atherosclerotic Disease, Elevated Lipoprotein (a), and a Missense DNAJC5 Variant with Potential Association to Adult-Onset Ceroid Lipofuscinosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Innate immunity has a primary role in lung antimicrobial defenses. The inflammasome has evolved for this purpose and is an important surveillance system that, when triggered, fights infection and eliminates pathogens. However, there is growing evidence that the inflammasome also plays a role in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic respiratory disease. Inflammasomes contribute to both the clearance of the pathogen as well as its pathogenesis C depending on the amount of inflammation triggered. How respiratory viruses trigger inflammasome activation remains unclear. Emerging evidence shows that ion flux is responsible for triggering inflammasome activation in the lung, causing lung pathology and disease exacerbations. Viroporins, encoded by all common respiratory viruses, are responsible for the changes in intracellular ion homeostasis that modulate inflammasome activation. This is a novel mechanism by which respiratory viral infection activates inflammasomes, and identifies sensing of disturbances in intracellular ionic concentrations as a novel pathogen-recognition pathway in the lung.","output":"Ion flux in the lung: virus-induced inflammasome activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In 2018, influenza and pneumonia was the eighth leading cause of death in the United States. Since 1950, non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) have experienced higher rates of mortality than non-Hispanic whites (NHWs). Previous studies have revealed geographic variation in mortality rates by race. The identification of areas with the greatest disparity in influenza and pneumonia mortality may assist policymakers in the allocation of resources, including for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does geographic variation in racial disparity in influenza and pneumonia mortality exist? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention database for Multiple Cause of Death between 1999 and 2018 for NHB and NHW decedents &#8805; 25 years of age with a Tenth Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems code for influenza (J09-J11) and pneumonia (J12-J18) was used. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) with 95% CIs were computed by race for Health & Human Services (HHS) regions and urbanization in NHBs and NHWs. RESULTS: In 1999 through 2018, there were 540,476 deaths among NHBs and NHWs 25 to 84 years of age. AAMRs were higher in NHBs than NHWs in each age group and in seven of 10 HHS regions. The greatest disparity was in HHS regions 2 (New York and New Jersey) and 9 (Arizona, California, Hawaii, and Nevada). In HHS region 2, NHBs (24.6; 95% CI, 24.1-25.1) were more likely to die than NHWs (15.7; 95% CI, 15.6-15.9). Similarly, in region 9, NHBs (23.2; 95% CI, 22.7-23.8) had higher mortality than NHWs (16.1; 95% CI, 15.9-16.2). Within these regions, disparities were greatest in the core of major metropolitan areas. A very high AAMR in NHBs was noted in large, central metropolitan areas of region 2: 28.2 (95% CI, 27.6-28.9).

Urgent surgical decompression aims to prevent progressive neurological deficit. Symptoms of cauda equina syndrome (CES), such as back pain, sciatica and bladder dysfunction are common in the population, but the majority of those investigated do not have radiological cauda equina compression. However, a missed diagnosis can have significant medical, social and legal consequences. We investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on presentation and management of suspected CES. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analysed referral, investigation and treatment of CES in a regional neurosurgical centre during the initial COVID-19 surge between March and May 2020 compared with March to May 2019. RESULTS: Referrals for suspected CES were similar during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 275) compared with 2019 (n = 261, p = 0.596) despite a significant (19%) decrease in total emergency neurosurgical referrals (1248 in 2020 vs 1544 in 2019, p < 0.001). Nineteen (7%) of the suspected CES referrals underwent decompression in 2020, similar to 16 (6%) in 2019 (p = 0.867). There were no differences in outcomes or complications and no evidence of delays in presentation or treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike other emergency neurosurgical conditions, the number of referrals for suspected CES and the percentage of referrals with radiological cauda equina compression were unchanged during the COVID-19 pandemic. The persistence of CES referrals when many people stayed away from hospital highlights the distress and worry caused by suspected CES and its symptoms to both patients and healthcare providers.","output":"Suspected cauda equina syndrome: no reduction in investigation, referral and treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of COVID-19 is different in studies conducted in different countries.

Understanding the interaction of cellular targets to the SARS-CoV2 infection is crucial for therapeutic development. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of transcriptomic signatures of infection of COVID-19 compared to different respiratory viruses (Ebola, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV), to determine unique anti-COVID1-19 gene signature. We identified for the first time molecular pathways for Heparin-binding, RAGE, miRNA, and PLA2 inhibitors, to be associated with SARS-CoV2 infection. The NRCAM and SAA2 that are involved in severe inflammatory response, and FGF1 and FOXO1 genes, which are associated with immune regulation, were found to be associated with a cellular gene response to COVID-19 infection. Moreover, several cytokines, most significantly the IL-8, IL-6, demonstrated key associations with COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, the only response gene that was shared between the five viral infections was SERPINB1. The PPI study sheds light on genes with high interaction activity that COVID-19 shares with other viral infections. The findings showed that the genetic pathways associated with Rheumatoid arthritis, AGE-RAGE signaling system, Malaria, Hepatitis B, and Influenza A were of high significance.

Although there has been increasing attention to the effect of social media use during epidemics and outbreaks, relatively little is known about the underlying mechanism by which social media plays a role in people's cognitive, affective and preventive responses. OBJECTIVE: With an objective to advance current knowledge surrounding social media effects on people's cognition, affection and health protective behaviors during epidemics, we aim to examine the associations between social media exposure to COVID-19 risks related information and preventive behavior of the public, and also the role that situation awareness and crisis emotions including anxiety and fear played. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted in China a total of 632 participants were recruited. Measures included exposure to COVID-19 information through social media, situation awareness, anxiety, fear and protective behaviors that participants have taken. We have performed the descriptive statistical analysis, correlation and mediation analysis to test the research hypotheses. RESULTS: Findings indicated that situation awareness was positively associated with social media use (B = 0.54, p < 0.001), anxiety (B = 0.95, p < 0.001) and fear (B = 0.87, p < 0.001), and preventive behavior (B = 0.68, p < 0.001). Social media use would also have an indirect effect on anxiety (indirect effect = 0.40; 95% CI = [0.34, 0.46]) and fear (indirect effect = 0.35; 95% CI = [0.29, 0.42]) through situation awareness.

These findings may help explain why after 30 years of proposed government obesity policies, obesity prevalence and health inequities still have not been successfully reduced. If policymakers address the issues identified in this analysis, population obesity could be tackled more successfully, which has added urgency given the COVID-19 pandemic. CONTEXT: In England, the majority of adults, and more than a quarter of children aged 2 to 15 years live with obesity or excess weight. From 1992 to 2020, even though the government published 14 obesity strategies in England, the prevalence of obesity has not been reduced. We aimed to determine whether such government strategies and policies have been fit for purpose regarding their strategic focus, nature, basis in theory and evidence, and implementation viability. METHOD: We undertook a mixed-methods study, involving a document review and analysis of government strategies either wholly or partially dedicated to tackling obesity in England. We developed a theory-based analytical framework, using content analysis and applied thematic analysis (ATA) to code all policies. Our interpretation drew on quantitative findings and thematic analysis. FINDINGS: We identified and analyzed 14 government strategies published from 1992 to 2020 containing 689 wide-ranging policies. Policies were largely proposed in a way that would be unlikely to lead to implementation; the majority were not interventionist and made high demands on individual agency, meaning that they relied on individuals to make behavior changes rather than shaping external influences, and are thus less likely to be effective or to reduce health inequalities. CONCLUSIONS: The government obesity strategies' failure to reduce the prevalence of obesity in England for almost 30 years may be due to weaknesses in the policies' design, leading to a lack of effectiveness, but they may also be due to failures of implementation and evaluation. These failures appear to have led to insufficient or no policy learning and governments proposing similar or identical policies repeatedly over many years. Governments should learn from their earlier policy failures. They should prioritize policies that make minimal demands on individuals and have the potential for population-wide reach so as to maximize their potential for equitable impacts. Policies should be proposed in ways that readily lead to implementation and evaluation.","output":"Is Obesity Policy in England Fit for Purpose?

We find that the illusion increases with increasing internal speed and decreases with increasing external speed. We model this by combining the external and internal vectors to produce the resulting, illusory direction (Tse & Hsieh, 2006). The relative effect of the two vectors is specified by a constant K in this model and the data reveal that K decreases linearly as external speed increases.

Since immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have shown clinically significant efficacy in patients with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC (R/M HNSCC), a plethora of trials are investigating their role in earlier stages of disease. At the same time, preclinical data showed the synergistic role of concurrently administered radiotherapy and ICIs (immunoradiotherapy) and explained several mechanisms behind it. Therefore, this approach is prospectively tested in a neoadjuvant, definitive, or adjuvant setting in non-R/M HNSCC patients. Due to the intricate relationship between host, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, each of these approaches has its advantages and disadvantages. In this narrative review we present the biological background of immunoradiotherapy, as well as a rationale for, and possible flaws of, each treatment approach, and provide readers with a critical summary of completed and ongoing trials. CONCLUSIONS: While immunotherapy with ICIs has already become a standard part of treatment in patients with R/M HNSCC, its efficacy in a non-R/M HNSCC setting is still the subject of extensive clinical testing. Irradiation can overcome some of the cancers immune evasive manoeuvres and can lead to a synergistic effect with ICIs, with possible additional benefits of concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy.

Taking a co-design approach to the development of eHealth tools has the potential to ensure that these tools are inclusive. Although the importance of involving future users in the development of eHealth tools to reduce SHIs is highlighted in the scientific literature, the challenges associated with their participation question the benefits of this involvement as co-designers in a real-world context. OBJECTIVE: On the basis of Amartya Sens theoretical framework of social justice, the aim of this study is to explore how co-design can support the development of an inclusive eHealth tool for caregivers of functionally dependent older persons. METHODS: This study is based on a social justice design and participant observation as part of a large-scale research project funded by the Ministry of Families as part of the Age-Friendly Quebec Program (Qubec Ami des A?ns). The analysis was based on the method developed by Miles and Huberman and on Paills analytical questioning method. RESULTS: A total of 78 people participated in 11 co-design sessions in 11 Quebec regions. A total of 24 preparatory meetings and 11 debriefing sessions were required to complete this process. Co-designers participated in the creation of a prototype to support the search for formal services for caregivers. The majority of participants (except for 2) significantly contributed to the tools designing. They also incorporated conversion factors to ensure the inclusiveness of the eHealth tool, such as an adequate level of digital literacy and respect for the caregivers help-seeking process. In the course of the experiment, the research teams position regarding its role in co-design evolved from a neutral posture and promoting co-designer participation to one that was more pragmatic. CONCLUSIONS: The use of co-design involving participants at risk of SHIs does not guarantee innovation, but it does guarantee that the tool developed will comply with their process of help-seeking and their literacy level. Time issues interfere with efforts to carry out a democratic process in its ideal form. It would be useful to single out some key issues to guide researchers on what should be addressed in co-design discussions and what can be left out to make optimal use of this approach in a real-world context.","output":"Co-Design to Support the Development of Inclusive eHealth Tools for Caregivers of Functionally Dependent Older Persons: Social Justice Design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has caused a severe impact on almost all aspects of human life and economic development.

The algal sample was dried and subjected to ethanolic extraction, followed by purification and analysis using gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Forty-three known compounds were identified and docked against the S(1) receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) glycoprotein. The compounds that exhibited high binding affinity to the RBD of S(1) protein were further analyzed for their chemical behaviour using conceptual density-functional theory (C-DFT). Finally, pharmacokinetic properties and drug-likeliness studies were carried out to test if the compounds qualified as potential leads. The results indicated that mainly phenols, polyenes, phytosteroids, and aliphatic compounds from the extract, such as 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol (2,4-DtBP), doconexent, 4,8,13-duvatriene-1,3-diol (DTD), retinoyl--glucuronide 6,3-lactone (RBGUL), and retinal, showed better binding affinity to the target.

The prime objective of this article is to use radiological images as a tool to help in early diagnosis. The interval type 2 fuzzy clustering is blended with the concept of superpixels, and metaheuristics to efficiently segment the radiological images. Despite noise sensitivity of watershed-based approach, it is adopted for superpixel computation owing to its simplicity where the noise problem is handled by the important edge information of the gradient image is preserved with the help of morphological opening and closing based reconstruction operations. The traditional objective function of the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is modified to incorporate the spatial information from the neighboring superpixel-based local window. The computational overhead associated with the processing of a huge amount of spatial information is reduced by incorporating the concept of superpixels and the optimal clusters are determined by a modified version of the flower pollination algorithm.

However, current available medical image datasets, such as those for COVID-19 CT images, have large variations of infections and domain shift problems. To address this issue, we propose a prior knowledge driven domain adaptation and a dual-domain enhanced self-correction learning scheme. Based on the novel learning schemes, a domain adaptation based self-correction model (DASC-Net) is proposed for COVID-19 infection segmentation on CT images. DASC-Net consists of a novel attention and feature domain enhanced domain adaptation model (AFD-DA) to solve the domain shifts and a self-correction learning process to refine segmentation results. The innovations in AFD-DA include an image-level activation feature extractor with attention to lung abnormalities and a multi-level discrimination module for hierarchical feature domain alignment. The proposed self-correction learning process adaptively aggregates the learned model and corresponding pseudo labels for the propagation of aligned source and target domain information to alleviate the overfitting to noises caused by pseudo labels. Extensive experiments over three publicly available COVID-19 CT datasets demonstrate that DASC-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation, domain shift, and coronavirus infection segmentation methods. Ablation analysis further shows the effectiveness of the major components in our model. The DASC-Net enriches the theory of domain adaptation and self-correction learning in medical imaging and can be generalized to multi-site COVID-19 infection segmentation on CT images for clinical deployment.","output":"Domain adaptation based self-correction model for COVID-19 infection segmentation in CT images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When an infectious disease outbreak is detected or suspected, a healthcare facilitys infection control personnel should be notified and an outbreak control team formed that is pertinent to the size and severity of the outbreak and healthcare facility.

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from the PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and WHO databases for studies mentioning the chest CT imaging findings of adult COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: A total of 45 studies comprising 4410 patients were included. Ground glass opacities (GGO), in isolation (50.2%) or coexisting with consolidations (44.2%), were the most common lesions. Distribution of GGOs was most commonly bilateral, peripheral/subpleural, and posterior with predilection for lower lobes. Common ancillary findings included pulmonary vascular enlargement (64%), intralobular septal thickening (60%), adjacent pleural thickening (41.7%), air bronchograms (41.2%), subpleural lines, crazy paving, bronchus distortion, bronchiectasis, and interlobular septal thickening. CT in early follow-up period generally showed an increase in size, number, and density of GGOs, with progression into mixed areas of GGOs plus consolidations and crazy paving, peaking at 10C11 days, before gradually resolving or persisting as patchy fibrosis. While younger adults more commonly had GGOs, extensive/multilobar involvement with consolidations was prevalent in the older population and those with severe disease. CONCLUSION: This review describes the imaging features for diagnosis, stratification, and follow-up of COVID-19 patients. The most common CT manifestations are bilateral, peripheral/subpleural, posterior GGOs with or without consolidations with a lower lobe predominance.

To date, most commercial antibody assays have not had a quantitative read-out. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 spike-receptor-binding-domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid proteins were biotinylated and used on the solid-phase of the ImmunoCAP using the biotin-streptavidin technique. The assay was developed using plasma from 15 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and serum from 86 subjects recruited prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Assay quantitation was validated using a commercially available monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD antibody (CR3022). Specific IgG was subsequently measured in 17 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in which serum was available at day 0 and 7 post-admission. Results: The cut-off limit for the assays (mean2SD) was determined using pre-COVID-19 samples as 4.9 g/mL for spike-RBD and 4.6 g/mL for nucleocapsid. Based on these cut-offs, the assay performance characteristics were: 100% sensitivity and 97.7% specificity for spike-RBD and 100% sensitivity and 97.6% specificity for nucleocapsid. Experiments using known concentrations of CR3022 correlated strongly with the assay results (R2=0.998). Among the 17 patients there was a wide variation in the magnitude of IgG responses. At day 7 of admission median values were 86.4 g/mL [range 3.2-158.0] and 38.6 g/mL [range 0.6-191.0] for spike-RBD and nucleocapsid, respectively. Conclusions: We have described a quantitative assay to measure IgG to SARS-CoV-2.

Due to the similarities between the symptoms of influenza and COVID-19, receiving the flu vaccine in suspicious cases can be helpful because it will make it easier to request a medical test and diagnosis. In this study, the value of influenza vaccination in the cancer population was investigated. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, all cancer patients who were referred to our clinic and had eligibility to receive the flu vaccine were included in our study for following up clinical signs every week for one month. All patients who were vaccinated from October 1 to November 15, 2020 were investigated. The most side effects that were followed were fever, runny nose, bone pain, and life-threatening or persistent adverse effects. RESULTS: From a total of 288 patients (median age: 52 years (range 18-79), 112 (38.9%) males and 176 (61.1%) female) with different types of cancers, only two patients had an adverse effect of vaccination (including bone pain, runny nose, and fatigue), and one had COVID-19 ten days after vaccination.

Mitigation strategies in acute care settings are based on a combination of basic science, environmental, and epidemiologic evidence. Here, we review the literature on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, how it has shaped infection prevention interventions in acute care settings, and the results of such measures to reduce transmission. RECENT FINDINGS HCP adherence to transmission-based precautions in acute care settings, such as the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), is essential to mitigating SARS-CoV-2 spread. Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated in nonrespiratory body sites, such exposure has not been shown to definitively cause transmission in humans. Epidemiologic evidence has demonstrated that implementation and adherence to infection prevention strategies reduces acute setting transmission. SUMMARY Given SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs primarily through respiratory transmission, preventing HCP acquisition requires fidelity to consistent PPE usage. Infection prevention strategies and implementation of transmission-based precautions have reduced spread and outbreaks. Epidemiologic studies of acute care outbreaks often include reports of PPE nonadherence and community exposure contributing to SARS-CoV-2 transmission within this setting.","output":"Infection prevention measures in acute care settings based on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission patterns and risk: a review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To contain the spread of the COVID-19, governments have designed and implemented a large range of exceptional measures.

The mechanisms underlying the interaction between vascular and immune cells remain unknown, hampering the development of effective therapies targeting the vascular-immune interface. Overcoming these limitations requires a reliable, physiologically relevant experimental model of vascular-immune interface. By coculturing a 3-dimensional organ culture vascular system with immune cells of interest, we reproduced ex vivo the vascular-immune interface that occurs in hypertension. In the 3-dimensional vascular-immune interface model, CD8 but not CD4 T cells isolated from hypertensive mice increased the contractile properties of resistance arteries in naive mice, indicating that CD8 lymphocytes directly contribute to enhanced peripheral resistance in hypertension. RNA sequencing of CD8 lymphocytes isolated from prehypertensive mice revealed upregulation of gene pathways involved in chemotaxis, response to IFN- and other external stimuli, MAPK cascade activation, and positive regulation of intracellular calcium fluxes, as compared with CD4 T cells. Taken together, these results indicate that hypertensive stimuli program CD8 T cells toward a phenotype with promigratory properties that might account for their ability to enhance myogenic tone of resistance arteries when cocultured in the 3-dimensional system. Here, we demonstrate modeling a 3-dimensional organ culture vascular system that recapitulates the in vivo physiological properties of resistance arteries.

From the initial outbreak the virus has mutated several times, with some lineages showing even stronger infectivity and faster spread than the original virus. Among all the variants, beta, gamma, delta and the latest (omicron) are currently classified as variants of concern (VOC) while the remaining are labelled either as variants of interest (VOI) or variants under monitoring (VUM). In this work, we have focused on the mutations observed in important variants, particularly at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein that is responsible for the interactions with the host ACE2 receptor and binding of antibodies. Studying these mutations is particularly important for understanding the viral infectivity, spread of the disease and for tracking the escape routes of this virus from antibodies. Molecular dynamics (MD) based alchemical free energy calculations have been shown to be very accurate in predicting the free energy change due to a mutation that could have a deleterious or a stabilising effect on the protein itself or its binding affinity to another protein. Here, we investigated the significance of six commonly observed spike RBD mutations on the stability of the spike protein binding to ACE2 by free energy calculations using high throughput MD simulations. For comparison, we also used other (rigorous and non-rigorous) binding free energy prediction methods and compared our results with the experimental data if available. The alchemical free energy-based method consistently predicted the free-energy changes with an accuracy close to 1.0 kcal/mol when compared with the available experimental values.

The objective of this study was to evaluate surgeons' ergonomy during LESS surgery, through the study of muscular activity, wrist angle, and hand movements, and compare it with conventional laparoscopy. METHODS The study group was composed by 14 experienced laparoscopic surgeons, all right-handed. Each one performed dissection tasks on a physical simulator through LAP and LESS approaches. For LAP, straight laparoscopic scissors and dissector were used, whilst for LESS articulating tip scissors and dissector were chosen. During both tasks, muscular activity of biceps brachii, triceps brachii, forearm flexors and extensors, and trapezius muscles was registered through surface electromyography. Simultaneously right-hand movements and wrist angles were obtained through a motion capture data glove (CyberGlove(?)), which allowed for the use of a modified RULA test applied to the recorded angles with subsequent establishment of risk levels for the wrist joint. RESULTS Muscular activity for trapezius (LAP 6.94  4.12 vs. LESS 11.32  4.68; p  0.05) and forearm extensor muscles (LAP 9.2  2.45 vs. LESS 37.07  16.05; p  0.001) was significantly lower in conventional laparoscopy compared with LESS approach. No statistical significance was obtained between the different sensors, except in 3 of the 11 analyzed CyberGlove(?) sensors. The modified RULA test showed a score of 3 for laparoscopy (unacceptable), whereas for LESS a score of 2 was obtained (acceptable), with statistically significant differences between them (p  0.05).

METHODS: This retrospective study was undertaken in a tertiary care epilepsy center in India. Consecutive patients with EE who had received IVMP as adjunctive therapy for a minimum of 3 months and had at least one pre-and post-steroid EEG each, were identified and a structured questionnaire was used to collect information including outcomes at 3 months post-steroid course completion and beyond, as available. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients (M:F=71:26) fulfilling the inclusion criteria with a mean age at onset of seizures being 20.52  25.69 months were included. Commonest seizure types were myoclonic (66%); Lennaux-Gastaut and West Syndromes accounted for 57 % and 24 % patients respectively. The etiology was unknown in 52 %. All children were on a combination of standard anti-seizure drugs. The duration of IVMP pulse therapy was 7.72  6.25 months. One-fourth (26 %) patients experienced minor adverse events. Greater than 50 % seizure burden reduction was seen in 66 % patients at 3 months with seizure-freedom in 25 %.

The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to assess the efficiency of telementoring of open and laparoscopic suturing of medical students compared to conventional in-person teaching and training. METHODS After randomization, 23 medical students were assigned to either the telementoring or the in-person training group. Both groups were taught by surgically trained residence with a student-teacher ratio of 1:1 (teacher-student). Open suturing was assessed in a model of congenital diaphragmatic hernia and laparoscopic suturing in a model of bowel anastomosis. All subjects were trained according to the spaced learning concept for 3 hours. Primary end points were time, knot quality, precision, knot strength, and overall knotting performance/competency. Furthermore, we utilized the Surgery Task Load Index to evaluate the cognitive load of both teaching techniques. Students' subjective progress regarding skill acquisitions and acceptance of telementoring was assessed using a nine-item questionnaire. RESULTS All 23 trainees significantly improved after training in all knot attributes. More than 90% of all subjects reached proficiency in both groups. In-person training and telementoring were similarly practical, and no significant differences regarding speed, knot quality, precision, knot stability, and procedure performance/competency were found. Students perceived no difference in acquisition of factual or applicational knowledge between the two groups. General acceptance of telementoring was moderate in both groups before training, but increased during training in students actually assigned to this group, in comparison to students assigned to conventional teaching. CONCLUSION The current study shows that telementoring of open and laparoscopic suturing is an ideal answer to the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, ensuring continuous training. On-site training and telementoring are similarly effective, leading to substantial improvement in proficiency in intracorporeal suturing and knot tying. Likewise, students' subjective progress regarding skill acquisitions and cognitive load does not differ between teaching methods. Skepticism toward telementoring decreases after exposure to this learning method.

This research explored how the pandemic's disruption led to new ways of communicating and professional behaviour, while exploring the potential for longer-term impact in England and other jurisdictions.Design/methodology/approach>Case studies were conducted in 2020 in five English local authorities to explore how schools worked with Children's Social Care and other professionals during the COVID-19 period. It was supplemented by a survey of schools and discussions with and reflections from those with relevant experience in five other countries.Findings>Many schools played an extended role in supporting vulnerable and in need families during this period. Children's Social Care recognised their contributions and the improved communication achieved, although schools were divided over whether relationships had improved. Most communication and meetings were online;while benefits were noted there were concerns for families who were digitally disadvantaged.Originality/value>The work provides a contemporary picture of multiagency work during the 2020 pandemic and identifies factors which may shape this work in the future in England and internationally.","output":"Multiagency working between children's social care and schools during COVID-19: case study experiences from English local authorities and international reflections: Managing Community Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

The resulting COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the WHO in March 2020. By July 2020 COVID-19 is present in 213 countries and territories, with over 12 million confirmed cases and over half a million attributed deaths. Knowledge of other viral respiratory diseases suggests that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 could be modulated by seasonally-varying environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. Many studies on the environmental sensitivity of COVID-19 are appearing online, and some have been published in peer-reviewed journals. Initially, these studies raised the hypothesis that climatic conditions would subdue the viral transmission rate in places entering the boreal summer and that southern hemisphere countries would experience enhanced disease. For the latter, the COVID-19 peak would coincide with the peak of the influenza season, increasing misdiagnosis and placing an additional burden on health systems. In this review, we assess the evidence that environmental drivers are a significant factor in the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic, globally and regionally. We critically assessed 42 peer-reviewed and 80 preprint publications that met qualifying criteria. Since the disease has been prevalent for only half a year in the northern, and a quarter of a year in the southern hemisphere, datasets capturing a full seasonal cycle in one locality are not yet available. Analyses based on space-for-time substitutions, i.e. using data from climatically distinct locations as a surrogate for seasonal progression, have been inconclusive. The reported studies present a strong northern bias. Socio-economic conditions peculiar to the Global Southhave been omitted as confounding variables, thereby weakening evidence of environmental signals. We explore why research to date has failed to show convincing evidence for environmental modulation of COVID-19, and discuss directions for future research. We conclude that the evidence thus far suggests a weak modulation effect, currently overwhelmed by the scale and rate of the spread of COVID-19. Seasonally-modulated transmission, if it exists, will be more evident in 2021 and subsequent years.","output":"Winter is Coming: A Southern Hemisphere Perspective of the Environmental Drivers of SARS-CoV-2 and the Potential Seasonality of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 broke out in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to other province of China and other countries. To understand epidemic characteristics, guidelines and policiesof COVID-19 compared to SARS, and further explore the gap of health system facing with major outbreaks for improvement in China. Methods: : A systematic review was performed using China academic literature (CNKI), Wan Fang, PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv,offical website of World Health Organization, National Health Commission of the Peoples Republic of China, the Hubei Province Health Commission, and Wuhan City Health Commission for literature of epidemiological and clinical characteristics, guidelines an policies of COVID-19 and SARS from 2003 to 2020. Two dataset were obtained from the National Health Commission's open data information, and daily SARS epidemic section authorized by the State Council\`s Information Office. Results: : The 113 related studies finally entered final analysis, among which 63 were Chinese articles. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) caused outbreak in 2002 and 2019 in China called SARS and 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Both belong to Beta Coronavirus (-CoV). Their original cluster confirmed cases had contact history to wild animals, and clinical symptoms are similar. However, COVID-19 has a high human-to-human transmission capability, and more rapidly spread from Hubei province (97.9% cases) across China and over the world. R0 was estimated around 2.2 (1.4-3.8), and incubation period of COVID-19 is 1-14 days. Transmission routes predominantly have respiratory droplets, close contact and even air transmission by aerosols. A fatality rate was 2.70% (2004/74185) with the highest of 14.8% at over 80 years old, and cases mainly were males in the middle and elder ages. For prevention and control, strategies and policies consecutively were issued. Compared to those of SARS, responsiveness for COVID-19 is more prompt. Policy priorities tend to multi-sectors of cooperation, strong action to cut off source of infection (sealed Wuhan city),strengthening community prevention and mental health. Conclusions: : The major gap facing with epidemic outbreak exists in the weak health system especially public health system, although we already made a great progress and improvement in our preventive awareness. Therefore, we forcefully appeal to a strong public health system by government for continuous investment and improvement. An advanced public health system stands by us in times of peace, and while fights for us during epidemic outbreak period.","output":"The epidemic characteristics, guidelines and policies: A compared analysis of literature between COVID-19 and SARS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 causes an infection called COVID-19 which is caused by a new Coronavirus.

Since the beginning of the development of rapid autopsy, the overriding organizing principle for all RAPs has been that the samples or organs must be removed and processed as rapidly as possible. To accomplish this some rapid autopsy programs are focused just on one tumor type, while others accept patients demonstrating all tumor types and sometimes other diseases as well. RAPs are logistically complicated and labor-intensive structures, therefore, the key to their success is program flexibility and maintaining a multidisciplinary focus. The necessary collaborations in the complex relationships between clinicians and researchers can be broken down into a series of thought and action steps that must be understood, accepted, and practiced by all participants. A crucial part of the pre-case steps (prior to death) for a rapid autopsy is the study consenting process. It is extremely important that this individualized consent is obtained for postmortem specimens and that it is written in general enough terms to be used for patients with all types of diseases and for an appropriate range of future research uses. The advent of Sars-CoV-2/COVID-19 has presented new challenges and opportunities to the field of autopsy pathology. Guidelines and practice had to be created and adapted to protect physicians and staff while maximizing diagnostic yield. However, any autopsy performed on a patient dying of or with COVID-19 represents a unique opportunity to contribute to understanding of disease mechanisms and to improve death certification, thus assisting in both clinical care and the development of health public policy.","output":"Rapid Autopsy Programs and Research Support: The Pre- and Post-COVID-19 Environments."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been more than 3 months now since the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Turkey.

The aim of this article was to describe a novel device to contain aerosol within a small localized environment around the operative field-the negative pressure assisted microenvironment surgical hood (NEPA-MESH). METHODS: This device can be assembled using easily available materials-steel wires, image intensifier cover, surgical drape, and three-dimensional-printed self-locking copolyester double hoops. Large-bore pipes in continuity with a high-volume suction apparatus create a constant negative pressure microenvironment around the operative field. The CEM DT-9880 particle counter was used to estimate particle concentration inside the NEPA-MESH during various stages of a neurosurgical procedure as well as outside. The NEPA-MESH was tested in different craniotomies and endoscopic procedures. RESULTS: Mean particle concentration inside the NEPA-MESH and outside during drilling in various procedures was calculated and compared using unpaired t test. Significant reduction in particle concentrations was recorded for particles sized 0.3 m (t = 17.55, P < 0.0001), 0.5 m (t = 11.39, P < 0.0001), 1 m (t = 6.36, P = 0.0002), 2.5 m (t = 2.04, P = 0.074), 5.0 m (t = 7.026, P = 0.0008), and 10 m (t = 4.39, P = 0.0023). CONCLUSIONS: As definitive evidence demonstrating the presence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in aerosol particles is awaited, we describe a cost-effective strategy to reduce aerosol contamination.

Given it is also one of the underlying diseases that increases the risk of complications from COVID-19, we sought to explore whether online discussions around asthma had changed since the pandemic started. METHODS: Data were collected using social listening tools provided by Synthesio, an Ipsos company, to aggregate all online mentions of the word asthma across social media platforms, excluding retweets, from December 2019 until November 2020 in the US. Topics most associated with the word asthma were tracked over time. RESULTS: From Dec 2019 to Feb 2020, there were a total of 38.1K mentions of asthma, with no specific topic particularly associated with the keyword. Asthma mentions increased by 53% in the first week of March 2020. The trend continued for three weeks and the highest traction was recorded on the third week of March at 18.1K mentions. During this period, 40% of the asthma mentions were associated with the keywords coronavirus/COVID-19, higher than the average number of mentions associated with other topics. The number of mentions of asthma together with coronavirus/COVID-19 increased 359%, from 1.5K in the first week, to 7K in the second week of March 2020. From June 2020 to August 2020, mentions of asthma were lower than in the preceding three months, but several spikes occurred throughout June and July 2020 (fourth week of June, 9.5K;first and second week of July, 9.6K and 10K). The increased traction was found to be associated with an increase in mentions of the word mask. On the fourth week of June, the number of mentions of asthma + mask increased by 157% compared to the previous week (1.7K to 4.3K). Mask was the keyword most associated with asthma for five weeks in a row, before decreasing over time. The number of asthma mentions from Sep 2020 to Nov 2020 continued to decline, but remained higher than pre-pandemic levels. A small peak is found during the third and fourth weeks of September, associating asthma with mask (3.2K mentions) and symptom(s) (2.7K mentions). CONCLUSION: Online discussions around asthma increased dramatically at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and continue to remain high.

METHODS: Excess mortality due to COVID-19 was estimated directly based on various data sources, and indirectly, based on the difference between the observed and expected number of deaths from serious acute respiratory infection (SARI) and all natural causes in 2020 had there been no COVID-19. The absence of laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 was adjusted based on the proportion of those who tested positive among the tested individuals whose death was attributed to COVID-19.

Opportunities for education and workforce development in the field of social work are essential to strengthening Indigenous communities. Indigenous students must often move outside of their communities to pursue masters-level social work degrees, decreasing their opportunity to practice skills within these communities during required masters-level practica.

Using the method, we demonstrate that sequence dissimilar but functionally similar antibodies can be found across the Coronavirus Antibody Database, with high accuracy (92% of antibodies in multiple-occupancy structural clusters bind to consistent domains). Our approach functionally links antibodies with distinct genetic lineages, species origins, and coronavirus specificities. This indicates greater convergence exists in the immune responses to coronaviruses than is suggested by sequence-based approaches.

It is therefore critical for infant health to characterize breast milk. The aim of this study was to determine the intra- and inter-day variation of elements in breast milk, for which there is currently limited information, as a pilot study for a larger study. Firstly, we developed a simple and robust analytical method for the determination of multiple elements in breast milk. It was accurate (accuracy ranged from 98% to 107%) for measurement of 26 elements in breast milk by quadrupole inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Intra- and inter-day variation of elements, protein, and fat in breast milk was determined by analyzing breast milk collected from 11 women at 12 sampling points over three days and calculating intraclass correlation coefficients. Intraclass correlation coefficients showed that while some elements were consistent across time points (e.g., Sr, Ca, and Cu), others showed very high variability (e.g., As, Cd, and Ni). Correlation analyses between elements in breast milk showed strong relationships between those including Fe and Mo, Ca and Sr, and Cd and Fe.","output":"Intra- and Inter-Day Element Variability in Human Breast Milk: Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to establish which of sitting height (SH) and total height (Ht) is most appropriately used in the scaling of adult body mass (BM), waist circumference (WC), and forced vital capacity (FVC), considering likely explanations and proposing a suitable index for each. METHODS: Data were from the US Third National Health and Nutrition Survey for white and black American women and men aged 20 to 50 years. Statistical analysis involved mainly correlation coefficients, the multiple regression of BM, WC, or FVC on SH and leg length (LL), and fitting of allometric regression equations relating each of BM, WC, and FVC to SH or Ht. RESULTS: BM and WC correlated more strongly with SH than with Ht, and FVC correlated more strongly with Ht. Associations with LL were negative for WC, negative or nonsignificant for BM, and positive for FVC. Using round-number exponents for Ht and SH, the allometric relationships indicated that appropriate indices are BM/SH3 , WC/SH, and FVC/Ht2 . CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to usual practice, BM and WC are better scaled in relation to SH than to Ht. FVC is slightly better scaled in relation to Ht, as is conventional. Interpretations involve the small influence of LL on BM and the influence both of gluteo-femoral fatness on measured SH and of childhood health and nutrition on adult LL, WC, and FVC.

However, recommendations for conducting pathology-based observational studies are not readily available. In part 1 of this series, we offer advice on planning and conducting an observational study with examples from the veterinary pathology literature. Investigators should recognize the importance of creativity, insight, and innovation in devising studies that solve problems and fill important gaps in knowledge. Studies should focus on specific and testable hypotheses, questions, or objectives. The methodology is developed to support these goals. We consider the merits and limitations of different types of analytic and descriptive studies, as well as of prospective vs retrospective enrollment. Investigators should define clear inclusion and exclusion criteria and select adequate numbers of study subjects, including careful selection of the most appropriate controls. Studies of causality must consider the temporal relationships between variables and the advantages of measuring incident cases rather than prevalent cases. Investigators must consider unique aspects of studies based on archived laboratory case material and take particular care to consider and mitigate the potential for selection bias and information bias.

Efforts to improve this achieved moderate results. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the extent to which demographic and cultural factors, the media, trust, perceptions, and government policies influence the willingness of Arabs to be vaccinated against COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among Israeli Arabs (558 respondents). The questionnaire was distributed through social networks between January 16 and 26, 2021. The t-tests, Chi-square tests, Z tests, which were used to evaluate the significance of variables, and Pearson correlations calculated for the study variables were used for statistical analysis. Hierarchical logistic regression was calculated to assess the extent of background influence on the odds for vaccination, and mediation was examined using the Process procedure. RESULTS: Moderate means were found for attitudes towards vaccination, vulnerability, vaccine effectiveness, and pandemic fatigue. A lower score was found for accessibility to medical services, social norms, and emotional barriers. Trust was highest in health-related authorities, whereas trust in government and the media was the lowest. Higher pandemic fatigue was associated with lower trust and lower odds for vaccination. DISCUSSION: Lack of awareness of the specific needs of the Arab minority in Israel, lack of vaccination campaigns in Arabic language, long neglect of Arabs in the Israeli health system, mistrust of governmental authorities by the Arabs, and low socioeconomic background of Israeli Arabs might have led to lower trust levels and incompliance with governmental policies among Arabs. Addressing these issues may benefit the entire population.

While such objective and subjective factors are usually tested in isolation with simple stimuli in the lab, here we examined the perceived passage of time in the ecology of daily social life: crowded public transit. Higher crowding level denotes a higher numerosity along with increased negative affect. Accordingly, we hypothesized that crowding lengthens subjective trip duration. Participants (N=41) experienced short (between 1 to 2 minutes) immersive subway trips using Virtual Reality (VR). Each individual experienced multiple virtual trips with different crowding levels. After each trip, they were asked to estimate the trip duration and rate its affective pleasantness. Presence of one additional person per square meter of the train significantly increased perceived travel time by an average of 1.8 seconds. Rather than objective factors, this effect was mediated by subjective negative feelings induced by crowding. Analysis of cardiac data also revealed the slope of change in heart rate during a trip as a physiological source of perceived travel time, independent of the crowding level. This study is an example of bringing basic psychological and physiological findings into an ecologically valid setting using VR technology.

To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we construct a biased COVID-19 vs. bacterial pneumonia dataset based on CT protocols and compare with existing state-of-the-art de-biasing methods.

The patients underwent a balloon occlusion test (BOT) in various modifications before stationary occlusion of the carrier artery. For vascular occlusion, we used detachable latex balloon catheters (33 cases) and microcoils (17 cases). The condition of patients in the pre- and postoperative period was assessed by using the modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS There were no deaths due to occlusion of the internal carotid artery (37 patients). Postoperative complications occurred in 5 patients. On the basis of BOT, revascularization surgery involving placement of an extra-intracranial microanastomosis (EICMA) was performed in 6 cases. In more 4 cases, EICMA was placed in the early postoperative period due to developing signs of ischemia. Two of 7 patients underwent occlusion of both vertebral arteries (VAs) in the vertebrobasilar basin, which led to fatal outcomes. One more patient died of aggravation of brainstem compression after VA occlusion. There was no worsening of neurological symptoms among survivors. There were no deaths and persistent neurological disorders upon occlusion of branches of the main cerebral arteries, starting with the first order arteries (6 patients). Thirty one patients (66%) were followed-up in the period from 1 to 104 months. There were no deaths associated with artery occlusion. Two patients experienced delayed ischemic disorders. CONCLUSION Occlusion of the carrier artery should be performed in a carefully selected group of BOT-negative patients.

Liverpool Football Club is a leading soccer club from England, and it has experienced a major revival in terms of sporting success and financial performance in recent years. The clubs emphasis on data analytics and AI only contributed to this impressive evolution when it was complemented with the emotional intelligence and people skills of its present manager Juergen Klopp. Along with new conceptual arguments, this example of integrated intelligence offers important insights for managers and executives in companies from many industries C far beyond sports management.Originality/valueThe conceptual arguments and case example illustrate that the competitive benefits of implementing standardized AI solutions in an isolated way will often be relatively limited. Many AI solutions will be standardized in the near future, and they may easily be applied by many firms. Thus, even those companies that are considered as AI pioneers may not be able to sustain their competitive advantage unless they develop an integrated intelligence architecture, which combines human and AI. This integration of data analytics and AI with the human intelligence and expertise of a firms employees offers the basis for a sustainable advantage because it is difficult to match for competitors.

This is mainly due to uncertainty of failure mode when the beam is subjected to bending and boundary constraints. Many analytical solutions are available for pure-shear tests when beams are subjected to thermo-mechanical loads;however, only few studies are available when plated beams are subjected to bending. This paper presents a simple approach to study the combined effects of temperature dependent parameters and thermo-mechanical loads on debonding mechanism, interfacial stress-distribution, development of bond-length and load of debonding. First-order closed-form solutions are proposed to address two possible cases of simply supported beam: roller-ended or pin-ended. Proposed solutions also introduce temperature effects (as thermal strains) within the interfacial adhesive to fill the gap in literature;this is useful to relate the effect of glass-transition point of adhesive with the composite action. The analytical observations are validated with focussed experiments and literature, and verified with continuum-discrete FE model;leading to parametric investigations and key observations. Effects of temperature are defined in terms of reverse- and inverse-actions.","output":"Towards progressive debonding in composite RC beams subjected to thermo-mechanical bending with boundary constraints-A new analytical solution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Government policy can add to the costs of doing international business.

Data on transcatheter stenting of SPS is limited. We sought to evaluate feasibility, safety and outcomes of stenting SPS. METHODS Retrospective review of all patients who underwent transcatheter SPS stenting from 1/2006 to 12/2013. RESULTS Of 229 surgically implanted SPS, 25 transcatheter stent interventions were performed in 22 patients. The majority had pulmonary atresia (n = 9) or HLHS (n = 10). Their median age was 4 ms (range 10 days to 4 years) and median weight 4.9 kg (range 3-14). Nine had a central and 15 had a BT shunt with a median shunt size of 3.75 mm (range 3-6). The interval from shunt placement to intervention was 1.9 ms (range 4 days-3.8 years). The indication for intervention was increasing cyanosis in10 patients and delaying final repair in 9. Two patients were on ECMO at the time of intervention. The median shunt diameter increased from 2.3 to 4.1 mm and oxygen saturation from 72 to 85% (P < 0.001). No intra-procedural complications were encountered. One patient died from aspiration (autopsy demonstrated a patent shunt), 13 progressed to repair or next stage, 6 remain palliated with shunts as they are deemed unfit for the next stage and 2 are awaiting surgery. CONCLUSIONS Stenting of systemic to pulmonary artery shunt is a safe and effective procedure and avoids surgical re-intervention. It can be performed both as a rescue procedure in patients with acute shunt occlusion and as an elective procedure to palliate patients not yet suitable for subsequent corrective or staged repair.","output":"Transcatheter stenting of the systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt: A 7-year experience from a single tertiary center."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) attaches to the host cell surface to initiate the interaction between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its spike glycoprotein (S) and the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme (hACE2) receptor. SARS-CoV-1 mutates frequently because of its RNA genome, which challenges the antiviral development. Here, we per-formed computational saturation mutagenesis of the S protein of SARS-CoV-1 to identify the residues crucial for its functions. We used the structure-based energy calculations to analyze the effects of the missense mutations on the SARS-CoV-1 S stability and the binding affinity with hACE2. The sequence and structure alignment showed similarities between the S proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, we found that target mutations of S protein amino acids generate similar effects on their stabilities between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. For example, G839W of SARS-CoV-1 corresponds to G857W of SARS-CoV-2, which decrease the stability of their S glycoproteins. The viral mutation analysis of the two different SARS-CoV-1 isolates showed that mutations, T487S and L472P, weakened the S-hACE2 binding of the 2003C2004 SARS-CoV-1 isolate. In addition, the mutations of L472P and F360S destabilized the 2003C2004 viral isolate. We further predicted that many mutations on N-linked glycosylation sites would increase the stability of the S glycoprotein.

It has been the story so far for the MSMEs in India. Three events that changed the business scenario include the implementation of demonetization & GST and the pandemic-related restrictions. Survival became the only viable factor for businesses. This study dwells deeper into these three events and their influence on the adoption of digitalization by MSMEs in rural India. Methodology: Responses of the rural MSME owners were collected through a structured questionnaire containing multiple-choice questions on a 5-point Likert scale. To have better clarity, responses of 274 rural MSME owners were finally considered for the data analysis. For factor analysis of the data, the process of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was adopted with the help of IBM SPSS 25.0. To find out the validity of the model, Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was performed by using IBM AMOS 21.0. Findings: It is found that the pandemic effect has the strongest significance followed by the demonetization effect on MSME owners towards the adoption of digitalization for their business. GST was implemented within a year of demonetization, so its effect is found to be non-significant. Practical Implications: The results of the study will help the government as well as IT solution providers to chalk out their strategies, products, or reforms taking into consideration the particular problems faced by MSMEs related to demonetization and pandemic closure. The outcome will also help in better implementation of the 'Vocal for Local' initiative. Originality: The results of the proposed study indicate that during all the three major events, the importance of digitalization has been witnessed by the MSMEs. These uncertain times have prioritized the use of digitalization not only for their survival but also to match the consumers' demands during those periods. This study shows the importance of digitalization and will help the cup to reach the lip and both the economy and the MSME owners will be benefitted from it.","output":"Effects of Demonetization, GST & Covid-19 Pandemic in the Adoption of Digitalization by Rural MSMEs in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines all counties in the United States that have four-year colleges and universities and compared the civic, socio-economic, and health factors of college communities compared to those without four-year institutions The data analyzed, using single factor analysis of variance, provide evidence that counties -with colleges and universities have higher levels of civic engagement and social capital, higher median incomes, and lower mid-life mortalities than counties without four-year institutions The results have implications for municipalities and counties with baccalaureate institutions The results are particularly important from a policy perspective as institutions face financial challenges from the coronavirus pandemic","output":"Colleges and Communities: A Preliminary Analysis of the Impact of Four-Year Colleges and Universities on Communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The usage of face masks has been mandated in many countries in an attempt to diminish the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

The unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on global health has resulted in multiple studies generating extensive gene expression datasets in a relatively short period of time. In order to better understand the immune dysregulation induced by SARS-CoV-2, we carried out a meta-analysis of these transcriptomics data available in the published literature. Datasets included both those available from SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines in vitro and those from patient samples. We focused our analysis on the identification of viral perturbed host functions as captured by co-expressed gene module analysis. Transcriptomics data from lung biopsies and nasopharyngeal samples, as opposed to those available from other clinical samples and infected cell lines, provided key signatures on the role of the hosts immune response on COVID-19 pathogenesis. For example, severity of infection and patients age are linked to the absence of stimulation of the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, a known critical immediate line of defense against RNA viral infections that triggers type-I interferon responses. In addition, co-expression analysis of age-stratified transcriptional data provided evidence that signatures of key immune response pathways are perturbed in older COVID-19 patients. In particular, dysregulation of antigen-presenting components, down-regulation of cell cycle mechanisms and signatures of hyper-enriched monocytes were strongly correlated with the age of older individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, our meta-analysis highlights the ability of transcriptomics and gene-module analysis of aggregated datasets to aid our improved understanding of the host-specific disease mechanisms underpinning COVID-19.","output":"Meta-analysis of virus-induced host gene expression reveals unique signatures of immune dysregulation induced by SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 global outbreak has been significantly damaging the human well-being, life style of people and the global economy It is clear that the entire world is moving into a dangerous phase of this epidemic at the moment With absence of a preventive vaccine, the governments across world implement, monitor and manage various public health and social distancing measures to control the spread of this extremely contagious disease and it is found that most of these responses have been critical results of numerous mathematical and decision support models In this study, SEIR compartment structure is used to model the COVID-19 transmission in Sri Lanka Reported cases data during the first 80 days of the outbreak is used to model the time dependent transmission rate of the disease Optimal transmission rates and initial size of the exposed and infected sizes of the populations are then estimated matching between clinically identified cases to model based simulated outcomes","output":"An SIER model to estimate optimal transmission rate and initial parameters of COVD-19 dynamic in Sri Lanka"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virtual screening aims to find desirable compounds from chemical library by using computational methods.

Human activities are constantly affecting the quality of the environment and altering the ecosystems, which produce negative consequences also on human wellbeing. Within this context, it has been much discussed how cities and the built environment can counteract this process by supporting more sustainable development. Adaptive reuse is defined as a process that changes a disused or ineffective item into a new item that can be used for a different purpose, which strongly triggers the sustainable development of cities. It can be recognized as a promoter of economic growth, social wellbeing, and environmental preservation, given its capability of both preserving past values and creating new ones. The adaptive reuse matches the main points of the circular economy, seen as the sustainable economy, which is aimed at the reduction of natural resource extraction and environmental impact by extending the useful life of materials and promoting recovery, reuse, and regeneration processes. Given these premises, the current contribution aimed to evaluate alternative scenarios for reuse in Castello Visconteo in Cusago, located in the Lombardy region (Italy), and understanding how adaptive reuse could contribute to generating new values within a circular economy perspective. In detail, four alternative scenarios were proposed to face the new needs born during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic period. Since both intangible and tangible values must be considered, a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been applied by combining economic and qualitative indicators to define the most suitable function for its adaptive reuse. In detail, the Novel Approach to Imprecise Assessment and Decision Environments (NAIADE) was used to identify the best alternative solution based on the opinions of conflicting stakeholders. The innovativeness of the contribution is given by the combination of different methodologies, the preservation of the memory and the generation of new values, and the consideration of adaptive reuse as a strategy for the achievement of sustainable development within a circular economy perspective. ? 2021 by the authors.

Using antibody repertoire sequencing, we found that the usage of VH3-53 increased after SARS-CoV-2 infection. A highly shared VH3-53-J6 clonotype was identified in 9 out of 13 COVID-19 patients. This clonotype was derived from convergent gene rearrangements with few somatic hypermutations and was evolutionary conserved. We synthesized 34 repertoire-deduced novel VH3-53-J6 heavy chains and paired with a common IGKV1-9 light chain to produce recombinant mAbs. Most of these recombinant mAbs (23/34) possess RBD binding and virus neutralizing activities, and recognize ACE2 binding site via the same molecular interface. Our computational analysis, validated by laboratory experiments, revealed that VH3-53 antibodies targeting RBD are commonly present in COVID-19 patients' antibody repertoires, indicating many people have germline-like precursor sequences to rapidly generate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.

Here, we employed a loss-of-function analysis with human A549 respiratory epithelial cells with a knockout (KO) of the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR KO), either solely or together with the receptor of type III IFN (IFNAR/IFNLR1 KO). The course of rubella virus (RuV) infection on the IFNAR KO A549 cells was comparable to the control A549. However, on the IFNAR/IFNLR1 KO A549 cells, both genome replication and the synthesis of viral proteins were significantly enhanced. The generation of IFN  during RuV infection was influenced by type III IFN signaling. In contrast to IFNAR KO A549, extracellular IFN  was not detected on IFNAR/IFNLR1 KO A549. The bioenergetic profile of RuV-infected IFNAR/IFNLR1 KO A549 cells generated by extracellular flux analysis revealed a significant increase in glycolysis, whereas mitochondrial respiration was comparable between all three cell types. Moreover, the application of the glucose analogue 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) significantly increased viral protein synthesis in control A549 cells, while no effect was noted on IFNAR/IFNLR KO A549. In conclusion, we identified a positive signaling circuit of type III IFN signaling on the generation of IFN  during RuV infection and an IFN signaling-dependent contribution of glycolysis to RuV infection.

Platelets are important regulators of thrombosis, but their involvement in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine their functional and biochemical profile in patients with COVID-19 in dependence of mortality within 5-days after hospitalization. Methods: The COVID-19-related platelet phenotype was examined by analyzing their basal activation state via integrin IIb3 activation using flow cytometry and the proteome by unbiased two-dimensional differential in-gel fluorescence electrophoresis. In total we monitored 98 surviving and 12 non-surviving COVID-19 patients over 5 days of hospital stay and compared them to healthy controls (n = 12). Results: Over the observation period the level of basal IIb3 activation on platelets from non-surviving COVID-19 patients decreased compared to survivors. In line with this finding, proteomic analysis revealed a decrease in the total amount of integrin IIb (ITGA2B), a subunit of IIb3, in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls; the decline was even more pronounced for the non-survivors. Consumption of the fibrin-stabilizing factor coagulation factor XIIIA (F13A1) was higher in platelets from COVID-19 patients and tended to be higher in non-survivors; plasma concentrations of the latter also differed significantly. Depending on COVID-19 disease status and mortality, increased amounts of annexin A5 (ANXA5), eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-I (EIF4A1), and transaldolase (TALDO1) were found in the platelet proteome and also correlated with the nasopharyngeal viral load. Dysregulation of these proteins may play a role for virus replication. ANXA5 has also been identified as an autoantigen of the antiphospholipid syndrome, which is common in COVID-19 patients. Finally, the levels of two different protein disulfide isomerases, P4HB and PDIA6, which support thrombosis, were increased in the platelets of COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Platelets from COVID-19 patients showed significant changes in the activation phenotype, in the processing of the final coagulation factor F13A1 and the phospholipid-binding protein ANXA5 compared to healthy subjects. Additionally, these results demonstrate specific alterations in platelets during COVID-19, which are significantly linked to fatal outcome.","output":"Platelet Phenotype Analysis of COVID-19 Patients Reveals Progressive Changes in the Activation of Integrin IIb3, F13A1, the SARS-CoV-2 Target EIF4A1 and Annexin A5"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cryptosporidium spp. are worldwide protozoan parasites which include species that can lead to cryptosporidiosis in humans. Different animal species can serve as reservoirs and sources of dissemination of the disease, such as rodent species due their potential in transmitting zoonotic pathogens to humans and other animals. In the Canary Islands (Spain), Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium hominis have been identified in patients with diarrhea. However, the occurrence of Cryptosporidium spp. in possible reservoirs in this archipelago remains unclear. Considering the zoonotic potential of these protozoans, the aim of the present study was to determine the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. in peridomestic wild rodents and the possible role of these mammals as a source of transmission of these protozoans in Canary Islands. METHODS: A total of 179 rodents belonging to Rattus rattus and Mus musculus domesticus from four Canary Islands, La Palma, El Hierro, Tenerife and Lanzarote, were analyzed. Feces were screened for Cryptosporidium spp. by nested PCR of the 18S ribosomal RNA fragment and the sequences used for phylogenetic analyses. RESULTS: Cryptosporidium spp. were found widely distributed with an overall prevalence of 12.30% in rodents (13.86% for R. rattus and 10.25% for M. m. domesticus). The overall prevalence by island was 19.60% for Tenerife, 7.14% for La Palma, 5.71% for El Hierro and 0% for Lanzarote. Cryptosporidium tyzzeri, Cryptosporidium meleagridis, Cryptosporidium muris and Cryptosporidium sp. rat genotype I and II/III were successfully identified, in addition to two unidentified Cryptosporidium genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the knowledge of the biodiversity and distribution of Cryptosporidium spp. in wild rodents from the Canary Islands, highlighting the presence of three zoonotic species, C. tyzzeri, C. meleagridis and C. muris, being the first detection of these three species in wild rodents in the Canary Islands and the first report of C. meleagridis in R. rattus.

To investigate the impact of residential heating activities on atmospheric particles, the chemical composition, size distribution, and evolution process of single particles collected during the wintertime of 2019 were investigated using a single-particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS). The results showed that the concentrations of four air pollutants including PM2.5, SO2, NO2, and CO during the heating period were 1.1-1.2 times higher than those before the heating period largely due to the increase of pollutant emissions from coal combustion, while O-3 concentration during the heating period decreased by 40.2%.

The acidity of single particles was calculated by the relative acidity ratio (R-ra), which increased from 36.1 +/- 13.9 before the heating period to 64.8 +/- 43.9 during the heating period, implying that the single particles were more acidic and less aged during the heating period, mainly due to the enhanced formation of sulfate and nitrate and the decreased O-3 concentration during the heating period.

In the present systematic review, we evaluated how many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted on critically ill patients and reporting a benefit on survival reported also data on QoL. All RCTs investigating nonsurgical interventions that significantly reduced mortality in critically ill patients were searched on MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus and Embase from inception until August 2021. In a second stage, for all the included studies, the outcome QoL was investigated. The primary outcome was to evaluate how many RCTs analyzing interventions reducing mortality reported also data on QoL. The secondary endpoint was to investigate if QoL resulted improved, worsened or not modified. Data on QoL were reported as evaluated outcome in 7 of the 239 studies (2.9%). The tools to evaluate QoL and QoL time points were heterogeneous. Four interventions showed a significant impact on QoL: Two interventions improved survival and QoL (pravastatin in subarachnoid hemorrhage, dexmedetomidine in elderly patients after noncardiac surgery), while two interventions reduced mortality but negatively influenced QoL (caloric restriction in patients with refeeding syndrome and systematic ICU admission in elderly patients).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 104 patients with ALD were examined: 15 (14.4%) with liver steatosis (LS), 19 (18.3%) with steatohepatitis and 70 (67.3%) with liver cirrhosis (LC); men 50 (48.1%), women 54 (51.9%); age 45.78.4 years. Traditional clinical, laboratory, instrumental studies were performed, the levels of fragments of cytokeratin-18 (FCK-18), cytokines IL-1, TNF-, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 were determined by ELISA. The control group consisted of 39 healthy individuals: men 20 (51.2%), women 19 (48.7%), age 48.58.3 years. RESULTS: In LS, an increase in the level of FCK-18 was noted with normal aminotransferase activity, the content of TNF-, IL-6, IL-1, IL-8 increased and the level of IL-4 decreased compared to those in healthy individuals. In steatohepatitis, a triple increase in aminotransferases and FCK-18 was observed compared with LS, as well as an increase in the level of inflammatory mediators, to a greater extent IL-6, to a lesser extent IL-8, TNF-, a decrease in IL-4, IL-1 remained at the same level. In LC, there was a further increase in FCK-18, significantly more pronounced than an increase in AST, and the increase in cytokines continued to the same extent, the levels of IL-6 and IL-8, to a lesser extent IL-1 and TNF-, and the level of IL-4. CONCLUSION: With the progression of ALD from LS to steatohepatitis, hepatic cell damage was carried out by equally pronounced processes of hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis, with the development of cirrhosis of the liver, parenchyma damage occurred mainly due to hepatocyte apoptosis. The immuno-inflammatory process progressively increased from the stage of LS to LC with IL-6 and IL-8 undergoing the greatest dynamics. FCK-18 can serve as a non-invasive marker of hepatic cell damage, and IL-6 and IL-8 markers of immune inflammation in ALD.","output":"[Hepatocellular damage and inflammation in various forms of alcoholic liver disease]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ICU patients typically are given large amounts of fluid and often develop oedema. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the oedema would change inter-electrode resistance and, thus, require a different approach to using non-invasive electrical stimulation of nerves to assess muscle force. Inter-electrode tissue resistance in the lower leg was measured by applying a 300 s constant current pulse and measuring the current through and voltage across the stimulating electrodes. The protocol was administered to nine ICU patients with oedema, eight surgical patients without oedema and eight healthy controls. No significant difference in inter-electrode resistance was found between the three groups. For all groups, resistance decreased as stimulation current increased. In conclusion, inter-electrode resistance in ICU patients with severe oedema is the same as the resistance in regular surgical patients and healthy controls. This means that non-invasive nerve stimulation devices do not need to be designed to accommodate different resistances when used with oedema patients; however, surface stimulation does require higher current levels with oedema patients because of the increased distance between the skin surface and the targeted nerve or muscle.","output":"Inter-electrode tissue resistance is not affected by tissue oedema when electrically stimulating the lower limb of sepsis patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization (WHO) upgraded the status of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak from epidemic to global pandemic on March 11, 2020.

There is a lack of studies to address the QoL of nursing students and its relationship with their academic achievement motivation in Iran. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate this relationship. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a correlational study conducted with baccalaureate nursing students of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran, from December 2019 to February 2020. Data collection tools consisted of three parts: a demographic questionnaire, the World Health Organization QoL-Brief Questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF), and the Hermans Achievement Motivation Questionnaire. Pearson correlation coefficient and standard multiple regression were used to evaluate the correlation between QoL mean domain scores and academic achievement motivation score. RESULTS: The QoL mean (SD) domain scores of physical, psychological, social, environmental, and academic achievement motivation score were 14.95 (2.43), 13.42 (2.74), 13.96 (3.39), 13.62 (2.54), and 84.40 (7.73), respectively. Pearson correlations between physical, psychological, social, and environmental QoL mean domain scores with academic achievement motivation score was 0.30, 0.35, 0.12, and 0.22 (p < 0.05), respectively. Using standard multiple regression, psychological mean domain score (? = 0.31) was the only statistically significant predictor of academic achievement motivation.

Two divergent hypotheses have been proposed: hyperinflammatory cytokine storm; and failure of host protective immunity that results in unrestrained viral dissemination and organ injury. A key explanation for the inability to address this controversy has been the lack of diagnostic tools to evaluate immune function in COVID-19 infections. ELISpot, a highly sensitive, functional immunoassay, was employed in 27 patients with COVID-19, 51 patients with sepsis, 18 critically ill nonseptic (CINS) patients, and 27 healthy control volunteers to evaluate adaptive and innate immune status by quantitating T cell IFN- and monocyte TFN-&#945; production. Circulating T cell subsets were profoundly reduced in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, stimulated blood mononuclear cells produced less than 40%-50% of the IFN- and TNF-&#945; observed in septic and CINS patients, consistent with markedly impaired immune effector cell function. Approximately 25% of COVID-19 patients had increased IL-6 levels that were not associated with elevations in other canonical proinflammatory cytokines. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that COVID-19 suppresses host functional adaptive and innate immunity. Importantly, IL-7 administered ex vivo restored T cell IFN- production in COVID-19 patients. Thus, ELISpot may functionally characterize host immunity in COVID-19 and inform prospective therapies.","output":"Severe immunosuppression and not a cytokine storm characterizes COVID-19 infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heterologous immunity (H.I.) is a consequence of an encounter with a specific antigen, which can alter the subsequent immune response to a different antigen.

This study describes the epidemiology and the outcome of major trauma patients admitted to centers in France during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included all consecutive trauma patients aged 15 years and older admitted into 15 centers contributing to the TraumaBase? registry during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France. This COVID-19 trauma cohort was compared to historical cohorts (2017-2019). RESULTS: Over a 4 years-study period, 5762 patients were admitted between the first week of February and mid-June. This cohort was split between patients admitted during the first 2020 pandemic wave in France (pandemic period, 1314 patients) and those admitted during the corresponding period in the three previous years (2017-2019, 4448 patients). Trauma patient demographics changed substantially during the pandemic especially during the lockdown period, with an observed reduction in both the absolute numbers and proportion exposed to road traffic accidents and subsequently admitted to traumacenters (348 annually 2017-2019 [55.4% of trauma admissions] vs 143 [36.8%] in 2020 p < 0.005). The in-hospital observed mortality and predicted mortality during the pandemic period were not different compared to the non-pandemic years. CONCLUSIONS: During this first wave of COVID-19 in France, and more specifically during lockdown there was a significant reduction of patients admitted to designated trauma centers. Despite the reallocation and reorganization of medical resources this reduction prevented the saturation of the trauma rescue chain and has allowed maintaining a high quality of care for trauma patients.","output":"Impact of the SARS-COV-2 outbreak on epidemiology and management of major traumain France: a registry-based study (the COVITRAUMA study)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Material development based on fungal mycelium is a fast-rising field of study as researchers, industry, and society actively search for new sustainable materials to address contemporary material challenges.

Reports have shown increased rates of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) provider infection with COVID-19 after patient care exposure, especially while utilizing aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs). Given the increased risk and rising call volumes for AGP-necessitating complaints, development of novel devices for the protection of EMS clinicians is of great importance.Drawn from the concept of the powered air purifying respirator (PAPR), the AerosolVE helmet creates a personal negative pressure space to contain aerosolized infectious particles produced by patients, making the cabin of an EMS vehicle safer for providers. The helmet was developed initially for use in hospitals and could be of significant use in the prehospital setting. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of the helmet in mitigating simulated infectious particle spread in varied EMS transport platforms during AGP utilization. METHODS: Fifteen healthy volunteers were enrolled and distributed amongst three EMS vehicles: a ground ambulance, a medical helicopter, and a medical jet. Sodium chloride particles were used to simulate infectious particles, and particle counts were obtained in numerous locations close to the helmet and around the patient compartment. Counts near the helmet were compared to ambient air with and without use of AGPs (non-rebreather mask [NRB], continuous positive airway pressure mask [CPAP], and high-flow nasal cannula [HFNC]). RESULTS: Without the helmet fan on, the particle generator alone and with all AGPs produced particle counts inside the helmet significantly higher than ambient particle counts. With the fan on, there was no significant difference in particle counts around the helmet compared to baseline ambient particle counts. Particle counts at the filter exit averaged less than one despite markedly higher particle counts inside the helmet. CONCLUSION: Given the risk to EMS providers by communicable respiratory diseases, development of devices to improve safety while still enabling use of respiratory therapies is of paramount importance. The AerosolVE helmet demonstrated efficacy in creating a negative pressure environment and provided significant filtration of simulated respiratory droplets, thus making the confined space of transport vehicles potentially safer for EMS personnel.","output":"Novel Negative Pressure Helmet Reduces Aerosolized Particles in a Simulated Prehospital Setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic can be referred to as a life-threatening war where every country is fighting with an invisible untold enemy Realizing the disease severity and managing the prevention is crucial in current situations Hence, it is time to follow the lockdown protocol until the situation improves worldwide METHOD We have searched all the possible validated resources such as WHO, governmental data-sharing portal, news media, blogs, and existing empirical studies We identified the significant inputs from social media platforms provided by healthcare entrepreneurs, clinicians, and interrelated different domain experts Here we qualitatively narrated an in-depth understanding of the phenomena and proposed a few steps to deal with the mental burden in developing country context RESULT There must be some effective strategy to reduce the mental burden and availability of the health consultancy services continuously to deal with such vulnerable situations Telehealth is one such solution in a developed country where the healthcare system is well equipped to offer such services CONCLUSIONS Here, we have presented a few proposed steps that can be adapted/practiced dealing with a similar situation in developing and densely populated nation like India This approach may help to deal with such emergencies and challenges for healthcare management in lockdown conditions ? 2020 Australasian College of Health Service Management All rights reserved","output":"CAN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES HANDLE the MENTAL BURDEN DUE to the LOCKDOWN SITUATION?

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of two hemostatic agents: bone wax (BW) and a water-soluble polymer wax, Ostene (WSW), on the mechanical and histologic characteristics of healing sternal bone. METHODS Twenty-four pigs underwent sternotomy and were randomized into three groups: WSW, BW, or no hemostatic treatment (control). Bone samples were obtained 6 weeks postoperatively. RESULTS Fracture strength (Fmax) and maximum stiffness (dF/dx) was lower in the BW group than in controls (Fmax: 175.2 vs. 255.8 N, dF/dx: 165.2 vs. 375.4 N/mm,) (p < 0.05). The stiffness did not differ statistically between the WSW and BW groups (298.4 vs 165.2 N/mm) nor did the fracture strength (211.4 vs 175.2 N).

The heterogeneity (I2 77.1%; p < 0.001) was decreased when we included the study quality and the method of calculation used as moderator variables (I2 0%). The mean incubation period ranged from 5.2 (95% CI 4.4 to 5.9) to 6.65 days (95% CI 6.0 to 7.2). CONCLUSIONS: This work provides additional evidence of incubation period for COVID-19 and showed that it is prudent not to dismiss the possibility of incubation periods up to 14 days at this stage of the epidemic.","output":"The incubation period during the pandemic of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) are a rare group of life-threatening hematological conditions characterized by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.

In our study, we aim to investigate the relationship between the liver enzymes on admission (AST, ALT, ALP, GGT) and severity of COVID-19. We evaluated course of disease, hospital stay, liver damage and mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 614 patients who were hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 between 03.16.20 and 05.12.20. Patients with liver disease, hematological and solid organ malignancy with liver metastases were excluded, resulting in 554 patients who met our inclusion criteria. We retrospectively evaluated liver transaminase levels, AST/ALT ratio, cholestatic enzyme levels and R ratio during hospital admission and these were compared in terms of morbidity, mortality and clinical course. RESULTS: Mean age of 554 subjects were 66.2115.45 years, 328 (59.2%) were men. The mean values of liver enzymes on admission were AST (36.233.6U/L), ALT (34.0149.34U/L), ALP (78.846.86U/L), GGT (46.2560.05U/L). Mortality rate and need for intensive care unit were statistically significant in subjects that had high ALT-AST levels during their admission to the hospital (p=0.001). According to the ROC analysis AST/ALT ratio was a good marker of mortality risk (AUC=0.713: p=0.001) and expected probability of intensive care unit admission (AUC=0.636: p=0.001). R ratio, which was used to evaluate prognosis, showed a poor prognosis rate of 26.5% in the cholestatic injury group, 36.1% in the mixed pattern group and 30% in the hepato-cellular injury group (p 0.001).

As the worlds largest industry, tourism has many related industries and is a strong driver of energy consumption. The emission reductions it can achieve will directly determine whether Chinas overall carbon emission reduction target can be met. This paper analyzes the drivers of the evolution of carbon emissions from the tourism industry in China over the period 2000C2017 as a research sample using the Generalized Dividing Index Method (GDIM), and on this basis, it uses scenario analysis and Monte Carlo simulation to predict the carbon peak in tourism for the first time. The research results show that the scale of industry and energy consumption are the key factors leading to increased tourism carbon emissions, and the carbon intensity of tourism industry, energy consumption carbon intensity, investment efficiency, and energy intensity are the main factors leading to reduced carbon emissions from tourism. The scale of investment and the carbon intensity of investment have a dual effect; the scenario analysis and Monte Carlo simulation used to predict peak carbon in Chinas tourism industry show that the peak carbon will occur approximately in 2030. The government needs to further guide and encourage the tourism industry to increase investment activities targeting energy conservation and emission reduction. Under the conditions of strictly implementing energy conservation and emission reduction measures and vigorous promotion of the transformation and upgrading of tourism development methods, the tourism industry will have considerable potential to reduce carbon emissions.

However, no study has assessed how social isolation and cognitive status influence misinformation regarding the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. For this reason, we sought to investigate the differences in misinformation on the current pandemic in older individuals with and without cognitive impairment and social isolation in Boston, MA (United States) and Chieti (Italy). METHOD: Data has been obtained from 49 subjects from the Boston cohort and 138 from the Italian cohort. Both healthy older adults and individuals diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Alzheimers Disease (AD) Dementia were included. Cognitive status was assessed with a telephone administered neuropsychological battery and blind MoCA. Social isolation was evaluated with the Lubben social isolation scale and misinformation with a COVID\\\\19 Misinformation Questionnaire. Associations between these variables were assessed using Pearson correlation and binary logistic regression. RESULT: 35 participants in our sample (26%) met the cutoff for social isolation. 95 subjects (70%) were cognitively impaired. Subjects that were at a higher risk of being socially isolated were more cognitively impaired (r=0.43, N=181, p<.001). Also, they were less likely to know the correct age group that is most affected by the pandemic (b =0.06; p <0.05) and were less likely to feel informed about protective measures that should be taken to avoid contracting COVID\\\\19 (r=0.24, N=181, p<.001). Subjects that were more cognitively impaired were more likely to think that the COVID\\\\19 was a bioweapon developed by a government or terrorist organization (b =0.15; p <.001) and were more likely to incorrectly think that a person could not be COVID\\\\19 positive and be asymptomatic (b =0.17; p <.01).

A cross-sectional descriptive questionnaire-based survey was answered during FebruaryNovember 2020, by licensed CPs practicing in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. The determination of the significant factors associated with the CPs views and OTC medication dispensing during pregnancy and breastfeeding was carried out using logistic regression. Among 256 respondents, dispensing medicines and referral to a physician were the predominant services provided to pregnant and lactating women. Respondents dispensed medications mostly to treat headache (74.2%), fever (62.5%) in pregnant women, and headache (81.3%) and fever (65.2%) in lactating mothers. Referral to a physician was common in pregnant women in the following cases: varicose veins (72.7%), swelling of the feet and legs (71.9%), and vaginal itching (53.9%). In breastfeeding women, the referrals were commonly for varicose veins (79.7%), swelling of the feet and legs (73.0%) and mastitis (70.3%). Most participants came to an agreement that CPs are capable of counselling and providing pregnant and lactating women the best OTC treatment. Around 35% of the respondents stated that OTC medicines are not safe to be used during pregnancy. One in five respondents stated that OTC medicines are not safe for breastfeeding women. CPs were confident to counsel and provide advice to pregnant and breastfeeding women to address medication and health problems.

Unfortunately our understanding of the therapeutic benefit of combining surgery with different treatment modalities including promising immunotherapeutics is limited by the current lack of easily adopted surgical models. The purpose of this study was to develop a surgically resectable model of PDAC in immunocompetent mice for use in preclinical investigations. Materials and Methods Surgically resectable orthotopic tumors were generated by injecting Pan02 cells into the tail of the pancreas. Fifteen days post implantation the primary tumors and tail of the pancreas were resected by laparotomy while preserving the spleen. Splenic function, tumor growth, immune phenotyping and survival were assessed following surgical resection of the primary tumor mass. Results As expected orthotopic tumor implants recapitulated many of the major histological hallmarks of PDAC including disrupted lobular structure and vascular invasion. Preservation of splenic immune cell viability and function was not associated with improved survival following surgery alone. However, pre-operative vaccination with GVAX was associated with improved survival which was not impacted by surgery. Conclusion This represents the first murine model of surgically resectable murine model of PDAC which recapitulates known pathological hallmarks of human disease in an immune competent model while allowing spleen preservation. This relatively simple and easily adopted approach provides an ideal platform to examine the efficacy of potential immunotherapy combinations for PDAC surgery patients.","output":"An easily adopted murine model of distal pancreatectomy for investigating immunotherapy efficacy in resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a group of patients with microsatellite-unstable tumors, pembrolizumab led to longer progression-free survival and was less toxic than standard chemotherapy see Original Article, N Engl J Med 2020;383:2207-2218 Effect of Finerenone on Chronic Kidney Disease Outcomes In this double-blind trial, patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to receive the nonsteroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone or placebo A detailed investigation identified person-to-person transmission that was driven by three symptomatic persons see Original Article, N Engl J Med 2020;383:2230-2241 Malaria Chemoprophylaxis in Sub-Saharan Africa In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial in children younger than 5 years of age with severe anemia in an area in which malaria is endemic, dihydroartemisininCpiperaquine administered after hospital discharge resulted in a lower incidence of readmission or death in the 3 months after discharge than placebo see Original Article, N Engl J Med 2020;383:2242-2254 Cytokine Storm Cytokine storm, a life-threatening disorder involving cytokine elevations and immune-cell hyperactivation, has various causes and is characterized by constitutional symptoms, systemic inflammation, and multiorgan dysfunction [ ]addressing obesity and other major health threats in concert could enable more effective solutions see Perspective, N Engl J Med 2020;383:2197-2200 The Bottom of the Health Care Rationing Iceberg Here I was, trying to do a perfect job allocating a handful of mechanical ventilators for an unprecedented viral pandemic, while every day the entire health care system fails utterly to fairly allocate all kinds of health care to an enormous number of vulnerable people see Perspective, N Engl J Med 2020;383:2200-2201 When Will We Have a Vaccine?

CHIKF is associated with immunopathology and high levels of pro-inflammatory factors. CHIKV is known to have a wide range of tropism in human cell types, including keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, monocytes, and macrophages. Previously, we reported that CHIKV-infected monocytes-derived macrophages (MDMs) express high levels of interleukin 27 (IL27), a heterodimeric cytokine consisting of IL27p28 and EBI3 subunits, that triggers JAK-STAT signaling and promotes pro-inflammatory and antiviral response, in interferon (IFN)-independent manner. Based on the transcriptomic analysis, we now report that induction of IL27-dependent pro-inflammatory and antiviral response in CHIKV-infected MDMs relies on two signaling pathways: an early signal dependent on recognition of CHIKV-PAMPs by TLR1/2-MyD88 to activate NF-B-complex that induces the expression of EBI3 mRNA; and second signaling dependent on the recognition of intermediates of CHIKV replication (such as dsRNA) by TLR3-TRIF, to activate IRF1 and the induction of IL27p28 mRNA expression. Both signaling pathways were required to produce a functional IL27 protein involved in the induction of ISGs, including antiviral proteins, cytokines, CC- and CXC- chemokines in an IFN-independent manner in MDMs. Furthermore, we reported that activation of TLR4 by LPS, both in human MDMs and murine BMDM, results in the induction of both subunits of IL27 that trigger strong IL27-dependent pro-inflammatory and antiviral response independent of IFNs signaling.

Applying the predictive model in the external validation cohort of 755 patients, the c-index was 0.75 (0.71-0.79) and the lift in the top quintile was 2.1. At a sensitivity of 80%, the specificity was 56%, negative predictive value 92%, and positive predictive value 30%. Equivalent model performance was observed in subsamples stratified by age, sex, race, need for critical care and care at community vs. academic hospitals. Conclusion: Machine learning applied to electronic health records available at the time of inpatient admission can be used to risk-stratify patients with coronavirus disease 2019 for incident delirium. Delirium is common among patients with coronavirus disease 2019, and resource constraints during a pandemic demand careful attention to the optimal application of predictive models.","output":"Development and External Validation of a Delirium Prediction Model for Hospitalized Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increase in the incidence of a new coronavirus infection has a significant impact on global health systems, shifting the vector of the COVID-19 pandemic in the direction of maximum conservation of resources Aim of the study is to summarize and analyze available data on the organization of treatment and surgical care for patients in the urology profile in the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic Material and methods Materials published in the English-language literature were analyzed, which were searched in the Cochrane Library's, MEDLINE (PubMed, BioMedNet), Scopus and Biosis databases The following keywords were used: \\"COVID-19\\", \\"pandemic\\", \\"epidemic\\", \\"treatment of COVID-19 patients\\", \\"COVID-19 surgery\\" and \\"urology during a pandemic\\" Results and discussion Given the rapidly developing and difficult to predict scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic, existing global recommendations are sometimes temporary in nature, which must be adapted \\"individually\\" taking into account certain features of the modern health system, the rapidly changing epidemiological situation and the emergence of new clinical research data  ٧ѧҧݧ֧ӧѧ֧ާ ߧӧ ܧߧѧӧڧߧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ֧ ܧѧ٧ӧѧ֧ ֧ӧ֧ߧߧ ӧݧڧߧڧ ߧ ާڧӧ ڧ֧ާ ٧էѧӧѧߧ֧ߧڧ, ާ֧ѧ ӧ֧ܧ ҧҧ  ѧߧէ֧ާڧ֧ COVID-19  ߧ ާѧܧڧާѧݧߧԧ ѧߧ֧ߧڧ ֧ ֧ݧ ڧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ - ާާڧӧѧߧڧ  ѧߧѧݧڧ ڧާ֧ڧ էѧߧߧ  ԧѧߧڧ٧ѧڧ ݧ֧֧ߧڧ  ܧѧ٧ѧߧڧ ڧԧڧ֧ܧ ާ ѧڧ֧ߧѧ  ڧݧ ?ݧԧڧ?  ݧӧڧ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ COVID-19 ѧ֧ڧѧ  ާ֧է ѧߧѧݧڧ٧ڧӧѧߧ ާѧ֧ڧѧݧ, ҧݧڧܧӧѧߧߧ  ѧߧԧݧ٧ߧ ݧڧ֧ѧ, ڧ ܧ ӧ֧է֧  ҧѧ٧ѧ էѧߧߧ Cochrane Library's, MEDLINE (PubMed, BioMedNet), Scopus  Biosis, ڧݧ٧ӧѧߧ ܧݧ֧ӧ ݧӧ: ?COVID-19?, ?ѧߧէ֧ާڧ?, ?ڧէ֧ާڧ?, ?ݧ֧֧ߧڧ ѧڧ֧ߧ  COVID-19?, ?ڧԧڧ COVID-19?  ?ݧԧڧ ӧ ӧ֧ާ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ? ֧٧ݧѧ  ҧاէ֧ߧڧ ڧӧѧ ҧ ѧ٧ӧڧӧѧڧۧ  ݧاߧ ԧߧ٧ڧ֧ާ ֧ߧѧڧ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ COVID-19, ֧ӧڧ ާڧӧ ֧ܧާ֧ߧէѧڧ էѧ ߧ ӧ֧ާ֧ߧߧ ѧѧܧ֧, ڧ ѧէѧѧڧ էݧاߧ ڧէڧ ڧߧէڧӧڧէѧݧߧ,  ֧ ֧ ڧݧ ڧߧ ӧ٧ާاߧ֧ ӧ֧ާ֧ߧߧ ڧ֧ާ ٧էѧӧѧߧ֧ߧڧ, ֧ާڧ֧ݧߧ ڧ٧ާ֧ߧ֧ۧ ڧէ֧ާڧݧԧڧ֧ܧ ҧѧߧӧܧ  ӧݧ֧ߧڧ ߧӧ էѧߧߧ ܧݧڧߧڧ֧ܧڧ ڧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ","output":"Surgical care for adults on \\"urology\\" in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To determine Washington University (WU) polyomavirus strains circulating among hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections (RTI) in Kuwait.

The VP2 gene from WU virus (WUV)-positive samples was sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS Of the 459 hospitalized RTI patients, 18 (3.9%) patients were positive for WUV infection. WUV infection was common among children aged 11 years (9 patients, 50%). Among the 18 WUV-infected hospitalized patients, viral co-infection was detected in 9 patients (50%). The most common viruses associated with mixed infection were respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus (2 patients, 11.1% each). Of the 18 WUV-infected patients, 4 were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. The circulating strains belong to type Ia and IIIb.

The objective of this study was to analyse the efficacy of telemedicine (by telephone) in monitoring patients in a coloproctology unit, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Prospective descriptive study of consecutive patients in a single centre. The result of the teleconsultation was classified as discharge, resolved visit or reprogramming and was analysed by different diagnostic groups. RESULTS: From March 19th to April 17th, 2020, the teleconsultation of 190 patients was carried out. The response rate was 94.2% (179). The diagnostic categories of the patients attended were: 51 (26.9%) colorectal neoplasia, 48 (25.3%) proctological pathology, 72 (37.9%) pelvic floor dysfunctions and 19 (10%) other benign pathologies. 105 (55.26%) could be recited as if they had come in person. Eleven (5.8%) patients were discharged. No significant differences were found between the different diagnostic categories and the resolution of the teleconsultation. The reasons for reprogramming are analyzed in the study. CONCLUSION: In the context of a pandemic, teleconsultation has allowed 61% of follow-up visits to be definitively solved, avoiding the reprogramming of 116 patients. The new social and health paradigm after the pandemic will require a rethinking of our healthcare model, and in many aspects, telemedicine can offer tools for this.","output":"Teleconsulta en una unidad de coloproctologa durante la pandemia de COVID-19.

Heart transplantation and ventricular assist device (VAD) support represent the only available lifelines for end stage disease. In the context of donor organ shortage, the future role of VAD as destination therapy is emerging. Yet, major drawbacks are connected to the long-term implantation of current devices. Poor VAD hemocompatibility exposes the patient to life-threatening events, including haemorrhagic syndromes and thrombosis. Here, we introduce a new concept of artificial support, the Hybrid Membrane VAD, as a first-of-its-kind pump prototype enabling physiological blood propulsion through the cyclic actuation of a hyperelastic membrane, enabling the protection from the thrombogenic interaction between blood and the implant materials. The centre of the luminal membrane surface displays a rationally-developed surface topography interfering with flow to support a living endothelium. The precast cell layer survives to a range of dynamically changing pump actuating conditions i.e., actuation frequency from 1 to 4 Hz, stroke volume from 12 to 30 mL, and support duration up to 313 min, which are tested both in vitro and in vivo, ensuring the full retention of tissue integrity and connectivity under challenging conditions.

This study aimed to estimate incidence of SARS-Cov-2 infection in a cohort of MS patients living in the Lazio region and to identify the risk factors for the infection. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed based on regional health administrative databases linked to the new integrated surveillance system of SARS-CoV-2 infection. MS patients residing in Lazio region and aged 18 years on 31 December 2019 were enrolled and followed-up to 31 March 2021. Age- and gender-standardised incidence ratios (SIR) was calculated to compare the infection rate of MS cases with that of the regional general population. A large number of socio-demographic and clinical variables were explored as potential risk factors using a multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: In the Lazio region lived 10,248 individuals affected by MS (mean age 49.212.9; 32.2% males; 67.8% females). During the follow-up period the overall incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 5.0% (n = 510), 5.2% and 4.8% among males and females, respectively. An overall SIR of 0.92 (95%CI 0.84-1.00) was estimated, and 0.97 (95%CI 0.83-1.12) and 0.89 (95%CI 0.80-0.99) for males and females, respectively. The multivariable logistic regression model identified the use of antidiabetic drugs as unique predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR = 1.69; 95%CI 1.19-2.40). No association with any DMT was observed. CONCLUSIONS: No difference was observed in the incidence of SARS CoV-2 infection in MS patients compared with the general population. DMT does not seem to affect the risk of infection, while the higher incidence in individuals using antidiabetics could reflect the higher prevalence of diabetic population in infected people. KEY MESSAGES: This study supports previous research suggesting that the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in MS population does not seem to be higher than that in the general population.

Findings: The findings suggest that both Tunisia Islamic and conventional stock markets are highly persistent;however, the conventional stock index showed a negative return spillover on the Islamic stocks during the pandemic. The conventional stock index has also shown a higher exposure to risk for a lower amount of return, and evidence of potential diversification benefit between both indexes was found during the pandemic, whereas the Islamic market showed a positive leverage effect, indicating a positive correlation between past return and future return;the conventional index implied a negative leverage effect.

Our aim is to analyse the outcomes of emergency surgery before against those during COVID-19. METHOD: Retrospectively we collected the emergency admissions to the general surgery department at a district general hospital during November 2019, which is a representative of our regular activity, and April 2020, the height of the COVID-19. The primary endpoint was the number and nature of surgical admissions and procedures. The secondary endpoints were morbidities and mortalities, laparoscopic and procedure approach (laparoscopic vs open), inflammatory markers (white cell count and C-reactive protein), hospital stay, gender and age. RESULTS: During the two months a total of 332 patients were admitted; 177 during November 2019 and 146 patients during April 2020. The mean age was 51 years in the November group and 49 years in the April group. 146 operations were conducted in November, while 117 procedures were performed in April. Hospital stay average was 5.87 days and 5.43 days for November and April groups, respectively. In the April group, seven patients tested positive for COVID-19. Mortality was slightly higher during April (2.05%) than November (1.6%). Postoperative complications, C-reactive protein level and prevalence of acute cholecystitis were much higher during April, while abscess and diverticulitis prevalence were significantly lower. CONCLUSIONS: Morbidity, mortality and acute cholecystitis were significantly higher during the COVID-19 pandemic, while abscess and diverticulitis were significantly less prevalent likely due to and tendency by patients to avoid hospitals and hence late clinical presentation.","output":"579 Emergency Surgical Admissions During The COVID-19 Pandemic; Comparative Study of Emergency Surgery Outcome Before and During The COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A variety of serological tests have been developed to detect the presence of antibodies against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Additionally, 22 sera were included to detect potential cross-reactivity. Test characteristics were determined for the 18 assays. In >14 days samples, the Vircell IgG and Wantai Ig ELISAs had superior sensitivity compared to the other ELISAs (96%). Furthermore, the Roche Ig, the Epitope Diagnostics IgM, Wantai IgM, Euroimmun IgG, and IgA all showed a specificity of 100%. The POCTs of Boson Biotech and ACRO Biotech showed the highest sensitivities: 100% and 96% (83.5-99.8), respectively.

History of malignancy was obtained from regional population-based cancer registries. Cancer-patients were distinguished by time between cancer diagnosis and SARS-CoV-2 testing (<12/?12 months). Comorbidities, hospitalization, and death at 15 September 2020 were retrieved from regional population-based databases. The impact of cancer history on SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical outcomes was calculated by fitting a multivariable logistic regression model, adjusting for sex, age, and comorbidities. RESULTS Among 552,362 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, 55,206 (10.0%) were cancer-patients and 22,564 (4.1%) tested CoV2+ve. Irrespective of time since cancer diagnosis, SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly lower among cancer patients (1,787; 3.2%) than non-cancer individuals (20,777; 4.2% - Odds Ratio (OR)=0.60; 0.57-0.63).

Objective: To estimate the association of age with the likelihood of developing symptoms and the association of age with the likelihood of progressing to critical illness after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study analyzed quarantined case contacts, identified between February 20 and April 16, 2020, in the Lombardy region of Italy. Contacts were monitored daily for symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, by either real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using nasopharyngeal swabs or retrospectively via IgG serological assays. Close contacts of individuals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were selected as those belonging to clusters (ie, groups of contacts associated with an index case) where all individuals were followed up for symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data were analyzed from February to June 2020. Exposure: Close contact with individuals with confirmed COVID-19 cases as identified by contact tracing operations. Main Outcomes and Measures: Age-specific estimates of the risk of developing respiratory symptoms or fever greater than or equal to 37.5 C and of experiencing critical disease (defined as requiring intensive care or resulting in death) in SARS-CoV-2-infected case contacts. Results: In total, 5484 case contacts (median [interquartile range] age, 50 [30-61] years; 3086 female contacts [56.3%]) were analyzed, 2824 of whom (51.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (median [interquartile range] age, 53 [34-64] years; 1604 female contacts [56.8%]). The proportion of infected persons who developed symptoms ranged from 18.1% (95% CI, 13.9%-22.9%) among participants younger than 20 years to 64.6% (95% CI, 56.6%-72.0%) for those aged 80 years or older. Most infected contacts (1948 of 2824 individuals [69.0%]) did not develop respiratory symptoms or fever greater than or equal to 37.5 C. Only 26.1% (95% CI, 24.1%-28.2%) of infected individuals younger than 60 years developed respiratory symptoms or fever greater than or equal to 37.5 C; among infected participants older than 60 years, 6.6% (95% CI, 5.1%-8.3%) developed critical disease. Female patients were 52.7% (95% CI, 24.4%-70.7%) less likely than male patients to develop critical disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions and Relevance: In this Italian cohort study of close contacts of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, more than one-half of individuals tested positive for the virus. However, most infected individuals did not develop respiratory symptoms or fever.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is more frequent and more severe in comorbid elderly patients, especially those with hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or cardiovascular diseases. There are concerns regarding the use of RAAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19. Some physicians have considered the need for interrupting RAAS inhibition in order to reduce the possibility of SARS-CoV2 entering lung cells after binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. We offer a different point of view in relation to the need for continuing to use RAAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19. We focused our article on elderly patients because of the distinctive imbalance between the immune response, which is depressed, and the exacerbated inflammatory response, inflammaging, which makes the geriatric patient an appropriate candidate for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the inflammatory response. Indeed, COVID-19 is an inflammatory storm that starts and worsens during the course of the disease. During the COVID-19 pandemic, various therapeutic approaches have been tested, including antiviral drugs, interferon, anti-interleukins, hydroxychloroquine, anti-inflammatories, immunoglobulins from recovered patients, and heparins. Some of these therapeutic approaches did not prove to be beneficial, or even induced serious complications.

There is some data suggesting that ACE-2 expression by AECs is greater in adults than children, leading many to hypothesize that airway ACE-2 expression is a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 replication and COVID-19 disease. Aim: Determine whether expression of ACE-2 and/or TMPRSS2 by bronchial AECs from children and adults is associated with SARS CoV2 replication. Methods: Primary bronchial AECs from children and adults (n=18;ages 8-75 yrs.) were differentiated ex vivo at an air-liquid interface to generate organotypic cultures. In a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility, cultures were infected with SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. At 96 hrs. following infection, RNA and protein were isolated from cultures. SARS-CoV-2 replication in cultures was assessed by PCR, and quantified as viral copy number/ng RNA. ACE-2 expression was assessed by qPCR in both SARS-CoV-2 infected AEC cultures and uninfected control cultures. In a subset of subjects (n=6), ACE-2 expression was measured in paired nasal and bronchial AEC cultures. Finally, we assessed the effect of apical treatment of AEC cultures with recombinant ACE-2 (rACE-2) prior to SARS-CoV-2 and once daily for 96rs. Results: In the primary bronchial AECs studied we observed marked between subject heterogeneity in ACE-2 expression (14-fold), TMPRSS2 expression (8-fold), and SARS-CoV-2 replication (range 167-89,040 copies/ng RNA). Baseline ACE-2 expression in uninfected AECs correlated with SARS-CoV-2 replication in infected AECs (Spearman r=0.6, p=0.02), whereas TMPRSS2 expression was not associated with viral replication (r=-0.2, p=0.5). In paired nasal and bronchial AEC cultures ACE-2 expression was strongly correlated (Pearson R2=0.66, p=0.05). Treatment of AECs with rACE-2 added apically immediately prior to infection and refreshed daily for 96 hrs. across a range of concentrations (0.1-1000 ng/mL rACE in 100L of PBS;n=4 AEC primary lines) led to a marked reduction in SARS-CoV-2 replication (mean of 5040 viral copies/ng RNA in untreated AECs to 16 viral copies/ng RNA at 10ng/mL). Conclusion: Expression of ACE-2 by primary bronchial AECs from children and adults is heterogenous, and is associated with SARS-CoV-2 replication ex vivo. ACE-2 expression by AECs may partially explain the between subject variability in the risk and severity of COVID-19.","output":"Relationship between ace2 and TMPRR2 expression by differentiated primary bronchial airway epithelial cells and sarscov2 replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 after emerging in China has caused a global pandemic that is risking the lives of millions.

This decision was based on the results of the MD Anderson randomized study showing significantly lower rates of the Total Toxicity Burden (TTB), especially of postoperative toxicity and consequently decreased hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay. The TTB combines a large range of toxicities with different incidence rates and severities into a single sum score. For patient selection, we used a model-based approach (MBA) using a model for TTB (>60). The aim of this study was to investigate if the post-operative TTB decreased with PT. Materials and Methods In accordance with the MBA, a plan comparison (photon vs proton radiotherapy (RT)) was performed in all EC patients that were to be treated with neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) according to the CROSS regimen. For patient selection, we developed a normal tissue complication probability (NTCP)-model for a TTB > 60, which corresponds to at least one grade > III or 2 grade > II complications. Patients, who were eligible for PT in terms of target motion (<15 mm), and with a ANCTP >5%, were selected and treated with PT. Postoperative TTB and hospital and ICU stay were compared with a prospective dataset of patients that were treated with photon RT between 2014 and 2018 (n=224). Results Since March 2020, 26 out of 32 patients were selected for PT. The average reduction in mean lung dose was 5.2 Gy with PT compared to VMAT, with a corresponding average NTCP-reduction for TTB of 9.7%. Mean heart, spleen and liver dose were reduced by 7.9, 7.4 and 7.1 Gy, respectively. At the time of analyses, 14 out of 19 patients underwent esophagectomy. Three patients developed intercurrent metastases, in one a wait and see policy was applied and one switched to definitive CRT. In the resected PT patients, the expected proportion of patients with a TTB>60 was 29.7% for photon and 20.8% for proton RT. After resection, only one out of 14 patients (7.1%) had an TTB>60 ((p=0.051), compared to the expected proportion based on the photon plans). On average, the observed post-operative TTB was 15 (SEM: 6) after PT, compared to the historical photon cohort in which the observed post-operative TTB was 45 (SEM: 5). Hospital and ICU stay were also reduced by PT compared to the photon cohort;12.7 (SEM 1.4) vs. 20.0 (SEM 1.2) and 1.9 days (SEM 0.4) vs. 4.9 (SEM 0.6), resulting in an average cost reduction of about 10,000 euro per patient. Follow up will continuously be updated in our dynamic database. Conclusion In the neo-adjuvant setting, the first results indicate that proton-based nCRT reduces the post-operative TTB compared to historic photon-based nCRT.

Materials and Methods We retrospectively analyzed antibody levels and seroconversion rates in serum samples from 135 cancer patients who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chemiluminescent immunoassay using Roche Cobas e801 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) was performed to identify Pan Ig antibody against nucleocapsid antigen. Reports of first, third, and sixth month were analyzed. Seroconversion was also compared with health-care workers (HCW) of our institute who had recovered from COVID-19 infection. Results Seroconversion rate in cancer patients was 81.2% at 1 month, 95% at 3 months, and 94.6% at 6 months post reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction positivity. There was no difference in seroconversion rate among different age groups, gender, comorbidities, severity of COVID-19 symptoms, cancer disease status, and treatment with chemotherapy.

We report here identification of a glycoprotein from filarial parasite, a homologue of mammalian Heat Shock Protein 70 with immunostimulatory attributes. The purified native glycoprotein designated as FHSP70 and its recombinant protein moiety, WFL were found to be TLR2 and TLR4 agonists in vitro in human myeloid cells and induce systemic inflammatory cytokines in vivo.

Among various approaches supraclavicular approach is the most consistent method for anaesthesia and postoperative pain management in surgery below the elbow joint. Many drugs are used as adjuvants in brachial plexus block for faster onset, denser block and for prolongation of postoperative analgesia. Dexmedetomidine also has been shown to prolong the sensory and motor duration when added as an adjuvant to local anaesthetic in nerve blocks. Objective To assess the effect of adding dexmedetomidine to ropivacaine in brachial block. Method Sixty patients, planned for upper limb surgeries under ultrasound guided brachial block were randomly allocated into two groups. Group RS (n=30) received 30 ml of 0.5% Ropivacaine + 1 ml Normal Saline and Group RD (n=30) received 30 ml of 0.5% Ropivacaine + 0.75 mcg/kg Dexmedetomidine diluted to 1 ml solution. The onset time to sensory and motor blockade were recorded. The duration of sensory and motor block and duration of analgesia were recorded. Result The mean time to onset of sensory block (12.602.67 min Vs 22.172.81 min) and motor block (14.203.22 min Vs 22.533.97) in Group RD was significantly faster in Group RD than Group RS.

Additionally, the current COVID-19 pandemic has placed substantial limitations on surgical training worldwide. Contact free, remote, web-based, validated learning tools which are easily accessible and allows repeated, sustained practice are the need of the hour. Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) have been used extensively to train pilots and military personnel and has shown excellent early results within orthopaedic training. We designed a femoral nailing CTA tool which showed objective benefits in the enhancement of cognitive knowledge in medical students. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this CTA tool to enhance practical skills in orthopaedic trainees in a real time interactive simulation setting (Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS)). METHODS: This was a double blinded, randomized controlled trial. 14 junior orthopaedic residents who met the inclusion criteria were recruited in the study. They were randomized into two equal groups. The intervention group were given the CTA learning tool, the control group were given a standard operative technique manual used for antegrade femoral intramedullary nailing. The participants were assessed on a high-fidelity phantom femur model with actual femoral nailing instruments in a simulation mobile operating theatre where the candidate had a simulation patient, an acting anesthetist and a scrub nurse (DIS). They were assessed using the modified Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) rating scale which has been validated for orthopaedic trauma. RESULTS: The median OSATS score in the intervention group was 49 (4.93, range 39-55) compared to 17 in the control group (14.98, range 12-51). The median improvement was by 32 points (p = 0.02).

The research used data from the national information system on hospitalizations from the Clinical Hospital Center Split, University Hospital Split. The indicators were statistically analyzed. The z-score test for two population proportions is used. RESULTS: In 2020, there was a significantly higher in-hospital mortality compared to 2019 (z = 9.0827; p < 0.00001), which was supported by a significant increase in mortality from respiratory diseases according to the comparison of disease categories of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) (z = 9.0427; p < 0.00001). Within hospital departments, significantly higher mortality was in the Intensive Care Unit (z = 5.2763; p < 0.00001) and the Infectious Diseases Department (z = 9.6982; p < 0.00001).

Indias relatively young age structure tends to conceal the severity of Covid-19 mortality, which is concentrated in older age groups. In this paper, we present four different demographic samples of Indian populations for which we have information on both their demographic structures and death outcomes. We show that we can model the age gradient of Covid-19 mortality in India and use this modeling for estimating the level of Covid-19 mortality in the country. Our findings point to a death toll of about 2.2 million persons by late May 2021. Once Indias age structure is taken into account, these figures correspond to one of the most severe cases of Covid-19 mortality in the world. BackgroundIndia has recorded after February a second outbreak of coronavirus that has affected the entire country. The accuracy of official statistics of Covid-19 mortality has been called in question and the real number of Covid-19 deaths is thought to be several times higher than reported. In this paper, we assembled four independent population samples to model and estimate the level of Covid-19 mortality in India. MethodsWe first used a first population sample with age and sex of Covid-19 victims to develop a Gompertz model of Covid-19 mortality in India. We applied and adjusted this mortality model on two other national population samples after factoring in the demographic characteristics of these samples. We finally derive from one of these samples the most reasonable estimate of Covid-19 mortality level in India and confirm this result with the use of a fourth population sample. FindingsOur findings point to a death toll of about 2.2 million persons by late May 2021. This is the largest number of Covid-19 deaths in the world. Once standardized for its age and sex structure, Indias Covid-19 mortality rate is above that of Brazil or the USA. InterpretationOur analysis shows that existing population samples allow for an alternative estimation of deaths due to Covid-19 in India. The results confirm that only one out 7 Covid-19 deaths appear to be registered in India. The estimates point to a very Covid-19 mortality rate, which is even higher after age and sex standardization. The magnitude of the pandemic in India requires immediate attention and calls for a strong response based on a combination of non-pharmaceutical interventions and the scale-up of vaccination to make them accessible to all, with an improved surveillance system to monitor the progression of the pandemic.","output":"Estimating the death toll of the Covid-19 pandemic in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many people live under stressful conditions which has an adverse effect on their health.

Within this context, the ability of pain specialists to accurately diagnose and plan appropriate interventional spine procedures based entirely on telemedicine visits, without an in-person evaluation, remains to be established. In this study, our primary objective was to assess the relevance of telemedicine to interventional spine procedure planning by determining whether procedure plans established solely from virtual visits changed following in-person evaluation. METHODS We reviewed virtual and in-person clinical encounters from our academic health system's 10 interventional spine specialists. We included patients who were seen exclusively via telemedicine encounters and indicated for an interventional procedure with documented procedural plans. Virtual plans were then compared with the actual procedures performed following in-person evaluation. Demographic data as well as the type and extent of physical examination performed by the interventional spine specialist were also recorded. RESULTS Of the 87 new patients included, the mean age was 60 years (SE 1.4 years) and the preprocedural plan established by telemedicine, primarily videoconferencing, did not change for 76 individuals (87%; 95% CI 0.79 to 0.94) following in-person evaluation. Based on the size of our sample, interventional procedures indicated solely during telemedicine encounters may be accurate in 79%-94% of cases in the broader population. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that telemedicine evaluations are a generally accurate means of preprocedural assessment and development of interventional spine procedure plans.

In respect to its potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties, the drug has demonstrated superior ex vivo efficacy compared to other host-directed agents and remdesivir, and it might retain its antiviral effect against the more transmittable B.1.1.7 variant.

This study aims to describe the variations in the environmental pollutants (CO, NO(2), SO(2), PM(2.5) and PM(10)) with and without the lockdown period in the majorly hit states and provinces of the USA and China, respectively. Data during the first quarter year of 2019 and 2020 (lockdown period) was used in this study. Moreover, the effect of these pollutants on the pandemic spread was also studied. The results illustrated that the overall concentrations of CO, NO(2) and PM(2.5) were decreased by 19.28%, 36.7% and 1.10%, respectively, while PM(10) and SO(2) were increased by 27.81% and 3.81% respectively in five selected states of the USA during the lockdown period. However, in the case of chosen provinces of China, overall, the concentrations of all selected pollutants, i.e., CO, NO(2), SO(2), PM(2.5) and PM(10), were reduced by 26.53%, 38.98%, 18.36%, 17.78% and 37.85%, respectively.

The relationship between their biological activities and their positive charge, hydrophobicity, amphipathicity, and secondary structure are described.

OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we aimed to test a serial mediation model, considering rumination and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) as mediators that link intolerance of uncertainty and aggression, while controlling the confounding effect of crisis-induced health and socioeconomic stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: A total of 714 participants [533 (74.6%) females, 176 (24.7%) males, aged 18C64 years (M(age) = 25.16, SD(age) = 9.34)] completed the following self-reported scales: Aggression Scale, COVID-19 stressors checklist, Short Version of the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale, Impact of Event Scale with Modifications for COVID-19, and Ruminative Thought Style Questionnaire. RESULTS: The results revealed that there was an association between intolerance of uncertainty and aggressive behaviours. Moreover, the results of serial mediation analysis showed that intolerance of uncertainty predicts aggressive behaviours via rumination and PTSS. Besides, socioeconomic stressors are significantly associated with the level of PTSS and aggression, while health stressors are not significantly association with the level of PTSS and aggression. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide several contributions to understand the link between intolerance of uncertainty and aggressive behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic, and confirm the importance of early psychological intervention, especially for those who are more likely to ruminate and suffer from PTSS, to prevent aggression and violence in the long run.

Patients were matched between exposed and non-exposed to OAC based on age and gender in a 1:2 design. Data source is the Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP). Results: We included 11,828 (33.3%) patients previously exposed to OAC, who were matched by age and sex to 23,656 (66.7%) non-exposed to OAC. Their mean age was 79.3 and 51% were women. Anticoagulated patients had a higher risk of hospital admission (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.22-1.38), and of stroke and pulmonary embolism than non-anticoagulated (OR 2.5, 95% CI 2.04-3.06). The risk of pneumonia was not different between groups (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.95-1.26). We found a lower risk of death in patients exposed to OAC (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.93). Conclusions: OAC users in our study had more comorbidities and were older than non-users, well known risks for hospitalization being confirmed with our results. We also found in our study that OAC exposure was not associated to an increased risk in the mortality rate, although we cannot assess the effect of the interventions applied during hospital admission on the COVID-19 outcomes, as our database is a PHC database.

First and foremost, our study did only assess the risk of psychotropic  9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) without inclusion of non-psychotropic  9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA). Secondly, as this article will discuss in more detail, there is ample evidence for side effects of CBD products, not only in paediatric patients, but also in adult users of over-the-counter CBD products (including inadvertent \\"high\\" effects). Thirdly, the exposure and risk assessment was conducted using up-to-date guidelines according to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR). And finally, the current legal situation in the European Union, without approval of any hemp extract-containing product according to the Novel Food regulation, actually allows blanket statements that all such products are illegal on the market, and this indeed would imply a general ban on the use and marketing of such products as food or food ingredients until such an approval has been granted.

Despite many efforts to find some effective medicines against SARS CoV-2, no established therapeutics are available yet. The use of phytochemicals as antiviral agents provides hope against the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2. Several natural compounds were analyzed by virtual screening against six SARS CoV-2 protein targets using molecular docking simulations in the present study. More than a hundred plant-derived secondary metabolites have been docked, including alkaloids, flavonoids, coumarins, and steroids. SARS CoV-2 protein targets include Main protease (MPro), Papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Spike glycoprotein (S), Helicase (Nsp13), and E-Channel protein. Phytochemicals were evaluated by molecular docking, and MD simulations were performed using the YASARA structure using a modified genetic algorithm and AMBER03 force field. Binding energies and dissociation constants allowed the identification of potentially active compounds. Ligand-protein interactions provide an insight into the mechanism and potential of identified compounds. Glycyrrhizin and its metabolite 18-beta-glycyrrhetinic acid have shown a strong binding affinity for MPro, helicase, RdRp, spike, and E-channel proteins, while a flavonoid Baicalin also strongly binds against PLpro and RdRp.

HypoRT is a relatively widespread treatment, although the accompanying level of evidence is limited. For its part, SBRT has been used specially to overdose specific areas of the disease as a boost after radiochemotherapy. In both cases, the study of how to integrate these RT tools with chemotherapy and immunotherapy is fundamental. In addition, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic situation has sparked increased interest in hypofractionated treatments. In this review, we analyze the role of SBRT and hypoRT in the management of LA-NSCLC in accordance with current scientific evidence.

The MRI of the 3 patients showed multifocal abnormalities predominantly in the cerebral white matter, with varying involvement of the grey matter, brainstem and spinal cord. Case 1's MRI changes were consistent with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. The patients also displayed blood markers, to varying degree, of autoimmunity and hypercoagulability.

The ability of COVID-19 to cause chronic illness, sarcopenia, and physical deconditioning may be underestimated and go beyond the anticipated respiratory sequelae. Myalgia, lethargy, and anorexia are common symptoms even in mild to moderate cases and have the potential to exacerbate frailty. How this impacts on risk-stratification for patients requiring surgery for time-critical conditions, such as malignancy, requires further urgent investigation. MAIN BODY: The deleterious effect of sarcopenia and poor physical capacity are well recognised in cancer surgery. This review commentary highlights current evidence which suggests skeletal muscle as an under recognised cause of COVID-19-related functional deconditioning. The mechanisms behind this are via direct (viral induced myositis, nutritional decline, cytokine-mediated myopathy) and indirect mechanisms (social isolation, inactivity, and psychological consequences).

Then integrating the chaotic random numbers with SHA3-256 (Secure hash algorithm 3), the design of synchronized dynamic key generators (SDKGs) is completed. Continuously, we can apply the SDKGs to encrypt/decrypt streaming audio/video data. In our design, we introduce the AES CFB (Advanced encryption standard cipher feedback) encryption algorithm with SDKGs to encrypt the video/audio streaming. Then the cipher-text is transmitted to the receiver via the network public channel and it can be fully decrypted with the dynamic random keys synchronously generated at the receiver. A duplex audio/video cryptosystem is realized to illustrate the performance and feasibility of this proposed research.

Considering the relevance of bilateral trade for foreign policy and economy studies, there is a need for a renewed framework in times of extreme economic instability. As international commerce is essential for improving the countrys economy, we have examined how economic distance, population, trade percentage of GDP, exchange rate, and political changes interconnect and relate to COVID-19, influencing trade flows. This conceptual paper illustrates the likely impact of COVID-19 on international trade by exploring pandemics effects on standard trading parameters such as GDP, distance, policy stability, and population. We model the resulting shock as a multifaceted variable reflected in capital underutilization, manufacturing output decline, international trade costs inflation, production costs inflation, decrease in demand for certain services and shift from everyday needs towards activities that exclude the proximity between people, e.g., proclivity towards virtual market products. The sudden decrease in GDP and bilateral trade, as well as FDI, is amplified by further development of pandemics long-term consequences. We take COVID-19 to be a technological, financial, and policy shock significantly influencing international trade and economic development and argue that it will have a varying impact on diverse sectors and economies.

SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 to infect cells leading to a strong inflammatory response, which is most profound in patients who progress to severe Covid-19. Recent studies have begun to unravel some of the differences in the innate and adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with different degrees of disease severity. These studies have attributed the severe form of Covid-19 to a dysfunctional innate immune response, such as a delayed and/or deficient type I interferon response, coupled with an exaggerated and/or a dysfunctional adaptive immunity. Differences in T-cell (including CD4(+) T-cells, CD8(+) T-cells, T follicular helper cells, æ-T-cells, and regulatory T-cells) and B-cell (transitional cells, double-negative 2 cells, antibody-secreting cells) responses have been identified in patients with severe disease compared to mild cases. Moreover, differences in the kinetic/titer of neutralizing antibody responses have been described in severe disease, which may be confounded by antibody-dependent enhancement. Importantly, the presence of preexisting autoantibodies against type I interferon has been described as a major cause of severe/critical disease. Additionally, priorVaccine and multiple vaccine exposure, trained innate immunity, cross-reactive immunity, and serological immune imprinting may all contribute towards disease severity and outcome.

Here we propose a new likelihood-based phylogenetic framework that greatly reduces both the memory and time demand of popular maximum likelihood approaches when analysing many closely related genomes, as in the scenario of SARS-CoV-2 genome data and more generally throughout genomic epidemiology. To achieve this, we rewrite the classical Felsenstein pruning algorithm so that we can infer phylogenetic trees on at least 10 times larger datasets with higher accuracy than existing maximum likelihood methods.

The authors aimed to assess the complication rates of performing ALIF using rhBMP-2. METHODS This is a prospective study of consecutive patients who underwent ALIF performed by a single spine surgeon and a single vascular surgeon between 2009 and 2012. All patients underwent placement of a polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cage filled with rhBMP-2 and a separate anterior titanium plate. Preoperative clinical data, operative details, postoperative complications, and clinical and radiographic outcomes were recorded for all patients. Clinical outcome measures included back and leg pain visual analog scale scores, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and SF-36 Physical and Mental Component Summary (PCS and MCS) scores. Radiographic assessment of fusion was performed using high-definition CT scanning. Male patients were screened pre- and postoperatively regarding sexual dysfunction, specifically retrograde ejaculation (RE). RESULTS The study comprised 131 patients with a mean age of 45.3 years. There were 67 men (51.1%) and 64 women (48.9%). Of the 131 patients, 117 (89.3%) underwent ALIF at L5-S1, 9 (6.9%) at L4-5, and 5 (3.8%) at both L4-5 and L5-S1. The overall complication rate was 19.1% (25 of 131), with 17 patients (13.0%) experiencing minor complications and 8 (6.1%) experiencing major complications. The mean estimated blood loss per ALIF level was 115 ml. There was 1 incidence (1.5%) of RE. No significant vascular injuries occurred. No prosthesis failure occurred with the PEEK cage and separate anterior screw-plate. Back and leg pain improved 57.2% and 61.8%, respectively. The ODI improved 54.3%, with PCS and MCS scores improving 41.7% and 21.3%, respectively. Solid interbody fusion was observed in 96.9% of patients at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS Anterior lumbar interbody fusion with a vascular access surgeon and spine surgeon, using a separate cage and anterior screw-plate, provides a very robust and reliable construct with low complication rates, high fusion rates, and positive clinical outcomes, and it is cost-effective.

Covering faces with masks, due to COVID-19 regulations, may lead to difficulties in using social signals, in particular, in individuals with neurodevelopmental conditions. Daily-life social participation of individuals who were born preterm is of immense importance for their quality of life. Here we examined face tuning in individuals (aged 12.79  1.89 years) who were born preterm and exhibited signs of periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), a dominant form of brain injury in preterm birth survivors. For assessing the face sensitivity in this population, we implemented a recently developed experimental tool, a set of Face-n-Food images bordering on the style of Giuseppe Arcimboldo. The key benefit of these images is that single components do not trigger face processing. Although a coarse face schema is thought to be hardwired in the brain, former preterms exhibit substantial shortages in the face tuning not only compared with typically developing controls but also with individuals with autistic spectrum disorders. The lack of correlations between the face sensitivity and other cognitive abilities indicates that these deficits are domain-specific.

However, how these shifts affect microbial interactions and function is poorly understood. Unraveling such microbial community responses is key to understand their environmental distribution and resilience under current and future disturbances. Here, we used metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to investigate microbial community structure and transcriptional responses to prolonged ammonium deprivation and sulfide and nitric oxide toxicity stresses in a controlled bioreactor system mimicking coastal sediment conditions. Candidatus Nitrobium versatile, identified in this study as a sulfide-oxidizing denitrifier, became a rare community member upon ammonium removal. The methanotroph Ca. Methanoperedens nitroreducens showed remarkable resilience to both experimental conditions, dominating transcriptional activity of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). After the ammonium removal experiment, a novel methanotroph species that we have named Ca. Methylomirabilis tolerans outcompeted Ca. Methylomirabilis lanthanidiphila and the anaerobic ammonium oxidizer (anammox) Ca. Kuenenia stuttgartiensis outcompeted Ca. Scalindua rubra. At the end of the sulfide and nitric oxide experiment, a gammaproteobacterium affiliated to the family Thiohalobacteraceae was enriched and dominated transcriptional activity of sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase. Our results indicate that some community members could be more resilient to stresses than others in coastal ecosystems, leading to dynamic microbial community shifts and novel functional states. Methane and sulfide oxidation could be ecosystem functions preserved across the investigated disturbances, while differing nitrogen cycling pathways might be favored in response to stresses. Importance Coastal ecosystems are primary zones of biogeochemical cycling, processing inputs of nutrients both generated in situ and derived from land runoff. Microbial communities that inhabit costal sediments perform these biogeochemical reactions, but microbial responses to dynamic, periodic substrate deprivation and exposure to toxic compounds remain elusive. In this study, we sought to address this knowledge gap in a controlled bioreactor system, unraveling microbial metabolic pathways and monitoring microbial responses to stresses that might occur in costal sediments. We identified key microbial players and shifts in their abundance and transcriptional activity. Our results indicated that methanotrophs were particularly resilient to stresses, sulfide oxidizers differed in resiliency but the community maintained sulfide oxidation function across stresses, and that anaerobic ammonium oxidizing (anammox) bacteria were sensitive to substrate deprivation but could restore activity once favorable conditions were reestablished. These insights will help to understand and predict coastal ecosystem responses to future disturbances.","output":"Unraveling nitrogen, sulfur and carbon metabolic pathways and microbial community transcriptional responses to substrate deprivation and toxicity stresses in a bioreactor mimicking anoxic brackish coastal sediment conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We miscalculated identities of several genes, and the corrected Table 1 should be as follows.","output":"Erratum to: Bat origin of a new human coronavirus: there and back again"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to their higher risk of developing life-threatening COVID-19 disease, solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients have been prioritized in the vaccination programs of many countries.

DESIGN Service evaluation. SETTING Gynaecology outpatient services at a tertiary referral hospital. POPULATION Patients who received a TC during May and June 2020. METHODS Postal questionnaire combining 3 validated tools: QQ-10, Patient Enablement Index (PEI) and NHS Friends and Family Test (NHS-FFT). Quantitative data and free text responses were analysed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Responses to QQ-10, PEI and NHS-FFT. RESULTS In total, 1307 patients were contacted and 504 patients responded (39%). Most (89%) described their experience as 'Very good' or 'Good' (NHS-FFT). Positive themes from responses included 'convenience', 'effectiveness' and 'equivalent care'. QQ-10 responses demonstrated a high Value score of 79 (0-100) and a low Burden score of 15. PEI scores suggested that most patients felt better or much better able to understand and cope with their condition following TC. The majority of patients (77%) would 'Strongly' or 'Mostly agree' to a repeat TC. Regarding patient outcomes, 21% were discharged and 71% required follow-up. Menopause, fertility, and endometriosis follow-up clinic patients benefited most from TC. Gynaecology-oncology patients found TC least acceptable.

At this stage, to withhold the debris of this pandemic-experts need to know the impact of the vaccine efficacy rates, the threshold level of vaccine effectiveness and how long this pandemic may extent with vaccines that have different efficacy rates. In this article, a mathematical model study has been done on the importance of vaccination and vaccine efficiency rate during an ongoing pandemic. METHODS: We simulated a five compartment mathematical model to analyze the pandemic scenario in both California, and whole U.S. We considered four vaccines, Pfizer (95%), Moderna (94%), AstraZeneca (79%), and Johnson & Johnson (72%), which are being used rigorously to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in addition with two special cases: a vaccine with 100% efficacy rate and no vaccine under use. SARS-CoV-2 related data of California, and U.S. were used in this study. FINDINGS: Both the infection and death rates are very high in California. Our model suggests that the pandemic situation in California will be under control in the last quartile of the year 2023 if vaccination program is continued with the Pfizer vaccine. During this time, six waves may happen from the beginning of the immunization where the case fatality and recovery rates will be 1.697% and 98.30%, respectively. However, according to the considered model, this period might be extended to the mid of 2024 when vaccines with lower efficacy rates are used. On the other hand, the daily cases and deaths in the U.S. will be under control at the end of 2026 with multiple waves. Although the number of susceptible people will fall down to none in the beginning of 2027, there is less chance to stop the vaccination program if vaccinated with a vaccine other than a 100% effective vaccine or Pfizer, and at that case vaccination program must run till the mid of 2028. According to this study, the unconfirmed-infectious and infected cases will be under control at the end of 2027 and at the mid of 2028, respectively. INTERPRETATION: The more effective a vaccine is, the less people suffer from this malign infection. Vaccines which are less than 90% effective do not have notable contribution to control the pandemic besides hard immunity. Furthermore, specific groups of people are getting prioritized initially, mass vaccination and quick responses are required to control the spread of this disease.","output":"Vaccine efficacy and SARS-CoV-2 control in California and U.S. during the session 2020C2026: A modeling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid implementation of telehealth has become a hallmark of our healthcare system's response to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic Telehealth has demonstrated feasibility and efficacy in the care of older adults including vulnerable homebound populations 1, 2","output":"RESEARCHRacial and Socioeconomic Disparities in Access to Telehealth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The national COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in India, prioritized healthcare workers to be vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222). So, we aimed to ascertain the effectiveness of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine among the healthcare workers by characterizing the breakthrough infections which occurred 14 days after the second dose of the vaccine. Methods: We prospectively evaluated the Institutional Covid Vaccination Database to categorize the SARS-CoV-2 positive healthcare workers into 2 cohorts: infected vaccinated and infected unvaccinated cohort. Along with comparing the descriptive statistics of the cohorts, the relative risk (RR), relative risk reduction (RRR), and the vaccine effectiveness were calculated. The study population was compared for the significant difference by using the parametric model (binary logistic regression) for the Odds ratio and the non-parametric model (cox proportionality model) for the Hazard ratio. Results: Out of the 324 healthcare workers employed in our institution 243 (75%) were vaccinated. When 6.58% (16) of the vaccinated healthcare workers were tested positive, 43.75% (35) were infected in the unvaccinated cohort and the median time of infection in the vaccinated cohort was 65 days (range 20 - 91 days). While the cox proportionality model reveals that the age, sex, and the contact exposure status of the cohort are not significant factors for getting infected after being vaccinated, binary logistic regression proves that a significant relationship exists between the incidence of infection and the unvaccinated status (p = 0.001, OR = 4.278). Completing the two-dose of vaccination decreased the hazard of testing positive for the SARS-CoV-2 by 84.96 % when compared with the unvaccinated individuals, which is the effectiveness of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Conclusion: There is an increased risk of the third wave of COVID-19 infection in the upcoming months. So, primary infection control measures should be followed even if vaccinated, to prevent the risk of breakthrough infections.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Breakthrough Infections among the Healthcare Workers Post-Vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Vaccine in the South Indian State of Kerala."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The maintenance of SARS-Cov-2 RNA samples poses a new challenge for laboratories and researchers.

The present work is a systematic literature review (SR) aimed to assess the association of air pollution especially particulate matter pollution in the transmission and acceleration of the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The systematic literature search was performed to identify the available studies published through October 31, 2020 concerning the transmission of the disease and particulate matter air pollution in four international electronic databases. From the results of the included studies, there are suggestions that atmospheric particulate matter pollution plays a role in the SARS-CoV-2 spread, but the literature has not confirmed that it enhances the transmission although some studies have proposed that atmospheric particulate matter can operate as a virus carrier, promoting its spread. Therefore, although PM concentration alone cannot be effective in spreading the COVID-19 disease, other meteorological and environmental parameters including size of particles in ambient air, weather conditions, wind speed, relative humidity (RH) and temperature are involved. Therefore, it is necessary to consider all influencing parameters to prevent the spreading of COVID-19 disease.

OBJECTIVE: Demonstrate how expansion of ED facilities can increase efficiency of care for patients while also improving safety for clinicians, staff, and non-infected patients. METHODS: We describe development and implementation of our external ED drive-through testing sites during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected data from three external ED sites in the Atrium Health system between March 15th and April 15th, 2020. Patients were included if they were seen at one of the sites and tested for COVID-19. There were no exclusion criteria. We analyzed the data to identify any differences in patient demographics between sites. RESULTS: We saw 580 patients across the three sites, 302 of whom met criteria for COVID-19 testing. The majority of patients tested were Caucasian females. The majority who tested positive, however, were males. Thirteen patients were redirected into the hospital ED for further medical evaluation.

Pediatric oncology patients are uniquely vulnerable to infection, but whether this predisposes them to different patterns of RVIs than healthy children is unknown.

We conducted a retrospective study of children ages 1-21 with cancer presenting to the clinic and emergency department (ED) and a randomly selected subset of patients without cancer presenting to the ED who had positive nasopharyngeal viral polymerase chain reactions at our institution from 2014 to 2019. Sixty-seven cancer patients (206 RVI episodes) and 225 pediatric non-cancer patients (237 RVI episodes) were included. Human rhino/enterovirus (HRE) was the most common infection in both groups in the spring, summer, and fall. In the winter, the most common RVI was influenza in cancer patients verses respiratory syncytial virus in non-cancer patients. On age-adjusted analysis, the likelihood of detecting coronavirus in the winter, HRE in the spring and fall, and parainfluenza in the summer was significantly greater in cancer patients (OR = 2.60, 2.52, 5.73, 3.59 respectively).

Some clinical studies have shown disparities in the proportion between males and females that have more severe clinical outcomes or, subsequently, die from this disease.

We systematically reviewed the literature, identified non-randomized studies that matched predetermined selection criteria, and performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the proportion of males among four disease severity categories. Appropriate assessment strategies were implemented to assess and minimize potential biases. The results of this meta-analysis indicated that males constituted a significantly higher proportion of those who had adverse clinical outcomes and died from COVID-19. As the coronavirus spread from the East to the West, male sex remained a consistent risk factor. Our results support the establishment of the male sex as an important risk factor for this disease.

Herein, we describe its use in immunoPET to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection of three rhesus macaques. Using PET/CT imaging of macaques at different times post-SARS-CoV-2 inoculation, we track the 64Cu-labelled CR3022-F(ab)2 probe targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to study the dynamics of infection within the respiratory tract and uncover novel sites of infection. Using this method, we uncovered differences in lung pathology between infection with the WA1 isolate and the delta variant, which were readily corroborated through computed tomography scans. The 64Cu-CR3022-probe also demonstrated dynamic changes occurring between 1- and 2-weeks post-infection. Remarkably, a robust signal was seen in the male genital tract (MGT) of all three animals studied. Infection of the MGT was validated by immunofluorescence imaging of infected cells in the testicular and penile tissue and severe pathology was observed in the testes of one animal at 2-weeks post-infection. The results presented here underscore the utility of using immunoPET to study the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection to understand its pathogenicity and discover new anatomical sites of viral replication.

Each technique has its advantages and disadvantages; however, how morbidity relates to satisfaction is not well-understood. Our aim was to compare complications and patient-reported outcomes following pedicled TRAM (pTRAM), free TRAM (fTRAM), and DIEP flaps to guide flap selection. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted, and 2 independent reviewers identified comparative studies of abdominally based flaps. Data were extracted on patient characteristics, complications, and patient-reported outcomes. Meta-analyses were conducted using random effects modeling with the DerSimonian and Laird method. Results The search retrieved 5090 articles, of which 18 were included in this review. pTRAM flaps trended toward a higher risk of abdominal bulge/hernia compared with DIEP flaps, particularly in low-volume hospitals. While fTRAM flaps had a higher risk of abdominal morbidity compared with DIEP flaps, relative risk decreased when obese patients were excluded and when only muscle-sparing fTRAM flaps were compared. Muscle-sparing flaps had a higher risk of flap loss than fTRAM flaps. Compared with DIEP flaps, pTRAM flaps were associated with lower general satisfaction but comparable emotional well-being. Conclusions Our findings indicate that safety and satisfaction following abdominally based breast reconstruction depend on flap type and patient characteristics. When possible, DIEP or muscle-sparing fTRAM flaps should be performed for obese patients to decrease the risk of abdominal bulge/hernia.

Although previous studies have shown the global influence of COVID-19 on energy prices and macroeconomic indicators, very few of them examined the impact on China independently, considering the special role of China in this pandemic and economy. In this study, we investigate the impact of the pandemic on several major China energy prices using the ARIMA-GARCH model. Combined with the Value-at-Risk (VaR) theory, we further explore the market risk, which indicates an increase in the tail risk of energy price volatility and the dramatic turbulence in energy markets. In addition, a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model is developed to analyze how the main macroeconomic indicators are affected when energy prices fluctuate. According to the model results, energy price fluctuations caused by the COVID-19 have a negative impact on economic growth and inflation, with a higher contribution to the latter changes. Based on the modeling analysis results, this paper makes constructive suggestions on how to stabilize energy prices and recover the economic development in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on energy prices and main macroeconomic indicators-evidence from China's energy market"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic presents challenges for surgeons of all disciplines, including cardiologists. The volume of cardiac surgery cases has to comply with the mandatory constraints of healthcare capacities. The treatment of Covid-19-positive patients must also be considered. Unfortunately, no scientific evidence is available on this issue. Therefore, this study aimed to offer some consensus-based considerations, derived from available scientific papers, regarding the organization and performance of cardiac surgery against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: Key recommendations were extracted from recent literature concerning cardiac surgery. RESULTS?? Reducing elective cardiac procedures should be based on frequent clinical assessment of patients on the waiting list (every one or two weeks) and the current local status of the Covid-19 pandemic. Screening tests at admission for every patient are broadly recommended. Where appropriate, alternative treatment methods can be considered, including percutaneous techniques and minimally invasive surgery, if performed by experienced cardiac surgery teams. CONCLUSIONS: There is little evidence on the strategies to organize cardiac surgery in the Covid-19 pandemic. Most authors agree on reducing elective operations based on patients' clinical condition and the status of the Covid-19 pandemic. Admission screenings and the use of percutaneous or minimally invasive approaches should be preferred to reduce in-hospital stays.","output":"Literature-based considerations regarding organizing and performing cardiac surgery against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Natural products from plants exert a promising potential to act as antioxidants, antimicrobials, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic agents. Xanthohumol, a natural compound from hops, is indeed known for its anticarcinogenic properties. Xanthohumol is converted into three metabolites: isoxanthohumol (non-enzymatically) as well as 8- and 6-prenylnaringenin (enzymatically). An inverse molecular docking approach was applied to xanthohumol and its three metabolites to discern their potential protein targets. The aim of our study was to disclose the potential protein targets of xanthohumol and its metabolites in order to expound on the potential anticarcinogenic mechanisms of xanthohumol based on the found target proteins. The investigated compounds were docked into the predicted binding sites of all human protein structures from the Protein Data Bank, and the best docking poses were examined. Top scoring human protein targets with successfully docked compounds were identified, and their experimental connection with the anticarcinogenic function or cancer was investigated. The obtained results were carefully checked against the existing experimental findings from the scientific literature as well as further validated using retrospective metrics. More than half of the human protein targets of xanthohumol with the highest docking scores have already been connected with the anticarcinogenic function, and four of them (including two important representatives of the matrix metalloproteinase family, MMP-2 and MMP-9) also have a known experimental correlation with xanthohumol. Another important protein target is acyl-protein thioesterase 2, to which xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, and 6-prenylnaringenin were successfully docked with the lowest docking scores. Moreover, the results for the metabolites show that their most promising protein targets are connected with the anticarcinogenic function as well. We firmly believe that our study can help to elucidate the anticarcinogenic mechanisms of xanthohumol and its metabolites as after consumption, all four compounds can be simultaneously present in the organism.","output":"Inverse Molecular Docking Elucidating the Anticarcinogenic Potential of the Hop Natural Product Xanthohumol and Its Metabolites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought challenges for the mental health of young people. The volume, negative content and potential for misinformation within COVID-19 related news can be an additional cause of distress. This systematic review aims to synthesise the research findings on the relationship between COVID-19 news and distress in young people. METHODS: Following the PRISMA guidelines, PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases were searched on 24 April 2021 for articles that contained empirical research examining the association between COVID-19 news consumption and mental health in samples of young people with a mean age between 10 and 24 years. RESULTS: The 13 included studies involved 760,474 participants in predominantly cross-sectional studies, with data collected during COVID-19 lockdowns across seven countries. Increased consumption of COVID-19 news was associated with a decline in mental health (n = 11). The results were more consistent for news obtained on social media with variation for traditional media sources. Misinformation may further explain the relationship. LIMITATIONS: Heterogeneity across study methodologies, lack of longitudinal research and validated measures of news consumption. CONCLUSIONS: The reviewed literature supports the association between increased consumption of COVID-19 related news and decreased mental health in young people. This group may benefit from support to mitigate the psychological impacts of COVID-19 news.

The absence of a national strategy for battling the pandemic also leaves state and local governments responsible for creating their own response strategies and policies. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the content of COVID-19-related tweets posted by public health agencies in Texas and how content characteristics can predict the level of public engagement. METHODS: All COVID-19-related tweets (N=7269) posted by Texas public agencies during the first 6 months of 2020 were classified in terms of each tweet's functions (whether the tweet provides information, promotes action, or builds community), the preventative measures mentioned, and the health beliefs discussed, by using natural language processing. Hierarchical linear regressions were conducted to explore how tweet content predicted public engagement. RESULTS: The information function was the most prominent function, followed by the action or community functions. Beliefs regarding susceptibility, severity, and benefits were the most frequently covered health beliefs. Tweets that served the information or action functions were more likely to be retweeted, while tweets that served the action and community functions were more likely to be liked. Tweets that provided susceptibility information resulted in the most public engagement in terms of the number of retweets and likes. CONCLUSIONS: Public health agencies should continue to use Twitter to disseminate information, promote action, and build communities.

We assessed the impact of environmental factors (temperature, humidity and air pollution) on the global patterns of COVID-19 early outbreak dynamics during January-May 2020, controlling for several key socio-economic factors and airport connections. We showed that during the earliest phase of the global outbreak (January-March), COVID-19 growth rates were non-linearly related to climate, with fastest spread in regions with a mean temperature of ca. 5 C, and in the most polluted regions. However, environmental effects faded almost completely when considering later outbreaks, in keeping with the progressive enforcement of containment actions. Accordingly, COVID-19 growth rates consistently decreased with stringent containment actions during both early and late outbreaks. Our findings indicate that environmental drivers may have played a role in explaining the early variation among regions in disease spread. With limited policy interventions, seasonal patterns of disease spread might emerge, with temperate regions of both hemispheres being most at risk of severe outbreaks during colder months. Nevertheless, containment measures play a much stronger role and overwhelm impacts of environmental variation, highlighting the key role for policy interventions in curbing COVID-19 diffusion within a given region. If the disease will become seasonal in the next years, information on environmental drivers of COVID-19 can be integrated with epidemiological models to inform forecasting of future outbreak risks and improve management plans.","output":"Containment measures limit environmental effects on COVID-19 early outbreak dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the multidimensional risk spillovers among crude oil, the US and Chinese stock markets during the COVID-19 epidemic through a GARCHSK-Mixed Copula-CoVaR-Network method.

However, compliance with the recommendation remains poor. While several interventions have been implemented to improve early fluid administration as part of sepsis protocols, the extent to which they have improved compliance with fluid resuscitation is unknown. The factors associated with the lack of compliance are also poorly understood. METHODS We conducted a systematic review, meta-analysis and narrative review to investigate the effectiveness of interventions in emergency departments in improving compliance with early fluid administration and examine the non-interventional facilitators and barriers that may influence appropriate fluid administration in adults with sepsis. We searched MEDLINE Ovid/PubMed, Ovid EMBASE, CINAHL, and SCOPUS databases for studies of any design to April 2021. We synthesised results from the studies reporting effectiveness of interventions in a meta-analysis and conducted a narrative synthesis of studies reporting non-interventional factors. RESULTS We included 31 studies out of the 825 unique articles identified in the systematic review of which 21 were included in the meta-analysis and 11 in the narrative synthesis. In meta-analysis, interventions were associated with a 47% improvement in the rate of compliance [(Random Effects (RE) Relative Risk (RR) = 1.47, 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 1.25-1.74, p-value < 0.01)]; an average 24 min reduction in the time to fluids [RE mean difference = - 24.11(95% CI - 14.09 to - 34.14 min, p value < 0.01)], and patients receiving an additional 575 mL fluids [RE mean difference = 575.40 (95% CI 202.28-1353.08, p value < 0.01)]. The compliance rate of early fluid administration reported in the studies included in the narrative synthesis is 48% [RR = 0.48 (95% CI 0.24-0.72)]. CONCLUSION Performance improvement interventions improve compliance and time and volume of fluids administered to patients with sepsis in the emergency department. While patient-related factors such as advanced age, co-morbidities, cryptic shock were associated with poor compliance, important organisational factors such as inexperience of clinicians, overcrowding and inter-hospital transfers were also identified. A comprehensive understanding of the facilitators and barriers to early fluid administration is essential to design quality improvement projects.

In this article, we describe our ongoing simulation activities to ensure that our staff is best prepared to adapt to the challenges of COVID-19. METHODS: This is a prospective preparedness assessment and training intervention at a tertiary care academic center in Lebanon during the COVID-19 pandemic. In situ simulations followed by debriefing with good judgment occur daily involving native teams of 3 to 5 professionals in the newly established COVID intensive care unit and wards, the adult and pediatric intensive care unit and wards, and the emergency department. The simulations are assessed by the instructor using the Simulation Team Assessment Tool and by the participants using the Simulation Effectiveness Tool. Transcripts of recorded simulation debriefings are analyzed for content for latent safety threats using the SHELL Framework (Software-Hardware-Equipment-Liveware). RESULTS: In 2 weeks, we conducted 15 simulations with 106 participants and 47 observers.

Such stress is associated with increased morbidity, reduced quality of life and delayed return to work. European guidelines emphasize recognition and intervention, but evidence-based treatment options are limited and perceived as costly. The present study will test the effect of brief, group-based cognitive therapy as an adjunct to usual cardiac rehabilitation in a randomized design. METHODS: A total of 148 patients with CAD and/or VHD after surgical intervention and concomitant psychological distress (defined as HADS anxiety (A) or depression (D) score 8) will be randomized to either usual out-patient cardiac rehabilitation (CR) comprising an 8-week multidisciplinary programme or usual care supplemented by five group-based cognitive therapy sessions performed by trained CR nurses. A structured, standardized treatment manual will be used. Patients will be randomized 1:1 at three different sites. Additionally, a non-randomized sub-group of 40 matched patients without signs of psychological distress will be followed to investigate spontaneous variation in HADS. The primary outcome is Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS). Secondary outcomes are adherence to cardiac rehabilitation (CR), health-related quality of life measured by HeartQoL, time to return to work, adherence to lifestyle interventions and cardiovascular readmissions. Patients are followed up for 12 months. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) on patients with cardiac disease with an intensive group-based programme of cognitive therapy performed by CR nurses, which makes it affordable and widely implementable. The outcome will elucidate the feasibility and effect of cognitive therapy as an adjunct to CR in patients with post-surgery CAD and/or VHD and psychological distress and could possibly benefit patients with other heart conditions as well.

Results suggest a negative psychological effect caused by the water crisis, including anxiety and health worries, exacerbated by lowered trust in public health officials, uncertainty about the long-term impacts of the crisis, financial hardships, stigma, and difficulties seeking help. There was evidence that concerns about tap water continued even after the state of emergency was lifted.

Patients admitted to a general hospital with COVID-19 are at a higher risk for developing or exacerbating various psychiatric disorders, due to the virus brain tropism and associated psychosocial factors. However, there are still limited data regarding the psychiatric needs and mental health care of these patients. The present study seeks to evaluate the changes in liaison psychiatry, patients characteristics and outcomes, brought on by SARS-CoV-2. Method We retrospectively analyzed liaison psychiatry patients characteristics during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, between October and December 2020, in comparison with the same trimester pre-COVID-19 in 2019. Result At admission to hospital, we found no differences between liaison psychiatry pre-COVID-19 (n = 96) and COVID-19 period (n = 114) groups, for age (p = 0.35), gender (p = 0.96), or hospital resource utilization in the previous year : number of hospital admissions (p = .40), Accident and Emergency presentations (p = 0.61), outpatients clinics (p = 0.20). There was, however, a significant association between pre-COVID-19 vs COVID-19 period groups and psychiatric diagnosis during hospitalization (2(5) = 11.56, p = 0.04), influencing overall respective rates of delirium/dementias (29.2 vs 42.1 %), mood disorders (18.8 vs 26.3 %), anxiety and stress related disorders (22.9 vs 14.0 %), psychoactive substance use disorders (12.5 Vs 9.6 %) and psychotic disorders (10.4 vs 2.6 %). Mortality rate in pre-COVID-19 Vs COVID-19 period increased from 5.2 % to 15.8 % (2(1) = 5.98, p = 0.01), mostly due to increased mortality in COVID-19 patients (7.3 vs 30.3 %, p < 0.001). Referrals to liaison psychiatry increased by 18.8 % during the COVID-19 period, 28.8 % of referred patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and time to referral was positively correlated with hospital length of stay ( = 0.60, p < 0.001). In the COVID-19 period, fewer patients were referred to outpatient psychiatric follow-up after discharge from hospital (p < 0.001), and delayed discharges for social reasons were of shorter duration (p = 0.001). Conclusion Our findings are consistent with emerging data on comorbid or superimposed mental illness in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, showing a strong impact in neuropsychiatric mani-festations, clinical prognosis and mortality, as well as clinical management. Consideration should also be given to adequate staffing of psychiatry liaison services during the pandemic, in order to attend and safely manage general hospital inpatients mental health needs.","output":"Changes in patients characteristics and service provision in liaison psychiatry during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased usage of ethanol-based disinfectants for surface inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in buildings. Emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particles from ethanol-based disinfectant sprays were characterized in real-time (1 Hz) via a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) and a high-resolution electrical low-pressure impactor (HR-ELPI+), respectively. Ethanol-based disinfectants drove sudden changes in the chemical composition of indoor air. VOC and particle concentrations increased immediately after application of the disinfectants, remained elevated during surface contact time, and gradually decreased after wiping. The disinfectants produced a broad spectrum of VOCs with mixing ratios spanning the sub-ppb to ppm range. Ethanol was the dominant VOC emitted by mass, with concentrations exceeding 103 g m-3 and emission factors ranging from 101 to 102 mg g-1. Listed and unlisted diols, monoterpenes, and monoterpenoids were also abundant. The pressurized sprays released significant quantities (104 to 105 cm-3) of nano-sized particles smaller than 100 nm, resulting in large deposited doses in the tracheobronchial and pulmonary regions of the respiratory system. Inhalation exposure to VOCs varied with time during the building disinfection events. Much of the VOC inhalation intake (>60%) occurred after the disinfectant was sprayed and wiped off the surface.

Thrombotic and bleeding or thrombotic pathologies are significant accompaniments to acute respiratory syndrome and lung complications in COVID-19. Thrombotic events and bleeding often occur in subjects with weak constitutions, multiple risk factors and comorbidities. Of particular interest are the various circulating inflammatory coagulation biomarkers involved directly in clotting, with specific focus on fibrin(ogen), D-dimer, P-selectin and von Willebrand Factor (VWF). Central to the activity of these biomarkers are their receptors and signalling pathways on endothelial cells, platelets and erythrocytes. In this review, we discuss vascular implications of COVID-19 and relate this to circulating biomarker, endothelial, erythrocyte and platelet dysfunction. During the progression of the disease, these markers may either be within healthy levels, upregulated or eventually depleted. Most significant is that patients need to be treated early in the disease progression, when high levels of VWF, P-selectin and fibrinogen are present, with normal or slightly increased levels of D-dimer (however, D-dimer levels will rapidly increase as the disease progresses). Progression to VWF and fibrinogen depletion with high D-dimer levels and even higher P-selectin levels, followed by the cytokine storm, will be indicative of a poor prognosis. We conclude by looking at point-of-care devices and methodologies in COVID-19 management and suggest that a personalized medicine approach should be considered in the treatment of patients.","output":"Covid-19: The Rollercoaster of Fibrin(Ogen), D-Dimer, Von Willebrand Factor, P-Selectin and Their Interactions with Endothelial Cells, Platelets and Erythrocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Nowadays, we are facing a disease caused by SARS-CoV- 2, known globally as COVID-19, which is considered a threat to global health due to its high contagiousness and rapid spread.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate weight and comorbidity outcomes comparing revisional LRYGB (rLRYGB) with primary LRYGB (pLRYGB). METHODS Retrospective single-centre case-matched analysis was conducted at a bariatric tertiary referral centre. Between January 2009 and July 2013, 239 patients were entered into a prospective database, and 32 patients undergoing rLRYGB (cases) were matched with 32 patients undergoing pLRYGB (controls) for sex, age and BMI. The end point was data at 3 years of follow-up. Thirty-one patients (12.9%) were lost to follow-up during the study period. RESULTS There were no significant differences in patient demographics or median BMI (kg/m2) for pLRYGB or rLRYGB (42.8  12.1 vs. 42.3  11.5, respectively; p = 0.748). Coexisting comorbidities were rated similarly in both groups. At 3 years, the percentage of excess weight loss (74.4  23.3 vs 52.0  26, respectively; p = 0.007) was higher for pLRYGB than rLRYGB, while similar improvements of coexisting comorbidities could be observed. CONCLUSION rLRYGB is a feasible and practical surgical approach that allows effective weight loss at 3 years of follow-up and alleviates refractory reflux symptoms. Although weight loss is lower compared to pLRYGB, resolution or improvement of coexisting comorbidities appears similar. Therefore, rLRYGB seems to be a reliable procedure to address failure after LSG.","output":"Three-Year Outcomes of Revisional Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass after Failed Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy: a Case-Matched Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research focuses on three factors that influence how individuals cognitively process information related to the coronavirus outbreak.

Drawing on previous studies of inclusive development and community well-being, this research paper frames and extends the phenomenon of over-tourism from a political economic perspective. Based on a historical account of small island tourism development, an in-depth case study of Aruba is presented.

Generic inverse meta-analysis and meta-regression were used to pool estimates and examine time trends. PubMed, Scopus and pre-printer servers were searched from January-November 2020. Registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020223132). FINDINGS: Twenty-eight nationally representative samples (n = 58,656) from 13 countries indicate that as the pandemic has progressed, the percentage of people intending to vaccinate decreased and the percentage of people intending to refuse vaccination increased. Pooled data from surveys conducted during June-October suggest that 60% (95% CI: 49% to 69%) intend to vaccinate and 20% (95% CI: 13% to 29%) intend to refuse vaccination, although intentions vary substantially between samples and countries (I2 > 90%).

We explored this association in Vietnamese children aged less than 5 years. METHODS A hospital-based case-control study of pediatric LRTIs was conducted in Nha Trang, Vietnam. A total of 550 hospitalized children (274 radiologically confirmed pneumonia [RCP] and 276 other LRTIs) were enrolled and 350 healthy controls were randomly selected from the community. Polymerase chain reaction-based methods were used to measure bacterial loads of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis and to detect 13 respiratory viruses and bacterial serotypes in nasopharyngeal samples of study participants. RESULTS The median nasopharyngeal bacterial load of SP was substantially higher in children with RCP compared with healthy controls or children with other LRTIs (P < 0.001). SP load was 15-fold higher in pneumonia children with viral coinfection compared with those children without viral coinfection (1.4 x 10?/mL vs. 9.1 x 10?/mL; P 0.0001). SP load was over 200-fold higher in serotypeable SP compared with nontypeable SP (2.5 x 10?/mL vs. 1 x 10?/mL; P < 0.0001). These associations were independent of potential confounders in multiple regression models. No clear association was found between nasopharyngeal load of Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis and viral coinfection in either RCP or other LRTIs groups. CONCLUSIONS An increased load of SP in the nasopharynx was associated with RCP, viral coinfection, and presence of pneumococcal capsule.","output":"Association between nasopharyngeal load of Streptococcus pneumoniae, viral coinfection, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia in Vietnamese children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Circulating mitochondrial DNA (cir-mtDNA) could have a potential comparable to circulating nuclear DNA (cir-nDNA), with numerous applications. However, research and development in this area have fallen behind, particularly considering its origin and structural features. To tackle this, we initially combined Q-PCR and low-pass whole genome sequencing in the same analytical strategy previously and successfully used for cir-nDNA. This revealed unexplained structural patterns and led us to correlate these data with observations made during physical examinations such as filtration, and differential centrifugation in various plasma preparations. Both the integrity index and number of reads revealed a very minor proportion of low size-ranged fragments (<1000 bp) in plasma obtained with a standard preparation (0.06%). Filtration and high speed second step centrifugation revealed that 98.7 and 99.4% corresponded to extracellular mitochondria either free or in large extracellular vesicles. When avoiding platelet activation during plasma preparation, the proportion of both types of entities was still preponderant (76-80%), but the amount of detected mitochondrial DNA decreased 67-fold. In correlation with our previous study on the presence of circulating cell-free mitochondria in blood, our differential centrifugation procedure suggested that cir-mtDNA is also associated with approximately 18% small extracellular vesicles, 1.7% exosomes and 4% protein complexes.","output":"Plasma derived cell-free mitochondrial DNA originates mainly from circulating cell-free mitochondria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) exhibit reduced muscle insulin-mediated glucose uptake, potentially attributed to altered muscle mass; however, this is inconclusive. Altered muscle mass may aggravate PCOS complications. Our systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated whether PCOS alters muscle mass and function.

METHODS: All members of the European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) were invited to participate in the study. RESULTS: Thoracic anaesthesia was most commonly performed by specialists/board-certified anaesthetists and/or senior/attending physicians. Across Europe, the double lumen tube (DLT) was most commonly chosen as the primary device for lung separation (461/ 97.3%). Bronchial blockers were chosen less frequently (9/ 1.9%). Throughout Europe, bronchoscopy was not consistently used to confirm correct double lumen tube positioning. Respondents from Eastern Europe (32/ 57.1%) frequently stated that there were not enough bronchoscopes available for every intrathoracic operation. A specific algorithm for difficult airway management in thoracic anaesthesia was available to only 18.6% (n = 88) of the respondents. Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is the most commonly used form of regional analgesia for thoracic surgery in Europe. Ultrasonography was widely available 93,8% (n = 412) throughout Europe and was predominantly used for central line placement and lung diagnostics. CONCLUSIONS: While certain ?gold standards are widely met, there are also aspects of care requiring substantial improvement in thoracic anaesthesia throughout Europe. Our data suggest that algorithms and standard operating procedures for difficult airway management in thoracic anaesthesia need to be established. A European recommendation for the basic requirements of an anaesthesia workstation for thoracic anaesthesia is expedient and desirable, to improve structural quality and patient safety.

The relationship between post-vaccination symptoms and strength of antibody responses is unclear. ObjectiveTo determine whether adverse effects caused by vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine are associated with the magnitude of vaccine-induced antibody levels. DesignSingle center, prospective, observational cohort study. SettingParticipants worked at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and were seen monthly at the Naval Medical Research Center Clinical Trials Center. ParticipantsGenerally healthy adults that were not severely immunocompromised, had no history of COVID-19, and were seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein prior to vaccination. MeasuresSeverity of vaccine-associated symptoms was obtained through participant completed questionnaires. Testing for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and receptor binding domain was conducted using microsphere-based multiplex immunoassays. Results206 participants were evaluated (69.4% female, median age 41.5 years old). We found no correlation between vaccine-associated symptom severity scores and vaccine-induced antibody titers one month after vaccination. We also observed that 1) post-vaccination symptoms were inversely correlated with age and weight and more common in women, 2) systemic symptoms were more frequent after the second vaccination, 3) high symptom scores after first vaccination were predictive of high symptom scores after second vaccination, and 4) older age was associated with lower titers. LimitationsStudy only observes antibody responses and consists of healthy participants. ConclusionsLack of post-vaccination symptoms following receipt of the BNT162b2 vaccine does not equate to lack of vaccine-induced antibodies one month after vaccination. This study also suggests that it may be possible to design future mRNA vaccines that confer robust antibody responses with lower frequencies of vaccine-associated symptoms.

Translational research suggests that regeneration upon hepatectomy may also alleviate metastatic recurrence; however, the significance in patients is unclear. We therefore sought to study the effect of liver regeneration on tumor recurrence in patients. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included 58 out of 186 potentially eligible patients from our prospectively maintained database of CRC liver metastasis patients between 2001 and 2012 with a median follow-up of 42 months who underwent a formal right or left hemihepatectomy. Liver regeneration in CT volumetry was correlated with recurrence of CRC liver metastases and overall survival. RESULTS: Liver regeneration increased up to 14 months to 21.0% for left and 122.6% for right hemihepatectomy, respectively, with comparable final volumes. Regeneration was independent of initial tumor stage, number of metastases, and preoperative chemotherapy. Patients with lower liver regeneration showed earlier recurrence of CRC liver metastases (p = 0.006). Overall survival did not differ in patients with weak versus strong liver regeneration. CONCLUSIONS: The extent of liver regeneration after major hepatectomy does not impede overall survival.

Here, we establish a clinically applicable strategy for early identification of IFN-AAB-positive patients for potential subsequent clinical interventions. Methods We analysed sera of 430 COVID-19 patients with severe and critical disease from four hospitals for presence of IFN-AABs by ELISA. Binding specificity and neutralizing activity were evaluated via competition assay and virus-infection-based neutralization assay. We defined clinical parameters associated with IFN-AAB positivity. In a subgroup of critically ill patients, we analyzed effects of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) on the levels of IFN-AABs, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and clinical outcome. Results The prevalence of neutralizing AABs to IFN- and IFN-{omega} in COVID-19 patients was 4.2% (18/430), while being undetectable in an uninfected control cohort. Neutralizing IFN-AABs were detectable exclusively in critically affected, predominantly male (83%) patients (7.6% IFN- and 4.6% IFN-{omega} in 207 patients with critical COVID-19). IFN-AABs were present early post-symptom onset and at the peak of disease. Fever and oxygen requirement at hospital admission co-presented with neutralizing IFN-AAB positivity. IFN-AABs were associated with higher mortality (92.3% versus 19.1 % in patients without IFN-AABs). TPE reduced levels of IFN-AABs in three of five patients and may increase survival of IFN-AAB-positive patients compared to those not undergoing TPE.

However, there is not a lot of information available regarding the effect of COVID-19 on Indian instructors. The objective of this research was to discover if COVID-19 impacts the professional teachers' quality of life (QoL) in India. The descriptive study that included 890 licensed teachers was the respondents of this cross-sectional approach. The primary instrument in this research was the COVID-19 Impact on Quality of Life (COV19-QoL). Statistics used to evaluate the data included descriptive statistics, t-test, and one-way ANOVA to measure the effect of COVID-19 on the QoL of instructors. Results showed that it had a modest impact. COVID-19 impacted QoL differently depending on the program degree. The effect of COVID-19 on the patient's overall quality of life did not vary greatly according to age, sex, marital status, employment status, monthly salary, whether or not they had any COVID-19-related cases near their home, whether or not they knew anyone who had contracted or died from COVID-19, and whether or not they believed they were at risk.

Maternal internal exposure to aflatoxins is associated with fetal growth restriction, while exposure to fumonisins increases the risk of offspring's neural tube defects. Mycotoxin contamination of breast milk is reported worldwide, but data on adverse effects of the lactational transfer of mycotoxins on infant health are lacking. Young children are exposed to mycotoxins through contaminated infant formulas and baby foods. Both external and internal exposure to aflatoxins and fumonisins in children are reported to be associated with growth impairment. In low-income settings, where other co-factors can affect growth, this association should be interpreted with caution. Further studies on human biomonitoring of mother-infant pairs and young children are needed to guide management strategies aiming to minimize mycotoxin exposure at critical developmental stages.","output":"Mycotoxin Exposure during the First 1000 Days of Life and Its Impact on Children's Health: A Clinical Overview"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2019, a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was detected in China.

Since the Covid-19 pandemic, many community-based services for people with traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been moved online, which may have hindered their accessibility. The study aims to assess the accessibility of online information and resources dedicated to people with TBI. Methods. The websites of 14 organizations offering information and resources to people with TBI in Quebec were evaluated. Two co-authors independently evaluated one page of each website and compared their results. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed. Results. The average accessibility score of the 14 websites evaluated was 54% with a standard deviation of 16%. Website design and writing were the most accessible aspects (72.3%). Only two out of the 14 websites (14%) presented multimedia content. This category presented the most barriers to accessibility with a score of 42%. Regarding images, they reached an accessibility score of 46%. Their main shortcoming was the absence of a caption. Conclusion. This study highlights accessibility issues specific to people with TBI to access online resources and identifies specific areas of improvement.

METHODS: Participants with CF were assessed using DXA, single-frequency BIA (SFBIA), and multiple-frequency BIA (MFBIA) to quantify percent body fat (%Fat), fat mass (FM), and fat-free mass (FFM) at baseline and after a home-based resistance training intervention comprised of 36, 1 h sessions completed in 12-14 weeks. Repeated measures analysis of variance, paired samples t-tests, Cohen's d effect sizes, and Pearson's correlations were used to compare differences between and within methods at baseline and post-intervention. RESULTS: Ten participants (15.8  2.2 yr, 60.1  15.1 kg) completed the assessments. At baseline, both SFBIA and MFBIA scales significantly underestimated %Fat and FM and overestimated FFM, with small to moderate effect sizes. Post-intervention, small, non-significant differences were found between DXA and both BIA scales for all body composition metrics. Significant changes in %Fat and FFM were observed with DXA. MFBIA displayed less constant error than SFBIA when compared to DXA for pre- and post-intervention assessments for %Fat (MFBIA: pre and post -2.8 and -0.8 vs. SFBIA: -4.6 and -2.0), FM (-0.4 and -0.4 vs. -3.0 and -1.1), and FFM (+0.8 and +0.6 vs. +3.1 and +1.3). Near-perfect correlations were observed at both time points between DXA and each BIA scale.

At present, COVID-19 has spread to most countries worldwide. The latest evidence suggests that cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) is an important cause of the transition from mild to critical pneumonia and critically ill patients' death. The sudden exacerbation of COVID-19 may be related to a cytokine storm. Therefore, early identification and active treatment of CSS may play very important roles in improving the patients' prognosis, and these tasks are given attention in the current treatment of new Coronavirus pneumonia.

Here, we explored IgG autoantibodies reacting with a panel of cytoplasmic endosomal/lysosomal antigens and individual heat-shock proteins, all of which share links to autophagy. Sera from autoimmune patients and from MRL/lpr and NZB/W lupus-prone mice reacted with the C-terminal residues of lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein (LAMP)2A. No cross-reaction was observed with LAMP2B or LAMP2C variants, with dsDNA or mononucleosomes, or with heat-shock protein A8. Moreover, administering chromatography-purified LAMP2A autoantibodies to MRL/lpr mice accelerated mortality. Furthermore, flow cytometry revealed elevated cell-surface expression of LAMP2A on MRL/lpr B cells. These findings reveal the involvement of a new class of autoantibodies targeting the C-terminus of LAMP2A, a receptor for cytosolic proteins targeted for degradation via chaperone-mediated autophagy. These autoantibodies could affect the autophagy process, which is abnormally upregulated in lupus.

By doing so, this paper attempts to provide an overview of the discipline's research output, social and conceptual structure, and offer strategies facilitating the scientific development within the field. The findings indicate that entrepreneurial finance is a young and growing field with an exponential increase in the number of publications (approx. 19.75 percent per year) and rising collaboration tendency among authors. The 1991C2000 period is a crucial milestone of the field thanks to the remarkable growth and impact of studies during this period as well as simultaneously occurring historical events. We also notice a sign of Western ideological homogeneity from the collaboration networks and lists of most productive authors, institutions, and countries. Additionally, using thematic mapping, five major research domains are identified: venture capital, crowdfunding, SMEs finance, social entrepreneurship finance, IPO and corporate governance.

These essential measures led to home confinement that influenced both the physical and mental health of populations. Physical activity plays a key role in preventing chronic diseases and promoting protective psychological factors. In the context of a lockdown, understanding the motives that guide people to enact physical activity is an important issue for public health. The present study aimed to evaluate the relation between autonomous motivation and physical activity, considering the role of behavioral intention and anxiety in a longitudinal moderated mediation model. Methods: Italian participants (N = 86; mean(age) = 29.74, standard deviation = 9.74; female = 53.5%) completed a booklet composed of different questionnaires (motivation, intention, anxiety, and physical activity) 3 weeks apart. Results: The hypothesized model is supported by the evidence; both autonomous motivation and intention are direct predictors of physical activity. The results also show that the direct effect of autonomous motivation on physical activity is stronger in participants with low anxiety, while high levels of anxiety are a significant moderator of the intentionCbehavior relation. Conclusions: In conclusion, a multidisciplinary approach should be promoting methods and infrastructures to permit people to adhere to physical activity, as a front line against any health emergency.","output":"Anxiety, Motives, and Intention for Physical Activity during the Italian COVID-19 Lockdown: An Observational Longitudinal Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 induces a distinct host transcriptome.","output":"The story of COVID-19: A comparative analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has stressed the importance of health research as never before.

NTFs injected into the brain rescue and regenerate certain neuronal populations lost in neurodegenerative diseases, demonstrating the potential of NTFs to cure the diseases rather than simply alleviating the symptoms. NTFs (as the vast majority of molecules) do not pass through the bloodCbrain barrier (BBB) and therefore, are delivered directly into the brain of patients using costly and risky intracranial surgery. The delivery efficacy and poor diffusion of some NTFs inside the brain are considered the major problems behind their modest effects in clinical trials. Thus, there is a great need for NTFs to be delivered systemically thereby avoiding intracranial surgery. Nanoparticles (NPs), particles with the size dimensions of 1-100 nm, can be used to stabilize NTFs and facilitate their transport through the BBB. Several studies have shown that NTFs can be loaded into or attached onto NPs, administered systemically and transported to the brain. To improve the NP-mediated NTF delivery through the BBB, the surface of NPs can be functionalized with specific ligands such as transferrin, insulin, lactoferrin, apolipoproteins, antibodies or short peptides that will be recognized and internalized by the respective receptors on brain endothelial cells. In this review, we elaborate on the most suitable NTF delivery methods and envision ideal NTF for Parkinsons disease (PD) and clinical trial thereof. We shortly summarize clinical trials of four NTFs, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neurturin (NRTN), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), and cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF), that were tested in PD patients, focusing mainly on GDNF and CDNF. We summarize current possibilities of NP-mediated delivery of NTFs to the brain and discuss whether NPs have impact in improving the properties of NTFs and delivery across the BBB.

Our long-term immune-defense is the production of antibodies (Abs) that recognize the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and successfully block viral infection. Thus, to understand immunity against SARS-CoV-2, a comprehensive molecular understanding of how human SARS-CoV-2 Abs recognize the RBD is needed. Here, we report the sequence-specific backbone assignment of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and, furthermore, demonstrate that biomolecular NMR spectroscopy chemical shift perturbation (CSP) mapping successfully and rapidly identifies the molecular epitopes of RBD-specific mAbs.

The aim of this study was to determine factors associated with patient decision time for seeking care in STEMI, particularly how symptoms were experienced and affected patient response. METHODS AND RESULTS: A multicentre cross-sectional self-report survey study was completed at five Swedish hospitals representing geographic diversity. The 521 patients were divided into three groups based on their time to respond to symptoms: early (<20 min), intermediate (20-90 min), and late responders (>90 min). Only one out of five patients both responded early and called an ambulance within 20 min. Believing symptoms were cardiac in origin [odds ratio (OR) 2.60], male sex (OR 2.40), left anterior descending artery as culprit artery (OR 1.77), and bystanders calling an ambulance (OR 4.32) were factors associated with early response and correct action. Associated symptoms such as dyspnoea (OR 1.67) and weakness (OR 1.65) were associated with an early action (<20 min), while chest pain was not independently associated with response time. Cold sweat (OR 0.61) prevented late care-seeking behaviour as did a high symptom burden (OR 0.86). CONCLUSION: Misinterpretation of symptoms delays correct care-seeking behaviour because patient expectations may not be aligned with the experience when stricken by Myocardial infarction.

A third booster dose of two-dose vaccines could restore protection but the benefit of boosting immunity in younger healthy individuals and the resultant effects on transmission have not been quantified. MethodsWe develop relationships between neutralizing antibody titers and vaccine protection against both infection and transmission. We combine these relationships with data on waning and boosting of neutralizing antibody titers to examine the impact of third doses of Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna vaccines on infection and transmission and the impact on the pathogen effective reproductive number Rt. FindingsWaning reduced protection of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine against all infections from 80.0% (95% CI: 77% to 83%) to 60.4% (95% CI: 53% to 67%), and for the Moderna vaccine from 83.8 (95% CI: 80 to 87%) to 65.9% (95% CI: 61-71%). A third dose increased neutralizing antibody titers 25.9-fold relative to waned levels for the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine and 13-fold relative to waned levels for the Moderna vaccine. This increased protection against infection to 87.2% (95% CI: 83% to 91%) and 86.3% (95% CI: 82% to 90%) for Pfizer and Moderna, respectively. Increased protection against infection and transmission from third doses reduced Rt by 28% to 74% depending on vaccine coverage and previous infection and reduced Rt below 1 when vaccination coverage was high or contact rates were well below pre-pandemic levels.

Climate change threatens to exacerbate these through further disruption of the physical environment, and a transition away from the fossil fuels on which many of the region's economies depend. Through their nationally determined contributions (NDC) to the Paris Agreement, all SSA countries committed to the increased utilisation of intermittent renewable energy sources (IRES) to tackle the twin challenges of energy poverty-which limits economic development-and climate change. There is a dearth of analysis on the nature of sustainable energy transition(s) necessary to deliver these NDCs, especially given the limited financial and technical resources of SSA. Using Nigeria as a case study, this study seeks to address this gap by determining the power system transitions required to deliver NDCs alongside universal energy access in SSA by 2050;their financial and policy implications;and the barriers and opportunities that they present to sustainable development efforts. We find that Nigeria can deliver its NDCs with no added cost implications, thereby debunking the prevalent view that climate change mitigation is too costly to pursue in SSA. Furthermore, we find that the higher availability and dispatchability of fossil fuel generation makes it critical for the rapid scale-up of energy supply;thus, entirely leapfrogging carbon-intensive development will prove costly to SSA. Finally, owing to the limited cost reductions that IRES have experienced in SSA, delivering NDCs through the deployment of decentralised IRES systems proves more expensive than using conventional generation. The distributed nature of IRES however means that they can democratise energy investment and job creation, thus facilitating the equitable sharing of economic resources which is crucial to conflict prevention in the fragile socio-political landscapes that pervade the region.","output":"Delivering low-carbon electricity systems in sub-Saharan Africa: insights from Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Collagen is the most widely distributed protein in human body.

WHO has set the strategic objective to interrupt spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. An outbreak in Bavaria, Germany, starting at the end of January, 2020, provided the opportunity to study transmission events, incubation period, and secondary attack rates. METHODS: A case was defined as a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR. Case interviews were done to describe timing of onset and nature of symptoms and to identify and classify contacts as high risk (had cumulative face-to-face contact with a confirmed case for &#8805;15 min, direct contact with secretions or body fluids of a patient with confirmed COVID-19, or, in the case of health-care workers, had worked within 2 m of a patient with confirmed COVID-19 without personal protective equipment) or low risk (all other contacts). High-risk contacts were ordered to stay at home in quarantine for 14 days and were actively followed up and monitored for symptoms, and low-risk contacts were tested upon self-reporting of symptoms. We defined fever and cough as specific symptoms, and defined a prodromal phase as the presence of non-specific symptoms for at least 1 day before the onset of specific symptoms. Whole genome sequencing was used to confirm epidemiological links and clarify transmission events where contact histories were ambiguous; integration with epidemiological data enabled precise reconstruction of exposure events and incubation periods. Secondary attack rates were calculated as the number of cases divided by the number of contacts, using Fisher's exact test for the 95% CIs. FINDINGS: Patient 0 was a Chinese resident who visited Germany for professional reasons. 16 subsequent cases, often with mild and non-specific symptoms, emerged in four transmission generations. Signature mutations in the viral genome occurred upon foundation of generation 2, as well as in one case pertaining to generation 4. The median incubation period was 40 days (IQR 23-43) and the median serial interval was 40 days (30-50). Transmission events were likely to have occurred presymptomatically for one case (possibly five more), at the day of symptom onset for four cases (possibly five more), and the remainder after the day of symptom onset or unknown. One or two cases resulted from contact with a case during the prodromal phase. Secondary attack rates were 750% (95% CI 190-990; three of four people) among members of a household cluster in common isolation, 100% (12-320; two of 20) among household contacts only together until isolation of the patient, and 51% (26-89; 11 of 217) among non-household, high-risk contacts. INTERPRETATION: Although patients in our study presented with predominately mild, non-specific symptoms, infectiousness before or on the day of symptom onset was substantial. Additionally, the incubation period was often very short and false-negative tests occurred. These results suggest that although the outbreak was controlled, successful long-term and global containment of COVID-19 could be difficult to achieve.

The primary outcome was a composite of pregnancy complications in SARS-CoV-2 positive versus negative women: miscarriage, preeclampsia, preterm delivery, perinatal death, small-for-gestational age, neonatal admission. Secondary outcomes were components of the primary outcome plus abnormal fetal growth, malformation, intrapartum fetal distress. Outcomes were also compared between positive symptomatic and positive asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 women. RESULTS: Of 2,225 pregnant women, 317 (14.2%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (n=314, 99.1%) and/or RT-PCR (n=36, 11.4%).

Methods The clinical records of 17 cats diagnosed with thiamine deficiency related to a defective dry food were examined and data collected. The thiamine level in the food was analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results The thiamine level in the food was below the recommendation of the National Research Council. Fifteen cats were fed the food exclusively. Prior to the acute development of neurological signs, most cats displayed non-specific signs such as anorexia, lethargy or vomiting. Vestibular signs of varying severity were observed in 94% of the cats, and all but one of these presented with bilateral dysfunction. Other main neurological signs included altered mentation (76%), blindness (59%) and seizures (59%). Moreover, 80% of the cats with seizures presented with cluster seizures or status epilepticus. MRI abnormalities consistent with findings reported in the previous literature were detected in five cases. MRI was unremarkable in one cat with ongoing severe neurological signs even though thiamine had been administered. Most surviving cats recovered rapidly within 2 weeks of treatment and had either returned to normal or had minimal neurological signs at the 2 month follow-up. One cat recovered slowly over 6 months. Most cats with seizures in the initial stage of the disease remained seizure free at the 24 month follow-up. Conclusions and relevance This study documented the association between feline thiamine deficiency and defective dry food. MRI examination provided valuable information in the diagnosis. However, normal MRI findings do not exclude the diagnosis of feline thiamine deficiency, especially once thiamine has been supplemented. MRI findings also may not always reflect the neurological status or severity. If treated promptly, most cats will recover rapidly with a good outcome. Occasionally, recovery may be slow and take several months.","output":"Outbreak of thiamine deficiency in cats associated with the feeding of defective dry food."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has uncovered the vulnerabilities, inequalities and fragility present within our social community which has exposed and exacerbated the pre-existing racial and socioeconomic inequalities that disproportionately affect health outcomes for Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) people.

Although recent studies have increased awareness that PH contributes significantly to the high morbidity and mortality of BPD, the risk factors and clinical characteristics for PH in VLBWIs are little known. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the risk factors and clinical characteristics for BPD-associated pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH) in VLBWIs. METHODS: A retrospective caseCcontrol observational study of VLBWIs with BPD admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) over 4 years. According to echocardiograms confirming elevated pulmonary artery pressure after 28 days after birth, we divided BPD infants into PH group (n = 18) and non-PH group (n = 65). We compared pre- and postnatal characteristics between VLBWIs with or without PH. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted with backward selection. RESULTS: A total of 83 infants with BPD were divided into PH group (n = 18) or non-PH group (n = 65). The average birth weight of the infants with BPD was 1078.1 g. Compared with those infants of the non-PH group, the birth weight of BPD-PH infants was significantly lower (968.1  187.7 vs. 1108.5  185.8, P = 0.006). Infants in the PH group had a higher incidence of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and underwent longer durations of oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation compared to those in the non-PH group. In all subjects, birth weight (OR 0.995; 95% CI 0.991C0.999; P = 0.025) and PDA (OR 13.355; 95% CI 2.950C60.469; P = 0.001) were found to be specific risk factors for BPD-PH in this cohort.

To facilitate the fast measurement of BT and RR using IRTs in densely populated venues, it is desirable to have IRT algorithms that can automatically identify the best facial locations in thermal images to extract these vital signs. The IEC 80601-2-59:2017 standard suggests that the regions medially adjacent to the inner canthi of the eyes are robust BT measurement sites. The nostril regions, on the other hand, are often used for RR estimation. However, it is more difficult to automatically identify inner canthi and nostrils in thermal images than in visible-light images, which are rich with exploitable features. In this paper, a unique system that can detect inner canthi and outer nostril edges directly in thermal images in two phases is introduced. In Phase I, original thermal images were processed in four different ways to enhance facial features to facilitate inner canthus and nostril detection. In Phase II, landmarks of the inner canthi and outer nostril edges were detected in two steps: (1) face detection using the Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) and (2) facial landmark detection to locate the inner canthi and outer nostril edges. The face detection, facial landmark detection, and overall system accuracies were evaluated using the intersection over union, normalized Euclidean distance, and success detection rate metrics on a set of 36 thermal images collected from 12 subjects using three different IRTs. Additional validation was performed on a subset of 40 random thermal images from the publicly available Tufts Face Database. The results revealed that the processed images - referred to as ICLIP images - yielded the highest landmark localization accuracy from the four types of processed thermal images, verifying that the system can automatically and accurately estimate the inner canthus and nostril locations in thermal images. The proposed system can be applied in IRT algorithms to provide reliable temperature measurements and RR estimates during infectious disease outbreaks. ? 2013 IEEE.","output":"Detecting Essential Landmarks Directly in Thermal Images for Remote Body Temperature and Respiratory Rate Measurement With a Two-Phase System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a physics-informed machine learning approach to the derivation of a bottom-up coarse-grained model of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein from all-atomic molecular dynamics simulations.

The force-matched machine learning procedure is constructed based on two physics-informed layers: one is the Harmonic layer consisting of bond, angle, and dihedral terms as bonded potentials;the other is the Lennard-Jones layer consisting of the non-bonded Lennard-Jones potential. Coarse-grained validation simulations are performed with the learned parameters to test the derived bottom-up coarse-grained model. The simulations are able to reach the microsecond time scale with stability. The physics-informed learning approach yields simulation speeds nearly 40,000 times faster than conventional all-atomic simulations while maintaining comparable simulation accuracy. Additionally, through examination of the non-bonded Lennard-Jones parameters and the radial distribution function analysis, the learning approach matches pairwise distances of the ground-truth data with greater accuracy than the conventional iterative approach method.","output":"Beyond the Scales: A physics-informed machine learning approach for more efficient modeling of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tijekom 2020. godine dva zna?ajna dogaeaja bitno su utjecala na tr?i?te nekretnina u Europskoj uniji.

The first one was the pandemic of COVID-19, which brought unprecedented uncertainty and resulted in a dramatic drop in property prices on rental market and hampered growth of the sales market. Another significant event this article is going to examine was the judgment C-724/18 of the European Court of Justice issued on 22 September 2020. The ECJ ruled that the authorisation scheme for short-term rental does not constitute a breach of the freedom of services warranted by the EU. The judgment concerns the legitimacy of the constraints imposed by local authorities on entrepreneurs operating short-term rentals. It also establishes the applicability of the EU's Services Directive (2006/123/EC)1 to short-term rental. The ECJ holds in the judgment that the measure requiring an authorisation for short-term rental aimed at tackling shortage of long-term rental housing represents an overriding reason of public interest and as such it is justified. The article analyses the importance of the ECJ judgment for the market of short-term rentals, in view of the existing legal regulations and in respect of its possible consequences for short-term rental in the EU member states.","output":"The Judgment of the European Court of Justice of 22 September 2020 C-724/18 and Its Impact on the Real Estate Market in the Eu"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Doubling Time (DT) is typically calculated for growth curves that show exponential growth, such as the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases day by day.

The burden of this disease is predominantly carried by low-resource countries in Africa and Asia. In resource-rich countries, the epidemiological spread of viral hepatitis is partially driven by migrant movements from areas of high endemicity. In the last decade, Member States of the European Union and the European Economic Area have experienced an unprecedented influx of migrants, which has resulted in the polarization of political views about migration. In addition, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has worsened the economic and health conditions of migrants and contributed to hostility to ensuring their health rights. Moreover, the implementation of hostile laws in some host nations has increased the vulnerability of marginalized migrant subgroups, such as asylum seekers and undocumented individuals. These developments have complicated the historical challenge of identifying high-risk migrant groups for screening and treatment. However, if European countries can apply the simplified assessment tools and diagnostic tests for viral hepatitis that have been used for decentralized screening and monitoring in resource-poor countries, the uptake of care by migrants could be dramatically increased.

The quality of the articles was assessed using NIH quality assessment tool for case series studies. The pooled prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of imaging findings were calculated. RESULTS: Fifty-six studies (6007 patients, age, 2.1-70 years, 2887 females, 5762 CT, 396 radiographs,) were included. The mean interval between onset of symptoms and CT acquisition was 1-8 days. On CT, the pooled prevalence of ground glass opacities (GGO), GGO plus consolidation, and consolidation only was 66.9% (95% CI 60.8-72.4%), 44.9% (38.7-51.3%), and 32.1 (23.6-41.9%) respectively. Pooled sensitivity and specificity of GGO on CT was 73% (71%-80%) and 61% (41%-78%), respectively. For GGO plus consolidation and consolidation only, the pooled sensitivities/ specificities were 58% (48%-68%)/ 58% (41%-73%) and 49% (20%-78%)/ 56% (30%-78%), respectively.

The diagnostic accuracy of radiographic findings could not be assessed due to small number of studies. CONCLUSION: GGO on CT has the highest diagnostic performance for COVID-19 pneumonia, followed by GGO plus consolidation and consolidation only. However, the moderate to low sensitivity and specificity suggest that CT should not be used as the primary tool for diagnosis.

He gave history of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea after dinner and before the pain started. The morning after admission, a Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) scan was done which showed a large mesenteric hematoma. On subsequent questioning, the patient then recalled a blow to the abdomen while playing basketball two days ago. Since the patient was hemodynamically stable, non-operative management (NOM) was chosen with close monitoring. Regular follow-up ultrasonography (USG) scans showed progressive spontaneous resolution of the hematoma. CLINICAL DISCUSSION Nonspecific symptoms of mesenteric hematoma make it difficult to reach a diagnosis. It is usually identified by history or medical imaging. Mesenteric hematoma can be managed conservatively if there is no active bleeding. In stable patients, selective visceral angiography should be performed and bleeding vessels should be embolized where possible. CONCLUSION This case highlights a successful conservative management of a large traumatic mesenteric hematoma. It also emphasizes the importance of eliciting a detailed history of major or minor trauma for any patient with abdominal pain.

Materials and Methods: This was a survey study of physicians from different specialties who provided patient care during the pandemic in Turkey. A total of 824 physicians responded to questionnaire, which consisted of 5 sections: (1) demographic characteristics; (2) anxiety level; (3) knowledge; (4) perspective; and (5) willingness to use telemedicine. Results: Fifty-six percent of the participants were found to experience mild-to-severe anxiety during the pandemic. It was found that the early career physicians most likely report anxiety about COVID-19 (p = 0.012). Physicians working in training and research hospital settings had higher Beck Anxiety Inventory scores compared to their colleagues working in private health care institutions (p = 0.011). Anxiety levels of physicians were not affected by working experience, existence of comorbidities, or living conditions of the participants (p = 0.138, p = 0.317, and p = 0.123, respectively). The results showed that the participants had a low level of knowledge about telemedicine. Only 61.1% of the physicians stated that they had heard of telemedicine before. The physicians who experienced telemedicine before (N = 76, 9.2% of all the participants) were more likely to find telemedicine beneficial both in pandemic (p < 0.001) and postpandemic period (p = 0.002).

Methods: Data regarding 2019 and 2020 were extracted from regional health insurance databases. They were used to elaborate several indicators relative to the general health insurance scheme, which were calculated and updated each week, starting with Week 2. Results: We observed a drop in private physician activity during the lockdown (-23% for general practitioners; -46% for specialist doctors), followed by a return to a semblance of normalcy. Concomitantly, a boom in teleconsultations occurred: at the height of the crisis they represented 30% of medical acts. The initial stage of the lockdown was characterized by peak provisioning for drugs, whereas vaccination strongly declined (-39 % regarding measles, mumps and rubella vaccine among children aged less than 5 years; -54 % regarding human papillomavirus vaccine among girls aged 10 to 14 years). Conclusion: The Covid-19 pandemic could lead to health effects other than those directly attributable to the coronavirus itself. Renouncing care may result in healthcare delays highly deleterious for people and society. Public authorities are preoccupied with these questions; they have set up action plans aimed at encouraging patients to seek treatment without delay.

The present review will focus on the most current data on PTNS types (percutaneous, transcutaneous, and implant) and their mechanism of action, safety, efficacy, advantages, drawbacks, limitation, and clinical applications. Recent Findings. The present review described the recent studies that addressed the tibial nerve stimulation role in OAB management. BlueWind RENOVA system, Bioness StimRouter, and eCoin are examples of emerging technologies that have evolved from interval sessions (percutaneous PTNS and transcutaneous PTNS) to continuous stimulation (implants). These can be efficiently managed at home by patients with minimum burden on the health system and fewer visits, especially in the COVID-19 pandemic. Summary. Our review shows that the tibial nerve stimulation advancements in OAB treatment have been rapidly increasing over the recent years. It is minimally invasive and effective, similar to sacral nerve stimulation (SNM), but less aggressive. Implantable PTNS has been promised in terms of efficacy, safety, and high acceptance rate. However, evidence is still limited to short-term trials, and tolerability, method, and drawbacks remain challenges.","output":"Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation for Overactive Bladder: Mechanism, Classification, and Management Outlines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Universal paid sick-leave (PSL) policies have been implemented in jurisdictions to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Lockdown measures imposed to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic led to substantial reductions in observed Asian aerosol loadings. Here, we use bottom-up estimates of anthropogenic emissions based on national mobility data from Google and Apple, along with simulations from the ECHAM6-HAMMOZ state-of-the-art aerosol-chemistry-climate model to investigate the impact of the reduced aerosol and gases pollution loadings on the ISM. We show that the decrease in anthropogenic emissions led to a 4 W m?2 increase in surface solar radiation over parts of South Asia, which resulted in a strengthening of the ISM. Simultaneously, while natural emission parameterizations are kept the same in all our simulations, the anthropogenic emission reduction led to changes in the atmospheric circulation, causing accumulation of dust over the Tibetan plateau (TP) during the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. This accumulated dust has intensified the warm core over the TP that reinforced the intensification of the Hadley circulation. The associated cross-equatorial moisture influx over the Indian landmass led to an enhanced amount of rainfall by 4% (0.2 mm d?1) over the Indian landmass and 5%C15% (0.8C3 mm d?1) over central India. These estimates may vary under the influence of large-scale coupled atmosphereCocean oscillations (e.g. El Nino Southern Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole). Our study indicates that the reduced anthropogenic emissions caused by the unprecedented COVID-19 restrictions had a favourable effect on the hydrological cycle over South Asia, which has been facing water scarcity during the past decades. This emphasizes the need for stringent measures to limit future anthropogenic emissions in South Asia for protecting one of the worlds most densely populated regions.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on the Indian summer monsoon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2016 translational research meeting of the French Intensive Care Society was focused on lung defense and repair.

In this work, we studied the electrophysiologic maturation of PRPs throughout the differentiation process. Methods Human embryonic stem cells were differentiated into PRPs and whole-cell recordings were performed for electrophysiologic characterization at days 0, 30, 60, and 90 along with quantitative PCR analysis to characterize the expression level of various ion channels, which shape the electrophysiologic response. Finally, to characterize the electrically induced calcium currents, we employed calcium imaging (rhod4) to visualize intracellular calcium dynamics in response to electrical activation. Results Our results revealed an early and steady presence (approximately 100% of responsive cells) of the delayed potassium rectifier current. In contrast, the percentage of cells exhibiting voltage-gated sodium currents increased with maturation (from 0% to almost 90% of responsive cells at 90 days). Moreover, calcium imaging revealed the presence of voltage-gated calcium currents, which play a major role in vision formation. These results were further supported by quantitative PCR analysis, which revealed a significant and continuous (3- to 50-fold) increase in the expression of various voltage-gated channels concomitantly with the increase in the expression of the photoreceptor marker CRX. Conclusions These results can shed light on the electrophysiologic maturation of neurons in general and PRP in particular and can form the basis for devising and optimizing cell replacement-based vision restoration strategies.","output":"Electrophysiologic Characterization of Developing Human Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Photoreceptor Precursors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Societal events C such as natural disasters, political shifts, or economic downturns C are time-varying and impact the learning potential of students in unique ways These impacts are likely accentuated during the COVID-19 pandemic, which precipitated an abrupt and wholesale transition to online education Unfortunately, the individual-level consequences of these events are difficult to determine because the extant literature focuses on single-occasion surveys that produce only group-level inferences To better understand individual-level variability in stress and learning, intensive longitudinal data can be leveraged The goal of this paper is to illustrate this by discussing three different techniques for the analysis of intensive longitudinal data: (1) regression analyses;(2) multilevel models;and (3) person-specific network models, (e g , group iterative multiple model estimation;GIMME) For each technique, a brief background in the context of education research is provided, an illustrative analysis is presented using data from college students who completed a 75-day intensive longitudinal study of cognition, somatic symptoms, anxiety, and intellectual interests during the 2016 U S Presidential election C a period of heightened sociopolitical stress C and strengths and limitations are considered The paper ends with recommendations for future research, especially for intensive longitudinal studies of online education during COVID-19","output":"Individualized learning potential in stressful times: How to leverage intensive longitudinal data to inform online learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the advent of the Covid-19 Disease students have been forced to adapt to online learning platforms at home.

Colchicine is an oral anti-inflammatory medication beneficial in gout, pericarditis, and coronary disease. We aimed to investigate the effect of colchicine on the composite of COVID-19-related death or hospital admission. METHODS: The present study is a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, adaptive, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. The study was done in Brazil, Canada, Greece, South Africa, Spain, and the USA, and was led by the Montreal Heart Institute. Patients with COVID-19 diagnosed by PCR testing or clinical criteria who were not being treated in hospital were eligible if they were at least 40 years old and had at least one high-risk characteristic. The randomisation list was computer-generated by an unmasked biostatistician, and masked randomisation was centralised and done electronically through an automated interactive web-response system. The allocation sequence was unstratified and used a 1:1 ratio with a blocking schema and block sizes of six. Patients were randomly assigned to receive orally administered colchicine (05 mg twice per day for 3 days and then once per day for 27 days thereafter) or matching placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of death or hospital admission for COVID-19. Vital status at the end of the study was available for 979% of patients. The analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. The COLCORONA trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04322682) and is now closed to new participants. FINDINGS: Trial enrolment began in March 23, 2020, and was completed in Dec 22, 2020. A total of 4488 patients (539% women; median age 540 years, IQR 470-610) were enrolled and 2235 patients were randomly assigned to colchicine and 2253 to placebo. The primary endpoint occurred in 104 (47%) of 2235 patients in the colchicine group and 131 (58%) of 2253 patients in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR] 079, 951% CI 061-103; p=0081). Among the 4159 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, the primary endpoint occurred in 96 (46%) of 2075 patients in the colchicine group and 126 (60%) of 2084 patients in the placebo group (OR 075, 057-099; p=0042). Serious adverse events were reported in 108 (49%) of 2195 patients in the colchicine group and 139 (63%) of 2217 patients in the placebo group (p=0051); pneumonia occurred in 63 (29%) of 2195 patients in the colchicine group and 92 (41%) of 2217 patients in the placebo group (p=0021). Diarrhoea was reported in 300 (137%) of 2195 patients in the colchicine group and 161 (73%) of 2217 patients in the placebo group (p<00001). INTERPRETATION: In community-treated patients including those without a mandatory diagnostic test, the effect of colchicine on COVID-19-related clinical events was not statistically significant. Among patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, colchicine led to a lower rate of the composite of death or hospital admission than placebo. Given the absence of orally administered therapies to prevent COVID-19 complications in community-treated patients and the benefit of colchicine in patients with PCR-proven COVID-19, this safe and inexpensive anti-inflammatory agent could be considered for use in those at risk of complications. Notwithstanding these considerations, replication in other studies of PCR-positive community-treated patients is recommended.

Results showed that in the Dutch Bible belt the level of patients with COVID-19 was strongly related to church attendance, but in the southern, traditionally Catholic part of The Netherlands nominal church membership mattered more than church attendance. On the basis of these findings, the conclusion was drawn that religion probably facilitates the spread of the virus in both a direct and indirect way.

Considering the widespread occurrence of AUD, a reliable, cheap, non-invasive biomarker of alcohol consumption is desired by healthcare providers, clinicians, researchers, public health and criminal justice officials. microRNAs could serve as such biomarkers. They are easily detectable in saliva, which can be sampled from individuals in a non-invasive manner. Moreover, microRNAs expression is dynamically regulated by environmental factors, including alcohol. Since excessive alcohol consumption is a hallmark of alcohol abuse, we have profiled microRNA expression in the saliva of chronic, heavy alcohol abusers using microRNA microarrays. We observed significant changes in salivary microRNA expression caused by excessive alcohol consumption. These changes fell into three categories: downregulated microRNAs, upregulated microRNAs, and microRNAs upregulated de novo. Analysis of these combinatorial changes in microRNA expression suggests dysregulation of specific biological pathways leading to impairment of the immune system and development of several types of epithelial cancer. Moreover, some of the altered microRNAs are also modulators of inflammation, suggesting their contribution to pro-inflammatory mechanisms of alcohol actions. Establishment of the cellular source of microRNAs in saliva corroborated these results. We determined that most of the microRNAs in saliva come from two types of cells: leukocytes involved in immune responses and inflammation, and buccal cells, involved in development of epithelial, oral cancers. In summary, we propose that microRNA profiling in saliva can be a useful, non-invasive biomarker allowing the monitoring of alcohol abuse, as well as alcohol-related inflammation and early detection of cancer.","output":"Non-Invasive microRNA Profiling in Saliva can Serve as a Biomarker of Alcohol Exposure and Its Effects in Humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The risk of COVID-19 transmission increases when an uninfected person is less than 6 ft from an infected person for longer than 15 minutes. Infectious disease experts working on the COVID-19 pandemic call this high-risk situation being Too Close for Too Long (TCTL). Consequently, the problem of detecting the TCTL situation in order to maintain appropriate social distance has attracted considerable attention recently. One of the most prominent TCTL detection ideas being explored involves utilizing the Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to determine whether the owners of two smartphones are observing the acceptable social distance of 6 ft. However, using RSSI measurements to detect the TCTL situation is extremely challenging due to the significant signal variance caused by multipath fading in indoor radio channel, carrying the smartphone in different pockets or positions, and differences in smartphone manufacturer and type of the device. In this study we utilize the Mitre Range Angle Structured (MRAS) Private Automated Contact Tracing (PACT) dataset to extensively evaluate the effectiveness of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in comparison to classical estimation theory techniques to solve the TCTL problem. We provide a comparative performance evaluation of proximity classification accuracy and the corresponding confidence levels using classical estimation theory and a variety of ML algorithms. As the classical estimation method utilizes RSSI characteristics models, it is faster to compute, is more explainable, and drives an analytical solution for the precision bounds proximity estimation. The ML algorithms, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Machines (GBM) utilized thirteen spatial, time-domain, frequency-domain, and statistical features extracted from the BLE RSSI data to generate the same results as classical estimation algorithms.

Various deep learning (DL) algorithms supported with clinical validations have been proposed to automate the stratification process. However, no work has been done to evaluate the impact on the automated decision by varying pixel resolution and bit depth, leading to the reduction in size of overall data.

All videos are resampled by a factor of 2, 3, and 4 of original resolution, and quantized to 128, 64, and 32 levels, followed by score prediction. The results indicate that the automated scoring shows negligible variation in accuracy when it comes to the quantization of intensity levels only.

In recent years organoids have been implemented to model a wide range of different organs and disease conditions. However, the technology for their fabrication and application to cardiovascular studies has been lagging significantly when compared to other organoid types (e.g., brain, pancreas, kidney, intestine).

AS has a highly heterogenous disease pattern due to different organ involvement. The initial clinical presentation can be variable. We present an atypical case of AS with ARDS. DESCRIPTION: A 72-year-old female, retired teacher, with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with complaints of progressively worsening shortness of breath for 3 to 4 weeks, associated with fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Otherwise review of symptoms was negative. Patient was hypotensive, tachycardic and hypoxic requiring hi-flow nasal canula (FiO2 90%). A chest CT was negative for thromboembolic disease but did show bilateral patchy ground glass opacities with traction bronchiectasis and confluent consolidation in both upper lobes. Patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit and initiated on antibiotics, but her hypoxemia progressively worsened requiring mechanical ventilation for ARDS. She required multiple proning sessions. Her bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was negative for infectious etiology including COVID test. Given her persistent hypoxia, patient was started on methylprednisolone due to concerns for interstitial lung disease (ILD). Patient's oxygenation significantly improved, and she was extubated 10 days later. Further investigations revealed positive anti-PL-7 directed against threonyl t-RNA synthetase. Case was discussed in the ILD multidisciplinary conference with pulmonary and thoracic surgery. In the light of her ongoing oxygen requirements, there was high suspicion of rapidly progressive form of antisynthetase syndrome. Therefore, she was started on 60 mg prednisone, tacrolimus, and cyclophosphamide. Patient was discharged to a skilled-nursing facility. DISCUSSION: AS can be a challenging diagnosis, especially in patients without any muscular or rheumatological symptoms that present with ARDS. It is critical to have a broad differential for patients with non-resolving ARDS. ILD as the initial presentation of AS is a major cause of mortality. Currently there is limited evidence-based recommendations to guide therapy.

Materials and Methods After the approval of study protocol by the Institutional Ethics Committee and informed voluntary consent, salivary samples were collected from 96 participants in each group of tobacco chewers with OSCC, tobacco chewers without precancerous or cancerous lesion, and healthy controls. Salivary protein-bound SA (PBSA) and salivary-free SA (FSA) were measured by Yao et al.'s method of acid ninhydrin reaction, and the data were subjected to appropriate statistical analysis. Results The salivary PBSA and FSA levels in the Groups 1, 2, and 3 participants were 31.17  7.6 mg/dL and 63.45  9.8 mg/dL, 25.45  16.61 mg/dL and 33.18  11.38 mg/dL, and 22.73  3.01 mg/dL and 21.62  8.86 mg/dL, respectively. Salivary FSA levels were significantly increased among the tobacco chewers with OSCC patients (Group 1) and tobacco chewers with no premalignant lesions of the oral cavity (Group 2) compared to the healthy controls (Group 3) with P < 0.05 being statistically significant. Salivary FSA levels were significantly increased in Group 1 as compared with Group 2. The salivary PBSA was high among Group 1 as compared to the control Group 3; there was however no significant difference in the levels of salivary PBSA between Group 1 and Group 2. There was no significant difference in the PBSA levels between OSCC patients of Group 1 and the tobacco chewers without precancerous or cancerous lesion in the oral cavity of Group 2. Conclusion Salivary PBSA and FSA are significantly raised in both tobacco chewers with OSCC and in tobacco chewers with no precancerous or cancerous lesions in the oral cavity. SA should therefore be used cautiously while considering it as a marker for the early detection of oral cancer. Tobacco can be a crucial confounding factor when SA is used as a biomarker in OSCC since their levels are elevated to some extent even in tobacco chewers without any clinically obvious precancerous or cancerous lesions in the oral cavity.","output":"Usefulness of salivary sialic acid as a tumor marker in tobacco chewers with oral cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The majority of breast cancer patients are severely psychologically affected by breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent therapeutic procedures. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions on public life have additionally caused significant psychological distress for much of the population. It is therefore plausible that breast cancer patients might be particularly susceptible to the additional psychological stress caused by the pandemic, increasing suffering. In this study we therefore aimed to assess the level of psychological distress currently experienced by a defined group of breast cancer patients in our breast cancer centre, compared to distress levels pre-COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Female breast cancer patients of all ages receiving either adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or palliative therapies were recruited for the study. All patients were screened for current or previous COVID-19 infection. The participants completed a self-designed COVID-19 pandemic questionnaire, the Stress and Coping Inventory (SCI), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network? (NCCN?) Distress Thermometer (DT), the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ C30, and the BR23. RESULTS: Eighty-two breast cancer patients were included. Therapy status and social demographic factors did not have a significant effect on the distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the DT pre and during COVID-19 pandemic did not differ significantly. Using the self-designed COVID-19 pandemic questionnaire, we detected three distinct subgroups demonstrating different levels of concerns in relation to SARS-CoV-2. The subgroup with the highest levels of concern reported significantly decreased life quality, related parameters and symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This monocentric study demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected psychological health in a subpopulation of breast cancer patients. The application of a self-created COVID-19 pandemic questionnaire could potentially be used to help identify breast cancer patients who are susceptible to increased psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore may need additional intensive psychological support.

Building on our previous work, together with recent cryo-EM structures of hERG, we set about to better understand the energetic and structural basis of promiscuous blocker-hERG binding in the context of Biodynamics theory. We propose a two-step blocker binding process consisting of: The initial capture step: diffusion of a single fully solvated blocker copy into a large cavity lined by the intra-cellular cyclic nucleotide binding homology domain (CNBHD). Occupation of this cavity is a necessary but insufficient condition for ion current disruption.The IKr disruption step: translocation of the captured blocker along the channel axis, such that: The head group, consisting of a quasi-rod-shaped moiety, projects into the open pore, accompanied by partial de-solvation of the binding interface.One tail moiety packs along a kink between the S6 helix and proximal C-linker helix adjacent to the intra-cellular entrance of the pore, likewise accompanied by mutual de-solvation of the binding interface (noting that the association barrier is comprised largely of the total head + tail group de-solvation cost).Blockers containing a highly planar moiety that projects into a putative constriction zone within the closed channel become trapped upon closing, as do blockers terminating prior to this region.A single captured blocker copy may conceivably associate and dissociate to/from the pore many times before exiting the CNBHD cavity.

CLINICAL FINDINGS Whole-body radiography revealed a mineralized egg of normal size and shape. However, no oviposition occurred, and the bird had no signs consistent with dystocia. After 7 days, repeated radiography revealed that the egg had rotated by approximately 180 along its short axis, leading to a diagnosis of ectopic egg retention, which was supported by the results of ultrasonography. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Surgical removal of the ectopic egg was performed by means of a ventral midline approach 14 days after administration of leuprolide acetate (800 g/kg [364 g/lb], IM). No intracoelomic abnormalities, such as coelomitis or oviductal disease, were diagnosed, and the bird recovered without complications. Physical examination and whole-body radiography at 8 months and a follow-up phone call with the owner at 16 months after surgical treatment revealed no evidence of ectopic egg recurrence or reproductive behavior. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Clinical management of ectopic egg retention differs considerably from treatment of intraoviductal egg binding. Therefore, careful evaluation of avian patients with radiographic evidence of egg binding should be performed to avoid possible iatrogenic deterioration of the patient's condition, secondary to inappropriate treatment attempts such as hormonal induction of oviposition or attempts to remove the retained egg via the cloaca. Repeated radiography and ultrasonography and close monitoring of the patient's general condition as well as the lack of clinical signs consistent with dystocia will facilitate the diagnosis of ectopic egg retention.","output":"Clinical management of an ectopic egg in a Timneh African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus timneh)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How should health authorities communicate to motivate the public to comply with health advice during a prolonged health crisis such as a pandemic? During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, for example, people have had to comply with successive restrictions as the world faced multiple races between controlling new waves of the virus and the development and implementation of vaccines. Here, we examine how health authorities and governments most effectively motivate the public by focusing on a specific race: between the Alpha variant and the implementation of the first generation of COVID-19 vaccinations in the winter of 2021. Following prior research on crisis communication, we focus on appeals to fear and hope using communicative aids in the form of visualizations based on epidemiological modelling. Using a population-based experiment conducted in United States ([Formula: see text] ), we demonstrate that a hope-oriented visual communication aid, depicting the competing effects on the epidemic curve of (1) a more infectious variant and (2) vaccinations, motivates public action more effectively than a fear-oriented visual communication, focusing exclusively on the threat of the new variant. The importance of the implementation of such hope-oriented messages is further highlighted by cross-national representative surveys from eight countries ([Formula: see text] ), which demonstrate that feelings of fear towards the Alpha variant alone were insufficient to activate strong compliance. Overall, these findings provide general insights into the importance of hope as a health communication strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","output":"Communicate hope to motivate the public during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The AAP and NASPGHAN recommend either exclusively breastfeeding for at least 6 months or an FDA-reviewed infant formula or donor breast milk from an established milk bank as alternatives. The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence of contemporary infant feeding practices such as informal human milk sharing, imported European infant formula, toddler formula and homemade formula and gain insight into the parental reasoning for their choices. STUDY DESIGN An anonymous, cross-sectional, voluntary electronic survey was sent to active prescribers to a Yumi (a baby subscription food company) list server in April and May, 2021. Basic demographic, utilization of infant feeding practices and general feeding practices were collected. RESULTS Of 2,315 respondents, at least 18% of the families were following at least one contemporary feeding practice. 36% of parents using donor breast milk obtained it from unregulated sources, 14% of the respondents were using European infant formula, 5% were using toddler formula for their infants, and 2% were making home-made infant formula. CONCLUSION The AAP has clear guidelines on infant nutrition and breastfeeding and when not possible, FDA reviewed infant formula or donor breast milk from an established milk bank as alternatives. Yet, our study found that at least 18% of the families across the US were following at least one contemporary feeding practice with possible nutritional and safety concerns.

Objective Since it is believed that Type 1/Th1immunity controls viral infections, and that there is a Th1/Th2 counter-regulation, we hypothesized that Th2 targeting with the IL-4R-antagonist, dupilumab, in patients with moderate-to-severe AD rebalances Th1/Th2 axis, potentially leading to attenuated COVID-19 symptoms. Methods 1,237 moderate-to-severe AD patients in the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Department of Dermatology were enrolled in a registry. Patients were screened for COVID-19-related symptoms and assigned a severity score (asymptomatic[0]-fatal[5]). Scores were compared among 3 treatment groups: dupilumab (n=632), other systemic treatments (n=107), and limited/no treatment (n=498). Demographic and comorbid covariates were adjusted by multivariate generalized logistic regression models. Results The dupilumab-treated group showed reduced incidence and severity of COVID-19 symptoms versus other treatment groups. Dupilumab-treated patients were less likely to experience moderate-to-severe symptoms versus patients on other systemics (p=0.01) and on limited/no treatment (p=0.04), and less likely to experience any symptoms versus patients on other systemics (p=0.01). This effect was seen in our entire cohort and in the subgroup of patients with verified COVID-19 or high-risk exposure. Conclusions Patients on dupilumab experienced less severe COVID-19 manifestations and lesser symptoms compared to patients on other systemics and on limited/no treatment. These results suggest that Th2 modulation with dupilumab may have a protective effect on anti-viral immune response in AD patients.","output":"COVID-19 symptoms are attenuated in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis patients treated with dupilumab"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating complication in patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) due to respiratory or cardiac issues. Neurosurgical evaluation and management of such cases has only insufficiently been studied. We conducted a retrospective, cohort study of adult patients treated with ECMO between January 2007 and January 2017 in a tertiary healthcare center. Demographics, clinical data, coagulation status, ICH characteristics, and treatment modalities were analyzed. The primary outcome parameter was defined as mortality caused by ICH during ECMO. 525 patients with ECMO therapy were eligible for analysis. An overall incidence for any type of intracranial bleeding of 12.3% was found. Small hemorrhages accounted for 6.4% and acute subdural and epidural hematoma for 1.2%. Twenty-four (4.6%) patients developed ICH, and 11 patients (46%) died due to the ICH. Mortality was significantly higher in patients with larger ICH volumes (86.8  34.8 ml vs 9.9  20.3 ml, p < 0.001), intraventricular hemorrhage (83% vs 8%, p = 0.01), and a fluid level inside the ICH (75% vs 31%, p = 0.04). All patients were classified according to the bleeding pattern on the initial CT scan into 3 types. Patients with type 1 bleeding were statistically more likely to die (p < 0.001). In 15 out of 24 patients (63%), correction of the coagulation status was possible within 12 h after ICH onset. Seven out of 9 patients (78%) without early coagulation correction died compared to 2 out of 15 patients (13%), in whom early coagulation correction was successful (p = 0.01).

AIMS: The present study aimed to document: (i) changes in the use of telepractice by speech\\\\language pathology (SLP) professionals in Quebec since the start of the COVID\\\\19 outbreak; (ii) perceptions of the feasibility of telepractice by SLPs; (iii) barriers to the use of telepractice; and (iv) the perceptions of SLP professionals regarding the main issues of telepractice. METHODS & PROCEDURES: An online survey with closed and open, Likert scale and demographic questions was completed by 83 SLPs in Quebec in June and July 2020. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: The survey responses showed that within the cohort responding, telepractice use has increased significantly as a response to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Most respondents planned to continue using telepractice after the pandemic ends. In addition, the respondents considered telepractice to be adequate for many clinical practices but less so for others (e.g., swallowing disorders, hearing impairment). Most of the reported barriers to the use of telepractice concerned technological problems and a lack of clinical materials for online use. Confidentiality and privacy issues were also raised. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: SLP professionals rapidly took advantage of existing technologies in their clinical settings to cope with the pandemic's effects on service delivery. The discrepancy between their perceptions and the evidence in the literature for some practices and populations strengthens the need for more information and education on telepractice. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT: The proportion of speech\\\\language pathologists (SLPs) in Canada who use telepractice for clinical activities is unknown. Knowing this information became crucial in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic because non\\\\essential activities were interrupted to halt the spread of the disease. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE: The findings from this survey study confirmed that the use of telepractice in SLP in Quebec increased significantly during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Moreover, the majority of the respondents began using telepractice because of the pandemic, and most planned to continue doing so after it ends. This demonstrates how SLP professionals rapidly took advantage of existing technologies in their clinical settings to cope with the pandemic's effects on service delivery. WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WORK? Although the SLPs expressed an overall positive perception of telepractice, they also highlighted barriers to its optimal use. The findings of this study should help employers and regulatory bodies in Quebec to bring down those barriers and make telepractice in SLP a durable, effective and efficient service delivery model.","output":"Proactive changes in clinical practice as a result of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic: Survey on use of telepractice by Quebec speech\\\\language pathologists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research aims to measure the effectiveness of online learning programs during the COVID-19 pandemic in improving the quality of education at one of the Islamic School in Jakarta.

The study aimed to demonstrate such an effectiveness in the alteration of the epidemic curves from theory to practice. Methods The empirical data on the daily reported COVID-19 cases were extracted from open source. A computer simulation design in conjunction with the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) type model was applied to evaluating confinement measures in Italy with adjustment for underreported cases; isolation and quarantine in Taiwan; and NPIs and vaccination in Israel. Results In Italy scenario, the extents of confinement measures were 34% before the end of March and then scaled up to 70% after then. Both figures were reduced to 22-69% after adjusting for underreported cases. Approximately 44% of confinement measures was implemented in the second surge of pandemic in Italy. Fitting the observational data on Taiwan assuming the initial outbreak similar to Wuhan, China, 44% of isolation and quarantine was estimated before 23th March 2020. Isolation and quarantine were scaled up to 90% and at least 60% to contain community-acquired outbreaks from March 24th 2020 onwards. Given 15% monthly vaccination rate from December 2020 in Israel, the effectiveness estimates of reducing the infected toll were 36%, 56%, and 85% for NPIs alone, vaccination alone, and both combined, respectively.

The use of non-invasive neuromonitoring in subjects without primary brain injury but with potential neurological derangement is gaining attention outside the intensive care unit (ICU). This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates the use of non-invasive multimodal neuromonitoring of the brain in non-critically ill patients with COVID-19 outside the ICU and quantifies the prevalence of abnormal neuromonitoring findings in this population. METHODS: A structured literature search was performed in MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and EMBASE to investigate the use of non-invasive neuromonitoring tools, including transcranial doppler (TCD); optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD); near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS); pupillometry; and electroencephalography (EEG) inpatients with COVID-19 outside the ICU. The proportion of non-ICU patients with CVOID-19 and a particular neurological feature at neuromonitoring at the study time was defined as prevalence. RESULTS: A total of 6,593 records were identified through literature searching. Twenty-one studies were finally selected, comprising 368 non-ICU patients, of whom 97 were considered for the prevalence of meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of electroencephalographic seizures, periodic and rhythmic patterns, slow background abnormalities, and abnormal background on EEG was.17 (95% CI 0.04C0.29), 0.42 (95% CI 0.01C0.82), 0.92 (95% CI 0.83C1.01), and.95 (95% CI 0.088C1.09), respectively. No studies investigating NIRS and ONSD outside the ICU were found. The pooled prevalence for abnormal neuromonitoring findings detected using the TCD and pupillometry were incomputable due to insufficient data. CONCLUSIONS: Neuromonitoring tools are non-invasive, less expensive, safe, and bedside available tools with a great potential for both diagnosis and monitoring of patients with COVID-19 at risk of brain derangements.

All countries have taken measures to control the spread of the epidemic. Because it is not known when the epidemic will end in several countries, then the prediction of the COVID-19 pandemic is a very important challenge. This study has predicted the temporal evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries using the logistic growth model. This model has analyzed several countries to describe the epidemic situation of these countries. The time interval of the actual data used as a comparison with the prediction results of this model was starting in the firstly confirmed COVID-19 cases to December 2020. This study examined an approach to the complexity spread of the COVID-19 pandemic using the logistic growth model formed from an ordinary differential equation. This model described the time-dependent population growth rate characterized by the three parameters of the analytical solution. The non-linear least-squares method was used to estimate the three parameters. These parameters described the rate growth constant of infected cases and the total number of confirmed cases in the final phase of the epidemic. This model is applied to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries. The prediction results show the spread dynamics of COVID-19 infected cases which are characterized by time-dependent dynamics. In this study, the proposed model provides estimates for the model parameters that are good for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic because they correspond to actual data for all analyzed countries. It is based on the coefficient of determination, R(2), and the R(2) value of more than 95% which is obtained from the non-linear curves for all analyzed countries.

The aims of this study were to compare the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of inpatients in the intensive-care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients. METHODS: We recruited 416 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and divided them into two groups: ICU (n = 35) and non-ICU (n = 381). Medical histories, laboratory findings, and echocardiography data were compared. RESULTS: The levels of myocardial injury markers in ICU vs non-ICU patients were as follows: troponin I (0.029 ng/mL [0.007-0.063] vs 0.006 ng/mL [0.006-0.006]) and myoglobin (65.45 g/L [39.77-130.57] vs 37.00 g/L [26.40-53.54]). Echocardiographic findings included ventricular wall thickening (12 [39%] vs 1 [4%]), pulmonary hypertension (9 [29%] vs 0 [0%]), and reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction (5 [16%] vs 0 [0%]). Overall, 10% of the ICU patients presented with right heart enlargement, thickened right-ventricular wall, decreased right heart function, and pericardial effusion.

Thus, it may impact accuracy in signaling O(3) formation regimes. In this study, an advanced three-dimensional numerical modeling system was used to investigate the relationship between atmospheric oxidation and O(3) formation regimes during a long-lasting O(3) exceedance event in September 2017 over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) of China. We discovered a clear relationship between atmospheric oxidative capacity and O(3) formation regime. Over eastern PRD, O(3) formation was mainly in a NO(x)-limited regime when HO(2)/OH ratio was higher than 11, while in a VOC-limited regime when the ratio was lower than 9.5. Over central and western PRD, an HO(2)/OH ratio higher than 5 and lower than 2 was indicative of NO(x)-limited and VOC-limited regime, respectively. Physical contribution, including horizontal transport and vertical transport, may pose uncertainties on the indication of O(3) formation regime by HO(2)/OH ratio.

Owing to its rarity and heterogeneous phenotype, it is often underrecognized, resulting in delayed diagnosis, including diagnosis after end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) has occurred or recurrence after kidney-only transplantation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old Caucasian Canadian woman with a history of recurrent nephrolithiasis since age 19 presented with ESKD and cutaneous symptoms. She had no known prior kidney disease and no family history of kidney disease or nephrolithiasis. DIAGNOSIS: A diagnosis of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) due to homozygous splice donor mutation (AGXT c.680+1G>A) was made with kidney and cutaneous pathology demonstrating calcium oxalate deposition and ultrasound suggestive of nephrocalcinosis. INTERVENTIONS: She was initiated on frequent, high-efficiency, high-flux conventional hemodialysis and oral pyridoxine. Lumasiran was added 11 months later, after she developed bilateral swan-neck deformities. OUTCOMES: After 14 months of high-intensity dialysis and 3 months of lumasiran, there have been no signs of renal recovery, and extra-renal involvement has increased with progressive swan-neck deformities, reduced cardiac systolic function, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient has been waitlisted for kidney-liver transplantation. TEACHING POINTS: This case report describes an adult presentation of PH1. The case highlights the importance of timely workup of metabolic causes of recurrent nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis in adults which can be a presenting sign of PH and genetic testing for PH to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment especially in the era of novel therapeutics that may alter disease course and outcomes.

TDDS are more convenient and less invasive tools for disease and viral infection treatment, prevention, detection, and surveillance. The emerging development of microneedles for TDDS has facilitated improved skin barrier penetration for the delivery of macromolecules or hydrophilic drugs. Microneedle TDDS patches can be fabricated to deliver virus vaccines and potentially provide a viable alternative vaccine modality that offers improved immunogenicity, thermostability, simplicity, safety, and compliance as well as sharp-waste reduction, increased cost-effectiveness, and the capacity for self-administration, which could improve vaccine distribution. These advantages make TDDS-based vaccine delivery an especially well-suited option for treatment of widespread viral infectious diseases including pandemics. Because microneedle-based bioassays employ transdermal extraction of interstitial fluid or blood, they can be used as a minimally invasive approach for surveying disease markers and providing point-of-care (POC) diagnostics. For cutaneous viral infections, TDDS can provide localized treatment with high specificity and less systemic toxicity. In summary, TDDS, especially those that employ microneedles, possess special attributes that can be leveraged to reduce morbidity and mortality from viral infectious diseases.

However, industrial logistics between the end customer and manufacturing supply chain still demands human labor and intelligence. This logistic work requires engineers with experienced knowledge to identify machining processes from the CAD model provided by customers at the beginning, and later sourcing for qualified manufacturing suppliers according to identified manufacturing processes. Developing an efficient automatic Machining Process Identification (MPI) system becomes a pivotal problem for logistic automation. In this paper, a novel MPI system is presented based on 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer learning. The proposed system admits triangularly tessellated surface (STL) models as inputs and outputs machining process labels (e.g. milling, turning etc.) as the results of classification of the neural network. Computer-synthesized workpiece models are utilized in training the neural network. In addition to the MPI system, a portable framework was developed for future applications in related fields. The MPI system shows more than 98% accuracy for both synthesized models and real workpiece models which verifies its robustness and real-time reliability.","output":"Deep Learning Based Approach for Identifying Conventional Machining Processes from CAD Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of COVID-19 is spreading everywhere in the world which subsequently has led the world into the most existential health emergency, even in the second wave.

We mapped each survey question to ACGME core competencies to identify common themes. We performed two-sample t tests to compare perceived self-confidence in faculty assessment and resident performance of key telemedicine clinical skills. Results A total of 29 respondents (15 faculty, 14 residents) completed the survey. Both residents and faculty expressed comfort with obtaining a focused history, ruling out red flag symptoms, formulating a differential diagnosis, and planning follow-up care. Faculty reported confidence in their ability to provide feedback about medical knowledge and clinical decision making, but also identified a need for better feedback tools. Both faculty and residents identified a need for better teaching of physical exam skills during video visits. There were no statistically significant differences for perceived self-confidence in evaluating and performing key telemedicine skills between faculty and residents, respectively.

Metapopulation models for the disease spread were simulated in order to evaluate the risk of infection of each city within the states, by ranking them according to the time the disease will take to infect each city. We observed that, although the high-risk regions are those closer to the capital cities, where the outbreak has started, there are also cities in the countryside with great risk.

Hitherto, 183 studies were included, reporting data from 64,876 patients with COVID-19 worldwide. The overall prevalence of taste disorders was 38% (95% CI = 22% to 56%, I2 = 98%). Hypogeusia, dysgeusia, and ageusia were also evaluated by a meta-analysis, and the pooled prevalence was 34% for hypogeusia, 33% for dysgeusia, and 26% for ageusia. Taste disorders were associated with a positive COVID-19 test (odds ratio [OR] = 7.54, 95% CI = 5.24 to 10.86, I2 = 93%, P < 0.00001), showing high certainty of evidence.

In an effort to augment the capabilities of existing diagnostic methodologies, the use of virus-specific DNA microarray technology has been recently applied in both research and clinical settings with favorable results. The primary advantage of this approach is that DNA microarrays containing literally thousands of virus-specific sequences allow simultaneous testing for essentially all known viral species. While previous methods have been limited to testing for a single pathogen, or small numbers of specific pathogens, a panviral assay is less biased and can be designed to detect variant or even novel members of existing viral families. The use of DNA microarrays in both research and clinical settings has the potential to substantially increase the number of instances in which a virus may be identified in biological samples. With the proper bioinformatics methodologies, this technology will also maximize the probability that previously uncharacterized pathogens are detected potentially leading to an improved understanding of the etiology for many chronic human diseases.

Conversely, Uruguay stands out as an outlier managing this health crisis with remarkable success. Methods: We developed a molecular diagnostic test to detect SARS-CoV-2. This methodology was transferred to research institutes, public hospitals and academic laboratories all around the country, creating a COVID-19 diagnostic lab network. Uruguay also implemented active epidemiological surveillance following the Test, Trace and Isolate (TETRIS) strategy coupled to real-time genomic epidemiology. Results: Three months after the first cases were detected, the number of positive individuals reached 826 (23 deaths, 112 active cases and 691 recovered). The Uruguayan strategy was based in a close synergy established between the national health authorities and the scientific community. In turn, academia rapidly responded to develop national RT-qPCR tests. Consequently, Uruguay was able to perform ~1,000 molecular tests per day in a matter of weeks. The COVID-19 diagnostic lab network performed more than 54% of the molecular tests in the country. This, together with real-time genomics, were instrumental to implement the TETRIS strategy, helping to contain domestic transmission of the main outbreaks registered so far. Conclusions: Uruguay has successfully navigated the first trimester of the COVID-19 health crisis in South America.

Severe DKA risk at the onset of T1D has recently significantly increased during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with life-threatening complications often due to its management. DKA is marked by low pH (<7.3) and bicarbonates (<15 mmol/L) in the presence of ketone bodies in plasma or urine, while HHS has normal pH (>7.3) and bicarbonates (>15 mmol/L) with no or very low ketone bodies. Despite this, ketone monitoring is not universally available, and DKA diagnosis is mainly based on pH and bicarbonates. A proper diagnosis of the right form with main elements (pH, bicarbonates, ketones) is essential to begin the right treatment and to identify organ damage (such as acute kidney injury). CASE PRESENTATIONS: In this series, we describe 3 case reports in which the onset of T1D was abrupt with severe acidosis (pH < 7.1) in the absence of both DKA and HHS. In a further evaluation, all 3 patients showed acute kidney injury, which caused low bicarbonates and severe acidosis without increasing ketone bodies. CONCLUSION: Even if it is not routinely recommended, a proper treatment that included bicarbonates was then started, with a good response in terms of clinical and laboratory values. With this case series, we would like to encourage emergency physicians to monitor ketones, which are diriment for a proper diagnosis and treatment of DKA.","output":"Case Report: Role of Ketone Monitoring in Diabetic Ketoacidosis With Acute Kidney Injury: Better Safe Than Sorry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious disease surveillance is one of the most valuable tools in monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic.

Design/methodology/approach: This analysis centers on a masters-level course in which students design software to support learning. One of the major changes to the course revolves around the transition from a traditional rubric-based grading scheme to a specifications grading system. This latter approach provides a series of binary (pass/fail) requirements (specifications) that students must meet to pass. Various forms of interactions were also altered during the transition; the authors investigate these in the paper. Findings: This study found that the move to specifications grading helped students and the instructor to focus on the important work of meeting course learning goals. The approach also aligned well with authentic scenarios in which software projects are tested against certain specifications. Finally, this study concludes that thinking about specifications grading in the future can help us to develop more resilient pedagogical design approaches that respond to various forms of disruptions and changes.

On March 8, while testing availability for SARS-CoV-2 was still limited, DOHMH announced sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (1). At this time, twenty-six NYC residents had confirmed COVID-19, and ED visits for influenza-like illness* increased, despite decreased influenza virus circulation.? The following week, on March 15, when only seven of the 56 (13%) patients with known exposure histories had exposure outside of NYC, the level of community SARS-CoV-2 transmission status was elevated from sustained community transmission to widespread community transmission (2).

It has been reported that people with chronic pain experience decision-making impairments, but these findings have been based on conventional laboratory experiments to date. In such experiments, researchers have extensive control of conditions and can more precisely eliminate potential confounds. In contrast, there is much less known regarding how chronic pain affects decision-making captured via laboratory-in-the-field experiments. Although such settings can introduce more experimental uncertainty, collecting data in more ecologically valid contexts can better characterize the real-world impact of chronic pain. OBJECTIVE: We aim to quantify decision-making differences between individuals with chronic pain and healthy controls in a laboratory-in-the-field environment by taking advantage of internet technologies and social media. METHODS: A cross-sectional design with independent groups was used. A convenience sample of 45 participants was recruited through social media: 20 (44%) participants who self-reported living with chronic pain, and 25 (56%) people with no pain or who were living with pain for <6 months acting as controls. All participants completed a self-report questionnaire assessing their pain experiences and a neuropsychological task measuring their decision-making (ie, the Iowa Gambling Task) in their web browser at a time and location of their choice without supervision. RESULTS: Standard behavioral analysis revealed no differences in learning strategies between the 2 groups, although qualitative differences could be observed in the learning curves. However, computational modeling revealed that individuals with chronic pain were quicker to update their behavior than healthy controls, which reflected their increased learning rate (95% highestCposterior-density interval [HDI] 0.66-0.99) when fitted to the Values-Plus-Perseverance model. This result was further validated and extended on the Outcome-Representation Learning model as higher differences (95% HDI 0.16-0.47) between the reward and punishment learning rates were observed when fitted to this model, indicating that individuals with chronic pain were more sensitive to rewards. It was also found that they were less persistent in their choices during the Iowa Gambling Task compared with controls, a fact reflected by their decreased outcome perseverance (95% HDI ?4.38 to ?0.21) when fitted using the Outcome-Representation Learning model. Moreover, correlation analysis revealed that the estimated parameters had predictive value for the self-reported pain experiences, suggesting that the altered cognitive parameters could be potential candidates for inclusion in chronic pain assessments. CONCLUSIONS: We found that individuals with chronic pain were more driven by rewards and less consistent when making decisions in our laboratory-in-the-field experiment. In this case study, it was demonstrated that, compared with standard statistical summaries of behavioral performance, computational approaches offered superior ability to resolve, understand, and explain the differences in decision-making behavior in the context of chronic pain outside the laboratory.","output":"Differences in Learning and Persistency Characterizing Behavior in Chronic Pain for the Iowa Gambling Task: Web-Based Laboratory-in-the-Field Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study investigated the detection of severe acute respiratory syndromeCcoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes at each treatment stage of 14 aerobic wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities in two states of Rajasthan and Uttarakhand in Northern India.

RESULTS: The study shows that TCM is well integrated in the Chinese health care system as one of the two mainstream medical practices. Also, the Chinese government is supportive of TCM development by increasing investment in TCM research and administration. However, there is downsizing of TCM utilization, a lack of TCM professionals with genuine TCM knowledge and skills, and limitations of and increasing public opinions on modernization and westernization. CONCLUSIONS: TCM is still facing many challenges in playing critical roles in improving public health in China. These challenges can be explained from different perspectives.

Theoretical and empirical literature implies that individuals who are characterized by catastrophic appraisals of somatic cues, a tendency known as anxiety sensitivity, as well as by older subjective age, might be particularly vulnerable to depression and anxiety during the pandemic. Furthermore, subjective age might moderate the relations between anxiety sensitivity with depression and anxiety symptoms. Yet, research to date has not explored the contribution of both anxiety sensitivity and subjective age in explaining distress following stress in general, nor in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Filling this gap, a convenience sample of 828 participants, (Mage = 43.98, SD = 14.06), filled questionnaires measuring background variables, COVID-19 related stressors, anxiety sensitivity, subjective age, and anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic. RESULTS: Positive associations were found between anxiety sensitivity and subjective age, on the one hand, and anxiety and depression symptoms, on the other. Furthermore, subjective age moderated the associations between anxiety sensitivity with depression and anxiety symptoms. Although higher levels of anxiety sensitivity were related to depression and anxiety during the pandemic, these associations were stronger among participants with an older subjective age. DISCUSSION: The findings are consistent with theories that view subjective age as an intra-individual construct involved in modulating important mental health outcomes in the context of coping with stress.","output":"The Toll of Feeling Older: Subjective Age Moderates the Associations between Anxiety Sensitivity and Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The organization of the response to infectious disease outbreaks by public health agencies at the federal, state, and local levels has historically been based on traditional public health functions (e.g., epidemiology, surveillance, laboratory, infection control, and health communications).

Therefore, public health agencies have had to find a way to incorporate traditional public health functions into the common response framework of the National Incident Management System. One solution is the development of a Science Section, containing public health functions, that is equivalent to the traditional incident command system sections.

This study evaluates the relative oral bioavailability of BCP formulated in a self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) based on VESIsorb(?) formulation technology (BCP-SEDDS) compared to BCP neat oil. Hence, a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design, single oral dose study (100 mg BCP) in 24 healthy subjects (12 men/12 women) was performed under fasting conditions. Pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed from individual concentration-time curves. The data show that BCP-SEDDS resulted in a 2.2/2.0-fold increase in AUC(0C12h)/AUC(0C24h) and a 3.6-fold increase in C(max) compared to BCP neat oil. Moreover, BCP was absorbed faster from BCP-SEDDS (T(max): 1.43 h) compared to BCP neat oil (T(max): 3.07 h).

Unlike responses to single Cu or Fe deprivation, the consequences of simultaneous Cu and Fe deficiency have not yet been fully deciphered. Previously, it was demonstrated that Cu and Fe deficiency applied in combination imposes transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome changes different from those triggered under each deficiency individually. Here, we evaluated the effect of alternative splicing (AS) on the transcriptome of rosette leaves under single and simultaneous Cu and Fe deficiency. Differentially spliced genes (DSGs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) coincided in number (2,600 approx.) although the overlapping fraction was minimal (15%). Functional annotation of changes exclusively detected under simultaneous Cu and Fe deficiency revealed that DEGs participated in general stress responses and translation, while DSGs were involved in metabolic reactions, especially amino acid biosynthesis. Interestingly, transcripts encoding central features for tryptophan (Trp) and asparagine (Asn) synthesis - two significantly altered metabolites under simultaneous Cu and Fe deficiency - underwent exclusive intron retention events under the double deficiency. However, transcript and protein amounts for these enzymes did not correlate with Trp and Asn concentration. In consequence, we propose that AS might act as a regulatory mechanism to modify the stability and/or functionality of the enzymes and therefore fine-tune amino acid production during the combinatorial response to simultaneous Cu and Fe deficiency.","output":"Analysis of Alternative Splicing During the Combinatorial Response to Simultaneous Copper and Iron Deficiency in Arabidopsis Reveals Differential Events in Genes Involved in Amino Acid Metabolism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) disproportionately affects African Americans, and they tend to experience more severe course and adverse outcomes. Using a simple and validated instrument of depression screening, we evaluated the incidence and severity of major depression among African American patients within 90 days of recovery from severe COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. METHODS: African American patients hospitalized and treated with invasive mechanical ventilation for COVID-19-associated respiratory failure in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, were screened for depression within 90 days of hospital discharge using the validated patient health questionnaires (PHQ-2) and PHQ-9. RESULTS: A total of 73 patients completed the questionnaire. The median age was 52.5 years [IQR 44C65] and 65% were males. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (66%) and diabetes mellitus (51%). Forty-four percent of the patients had a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) based on their PHQ-9 questionnaire responses. The incidence of MDD was higher among females (69%, n=18/26) compared to males (29%, n=14/47), in patients > 75 years (66%) and those with multiple comorbidities (45%). Eighteen percent of the patients had moderate depression, while 15% and 22% had moderately severe and severe depression, respectively.

Cancer patients are a very special population in this setting since they are more susceptible to viral infections than the general population. Several recommendations have been made on this issue, most of them based on expert opinion and institutional experience. It is essential to gather the evidence available for decision making. OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence available in order to create a multi-institutional position from the perspective of scientific societies in Argentina involved in the management of cancer patients. METHODOLOGY: The review included two phases: 1) search and systematic revision of the medical literature; 2) consensus and revision of the document drafted by national scientific societies involved in the management and care of cancer patients using the modified Delphi method. The final results were presented at a videoconference with all the participants. Also, additional comment and recommendations were discussed. The final document was revised and approved for publication by the members of the panel. RESULTS: The consensus panel included 18 representatives from scientific societies from Argentina who assessed the evidence and then made recommendations for the management of cancer patients in our country. International guidelines (CDC; ASCO, NCCN and ESMO) were considered as a background for analysis, as well as institutional guidelines and an open ad hoc survey administered to 114 healthcare professionals from the scientific societies involved in this study. The recommendations are grouped as follows: 1) general care interventionstraining of the personnel, cleaning and disinfection of the hospital premises and patient scheduling; 2) treatment decisionspatient care, surgeries, immunosuppressive therapy, radiotherapy and screening; 3) ethical considerationsoptimisation of resources, end-of-life care for critically-ill patients; 4) management of hospitalised patients; and 5) wellbeing of the healthcare team. The general recommendation arising from the study is that the management of cancer patients must adapt to the exceptional pandemic status quo without disregarding treatment or cure options. Moreover, healthcare professional accompaniment of all patients should not be neglected. All healthcare professionals must make a significant joint effort to create multidisciplinary teams to discuss the most appropriate measures for each particular situation. CONCLUSIONS: The scientific evidence available on this topic worldwide is in progress. This together with the epidemiologically shifting scenario poses unprecedented challenges in the management of cancer amidst this global pandemic. Furthermore, the key role of the healthcare structural organisation appears evident, such as the drafting of clear guidelines for all the stakeholders, adaptability to constant change and an interdisciplinary shared vision through consensus to provide adequate care to our cancer patients in the light of uncertainty and fast-paced change.","output":"Multidisciplinary approach to COVID-19 and cancer: consensus from scientific societies in Argentina"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Convalescent Plasma (CP) therapy is of interest as no vaccine or specific treatment is available for emerging viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causing Covid-19.

METHODS: CP treatment was applied to 26 Covid-19 patients in intensive care unit who had quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction positive Sars-Cov-2 infection. Plasma was collected at least 14 days after complete recovery from patients who had mild or moderate infection with Sars-Cov-2 infection. The collected CP (200cc) were applied to severe Covid-19 patients. Laboratory values of patients just before CP and after 7 days were compared. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet, CRP, ferritin, LDH, ALT, AST, sO2 and total bilirubin values just before and after 1 week of CP. A statistically significant difference was found between age and lymphocyte values of living and dying patients. The patients who died were determined to have older age (74,6 vs 61,85, p = 0,018) and more severe lymphopenia (0,47 vs 1,18, p = 0,001).

Metamorphosis progresses via the interaction of thyroid hormone and adrenal corticosteroids, of which secretion is enhanced by thyrotropin and corticotropin, respectively. However, unlike in mammals, the hypothalamic releasing factor for thyrotropin is not thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), but corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and the major releasing factor for corticotropin is arginine vasotocin (AVT). Prolactin, the release of which is profoundly enhanced by TRH at the metamorphic climax, is another pituitary hormone involved in metamorphosis. Prolactin has a dual role: modulation of the metamorphic speed and the development of organs for adult life.

Methodology: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at Medical Center Hospital, Chattogram, Bangladesh. The study included two hundred and fifty-nine patients with T2DM. Data regarding sociodemographic factors, patients characteristics, medication factors, physician-related factors, and noncompliance were collected using a pretested and structured questionnaire. Treatment adherence was assessed by Morisky Medication Adherence Scales (MMAS-8). Data analyses were conducted on SPSS v23.0 Software. Results: The majority of the participants (56%) were in the 40-45 years of age group, followed by 32% in the older age group (>/=60 years), and 62.5% of them were male. One hundred and sixty eight (64.86%) patients were considered low adherent as per the response of the MMAS-8 scale (score <6), followed by 57 (22.0%) patients were regarded as high adherent (score 8) and 34 (13.13%) patients were considered medium adherent (score 6-7) to treatment. Observing the frequency distribution for noncompliance, financial concerns (32.3 %), forgetfulness (27.7%), a busy daily schedule (17.7%), and fear of antihyperglycemic drug side effects were all identified as significant explanations.

As the psychological burden of the continuing pandemic accrues, the probability of an impending mental health crisis is increasing, especially in countries with greater infection and death rates than South Korea. Comprehensive efforts to address the psychological aftermath of the pandemic are urgently needed.","output":"Deterioration of mental health despite successful control of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing, also referred to as physical distancing, means creating a safe distance of at least two meters (six feet) between yourself and others. This is a term popularized during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it is one of the most important measures to prevent the spread of this virus. However, the term 'social distancing' can be misleading, as it may imply that individuals should stop socializing. However, socializing in a safe context (i.e. over the phone, video-chat, etc.) is especially important during this time of crisis. Therefore, in this narrative review, we suggest the term 'distant socializing' as more apt expression, to promote physical distancing measures while also highlighting the importance of maintaining social bonds. Further, articles discussing the practice, implementation, measurement, and mental health effects of physical distancing are reviewed. Physical distancing is associated with psychiatric symptoms (such as anxiety and depression), suicidal ideation, and domestic violence. Further, unemployment and job insecurity have significantly increased during COVID-19, which may exacerbate these negative mental health effects. Governments, medical institutions, and public health bodies should therefore consider increasing mental health resources both during and after the pandemic, with a specific focus on frontline workers, COVID-19 survivors, and marginalized communities.","output":"'Distant socializing,' not 'social distancing' as a public health strategy for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity in asymptomatic pregnant women admitted to hospital for delivery in a Turkish pandemic center. STUDY DESIGN: This prospective cohort study was conducted in Ankara City Hospital between April, 15, 2020 and June, 5, 2020. A total of 206 asymptomatic pregnant women (103 low-risk pregnant women without any defined risk factor and 103 high-risk pregnant women) were screened for SARS-CoV-2 positivity upon admission to hospital for delivery. Detection of SARS-CoV2 in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples was performed by Real Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) method targeting RdRp (RNA dependent RNA polymerase) gene. Two groups were compared in terms of demographic features, clinical characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. RESULTS: Three of the 206 pregnant women participating in the study had positive RT-PCR tests (1.4 %) and all positive cases were in the high-risk pregnancy group. Although, one case in the high-risk pregnancy group had developed symptoms highly suspicious for COVID-19, two repeated RT-PCR tests were negative. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity rate was significantly higher in the high-risk pregnancy group (2.9 % vs 0%, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Healthcare professionals should be cautious in the labor and delivery of high-risk pregnant women during the pandemic period and universal testing for COVID-19 may be considered in selected populations.","output":"The rate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in asymptomatic pregnant women admitted to hospital for delivery: Experience of a pandemic center in Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has caused a pandemic, sparing few regions. However, limited reports suggest differing infection and death rates across geographic areas including populations that reside at higher elevations (HE). We aimed to determine if COVID-19 infection, death, and case mortality rates differed in higher versus low elevation (LE) U.S. counties. METHODS: Using publicly available geographic and COVID-19 data, we calculated per capita infection and death rates and case mortality in population density matched HE and LE U.S. counties. We also performed population-scale regression analysis to investigate the association between county elevation and COVID-19 infection rates. FINDINGS: Population density matching of LA (< 914m, n = 58) and HE (>2133m, n = 58) counties yielded significantly lower COVID-19 cases at HE versus LE (615 versus 905, p = 0.034). HE per capita deaths were significantly lower than LE (9.4 versus 19.5, p = 0.017). However, case mortality did not differ between HE and LE (1.78% versus 1.46%, p = 0.27). Regression analysis, adjusted for relevant covariates, demonstrated decreased COVID-19 infection rates by 12.82%, 12.01%, and 11.72% per 495m of county centroid elevation, for cases recorded over the previous 30, 90, and 120 days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This population-adjusted, controlled analysis suggests that higher elevation attenuates infection and death. Ongoing work from our group aims to identify the environmental, biological, and social factors of residence at HE that impact infection, transmission, and pathogenesis of COVID-19 in an effort to harness these mechanisms for future public health and/or treatment interventions.","output":"Impact of altitude on COVID-19 infection and death in the United States: A modeling and observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged researchers working in physical contact with research participants.

The spike in research publications following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, however, has been like no other. The global crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has mobilised scientific efforts in an unprecedented way. In less than five months, more than 12,000 research items have been indexed while the number increasing every day. With the crisis affecting all aspects of life, research on Covid-19 seems to have become a focal point of interest across many academic disciplines. Here, scientometric aspects of the Covid-19 literature are analysed and contrasted with those of the two previous major Coronavirus diseases, i.e. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The focus is on the co-occurrence of key-terms, bibliographic coupling and citation relations of journals and collaborations between countries. Certain recurring patterns across all three literatures were discovered. All three outbreaks have commonly generated three distinct and major cohort of studies: (i) studies linked to the public health response and epidemic control, (ii) studies associated with the chemical constitution of the virus and (iii) studies related to treatment, vaccine and clinical care. While studies affiliated with the category (i) seem to have been the first to emerge, they overall received least numbers of citations compared to those of the two other categories. Covid-19 studies seem to have been distributed across a broader variety of journals and subject areas. Clear links are observed between the geographical origins of each outbreak or the local geographical severity of each outbreak and the magnitude of research originated from regions. Covid-19 studies also display the involvement of authors from a broader variety of countries compared to SARS and MRS.","output":"Covid-19 pandemic and the unprecedented mobilisation of scholarly efforts prompted by a health crisis: Scientometric comparisons across SARS, MERS and 2019-nCov literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Density-based directed distances -- particularly known as divergences -- between probability distributions are widely used in statistics as well as in the adjacent research fields of information theory, artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Methods: In an online survey, 2567 police officers (77% male) from Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Spain participated at three measurement points per country in spring, 2020. Three-level growth curve models assessed changes in strain and its relation to stressor appraisal, emotion regulation, and preparedness through training. To add context to the findings, free response answers about officers' main tasks, stressors, and crisis measures were coded inductively. Results: On average, officers seemed to tolerate the pandemic with slight decreases in strain over time. Despite substantial variance between countries, 66% of the variance occurred between individuals. Sex, work experience, stressor appraisal, emotion regulation, and preparedness significantly predicted strain. Risk of infection and deficient communication emerged as main stressors. Officers' reports allowed to derive implications for governmental, organizational, and individual coping strategies during pandemics. Conclusion: Preparing for a pandemic requires three primary paths: 1) enacting unambiguous laws and increasing public compliance through media communication, 2) being logistically prepared, and 3) improving stress regulation skills in police training.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on European police officers: Stress, demands and coping resources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Domestic cats, an important companion animal, can be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Methods: : This is a retrospective, observational study, using a cross-sectional design to compare routine monthly maternal and perinatal statistics three months before and after Covid-19 emergency measures at Mpilo Central Hospital. Results: : Between January-March and April-June 2020, average monthly deliveries fell from 747 to 681 and Caesarean section rates from 29.8% to 26.6%. Women with unbooked pregnancies presenting in labour almost doubled from 4.4% to 8%. There was no substantial change, however, in maternal mortality or severe maternal morbidity (post-partum haemorrhage (PPH), uterine rupture, severe preeclampsia/eclampsia), stillbirth rate or special care baby unit (SCBU) admission. There was a small increase in early neonatal death (ENND) from an average of 18.7 to 24.0 deaths per month. Conclusion: Maternal and perinatal outcomes must continue to be monitored to assess the impact of Covid-19 and lockdown measures as the epidemic in Zimbabwe unfolds.

The current round, round 10, collected swabs from 11 to 30 March 2021 and is compared here to round 9, in which swabs were collected from 4 to 23 February 2021. Results During round 10, we estimated an R number of 1.00 (95% confidence interval 0.81, 1.21). Between rounds 9 and 10 we estimated national prevalence has dropped by ~60% from 0.49% (0.44%, 0.55%) in February to 0.20% (0.17%, 0.23%) in March. There were substantial falls in weighted regional prevalence: in South East from 0.36% (0.29%, 0.44%) in round 9 to 0.07% (0.04%, 0.12%) in round 10; London from 0.60% (0.48%, 0.76%) to 0.16% (0.10%, 0.26%); East of England from 0.47% (0.36%, 0.60%) to 0.15% (0.10%, 0.24%); East Midlands from 0.59% (0.45%, 0.77%) to 0.19% (0.13%, 0.28%); and North West from 0.69% (0.54%, 0.88%) to 0.31% (0.21%, 0.45%). Areas of apparent higher prevalence remain in parts of the North West, and Yorkshire and The Humber. The highest prevalence in March was found among school-aged children 5 to 12 years at 0.41% (0.27%, 0.62%), compared with the lowest in those aged 65 to 74 and 75 and over at 0.09% (0.05%, 0.16%). The close approximation between prevalence of infections and deaths (suitably lagged) is diverging, suggesting that infections may have resulted in fewer hospitalisations and deaths since the start of widespread vaccination. Conclusion We report a sharp decline in prevalence of infections between February and March 2021. We did not observe an increase in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 following the reopening of schools in England, although the decline of prevalence appears to have stopped. Future rounds of REACT-1 will be able to measure the rate of growth or decline from this current plateau and hence help assess the effectiveness of the vaccination roll-out on transmission of the virus as well as the potential size of any third wave during the ensuing months.","output":"REACT-1 round 10 report: Level prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 swab-positivity in England during third national lockdown in March 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"P29 Figure 1DiscussionBronchoscopy procedures declined during the COVID-19 pandemic However, our service maintained 4 lists per week during the peak with reinstatement of six lists during the COVID-endemic period Bronchoscopy training was maintained with all lists having an assigned trainee AGP-related air exchange protocols limited the number of procedures per list and elective procedures were postponed early in the pandemic Our centre had a proactive approach to running the service, introducing mandatory pre-procedure COVID swabbing early together with telephone screening pre-BTS guidance Staff safety was prioritised via universal use of powered air-purifying respiratory (PAPR) use which eliminated the need for mask-fit testing and seeking FFP3 mask availability It is feasible to maintain a safe and efficient bronchoscopy service in the midst of a pandemic with the implementation of appropriate pathways and provision of adequate personal protective equipment","output":"P29 Maintenance of bronchoscopy services during the COVID-19 pandemic: Experience from a tertiary care centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The issues of digital transformation of business in the current context are more pressing than ever.

The majority of CT and NG infections are asymptomatic and missed by the standard of care in most countries (treatment based on symptoms). Thus, it is likely that missed maternal CT and NG infections contribute to preventable adverse health outcomes among women and children globally. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of CT and NG testing for asymptomatic pregnant women to prevent adverse neonatal outcomes, understand the inflammatory response linking CT and NG infections to adverse neonatal outcomes, and conduct an economic analysis of the CT and NG testing intervention. METHODS: The Maduo (results in Setswana) is a prospective, cluster-controlled trial in Gaborone, Botswana to compare a near point-of-care CT and NG testing and treatment intervention implemented in study clinics with standard antenatal care (World Health Organization-endorsed syndromic management strategy based on signs and symptoms without laboratory confirmation) implemented in standard of care clinics among asymptomatic pregnant women. The primary outcome is vertical transmission of CT/NG infection. Secondary outcomes include preterm birth (delivery < 37 completed weeks of gestation) and/or low birth weight (< 2500 g). The trial will also evaluate immunological and inflammatory markers of adverse neonatal outcomes, as well as the costs and cost-effectiveness of the intervention compared with standard care. DISCUSSION: The Maduo study will improve our understanding of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of CT and NG testing among asymptomatic pregnant women. It will also increase knowledge about the CT/NG-related immune responses that might drive adverse neonatal outcomes.

However, an integration of these approaches is not easy to find. This chapter discusses the phenomenon of resistance to change in light of current understandings of the concept as well as new elaborations, which might help to pinpoint specific challenges of digital change resistance. To this end, I will dive into the research traditions that have been built up around the concept. In order to understand resistance to digital change, specifically, I will draw upon the theory of Danish educational researcher Knut Illeris and explore the potential of his writings to explain resistance to digital change from a learning perspective. Throughout I will use examples from higher education digitalization research, to illustrate the respective phenomena. Key navigation points of this chapter are to elaborate resistance to (digital) change both as an individual and a systemic phenomenon and to contribute to a better understanding of resistance to digital change in light of incremental and disruptive change expectations.","output":"Resistance to (Digital) Change: Individual, Systemic and Learning-Related Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder with unambiguous involvement of both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms in the destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Recent evidence demonstrated that neutrophils infiltrate the pancreas prior to disease onset and therein extrude neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), web-like structures of DNA and nuclear proteins with a strong pro-inflammatory biologic activity. Our previous work showed that T1D NETs activate dendritic cells, which consequently induce IFN-producing Th1 lymphocytes. The aim of this study was to assess direct ex vivo biomarkers of NETosis in the serum of recent onset and long-term pediatric T1D patients, their first-degree relatives and healthy controls. To this end we evaluated serum levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE), proteinase 3 (PR3), protein arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4), LL37 and cell-free DNA-histone complexes in sex- and age-matched cohorts of T1D first-degree relatives, recent-onset T1D patients, and in patients 12 months after clinical manifestation of the disease. Our data shows that disease onset is accompanied by peripheral neutrophilia and significant elevation of MPO, NE, PR3, PAD4 and cell-free DNA-histone complexes. Most biomarkers subsequently decrease but do not always normalize in long-term patients. First-degree relatives displayed an intermediate phenotype, except for remarkably high levels of LL37. Together, this report provides evidence for the presence of ongoing NETosis in pediatric patients with T1D at time of clinical manifestation of the disease, which partly subsides in subsequent years.","output":"Elevated Biomarkers of NETosis in the Serum of Pediatric Patients With Type 1 Diabetes and Their First-Degree Relatives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global catastrophe.

This study compared levels of depression and anxiety, the quality of social relationships, and the temperament of infants of treatment-seeking mothers in Ontario, Canada prior to and during the pandemic. METHODS Mothers with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores 10 and seeking treatment for PPD prior to COVID-19 (n = 100) were compared to those who sought treatment during the pandemic (n = 120). Mothers self-reported symptoms of depression, worry/anxiety, partner relationship quality, social support, as well as aspects of the mother-infant relationship and infant temperament. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences in symptoms of depression, anxiety, or the quality of social relationships between women seeking treatment for PPD before or during the pandemic. However, mothers reported poorer relationships with their infants, and there was evidence of more negative emotionality in their infants during COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS The pandemic may not have worsened depression, anxiety, relationships with partners, or social support in mothers seeking treatment for PPD, but appears to have contributed to poorer mother-infant interactions and maternal reports of more negative emotionality in their infants. These findings highlight the importance of identifying women with possible PPD, supporting mother-infant interactions, and monitoring their infants during COVID-19 and beyond.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of women seeking treatment for postpartum depression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has, of necessity, demanded the rapid incorporation of virtual technologies which, suddenly, have superseded the physical medical encounter.

Tracing of contacts and consequential tracing and breaking of infection-chains is a promising and comparably straightforward strategy to help containing the disease, although its precise impact on the epidemic is unknown. In order to quantify the benefits of tracing and similar policies we developed an agent-based model that not only validly depicts the spread of the disease, but allows for exploratory analysis of containment policies.

Previous studies of community-wide disasters suggested people are fairly resilient and identified resources and strategies that promote that resilience. Yet, the COVID-19 pandemic is in some ways unique, with high levels of uncertainty, evolving implications and restrictions, and varied and uneven impacts. How resilient were Americans as the pandemic progressed? What psychosocial resources and coping strategies facilitated adjustment as the country moved into a summer of uneven reopenings and reclosures? Data from a national sample of 674 Americans were gathered at the height of early lockdowns and peaking infections in mid-April, 2020, and again, 5 and 10 weeks later. The study aimed to determine levels and sources of distress and to identify the resources and coping efforts that promoted or impeded resilience. Early levels of distress diminished to some extent over subsequent months while levels of wellbeing were comparable with usual norms, suggesting a largely resilient response. COVID-19-related stress exposure also decreased gradually over time. Older age, higher levels of mindfulness and social support, and meaning focused coping predicted better adjustment, reflecting resilience, while avoidance coping was particularly unhelpful. In models predicting change over time, approach-oriented coping (i.e., active coping, meaning-focused coping, and seeking social support) was minimally predictive of subsequent adjustment. Given the unique and ongoing circumstances presented by COVID-19, specific interventions targeting psychosocial resources and coping identified here may help to promote resilience as the pandemic continues to unfold.

One class of antiviral compounds, nucleoside analogues, mimics naturally occurring nucleosides to inhibit viral replication. While these compounds have been successful therapeutics for several viral infections, mutagenic nucleoside analogues, such as ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil, have been ineffective at inhibiting CoVs. This has been attributed to the proofreading activity of the viral 3-5 exoribonuclease (ExoN). -d-N(4)-Hydroxycytidine (NHC) (EIDD-1931; Emory Institute for Drug Development) has recently been reported to inhibit multiple viruses. Here, we demonstrate that NHC inhibits both murine hepatitis virus (MHV) (50% effective concentration [EC(50)] = 0.17 M) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) (EC(50) = 0.56 M) with minimal cytotoxicity. NHC inhibited MHV lacking ExoN proofreading activity similarly to wild-type (WT) MHV, suggesting an ability to evade or overcome ExoN activity. NHC inhibited MHV only when added early during infection, decreased viral specific infectivity, and increased the number and proportion of G:A and C:U transition mutations present after a single infection. Low-level NHC resistance was difficult to achieve and was associated with multiple transition mutations across the genome in both MHV and MERS-CoV. These results point to a virus-mutagenic mechanism of NHC inhibition in CoVs and indicate a high genetic barrier to NHC resistance. Together, the data support further development of NHC for treatment of CoVs and suggest a novel mechanism of NHC interaction with the CoV replication complex that may shed light on critical aspects of replication. IMPORTANCE The emergence of coronaviruses (CoVs) into human populations from animal reservoirs has demonstrated their epidemic capability, pandemic potential, and ability to cause severe disease. However, no antivirals have been approved to treat these infections. Here, we demonstrate the potent antiviral activity of a broad-spectrum ribonucleoside analogue, -d-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (NHC), against two divergent CoVs. Viral proofreading activity does not markedly impact sensitivity to NHC inhibition, suggesting a novel interaction between a nucleoside analogue inhibitor and the CoV replicase. Further, passage in the presence of NHC generates only low-level resistance, likely due to the accumulation of multiple potentially deleterious transition mutations. Together, these data support a mutagenic mechanism of inhibition by NHC and further support the development of NHC for treatment of CoV infections.","output":"Small-Molecule Antiviral -d-N(4)-Hydroxycytidine Inhibits a Proofreading-Intact Coronavirus with a High Genetic Barrier to Resistance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article discusses use of Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is expanding as preferred method of infection detection Topic includes use of RT-PCR in diagnosis cases of infection such as influenza and strep;aggressive growth rate of use of RT-PCR;and use for RT-PCR testing in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, to diagnosethe outbreak of corona virus","output":"RT-PCR usage expands as preferred method of infection detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Despite critical hypoxemia, Covid-19 patients may present without proportional signs of respiratory distress. We report three patients with critical respiratory failure due to Covid-19, in which all presented with severe hypoxemia refractory to supplemental oxygen therapy. We discuss possible strategies for ventilatory support in the emergency pre-hospital setting, and point out some pitfalls regarding the management of these patients. Guidelines for pre-hospital care of critically ill Covid-19 patients cannot be established based on the current evidence base, and we have to apply our understanding of respiratory physiology and mechanics in order to optimize respiratory support.

CONCLUSION: Patients with Covid-19 and severe hypoxemia may pose a considerable challenge for the pre-hospital emergency medical services. Intubation may be associated with a high risk of complications in these patients and should be carried out with diligence when considered necessary. The following interventions are worth considering in Covid-19 patients with refractory hypoxemia before proceeding to intubation. First, administering oxygen via a tight fitting BVM with an oxygen flow rate that exceeds the patients ventilatory minute volume. Second, applying continuous positive airway pressure, while simultaneously maintaining a high FiO(2).

DESIGN: The BIOmarkers TO diagnose PnEumonia study was a prospective cohort study conducted from March to June 2016. SETTING: Primary care in Northern Malawi. PATIENTS: 494 children aged 2 C59 months with WHO defined pneumonia. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): Number of children with bacterial infection identified and the sensitivity/specificity of WHO markers of severity for need for hospitalisation. RESULTS: 13 (2.6%) children had a bacterium consistent with pneumonia identified. A virus consistent with pneumonia was identified in in 448 (90.7%) of children. 56 children were admitted to hospital and two children died within 30 days. 442 (89.5%) received antibiotic therapy. Eleven children (2.6%) had HIV. WHO severity markers at baseline demonstrated poor sensitivity for the need for hospitalisation with a sensitivity of 0.303 (95% CI 0.188 to 0.441) and a specificity 0.9 (95% CI 0.868 to 0.926). A prediction rule to indicate the need for hospitalisation was developed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The low rate of bacterial infection and high use of antibiotics in the setting of high immunisation rates highlights the changing profile of childhood pneumonia. Similarly, the markers of need for hospitalisation may have changed in the setting of extended immunisation.

It is necessary to explore the behavioral strategies of relevant companies in adopting CCU technology. In this paper, an evolutionary game model is established in order to analyze the interaction process and evolution direction of local governments and coal-fired power plants. We develop a replicator dynamic system and analyze the stability of the system under different conditions. Based on numerical simulation, we analyze the impact of key parameters on the strategies of stakeholders. The simulation results show that the unit prices of hydrogen and carbon dioxide derivatives have the most significant impact: when the unit price of hydrogen decreases to 15.9 RMB/kg or the unit price of carbon dioxide derivatives increases to 3.4 RMB/kg, the evolutionary stabilization strategy of the system changes and power plants shift to adopt CCU technology. The results of this paper suggest that local governments should provide relevant support policies and incentives for CCU technology deployment, as well as focusing on the synergistic development of CCU technology and renewable energy hydrogen production technology.","output":"To Adopt CCU Technology or Not?

However, its applicability to operable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not yet been established. METHODS We retrospectively collected data from patients with pathological stage I or II NSCLC who underwent complete resection. A total of 1048 patients were categorized as either GPS-0 (n = 817 [78.0%]), GPS-1 (184 [17.6%]), or GPS-2 (47 [4.5%]). Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the Cox proportional hazard model was used to analyze the relationship between prognosis and GPS status. RESULTS The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 91.2%, 78.3%, and 75.8% for GPS-0, GPS-1, and GPS-2, respectively. There were significant differences in OS between GPS-0 and GPS-1 (p < 0.001) and between GPS-0 and GPS-2 (p < 0.001). Ten variables demonstrated to be associated with OS in a univariate analysis were subjected to a multivariate analysis. The results showed that male sex (p = 0.031), vascular invasion (p < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001), and GPS (p = 0.025) were significantly associated with OS. CONCLUSIONS A high GPS is significantly associated with poor OS.

OBJECTIVES To estimate the prevalence of cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 patients. METHODS This study was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A detailed literature search was done in PubMed and Embase from December 1, 2019, till May 1, 2020. Studies reporting cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 patients were included. Irrespective of the heterogeneity of data, a random effects model with inverse-variance approach was used for pooling the prevalence using meta package in R version 3.6.2. RESULTS Out of 15,143 articles, 2086 articles were selected for full-text read. Forty-three articles were selected for qualitative analysis, of which 10 articles (N = 1682) were included for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of overall cutaneous lesions was 5.69 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.87-15.98; I2 88%). The pooled prevalence of other outcome parameters were as follows: viral exanthem-like presentation 4.15 (95% CI: 1.33-12.23; I2 88%), maculopapular rash 3.81 (95% CI: 1.02-13.18; I2 87%), vesiculobullous lesions 1.67 (95% CI: 0.70-3.96; I2 0%). CONCLUSION The estimated prevalence of cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 was 5.69%. Other manifestations were urticaria, chilblain-like lesions, livedo reticularis, and finger/toe gangrene.

Using the lockdown as the landmark, higher prevalence was found before than during the lockdown across physical, emotional, financial, and sexual forms of IPV. Emotional form had the highest prevalence both before and during the lockdown with 11.4% and 3.8% respectively. Furthermore, 22.6% of participants reported that the lockdown affected their mental health. Hopelessness, feelings of failure, being irritable, and constantly under strain were psychological symptoms significantly associated with IPV amid the lockdown. Decreased prevalence of IPV were found in the early phase of the pandemic, suggesting that couples can experience less partner violence during periods of confinement.

Diagnosis is difficult as patients can present without symptoms or biochemical evidence of DM. We report a rare adult case of anti-MDA5 ILD with only pulmonary manifestations. CASE PRESENTATION: 74-year-old female with past medical history of atrial fibrillation status post pacemaker, reactive airway disease, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, was referred to pulmonary clinic for abnormal CT scan and dyspnea that began 4 months prior while living in India. Initial chest CT was significant for bi-apical consolidations and bronchiectasis. Bronchoscopy with lavage was positive for Aspergillus galactomannan, and she was treated with isavuconazole, prednisone, and Septra (for pneumocystis prophylaxis). Chest CT 4 weeks later showed improvement in consolidations. 3 months later, dyspnea recurred. She was re-started on prednisone 20 mg daily, and dyspnea resolved. She subsequently relocated to the USA. She had serial negative COVID tests. Pulmonary function test showed a restrictive ventilatory defect with decreased diffusion capacity. Follow-up CT chest revealed bi-apical scarring, and multifocal airspace consolidation. ESR 44 (elevated) and CRP 11.2 (elevated). IGE, aldolase, CK, hypersensitivity pneumonitis antibody panel, Aspergillus antibody, nuclear antibody panel, RF, and anti-CCP were negative. Extended myositis panel revealed high positive titer for anti-MDA5 and RNA polymerase 3 antibodies;subsequently confirmed with a different extended myositis assay. She was referred to a rheumatologist who recommended aggressive immune modulating treatment with prednisone, tacrolimus and cyclophosphamide. After discussion, she opted for mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone. DISCUSSION: Anti-MDA5 associated DM can present with rapidly progressive ILD and is associated with poor prognosis. In a small prospective study, a triple therapy regimen consisting of high dose glucocorticoid, Tacrolimus, and intravenous Cyclophosphamide showed 6-month survival benefit compared to a step-up approach (which entailed starting with high dose glucocorticoids and later combining with immunomodulators). Plasmapheresis has been used for patients who have failed combination immunomodulators in multiple small case studies. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-MDA5 associated ILD should be considered in patients with new ILD, since it can present without evidence of DM. Intense multiple drug immune suppression is recommended from the beginning. Plasmapheresis and lung transplant can be considered if patients become refractory to combination immunosuppression.

The presence of ASF has been historically neglected in Africa, contributing to its uncontrolled expansion and favouring its spread to continental Europe on at least three occasions, the last one in 2007 through the Republic of Georgia. Since then, African swine fever virus (ASFV) has spread to neighbouring countries, reaching the European Union in 2014, China in the summer of 2018 and spreading through Southeast Asia becoming a global problem. Lack of available vaccines against ASF makes its control even more difficult, representing today the number one threat for the swine industry worldwide and negatively affecting the global commerce equilibrium. MAIN BODY: In this review, we intend to put in perspective the reality of ASF vaccination today, taking into account that investment into ASF vaccine development has been traditionally unattractive, overall since ASF-free areas with large swine industries applied a non-vaccination policy for diseases listed by the OIE. The dramatic situation suffered in Asia and the increasing threat that ASF represents for wealthy countries with large swine industries, has dramatically changed the perspective that both private and public bodies have about ASF vaccinology, although this is controversial. The feasibility of modifying the ASFV genome has led to safe and efficacious experimental recombinant live attenuated viruses (LAVs). The main challenge today will be confirming the safety and efficacy of these technologies in the field, accelerating transfer to the industry for official registration and commercialization. The complexity of ASFV, together with the lack of knowledge about the mechanisms involved in protection and the specific antigens involved in it, requires further investment in research and development. Although far from the efficacy achieved by LAVs, subunit vaccines are the optimal choice for the future. If the world can wait for them or not is a contentious issue. CONCLUSION: Despite their inherent disadvantages, LAVs will be the first technology to reach the market, while subunit vaccines will need much further research to become a successful commercial reality.","output":"African swine fever vaccines: a promising work still in progress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, immigrants from various backgrounds immigrated to Canada in search of a better life for themselves and their children.

Its major phenolic compounds were also determined. Ten (10) female, 8-week old mice were grouped into control and treatment groups for acute toxicity study. A dose of 2000 mg/kg MOHE was given once to the treatment group via oral gavage. However, for the sub-acute toxicity study, 25 mice were grouped into groups A (control), B (125 mg/kg), C (250 mg/kg), D (500 mg/kg) and E (1000 mg/kg). MOHE was given via oral gavage to groups B, C, D and E daily for 28 days. Group A received only distilled water. The mice were sacrificed at the end of the experiments and samples were collected for evaluation. The results of the chemical profiling of MOHE revealed the presence of glucomoringin, niaziminine, quercetin and kaempferol as the major compounds.

Currently, most methods for studying interactions on scRNA-seq level are based on curated databases of ligands and receptors. While those methods are useful, they are limited to our current biological knowledge. Recent advances in single cell protocols have allowed for physically interacting cells to be captured, and as such we have the potential to study interactions in a complemantary way without relying on prior knowledge. We introduce a new method based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for detecting genes that change as a result of interaction. We apply our method to synthetic datasets to demonstrate its ability to detect genes that change in an interacting population compared to a reference population. Next, we apply our approach to two datasets of physically interacting cells to identify the genes that change as a result of interaction, examples include adhesion and co-stimulatory molecules which confirm physical interaction between cells. For each dataset we produce a ranking of genes that are changing in subpopulations of the interacting cells. In addition to the genes discussed in the original publications, we highlight further candidates for interaction in the top 100 and 300 ranked genes. Lastly, we apply our method to a dataset generated by a standard droplet-based protocol not designed to capture interacting cells, and discuss its suitability for analysing interactions.

Nurses involved in the care of infected (COVID-19) patients, may feel more discomfort physically and experience greater psychological morbidities. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The main aim of the study is to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety and stress among nurses in a designated COVID-19 hospital and variables that influence these psychological problems. METHODOLOGY: Nurses working in the designated tertiary care hospital were invited to participate in an online cross-sectional survey (dated, September 5C15, 2020). A self-administered questionnaire regarding sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19-related experiences, perceived threat regarding COVID-19, and two scales (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Perceived Stress Scale-10) for the assessment of anxiety and stress was applied to nurses. Chi-square test and multiple regression analysis were used to investigate the predictors (risk and protective) of psychological morbidities in nurses. RESULTS: On analysis of 209 participants, it was revealed that 65 (31.1%) participants have anxiety symptoms and 35.40% have moderate to the high level of stress. Being proud of working in this profession was the only protective factor from such psychological morbidities. The identified risk factors for greater anxiety symptoms and moderate-to-high-level stress were, working experience of >10 years (odds ratio [OR] = 3.36), direct involvement in the care of suspected/diagnosed patients (OR = 3.4), feeling worried about being quarantined/isolated (OR = 1.69,) and high risk of being infected at the job (OR = 2.3 for anxiety and OR = 2.1 for moderate-to-high stress).

It is also recommended in clinical practice guidelines for ventricular assist device (VAD) recipients. However, there have only been two meta-analyses on the effects of exercise rehabilitation in VAD patients, on only two outcomes. The objective of the review was to quantitatively evaluate the effect of exercise rehabilitation in VAD recipients on functional capacity, exercise physiology parameters, chronotropic responses, inflammatory biomarkers and neurohormones, heart structure and function, and clinical outcomes. The following databases were systematically searched: CCTR, CDSR, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and Medline through to November 2015, for studies reporting on VAD recipients receiving  2 sessions of aerobic training. Citations were considered for inclusion, and data were extracted in included studies as well as quality assessed, each by two investigators independently. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed where possible. The meta-analysis showed that compared to usual care, exercise rehabilitation significantly improved peak VO2 (n = 74, mean difference = 1.94 mL kg-1 min-1, 95% CI 0.63-3.26, p = 0.004) and 6-min walk test distance (n = 52, mean difference = 42.46 m, 95% CI 8.45-76.46, p = 0.01).

B.1.1.7 has been detected in over 30 countries, including the United States. As of January 13, 2021, approximately 76 cases of B.1.1.7 have been detected in 12 U.S. states.? Multiple lines of evidence indicate that B.1.1.7 is more efficiently transmitted than are other SARS-CoV-2 variants (1-3). The modeled trajectory of this variant in the U.S. exhibits rapid growth in early 2021, becoming the predominant variant in March. Increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission might threaten strained health care resources, require extended and more rigorous implementation of public health strategies (4), and increase the percentage of population immunity required for pandemic control. Taking measures to reduce transmission now can lessen the potential impact of B.1.1.7 and allow critical time to increase vaccination coverage. Collectively, enhanced genomic surveillance combined with continued compliance with effective public health measures, including vaccination, physical distancing, use of masks, hand hygiene, and isolation and quarantine, will be essential to limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHOD: This is a brief note in which authors rely on various statistics and insights regarding domestic violence since the detection of Covid-19. Based on the available statistics regarding domestic violence prevalence during previous times of uncertainty, the number and nature of domestic violence incidents around the globe, and existing literature, the authors argue that clear links exist between Covid-19 and domestic violence, which also impacts on the economic and social crisis. RESULTS: Countries across the world are battling Covid-19 by enacting measures to reduce the speed of transmission. Multiple reports, however, suggest that such measures are increasing the incidence of domestic violence and not only in number but also in severity. We find that layoffs, loss of income, extended domestic stays, and exposure to habits due to stay-at-home orders are driving up the incidence of domestic violence. Moreover, these domestic violence increases are driving economic and social crises due to the form and severity of the violence, the burden placed on government, a crisis of resources, and decreases in the productivity of workforces. CONCLUSION: Domestic violence increase resulting from Covid-19 is an indirect driver of economic and social crisis.

Difficulties exist in cryopreservation of the relatively large ovarian tissue mass. This study evaluates whether a human postmenopausal ovary can be used, as a complement to animal models, in studies of this research field. METHODS Postmenopausal human ovaries (n = 10) were isolated and flushed through ovarian arteries with either the cryoprotectant dimethylsulphoxide or Ringer-Acetate, followed by slow freezing. After thawing, production of androgens during in vitro perfusion and morphology (light/electron microscopy) were assessed. RESULTS The dimethylsulphoxide-cryopreserved ovaries showed larger secretion of androgens during perfusion than Ringer Acetate-cryopreserved ovaries. Light microscopy showed well preserved morphology in both groups. Electron microscopy revealed normal appearance of stroma and vessels in the dimethylsulphoxide group.

Due to their regenerative and reparative properties, MSCs are extremely valuable for cell-based therapy in tackling several pathological conditions including COVID-19. Iron is essential for MSC processes but iron-loading, which is common in several chronic conditions, hinders normal MSC functionality. This not only aggravates disease pathology but can also affect allogeneic and autologous MSC therapy. Thus, understanding MSCs from an iron perspective is of clinical significance. Accordingly, this review highlights the roles of iron and iron-related proteins in MSC physiology. It describes the contribution of iron and endogenous iron-related effectors like hepcidin, ferroportin, transferrin receptor, lactoferrin, lipocalin-2, bone morphogenetic proteins and hypoxia inducible factors in MSC biology. It summarises the excess-iron-induced alterations in MSC components, processes and discusses signalling pathways involving ROS, PI3K/AKT, MAPK, p53, AMPK/MFF/DRP1 and Wnt. Additionally, it evaluates the endogenous and exogenous saviours of MSCs against iron-toxicity. Lastly, it elaborates on the involvement of MSCs in the pathology of clinical conditions of iron-excess, namely, hereditary hemochromatosis, diabetes, -thalassaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. This unique review integrates the distinct fields of iron regulation and MSC physiology. Through an iron-perspective, it describes both mechanistic and clinical aspects of MSCs and proposes an iron-linked MSC-contribution to physiology, pathology and therapeutics. It advances the understanding of MSC biology and may aid in identifying signalling pathways, molecular targets and compounds for formulating adjunctive iron-based therapies for excess-iron conditions, and thereby inform regenerative medicine.","output":"Role of iron and iron-related proteins in mesenchymal stem cells: Cellular and clinical aspects."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe COVID\\\\19 is often accompanied by coagulopathies such as thrombocytopenia and abnormal clotting.

In this article, we describe existing challenges and possible solutions and suggest future research directions that may be relevant for robotics and AI in addressing the three tasks mentioned above.","output":"Robotics and AI for Teleoperation, Tele-Assessment, and Tele-Training for Surgery in the Era of COVID-19: Existing Challenges, and Future Vision"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To estimate seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among healthcare, first response, and public safety personnel, antibody testing was conducted in emergency medical service agencies and 27 hospitals in the Detroit, Michigan, USA, metropolitan area during May-June 2020 Of 16,403 participants, 6 9% had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies In adjusted analyses, seropositivity was associated with exposure to SARS-CoV-2-positive household members (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6 18, 95% CI 4 81-7 93) and working within 15 km of Detroit (aOR 5 60, 95% CI 3 98-7 89) Nurse assistants (aOR 1 88, 95% CI 1 24-2 83) and nurses (aOR 1 52, 95% CI 1 18-1 95) had higher likelihood of seropositivity than physicians Working in a hospital emergency department increased the likelihood of seropositivity (aOR 1 16, 95% CI 1 002-1 35) Consistently using N95 respirators (aOR 0 83, 95% CI 0 72-0 95) and surgical facemasks (aOR 0 86, 95% CI 0 75-0 98) decreased the likelihood of seropositivity","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence among Healthcare, First Response, and Public Safety Personnel, Detroit Metropolitan Area, Michigan, USA, May-June 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Behavioral practices are one of the key factors facilitating zoonotic disease transmission, especially in individuals who have frequent contact with wild animals, yet practices of those who work and live in high-risk animal-human interfaces, such as wild animal 'bushmeat' markets in the Congo Basin are not well documented in the social, health and medical sciences. This region, where hunting, butchering, and consumption of wild animal meat is frequent, represents a hotspot for disease emergence, and has experienced zoonotic disease spillover events, traced back to close human-animal contact with bats and non-human primates. Using a One Health approach, we conducted wildlife surveillance, human behavioral research, and concurrent human and animal biological sampling to identify and characterize factors associated with zoonotic disease emergence and transmission. Research was conducted through the USAID Emerging Pandemic Threats program between 2010 and 2019 including qualitative studies of bushmeat markets, with selected study sites prioritized based on proximity to bushmeat markets. Sites included two hospitals where we conducted surveillance of individuals with syndromes of acute febrile illness, community sites where we enrolled actors of the animal value chain (ie. hunters, middlemen, transporters), and bushmeat markets, where we enrolled bushmeat vendors, butchers, market managers, cleaners, and shoppers. Mixed methods research was undertaken at these sites and included investigation of bushmeat market dynamics through observational research, focus group discussions, quantitative questionnaires, and interviews. Participants were asked about their risk perception of zoonotic disease transmission and specific activities related to bushmeat trade, local market conditions, and regulations on bushmeat trade in Cameroon. Risks associated with blood contact and animal infection were not well understood by most market actors. As bushmeat markets are an important disease interface, as seen with CoVID19, risk mitigation measures in markets and bushmeat alternative strategies are discussed.","output":"Market characteristics and zoonotic disease risk perception in Cameroon bushmeat markets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"EpsteinCBarr virus (EBV) was the first human tumor virus being discovered and remains to date the only human pathogen that can transform cells in vitro. 55 years of EBV research have now brought us to the brink of an EBV vaccine. For this purpose, recombinant viral vectors and their heterologous prime-boost vaccinations, EBV-derived virus-like particles and viral envelope glycoprotein formulations are explored and are discussed in this review. Even so, cell-mediated immune control by cytotoxic lymphocytes protects healthy virus carriers from EBV-associated malignancies, antibodies might be able to prevent symptomatic primary infection, the most likely EBV-associated pathology against which EBV vaccines will be initially tested. Thus, the variety of EBV vaccines reflects the sophisticated life cycle of this human tumor virus and only vaccination in humans will finally be able to reveal the efficacy of these candidates. Nevertheless, the recently renewed efforts to develop an EBV vaccine and the long history of safe adoptive T cell transfer to treat EBV-associated malignancies suggest that this oncogenic -herpesvirus can be targeted by immunotherapies. Such vaccination should ideally implement the very same immune control that protects healthy EBV carriers.","output":"Vaccination against the EpsteinCBarr virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper quantitatively analyzes the trade-off between job losses and the spread of COVID-19 in Japan. We derive an empirical specification from the social planners resource constraint under the susceptible, infected, recovered, and deaths (SIRD) model and estimate how job losses and the case growth rate are related to peoples mobility using the Japanese prefecture-level panel data on confirmed cases, involuntary job losses, peoples mobility, and teleworkability. Our findings are summarized as follows. First, we find that a decrease in mobility driven by containment policies is associated with an increase in involuntary job separations, but the high teleworkability mitigates the negative effect of decreased mobility on job losses. Second, estimating how the case growth is related to peoples mobility and past cases, we find that the case growth rate is positively related to an increase in peoples mobility but negatively associated with past confirmed cases. Third, using these estimates, we provide a quantitative analysis of the trade-off between job losses and the number of confirmed cases. Taking Tokyo in July 2020 as a benchmark, we find that the cost of saving 1 job per month is 2.3 more confirmed cases per month in the short run of 1 month. When we consider a trade-off for 3 months from July to September of 2020, protecting 1 job per month requires 6.6 more confirmed cases per month. Therefore, the trade-off becomes worse substantially in the longer run of 3 months, reflecting the exponential case growth when the peoples mobility is high.","output":"Trade-off between job losses and the spread of COVID-19 in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For NOx, pollutions in Wuhan during the outbreak of COVID-19, we applied a mobile MAX-DOAS and a portable ultraviolet DOAS to cooperatively measure NOx, concentration in the third ring road of Wuhan from Feb. 29th to Mar. 14th, 2020. The mobile MAX-DOAS acquired the vertical column concentration (VCD) distribution of NO2 along its course and the portable ultraviolet DOAS measured the NO and NO2 concentrations to calculate [NOx]/[NO2]. Then, the NOx emission flux and its error of the third ring road of Wuhan were calculated in conjunction with the data of the wind field. The results show that the NO, emission flux during the measurements in the third ring of Wuhan ranges from 7.78 mol/s to 15.71 mol/s, about 10.78 mol/s on average. Compared with the average [NOx]/[NO2], the real-time [NOx]/[NO2] along the route of the mobile MAX-DOAS derived from the portable ultraviolet DOAS could effectively reduce the error of NOx emission flux caused by the [NOx,]/[NO2] error.

We used an innovative journaling approach with thirty-seven aides as well as in-depth interviews with fifteen aides and leadership representatives from nine home health agencies in New York and Michigan. Workers described a range of concerns around workplace safety including uncertainty around whether a client had COVID-19, inadequate access to personal protective equipment and safe transportation, as well as fundamental changes to interactions with clients. Agencies also faced challenges acquiring personal protective equipment for their aides.

Thus, it was imperative to investigate its influence on the incidence of face touching behaviors. Methods: Videos displaying mask-wearing and face-touching behaviors of general population in public areas were analyzed. Period before the COVID-19 epidemic were defined as January 2018 to October 2019, and those during the pandemic were from February 2020 to August 2020 in East Asia, and March to August 2020 in Europe and United States (US). Findings: 37 videos (4699 individuals) before the pandemic with 135 videos (8217 individuals) were included. The mask wearing rates all increased significantly during the pandemic. However, the incidence of face touching behaviors maintained. The incidence of eyes, nose and mouth touching behaviors decreased in East Asia and Europe, instead of US. Mask wearing rates was negatively related to incidences of face touching behaviors, especially in East Asia. Surprisingly, when mask wearing rates were >0% and <75%, mask wearing rates was positively related to the incidence of face touching behaviors in East Asia significantly (p=0.017). Interpretation: The incidence of face touching behaviors of general population in public areas was negatively associated with mask wearing rates. However, Mandatory mask wearing polices were risky in population with low adherence to masks, among whom, the face touching behaviors in public areas might increase with mask wearing rates rise.

How well OHS is organized and how measures are actually implemented are not yet empirically known. This gap was closed with an epidemiological study on the status quo. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the second half of 2020 a total of 120 managers of day care centers in Germany, mostly church-run, which are member companies of the German Statutory Accident Insurance and Prevention in the Health and Welfare Services (BGW), were randomly selected and interviewed. This was done by members of the BGW prevention services using a standardized survey instrument. The surveyed aspects (mostly concerning the OHS organization) were summarized in a standardized sum index between 0 and 1 (worst to best occupational health and safety) and analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: The requirements for the organization of OHS were fulfilled in many cases. There is still some potential left for improvement in the actual implementation of organized OHS requirements. The standardized sum index is 0.82 (standard deviation 0.16). Of the respondents two thirds rated OHS in their day care center as good/very good in a global item. In free texts, the desire for more information on OHS and better communication between the day care center and the respective provider was frequently expressed. DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK: The results confirmed a higher formal quality of OHS as found in other cross-sectional studies. To continuously improve the actual implementation of organized measures, OHS management systems, which are still rarely used in day care centers, could have a supporting effect. Corresponding instruments are available and their use should be more strongly promoted in the future. Limitations of the study include possible bias due to responses to representatives of an institution that is also responsible for OHS inspections.","output":"Organisation und Umsetzung des Arbeitsschutzes in Kitas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of a specially designed care bundle on the development of facial pressure injuries (PI) among frontline healthcare workers wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome of interest was the incidence of facial PIs. The secondary outcomes of interest were facial pain while wearing PPE and ease of use of the care bundle. METHODS: This study used a voluntary survey by questionnaire, supplemented by a qualitative analysis of interviews from a small purposive sample that took place in one large Irish hospital over a two-month period in 2020. The hospital was a city-based public university teaching hospital with 800 inpatient beds. The intervention was a care bundle consisting of skin protection, face mask selection, material use, skin inspection, cleansing and hydration developed in line with international best practice guidelines. All staff working in COVID-19 wards, intensive care units and the emergency department in the hospital were given a kitbag containing the elements of the care bundle plus an information pamphlet. Data were collected via a survey and interviews. RESULTS: A total of 114 staff provided feedback on the use of the care bundle. Before using the care bundle 29% (n=33) of the respondents reported developing a facial PI, whereas after using the care bundle only 8% (n=9) of the respondents reported developing a facial PI. The odds ratio (OR) of skin injury development was 4.75 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.15-10.49; p=0.0001), suggesting that after the care bundle was issued, those who responded to the survey were almost five times less likely to develop a skin injury. Interviews with 14 staff determined that the bundle was easy to use and safe. CONCLUSION: Among those who responded to the survey, the use of the bundle was associated with a reduction in the incidence of skin injury from 29% to 8%, and respondents found the bundle easy to use, safe and effective. As with evidence from the international literature, this study has identified that when skincare is prioritised, and a systematic preventative care bundle approach is adopted, there are clear benefits for the individuals involved.","output":"Facial pressure injuries and the COVID-19 pandemic: skin protection care to enhance staff safety in an acute hospital setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A common consequence of moderate to extreme periodontitis is pathologic migration. This denotes tooth movement when the periodontal disease interjects the equilibrium among the elements that preserve physiological tooth position. The balancing factors can migrate the teeth in any direction. The etiology of pathological migration tends to be multifactorial, thus achieving early diagnosis is imperative, which will ultimately lead to the prompt removal of the etiological factors while avoiding severe bone destruction. In this case maxillary central incisors had diastema due to pathological migration with mobility grade I in maxillary left central incisor. Many cases of moderate to severe pathological migration need a suitable, interdisciplinary approach. Nevertheless, since it is possible to detect mild cases of Pathological tooth migration (PTM) at an early stage, spontaneous correction of migrated teeth can be accomplished by periodontal therapy alone. Regardless of the treatment selected, maintenance of stable results should be considered as an aim of treatment.","output":"Pathological tooth migration-spontaneous correction of diastema after surgical periodontal therapy: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Among pathways involved in the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), impaired endothelial cell (EC) function and angiogenesis have been discussed less frequently than others such as cytokine storm. These two do play parts in the development of various clinical manifestations of COVID-19 including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the hyper-coagulation state. METHODS: This narrative review attempts to gather recent data on the possible potential of cannabidiol in the treatment of COVID-19 with an eye on angiogenesis and endothelial dysfunction. Keywords including cannabidiol AND angiogenesis OR endothelial cell as well as coronavirus disease 2019 OR COVID-19 AND angiogenesis OR endothelial dysfunction were searched among the databases of PubMed and Scopus. RESULTS: Cannabidiol (CBD), as a therapeutic phytocannabinoid, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for two types of seizures. Due to the potent anti-inflammatory properties of CBD, this compound has been suggested as a candidate treatment for COVID-19 in the literature. Although its potential effect on ECs dysfunction and pathologic angiogenesis in COVID-19 has been overlooked, other than cytokines like interleukin 1 (IL-), IL-6, IL-8, and tumour necrosis factor  (TNF) that are common in inflammation and angiogenesis, CBD could affect other important factors related to ECs function and angiogenesis. Data shows that CBD could decrease pathologic angiogenesis via decreasing ECs proliferation, migration, and tube formation. These activities are achieved through the suppression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Moreover, in an animal model, ARDS and sepsis responded well to CBD treatment. CONCLUSION: Altogether and considering the current use of CBD in the clinic, the conduction of further studies on CBD administration for patients with COVID-19 seems to be useful.","output":"Endothelial dysfunction and angiogenesis: what is missing from COVID-19 and cannabidiol story?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is an infectious disease caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 Covid-19 is currently a serious pandemic with an increasing number of daily cases, including in Indonesia The spread of Covid-19 is associated with peoples knowledge, attitude, and behavior towards the danger of Covid-19 Objective: This study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitude, and behavior of Indonesian society to the Covid-19 pandemic Methods: This study used a cross-sectional online survey Results: Of the 4057 respondents, most of them aged 26-50 years old (67 2%), female (62,1%), bachelor/diploma graduates (64,4%) Sources of information about Covid-19 were mostly obtained from the internet and television The knowledge, attitude, and behavior of Indonesian respondents towards the Covid-19 pandemic were good Conclusion: Based on an online questionnaire regarding the knowledge, attitude, and behavior of Indonesian society towards the Covid-19 pandemic, the results were in accordance with the recommendations and regulations of the Indonesian government ? 2020 EManuscript Technologies All rights reserved","output":"Knowledge, Attitude, and Behavior of Indonesian Society towards Covid-19 Pandemic"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(O,[["render",P]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/41.md","filePath":"drive/41.md"}'),R={name:"drive/41.md"},z=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{E as __pageData,z as default};
