Previous studies have quantified humid heat impacts on labor productivity by relying on exposure response functions that are based on uncontrolled experiments under a limited range of heat and humidity. Here we use the latest empirical model, based on a wider range of temperatures and humidity, for studying the impact of humid heat and recent climate change on labor productivity. We show that globally, humid heat may currently be associated with over 650 billion hours of annual lost labor (148 million full time equivalent jobs lost), 400 billion hours more than previous estimates. These differences in labor loss estimates are comparable to losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, annual heat-induced labor productivity losses are estimated at 2.1 trillion in 2017 PPP$, and in several countries are equivalent to more than 10% of gross domestic product. Over the last four decades, global heat-related labor losses increased by at least 9% (>60 billion hours annually using the new empirical model) highlighting that relatively small changes in climate (<0.5 degrees C) can have large impacts on global labor and the economy.","output":"Global labor loss due to humid heat exposure underestimated for outdoor workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Juvenile angiofibromas are hypervascular tumors that may benefit from preoperative devascularization to reduce intraoperative blood loss. Our purpose was to evaluate the extent of angiographic devascularization and intraoperative blood loss by using only Onyx for percutaneous juvenile angiofibroma tumor embolization. MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed the clinical records and preoperative and postoperative imaging studies of a consecutive series of 9 patients with juvenile angiofibromas who were treated with preoperative embolization with direct percutaneous injection of Onyx followed by resection from a standard open surgical or endoscopic approach. RESULTS Two Fisch type I, 1 Fisch type II, 5 Fisch type IIIa, and 1 Fisch type IVa tumor were treated. Complete devascularization was achieved in all cases percutaneously with only Onyx. There were no complications. The average intraoperative blood loss was 567.7 mL (range, 10-1700 mL). An average of 2.2 needles (range, 1-5 needles) was placed into the tumor. An average of 14.6 mL of Onyx (range, 2-25 mL) was injected into each tumor. Four Fisch type IIIa tumors were removed completely from only an ENE approach. CONCLUSIONS Presurgical direct percutaneous embolization of a juvenile angiofibroma with only EVOH before surgical resection is safe and feasible. Our preliminary experience suggests that Onyx may offer a higher degree of devascularization compared with other embolic agents. This may facilitate an easier surgical resection with lower blood loss.","output":"Preliminary experience with the percutaneous embolization of juvenile angiofibromas using only ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (Onyx) for preoperative devascularization prior to surgical resection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The period during and after World War II saw enormous changes in the practice and status of anaesthesia, as well as in female participation. This article offers an account of three South African (SA) women who trained in anaesthetics before and during the War and participated in these changes. By the mid-1960s, they presided over the three independent anaesthetic departments at Johannesburg's three main teaching hospitals, teaching generations of junior doctors. The first woman to register as a specialist anaesthetist in SA, Miriam (Mollie) Barlow, broke the glass ceiling in her own career by lobbying for the professional rights of medical women, although working within the constraints of the medical and political establishment. She also contributed to important SA research on malignant hyperthermia. Hilde Ginsberg collaborated with Barlow in the 1950s, reducing intraoperative and perioperative mortality at Coronation Hospital, and fought for key interventions in anaesthetic practice and policy through the South African Society of Anaesthetists (SASA), becoming its most long-serving and honoured female member. Kathleen Barbara Vetten's exemplary career in academic medicine, including pioneering animal research (developing anaesthetic techniques for open-heart surgery in dogs and protocols for liver transplantation in primates) and a successful operation to separate craniopagus twins, shows both the achievement of and limits to female achievement at the end of this period.

In 2019, there were estimated to be over 10 million tuberculosis cases in the world, in the same year TB was between the ten leading causes of death, and the deadliest from a single infectious agent. Chest X-ray (CXR) has recently been promoted by the WHO as a tool possibly placed early in screening and triaging algorithms for TB detection. Numerous TB prevalence surveys have demonstrated that CXR is the most sensitive screening tool for pulmonary TB and that a significant proportion of people with TB are asymptomatic in the early stages of the disease. This study presents experimentation of classic convolutional neural network architectures on public CRX databases in order to create a tool applied to the diagnostic aid of TB in chest X-ray images.

By aligning science and diplomacy, countries can attract talent, strengthen their national research ecosystems, provide avenues for participation of scientists in policy, and coordinate integrated solutions to challenges with technical dimensions. While Latin America has a long tradition of bilateral and regional cooperation, science still plays a marginal role in foreign policy, as has become evidenced by the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. With few exceptions, Latin American nations have a relatively immature science, technology, and innovation ecosystem, compounded by low public and private investments in research, coexisting with profound socio-economic inequalities, and large vulnerable populations. Such challenging conditions have created barriers to a fluid relationship between science and diplomacy, fundamentally characterized by inefficient communication between scientists and policymakers, weak collaboration channels, and duplicated roles, which altogether perpetuate siloed mentalities and a lack of trust between the two communities. Over the last decade, a first influential wave of Latin American scientists, diplomats, and other professionals, including five of the co-authors, have undertaken science diplomacy training provided by specialized organizations. Through these experiences, we recognized the need to elevate awareness and build capacities in science diplomacy in our respective countries and overall, across Latin America. Here, we describe emerging efforts and mechanisms to bridge the gap between scientists and policymakers at the national and regional level. Furthermore, we offer recommendations to amplify the impact of those pioneering initiatives toward consolidating a robust science diplomacy practice across the region. The national experiences described from Costa Rica, Mexico, and Panama can serve as a roadmap for other Latin American nations in the early process of developing a science diplomacy strategy, so they can also align themselves to a collective pathway. Most critically, we propose a way forward so that Latin America can leapfrog beyond disjointed training of individuals into integrated institutional strategies that can harness the tools of science diplomacy to enhance science-informed multilateral cooperation and enable more effective science-informed policymaking.","output":"Closing the Gap Between Emerging Initiatives and Integrated Strategies to Strengthen Science Diplomacy in Latin America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Collective wisdom is the ability of a group to perform more effectively than any individual alone.

For instance, depression is one of the most common mental health issues according to the findings made by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Depression can cause serious emotional, behavioural and physical health problems with significant consequences, both personal and social costs included. This paper studies community depression dynamics due to COVID-19 pandemic through user-generated content on Twitter. A new approach based on multi-modal features from tweets and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is proposed to build depression classification models. Multi-modal features capture depression cues from emotion, topic and domain-specific perspectives. We study the problem using recently scraped tweets from Twitter users emanating from the state of New South Wales in Australia. Our novel classification model is capable of extracting depression polarities which may be affected by COVID-19 and related events during the COVID-19 period. The results found that people became more depressed after the outbreak of COVID-19. The measures implemented by the government such as the state lockdown also increased depression levels. Further analysis in the Local Government Area (LGA) level found that the community depression level was different across different LGAs. Such granular level analysis of depression dynamics not only can help authorities such as governmental departments to take corresponding actions more objectively in specific regions if necessary but also allows users to perceive the dynamics of depression over the time.","output":"Detecting Community Depression Dynamics Due to COVID-19 Pandemic in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background & objectives: The potential benefits of mobile health (mHealth) initiatives to manage the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have been explored. The Government of India, State governments, and healthcare organizations have developed various mobile apps for the containment of COVID-19. This study was aimed to systematically review COVID-19 related mobile apps and highlight gaps to inform the development of future mHealth initiatives. Methods: Google Play and the Apple app stores were searched using the terms 'COVID-19', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', and 'epidemic' in the first week of April 2020. A list of COVID-19-specific functions was compiled based on the review of the selected apps, the literature on epidemic surveillance, and national and international media reports. The World Health Organization guideline on Digital Health Interventions was used to classify the app functions under the categories of the general public, health workers, health system managers, and data services. Results: The search yielded 346 potential COVID-19 apps, of which 50 met the inclusion criteria. Dissemination of untargeted COVID-19-related information on preventative strategies and monitoring the movements of quarantined individuals was the function of 27 (54%) and 19 (32%) apps, respectively. Eight (16%) apps had a contact tracing and hotspot identification function. Interpretation & conclusions: Our study highlights the current emphasis on the development of self-testing, quarantine monitoring, and contact tracing apps. India's response to COVID-19 can be strengthened by developing comprehensive mHealth solutions for frontline healthcare workers, rapid response teams and public health authorities. Among this unprecedented global health emergency, the Governments must ensure the necessary but least intrusive measures for disease surveillance.","output":"An overview of mobile applications (apps) to support the coronavirus disease 2019 response in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The role of rapid testing has proven vital in reducing infection incidence in communities through swift identification and isolation of infected individuals. The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly catastrophic for residential carceral and rehabilitation facilities that are high-risk settings for transmission of contagious diseases. Centralized provider-based viral testing employing conventional diagnostic techniques is labor-intensive and time-consuming. There is a marked unmet need for quick, inexpensive, and simple viral testing strategies. We hypothesized that rehabilitation residents could successfully test themselves employing inexpensive, disposable, antigen-based influenza lateral-flow tests and would be willing to self-isolate and self-report to health authorities if positive. METHODS: We evaluated self-testing among 50 rehabilitation residents ages 18 and older in Pomona, California, where participants self-administered influenza lateral-flow diagnostic test (without specimen collection) with the goal of appropriately observing a control line and completed two brief written surveys on self-testing and COVID-19, one before self-administering the lateral-flow test and one after, to determine the overall feasibility of viral self-testing and to characterize attitudes comparing self-testing and provider-based testing. FINDINGS: A total of 50 rehabilitation residents were enrolled in this study and all 50 conducted a lateral-flow test and answered the provided surveys. Among the participants, 96% (48 of 50) achieved a positive-control line from their lateral-flow test. Most participants, 83% (34 of 41) indicated that they would prefer to perform their own rapid test instead of having a health care provider administer the test. Notably, 98% (49 of 50) indicated that they would self-isolate if the lateral-flow test returned a positive indicator suggesting the presence of a viral infection and 96% (48 of 50) would report positive results to their corresponding public health department. INTERPRETATION: Residents in a residential rehabilitation center were widely able to successfully self-administer standard lateral-flow antigen-based rapid diagnostic kits. Self-testing was strongly preferred over tests administered by a healthcare provider. Reassuringly, almost every resident indicated that they would report any positive test result to the health department and self-isolate accordingly. Self-testing offers a promising adjunct to centralized testing, potentially better enabling swift and effective management of life-threatening infectious outbreaks among those living in high-risk congregate living settings.","output":"Evaluation of feasibility and user acceptance of lateral-flow self-testing for viral illness in a residential treatment rehabilitation facility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Six years ago, a comprehensive review by the EURECA-m working group of the ERA-EDTA thoroughly addressed the drivers of mortality in patients with end-stage kidney disease.

Deep Learning methods have shown great promise for scene analysis when trained on large-scale datasets. However, current datasets for fish analysis tend to focus on the classification task within constrained, plain environments which do not capture the complexity of underwater fish habitats. To address this limitation, we present DeepFish as a benchmark suite with a large-scale dataset to train and test methods for several computer vision tasks. The dataset consists of approximately 40 thousand images collected underwater from 20 habitats in the marine-environments of tropical Australia. The dataset originally contained only classification labels. Thus, we collected point-level and segmentation labels to have a more comprehensive fish analysis benchmark. These labels enable models to learn to automatically monitor fish count, identify their locations, and estimate their sizes. Our experiments provide an in-depth analysis of the dataset characteristics, and the performance evaluation of several state-of-the-art approaches based on our benchmark. Although models pre-trained on ImageNet have successfully performed on this benchmark, there is still room for improvement.

We report here a multi-omics investigation of IFN signaling in hospitalized COVID19 patients, defining the biosignatures associated with varying levels of 12 different IFN ligands. Previously we showed that seroconversion associates with decreased production of select IFN ligands (Galbraith et al, 2021). We show now that the antiviral transcriptional response in circulating immune cells is strongly associated with a specific subset of ligands, most prominently IFNA2 and IFNG. In contrast, proteomics signatures indicative of endothelial damage associate with levels of IFNB and IFNA6. Differential IFN ligand production is linked to distinct constellations of circulating immune cells. Lastly, IFN ligands associate differentially with activation of the kynurenine pathway, dysregulated fatty acid metabolism, and altered central carbon metabolism. Altogether, these results reveal specialized IFN ligand action in COVID19, with potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications.

Thus, it is important to develop inhibitors against CHIKV enzymes to block key steps in viral reproduction. In view of this, CVCP was produced recombinantly and purified to homogeneity. A fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based proteolytic assay was developed for high throughput screening (HTS). A FRET peptide substrate (DABCYL-GAEEWSLAIE-EDANS) derived from the cleavage site present in the structural polyprotein of CVCP was used.

Our findings revealed that the interactions among the PBMC subpopulations of SLE patients may be weakened under the inflammatory microenvironment, which could result in abnormal emergences or variations in signaling patterns within PBMCs. In particular, the alterations of B cells and monocytes may be the most significant findings. Utilizing this powerful information, an efficient mathematical model of unbiased random forest machine learning was established to distinguish SLE patients from healthy donors via not only scRNA-seq data but also bulk RNA-seq data. Surprisingly, our mathematical model could also accurately identify patients with rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, not just SLE, via bulk RNA-seq data (derived from 688 samples).

Body temperature can be measured using thermal infrared imaging, a safe, non-contact method that relies on the emissivity of the skin being known to provide accurate readings. Skin pigmentation affects the absorption of visible light and enables us to see variations in skin colour. Pigmentation may also affect the absorption of infrared radiation and thus affect thermal imaging. Human skin has an accepted emissivity of 0.98 but the effect of different skin pigmentation on this value is not known. In this study, we investigated the influence of different skin pigmentation on thermal emissivity in 65 adult volunteers. METHODS: A reference object of known emissivity (electrical tape) was applied to participant's skin on the inner upper arm. Tape and arm were imaged simultaneously using a thermal infrared camera. The emissivity was set on the camera to the known value for electrical tape. The emissivity was altered manually until the skin temperature using thermal imaging software was equal to the initial tape temperature. This provided the calculated emissivity value of the skin. Participants were grouped according to skin pigmentation, quantified using the Fitzpatrick skin phototyping scale and reflectance spectrophotometry. Differences in emissivity values between skin pigmentation groups were assessed by one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: The mean calculated emissivity for the 65 participants was 0.972 (range 0.96-0.99). No significant differences in emissivity were observed between participants when grouped by skin pigmentation according to the Fitzpatrick scale (p = 0.859) or reflectance spectrophotometry (p = 0.346).

We evaluated the efficacy of clinically relevant hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease inhibitors (PIs) against SARS-CoV-2 and their interactions with remdesivir, the only direct-acting antiviral approved for COVID-19 treatment. HCV PIs showed differential potency in short-term treatment assays based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in Vero E6 cells. Linear PIs boceprevir, telaprevir, and narlaprevir had 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)) of 40 M. Among the macrocyclic PIs, simeprevir had the highest (EC(50), 15 M) and glecaprevir the lowest (EC(50), >178 M) potency, with paritaprevir, grazoprevir, voxilaprevir, vaniprevir, danoprevir, and deldeprevir in between. Acyclic PIs asunaprevir and faldaprevir had EC(50)s of 72 and 23 M, respectively. ACH-806, inhibiting the HCV NS4A protease cofactor, had an EC(50) of 46 M. Similar and slightly increased PI potencies were found in human hepatoma Huh7.5 cells and human lung carcinoma A549-hACE2 cells, respectively. Selectivity indexes based on antiviral and cell viability assays were highest for linear PIs.

We here aimed to analyse the pulmonary immune response during severe COVID-19 and to compare this with blood responses. METHODS: This was an observational study in patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Mononuclear cells were purified from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and blood, and analysed by spectral flow cytometry; inflammatory mediators were measured in BALF and plasma. FINDINGS: Paired blood and BALF samples were obtained from 17 patients, four of whom died in the ICU. Macrophages and T cells were the most abundant cells in BALF, with a high percentage of T cells expressing the ? T cell receptor. In the lungs, both CD4 and CD8 T cells were predominantly effector memory cells (873% and 838%, respectively), and these cells expressed higher levels of the exhaustion marker programmad death-1 than in peripheral blood. Prolonged ICU stay (>14 days) was associated with a reduced proportion of activated T cells in peripheral blood and even more so in BALF.

METHODS: The CLI algorithm was developed using the Electronic Medical Record Support for Public Health platform (esphealth.org) and data from five clinical practice groups in Massachusetts that collectively care for 25% of the states population. Signs and symptoms of CLI were identified using ICD-10 diagnosis codes and measured temperature. The algorithm originally included three categories: Category 1 required codes for coronavirus infection and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI); Category 2 required an LRTI-related diagnosis and fever; Category 3 required an upper or lower RTI and fever. The three categories mirrored statewide laboratory-confirmed case trends during spring and summer 2020 but did not detect the increase in late fall. We hypothesized this was due to the requirements for fever and LRTI. Therefore, we added three new categories defined by milder symptoms without fever: Category 4 requires LRTI-related diagnoses only; Category 5 requires upper or lower RTI or olfactory/taste disorders; and Category 6 requires at least one sign of CLI not identified by another category. RESULTS: The six-category algorithm detected the initial surge in April 2020, the summer lull, and the second surge in late fall (see figure). Category 1 cases were not identified until mid-March, which coincides with the first laboratory-confirmed cases in Massachusetts. Categories 2 and 3, which required fever, were prominent during the initial surge but declined over time. Category 5, the broadest category, declined during February and March 2020, likely capturing the end of the influenza season, and successfully detected the spring surge and fall resurgence. Weekly number of COVID-19 like illnesses by category, February 2, 2020 through May 8, 2021 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: A syndromic definition that included mild upper RTI and olfactory/taste disorders, with or without fever or LRTI, mirrored changes in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases better than definitions that required fever and LRTI. This suggests a shift in medically attended care and/or coding practices during initial vs subsequent surges of COVID-19, and the importance of using a broad definition of CLI for ongoing surveillance.

STUDY DESIGN We performed a systematic review of the literature to identify reports of severe acute neurologic complications associated with acute respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children aged <15 years (PROSPERO Registration CRD42019125722). Main outcomes included neurologic, clinical, and demographic features of cases, and the frequency of disease. We aggregated available case data from the published literature and from the Australian Acute Childhood Encephalitis (ACE) study. RESULTS We identified 87 unique studies from 26 countries describing a spectrum of RSV-associated severe acute neurologic syndromes including proven encephalitis, acute encephalopathy, complex seizures, hyponatremic seizures, and immune-mediated disorders. The frequency of RSV infection in acute childhood encephalitis/encephalopathy was 1.2 to 6.5%. We aggregated data from 155 individual cases with RSV-associated severe acute neurologic complications; median age was 11.0 months (IQR 2.0-21.5), most were previously healthy (71/104, 68%). Seizure was the most frequently reported neurologic feature (127/150, 85%). RSV was detected in the central nervous system of 12 cases. Most children recovered (81/122, 66%), however some reports described partial recovery (33/122, 27%) and death (8/122, 7%). CONCLUSIONS RSV-associated neurologic complications have been widely reported but there is substantial heterogeneity in the design and quality of existing studies. The findings from our study have implications for the investigation, management, and prevention of RSV-associated neurologic complications.

Furthermore, preincubation of virus with soluble Nrp-1 dramatically inhibits infection by reducing virus attachment.

When involved in policing the stay-at-home orders, the extent of human rights violations is explained by the level of operational autonomy the military has in public security operations.

The normal response to high minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) fraction of anesthetics is hypotension and low Bispectral Index (BIS) scores. Low MAP and/or BIS at lower MAC fractions may represent anesthetic sensitivity. The authors sought to characterize the effect of the triple low state (low MAP and low BIS during a low MAC fraction) on duration of hospitalization and 30-day all-cause mortality. METHODS Mean intraoperative MAP, BIS, and MAC were determined for 24,120 noncardiac surgery patients at the Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio. The hazard ratios associated with combinations of MAP, BIS, and MAC values greater or less than a reference value were determined. The authors also evaluated the association between cumulative triple low minutes, and excess length-of-stay and 30-day mortality. RESULTS Means (SD) defining the reference, low, and high states were 87  5 mmHg (MAP), 46  4 (BIS), and 0.56  0.11 (MAC). Triple lows were associated with prolonged length of stay (hazard ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.7). Thirty-day mortality was doubled in double low combinations and quadrupled in the triple low group. Triple low duration 60 min quadrupled 30-day mortality compared with 15 min. Excess length of stay increased progressively from 15 min to 60 min of triple low. CONCLUSIONS The occurrence of low MAP during low MAC fraction was a strong and highly significant predictor for mortality. When these occurrences were combined with low BIS, mortality risk was even greater.

However, research waste (ie, unpublished data, inadequate reporting, or avoidable design limitations) is still a major challenge for evidence-based medicine. OBJECTIVES: To determine the characteristics of GC RCTs in the past 20 years and the presence of research waste and to explore potential targets for improvement. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional study of GC RCTs, ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for phase 3 or 4 RCTs registered from January 2000 to December 2019 using the keyword gastric cancer. Independent investigators undertook assessments and resolved discrepancies via consensus. Data were analyzed from August through December 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were descriptions of the characteristics of GC RCTs and the proportion of studies with signs of research waste. Research waste was defined as unpublished data, inadequate reporting, or avoidable design limitations. Publication status was determined by searching PubMed and Scopus databases. The adequacy of reporting was evaluated using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline checklist. Avoidable design limitations were determined based on existing bias or lack of cited systematic literature reviews. In the analyses of research waste, 125 RCTs that ended after June 2016 without publication were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 262 GC RCTs were included. The number of RCTs increased from 25 trials in 2000 to 2004 to 97 trials in 2015 to 2019, with a greater increase among RCTs of targeted therapy or immunotherapy, which increased from 0 trials in 2000 to 2004 to 36 trials in 2015 to 2019. The proportion of RCTs that were multicenter was higher in non-Asian regions than in Asian regions (50 of 71 RCTs [70.4%] vs 96 of 191 RCTs [50.3%]; P = .004). The analysis of research waste included 137 RCTs, of which 81 (59.1%) were published. Among published RCTs, 65 (80.2%) were judged to be adequately reported and 63 (77.8%) had avoidable design defects. Additionally, 119 RCTs (86.9%) had 1 or more features of research waste. Study settings that included blinding (odds ratio [OR], 0.56; 95% CI, 0.33-0.93; P = .03), a greater number of participants (ie, 200 participants; OR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01-0.51; P = .01), and external funding support (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08-0.60; P = .004) were associated with lower odds of research waste. Additionally, 35 RCTs (49.3%) were referenced in guidelines, and 18 RCTs (22.2%) had their prospective data reused. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, this study is the first to describe the characteristics of GC RCTs in the past 20 years, and it found a research waste burden, which may provide evidence for the development of rational RCTs and reduction of waste in the future.","output":"Characteristics and Research Waste Among Randomized Clinical Trials in Gastric Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 ravages the world, the efforts to identify this infection more quickly and efficiently grow in significance every day.

These patients can develop chronic fatigue, dyspnea, fevers, and persistent radiographic abnormalities after appearing to convalesce from their index infection. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case series of 3 patients with prolonged COVID-19 infections who had received rituximab prior to their index SARS-CoV-2 infection. They were all successfully treated with a combination of remdesivir and antibody therapy. This report demonstrates and replicates successful application of anti-viral therapy with remdesivir, and the provision of convalescent plasma/monoclonal antibodies to thwart B-cell depletion to treat patients with prolonged COVID-19 symptoms. DISCUSSION: Rituximab can cause B-cell depletion, impairment in humoral immunity, and delayed viral clearance with persistent viremia. Intact humoral and innate immunity appear necessary to eradicate SARS-CoV-2 in some individuals being treated with rituximab. The American Society of Hematology reports on 17 B-cell depleted patients with prolonged COVID-19 who were treated with convalescent plasma. All but 1 patient had symptom improvement within 48 hours. These findings support our experience and suggest that combination antiviral and antibody therapy is a promising treatment strategy. The reporting of successful and safe treatment strategies are crucial to guide clinicians as it is unlikely that there will be large, randomized control trials examining optimal therapeutic strategies for patients with a lack of humoral protection. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 who had been prescribed rituximab prior to infection may be susceptible to chronic symptoms with persistent radiographic features.

In predictive models for AKI, presence of CKD improved the area under the curve (AUC) (95% confidence interval) to 0.73 (0.71, 0.75), P < 0.001, and adding baseline creatinine improved the AUC to 0.85 (0.83, 0.86), P < 0.001, when compared to the base model AUC using only proteinuria and hematuria, AUC = 0.64 (0.62, 0.67). In RRT models, CKD status improved the AUC to 0.78 (0.75, 0.82), P < 0.001, and baseline creatinine improved the AUC to 0.84 (0.80, 0.88), P < 0.001, compared to the base model, AUC = 0.72 (0.68, 0.76). There was no significant improvement in model discrimination when both CKD and baseline serum creatinine were included. CONCLUSIONS: Proteinuria and hematuria values on dipstick urinalysis can be utilized to predict AKI and RRT in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We derived formulas using these two readily available values to help prognosticate kidney outcomes in these patients. Furthermore, the incorporation of CKD or baseline creatinine increases the accuracy of these formulas.

A strict kind of lockdown was imposed in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. During home confinement due to lockdown, people face multidimensional issues. The present study explored the psychological impacts of COVID-19 home confinement during the lockdown period and Wuhans residents attitude toward physical activity. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted to collect the primary data according to the study objectives. The population was Wuhan residents (+ 18 years) who were in home confinement. A total of 2280 participants reply to the online questionnaire survey and collected data after quantifying the data, about 2200 (96.49%); about (49.8%) female, about (49.4%) male, others about (0.2%), and about (0.6%) were not disclosed their gender participants responses were used for analysis. The collected data were analyzed through appropriate statistical techniques. RESULTS: According to results, H1 is supported with  = ?40.793, t = 57.835, p = 0.000, which claimed a negative association between COVID-19 lockdown policy and behavior and attitude. Results for H2 reveals that the COVID-19 lockdown policy have negative influence on emotional control with  = ?0.769, t = 46.766, p = 0.000 and it is supported.

Yet, the modern chicken in its many forms is the result of artificial selection more intense than almost any other domesticated animal. A consequence of great variation in genotype and phenotype is that some breeds have inherent aberrant physiological and morphological traits that may show up relatively early in development (e.g., hypertension, hyperglycemia, and limb defects in the broiler chickens). While such traits can be useful as models of specific diseases, this high degree of specialization can color general experimental results and affect their translational value. Against this background, in this review we first consider the characteristics that make an animal model attractive for developmental research (e.g., accessibility, ease of rearing, size, fecundity, development rates, genetic variation, etc.). We then explore opportunities presented by the embryo to adult continuum of alternative bird models, including quail, ratites, songbirds, birds of prey, and corvids.

Premise plumbing is constructed of a variety of materials, creating complex environments that vary chemically, microbiologically, spatially, and temporally in a manner likely to influence survival and growth of OPs. Here we systematically review the literature to critically examine the varied effects of common metallic (copper, iron) and plastic (PVC, cross-linked polyethylene (PEX)) pipe materials on factors influencing OP growth in drinking water, including nutrient availability, disinfectant levels, and the composition of the broader microbiome. Plastic pipes can leach organic carbon, but demonstrate a lower disinfectant demand and fewer water chemistry interactions. Iron pipes may provide OPs with nutrients directly or indirectly, exhibiting a high disinfectant demand and potential to form scales with high surface areas suitable for biofilm colonization. While copper pipes are known for their antimicrobial properties, evidence of their efficacy for OP control is inconsistent. Under some circumstances, coppers interactions with premise plumbing water chemistry and resident microbes can encourage growth of OPs. Plumbing design, configuration, and operation can be manipulated to control such interactions and health outcomes. Influences of pipe materials on OP physiology should also be considered, including the possibility of influencing virulence and antibiotic resistance. In conclusion, all known pipe materials have a potential to either stimulate or inhibit OP growth, depending on the circumstances. This review delineates some of these circumstances and informs future research and guidance towards effective deployment of pipe materials for control of OPs.","output":"Critical Review: Propensity of Premise Plumbing Pipe Materials to Enhance or Diminish Growth of Legionella and Other Opportunistic Pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background: People with schizophrenia are at high risk for developing severe COVID-19 outcomes but recent evidence suggests that this population have lower vaccination rates than the general population. This gap in vaccination rates could be explained by attitudinal and structural barriers. Aims: This study explored the role of potential attitudinal barriers by comparing schizophrenia patients with participants from the general population regarding COVID-19 vaccination rates, general attitudes towards vaccines, and willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional study between April 2021 and October 2021. 100 schizophrenia patients and 72 controls were recruited. Attitudes towards vaccines were assessed with the Vaccination Attitudes Examination Scale. COVID-19 vaccination rates, sociodemographic, clinical and health-related variables were also assessed. Results: In our study, the proportion of individuals with schizophrenia were under-vaccinated despite similar general attitudes towards vaccination and higher willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 compared to the participants from the general population. In patients, negative attitudes toward vaccines was related to higher level of negative psychotic symptoms and higher level of paranoid ideation. As a whole, participants with more negative attitudes towards vaccines were less likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and had lower levels of trust in institutions. Conclusions: Vaccine hesitancy does not appear to be a major barrier for COVID-19 vaccine uptake amongst people with schizophrenia. This study suggests that disparities in COVID-19 vaccination rates in schizophrenia do not seem related to attitudinal but rather structural barriers.","output":"Attitudes towards vaccines, intent to vaccinate and the relationship with COVID-19 vaccination rates in individuals with schizophrenia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research aims to study the effects of technological organization, management of cost innovation, and value creation.

Fisher and Robertson (1999) first showed the existence of a silk gland in the head of adult Melissotarsus beccarii workers, and we confirm this with detailed histology and ultrastructural comparisons of both queens and workers. This African genus exhibits extreme morphological adaptations (legs, head shape and mandibular muscles) for tunnelling behaviour inside living trees, that underlie an obligate mutualism with scale insects. Rhopalomastix is its sister genus distributed across Asia, and we show that queens and workers also have a silk gland. This lineage of minute workers relies on silk to secure their network of tunnels against other arboreal ants. We show striking differences between these genera in the anatomy and ultrastructure of the cells that secrete silk, especially numerous vacuoles and an unexpectedly branched end apparatus in Melissotarsus. Moreover, the legs of Melissotarsus are much more specialized for tunnelling, and this includes highly expanded basitarsi. The latter house the novel 'Delage-Darchen gland', and we document its anatomy and ultrastructure, suggesting a proteinaceous secretion to harden roofs made of silk combined with wood fragments. The restriction of the Delage-Darchen gland to Melissotarsus, combined with a modified silk gland (an almost three-fold increase in the number of secretory cells, and ultrastructural differences suggestive of higher secretory activity), are evidence of an outstanding evolutionary divergence relative to Rhopalomastix. Synthesis of silk by adults is a significant innovation among ants, but its augmented production in Melissotarsus makes them better adapted for the hazards of arboreal life.","output":"Glandular innovations for a tunnelling life: Silk and associated leg glands in Melissotarsus and Rhopalomastix queen and worker ants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has adversely affected many countries in the world The unexpected large number of COVID-19 cases has disrupted the healthcare system in many countries and resulted in a shortage of bed spaces in the hospitals Consequently, predicting the number of COVID-19 cases is imperative for governments to take appropriate actions The number of COVID-19 cases can be accurately predicted by considering historical data of reported cases alongside some external factors that affect the spread of the virus In the literature, most of the existing prediction methods focus only on the historical data and overlook most of the external factors Hence, the number of COVID-19 cases is inaccurately predicted Therefore, the main objective of this study is to simultaneously consider historical data and the external factors This can be accomplished by adopting data analytics, which include developing a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous input (NARX) neural network-based algorithm The viability and superiority of the developed algorithm are demonstrated by conducting experiments using data collected for top five affected countries in each continent The results show an improved accuracy when compared with existing methods Moreover, the experiments are extended to make future prediction for the number of patients afflicted with COVID-19 during the period from August 2020 until September 2020 By using such predictions, both the government and people in the affected countries can take appropriate measures to resume pre-epidemic activities","output":"Data Analytics for Predicting COVID-19 Cases in Top Affected Countries: Observations and Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acetamiprid is a potent new first-generation neonicotinoid insecticide in agricultural practices.

Social engagement has been identified as a key factor in promoting positive health behaviors and quality of life and preventing social isolation and loneliness. Studies involving cognitively healthy older adults have shown the protective effects of both in-person and technology-based social engagement. However, the benefits of social engagement for people who are already at-risk of developing dementia, namely those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), have yet to be elucidated. We present a narrative review of the literature, summarizing the research on social engagement in MCI. First, we identified social networks (quality, size, frequency, and closeness) and social activities (frequency, format, purpose, type, and content) as two overarching dimensions of an integrative framework for social engagement derived from literature examining typical cognitive aging. We then used this framework as a lens to examine studies of social engagement in MCI to explore (i) the relationship between in-person and technology-based social engagement and cognitive, emotional, and physical health, and (ii) interventions that target social engagement including technology-based approaches. Overall, we found that persons with MCI (PwMCI) may have different levels of social engagement than those experiencing typical cognitive aging. Moreover, in-person social engagement can have a positive impact on cognitive, emotional, and physical health for PwMCI. With respect to activity and network dimensions in our framework, we found that cognitive health has been more widely examined in PwMCI relative to physical and emotional health. Very few intervention studies have targeted social engagement, but both in-person and technology-based interventions appear to have promising health and well-being outcomes. Our multidimensional framework of social engagement provides guidance for research on characterizing the protective benefits of social engagement for PwMCI and informs the development of novel interventions including technology-based approaches.","output":"An Integrative Framework to Guide Social Engagement Interventions and Technology Design for Persons With Mild Cognitive Impairment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS Several reports have demonstrated the safety of pure natural-orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (P-NOTES) using transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) and embryonic NOTES (E-NOTES; laparoscopic surgery through the umbilicus). This study was performed to compare the safety and applicability of NOTES rectosigmoidectomy between E-NOTES and P-NOTES in a swine model. PATIENTS AND METHODS E-NOTES was conducted through a single port using laparoscopic instruments (n = 11). P-NOTES was performed using TEM with transgastric endoscopic assistance (n = 11). Gastrotomies were created using a needle knife and the balloon dilatation technique, and closed using T-anchors. Blood samples were collected to evaluate changes in systemic cytokine levels during the preoperative and postoperative periods; operative outcomes were also evaluated and compared between the groups. The necropsy findings were recorded after sacrifice at 1 week after the procedure. RESULTS The mean operative time for P-NOTES was significantly longer than that for E-NOTES (239 vs. 103 minutes, P < 0.001). The mean distance from the anal verge to colorectal anastomosis in the P-NOTES group was significantly less than that in the E-NOTES group (2.9 vs. 17.6 cm, P < 0.001). On necropsy, the complication rate of P-NOTES was higher than that of E-NOTES, but without statistical significance (54.5 % vs. 18.2 %, P = 0.091).

No epidemiological data are available in these two populations. We report COVID-19 attack rate in HIV-infected patients and in PrEP users in the Rh?ne department, France, and compared it with the general population. DESIGN Retrospective analysis of a laboratory database. METHODS COVID-19 testing strategy in France was centered on symptomatic infections, hospitalized patients and symptomatic healthcare workers while most asymptomatic cases were not confirmed. SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate on PCR assays and COVID-19 attack rate were determined in HIV-infected patients and in PrEP users. COVID-19 attack rate in the general population was estimated from health authorities' database and demographic data.

The conclusions contribute to enriching the outcomes regarding the risk control of rural inclusive finance, provide experiences to its sustainable development and offer a reference to other countries with their risk control of rural inclusive finance. Originality/value: Drawing on the knowledge-sharing approach, this study creatively resolves the persistent problems in the risk control of rural inclusive finance, which forms a powerful supplement to the extant literature. Meanwhile, the paper combines the two contextual factors of the post-COVID-19 era and emerging economies, which can be deemed as a novel attempt. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Research on the impact of knowledge sharing on risk control of inclusive finance in rural areas during the post-COVID-19 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aims: The health emergency caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has negatively impacted the management of HCV infection, potentially jeopardizing the achievement of the goal of eliminate hepatitis C by 2030. To take advantage of the current sanitary situation, associated screening for HCV and SARS-CoV-2 infection have been carried out. We decided to propose HCV screening also to people who undergone SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. [Formula presented] Methods: Screening for hepatitis C was carried out by finger-prick test to search for HCV antibodies. It took place in the minutes following the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, in two different vaccination centers of the Campania region, and in two different time frames. In the period 1 May-20 July 2021, screening for hepatitis C was offered to the general population who got the vaccine at the Fisciano (province of Salerno) vaccination center. In the period 20 September-11 October 2021, screening for hepatitis C was offered to the general population who underwent vaccination at the San Leonardo Hospital (Castellammare di Stabia, metropolitan city of Naples). In both sites, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines were used. Results: Out of 5095 people who underwent vaccination at the Fisciano vaccination center, 1952 (38,3%, average age 41,6 years) performed screening for hepatitis C. 5 of these (0,25%, average age 54,2 years) resulted HCV-Ab positive;all 5 were aware of their condition;4 had previous treatment;1 (0,05%) was found to have active HCV infection. Out of 2202 people vaccinated at the San Leonardo Hospital, 1207 (54,8%, average age 43,1 years) underwent screening for hepatitis C. Among these, 9 (0,7%, average age 54,3) resulted positive. 5/9 tested negative on the confirmatory test;2/9 were aware of their condition and had previous treatment;1 subject (0,08%) was found to have active HCV infection;1 subject is awaiting the results at time of writing. In both sites a consistent percentage of people refused the HCV-Ab test. Moreover, the prevalence of HCV-Ab positivity and HCV active infection was found to be lower than the national data. Frequent reasons for refusing the test were lack of knowledge of the disease, fear of a positive result, and distrust in the test's effectiveness. Someone refused the test because vaccination was considered a particularly stressful event. The low prevalence of HCV infection found in these projects could be at least partly attributable to the under-participation of the elderly, as at the time the screenings were carried out most of them had probably already received the expected doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Conclusions: In conclusion, we believe that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination could be an opportunity to screen for HCV infection, but to maximize the benefits of this screening, the characteristics of the subjects to be tested should be reconsidered, by focusing particularly on the elderly population.","output":"Screening for HCV infection combined with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the Campania region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether engagement in a COVID-19 remote patient monitoring (RPM) programme or telemedicine programme improves patient outcomes. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study analysing patient responsiveness to our RPM survey or telemedicine visits and outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Daily text message surveys and telemedicine consultations were offered to all patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at our institutional screening centres. Survey respondents with alarm responses were contacted by a nurse. We assessed the relationship between virtual engagement (telemedicine or RPM survey response) and clinical outcomes using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Between 10 July 2020 and 2 January 2021, 6822 patients tested positive, with 1230 (18%) responding to at least one survey. Compared with non-responders, responders were younger (49 vs 53 years) and more likely to be white (40% vs 33%) and female (65% vs 55%) and had fewer comorbidities. After adjustment, individuals who engaged virtually were less likely to experience an emergency department visit, hospital admission or intensive care unitClevel care.

Although a number of vaccines have been deployed, the continual evolution of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the virus has challenged their efficacy. In particular, the emerging variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 (first detected in the UK, South Africa and Brazil, respectively) have compromised the efficacy of sera from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and immunotherapies that have received emergency use authorization(1C3). One potential alternative to avert viral escape is the use of camelid VHHs (variable heavy chain domains of heavy chain antibody (also known as nanobodies)), which can recognize epitopes that are often inaccessible to conventional antibodies(4). Here, we isolate anti-RBD nanobodies from llamas and from mice that we engineered to produce VHHs cloned from alpacas, dromedaries and Bactrian camels. We identified two groups of highly neutralizing nanobodies. Group 1 circumvents antigenic drift by recognizing an RBD region that is highly conserved in coronaviruses but rarely targeted by human antibodies. Group 2 is almost exclusively focused to the RBDCACE2 interface and does not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants that carry E484K or N501Y substitutions. However, nanobodies in group 2 retain full neutralization activity against these variants when expressed as homotrimers, andto our knowledgerival the most potent antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 that have been produced to date. These findings suggest that multivalent nanobodies overcome SARS-CoV-2 mutations through two separate mechanisms: enhanced avidity for the ACE2-binding domain and recognition of conserved epitopes that are largely inaccessible to human antibodies. Therefore, although new SARS-CoV-2 mutants will continue to emerge, nanobodies represent promising tools to prevent COVID-19 mortality when vaccines are compromised.","output":"Nanobodies from camelid mice and llamas neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incidence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has brought daunting complications for people as well as physicians around the world.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of COVID-19 and pandemic regulations on current and future PPRI. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey-based study that analyzed data from 400 surveyed dermatologists using a pre-validated questionnaire sent via email. Data regarding PPRI were collected over 1 week in July 2020 to compare demographics and practice standards from April 2019, April 2020, July 2020, and predictions for 2021. RESULTS: Virtual-only PPRI increased from 7.8% in April 2019 to 26.5% during April 2020 (mean difference, 18.8%; 95% confidence interval, 13.6%&ndash;23.9%). Virtual-only PPRI remained elevated at 24.5% while hybrid PPRI increased, eventually surpassing the April 2019 mark (27.0%). These trends persisted among all studied practice types and levels of experience. Practices predicted no significant percent differences in participation in PPRI (87.3% vs 90.3%; P=0.0834), but a significant shift in method of delivery where the odds ratio of incorporating a virtual component into PPRI in 2021 increased by a factor of 3. LIMITATIONS: Relatively small sample size, especially among subgroups. Responses may have been retrospective estimates. There may also be selection bias given slightly increased representation of more experienced dermatologists. CONCLUSION: PPRI materially decreased during the initial COVID-19 peak but will likely return to baseline volume moving forward with a significant component being hybrid PPRI. Further studies may better elucidate the economic and clinical impact associated with these changes and their effect on dermatologists&rsquo; ability to provide patients with samples and educational materials.

We focus not only on experimental results but also discuss theoretical and simulation studies regarding kinetic and structural aspects of heteroaggregation processes arising in such systems. In the first part of this work, heteroaggregation of oppositely charged particles is reviewed. When the interactions are short ranged, binary diffusion-limited cluster-cluster aggregation takes place. In this case, the short time behavior of the system follows the Hogg, Healy and Fuerstenau (HHF) theory. At long times, however, stable aggregates may form and remain in the system. Furthermore, cluster discrimination is observed, clusters that differ only by one constituent particle were found to behave quite differently. When the range of the interactions is increased, the latter effects become more pronounced. The fractal dimension of heteroaggregates is, in general, smaller than the values reported for fast and slow homoaggregation processes. In some cases, even values close to unity were obtained. This means that heteroaggregates have an open branched structure that may approach a chain-like morphology. In the second part of this work, we briefly discuss similar effects arising in heteroaggregation phenomena due to differences in particle size and chemical composition. The third part of this review tackles recent developments in the field of equilibrium phase diagrams of binary colloids.

The setting of this study was an eight-bed ICU at a tertiary-care hospital in Okayama, Japan. We included patients who underwent urgent tracheal intubation at the emergency department or the ICU and were admitted to the ICU between April 2013 and November 2017. We extracted data on methods and medications of intubation, predictors for difficult intubation, CormackCLehane grade, patient demographics, primary diagnoses, reintubation. We estimated odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals for elective tracheostomy during the ICU stay using logistic regression models. Of 411 patients, 46 patients underwent intubation without neuromuscular blocking agents and 61 patients underwent tracheostomy. After adjusting for potential confounders, patients who avoided neuromuscular blocking agents had more than double the odds of tracheostomy (odds ratio 2.59, 95% confidence interval 1.06C6.34, p value = 0.04).

Herein we investigated the role of Sirtuin and Forkhead box O (FOXO) families in this experimental model using Nortern Blot and Western Blot analysis. Our results demonstrated that mitochondrial SIRT3 and SIRT4 protein expression increased from 12 and 24 h post infection (p.i.) onwards, respectively, whereas the nuclear SIRT1 expression increased during the first 12 h p.i. followed by a decrease after 36 h p.i., reaching the same level of control at 48 h p.i. Sirtuins interact with/and regulate the activity of FOXO family proteins, and we herein observed that FOXO3A and FOXO1 expression increased significantly and stably from 12 h p.i. onwards. In addition, CCoV-II induces a remarkable increase in the expression of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), while we observed a slight up-regulation of FasL/Fas at 36 p.i. with a decrease of both proteins at the end of infection. Furthermore, we found that virus infection increased both bax translocation into mitochondria and decreased bcl-2 expression in cytosol in a time-dependent manner. These data suggest that FOXO transcription factors mediate pro-apoptotic effects of CCoV-II, in part due to activation of extrinsic apoptosis pathway, while some Sirtuin family members (such as SIRT3 and SIRT4) may be involved in intrinsic apoptotic pathway.

The neuropsychological effects of simvastatin are not known, but their ascertainment would have significant translational value about simvastatins influence on mood and cognition. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the effects of simvastatin on a battery of psychological tests and inflammatory markers in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Fifty-three healthy subjects were randomly assigned to 7 days of either simvastatin (N = 27) or sucrose-based placebo (N = 26) given in a double-blind fashion. Then, participants were administered questionnaires measuring subjective rates of mood and anxiety, and a battery of tasks assessing emotional processing, reward learning, and verbal memory. Blood samples for C-reactive protein were also collected. RESULTS: Compared to placebo, participants on simvastatin showed a higher number of positively valenced intrusions in the emotional recall task (F(1,51) = 4.99, p = 0.03), but also an increase in anxiety scores (F(1,51) = 5.37, p = 0.02). An exploratory analysis of the females subgroup (N = 27) showed lower number of misclassifications as sad facial expression in the simvastatin arm (F(1,25) = 6.60, p = 0.02). No further statistically significant changes could be observed on any of the other outcomes measured. CONCLUSIONS: We found limited evidence that 7-day simvastatin use in healthy volunteer induces a positive emotional bias while also being associated with an increase in anxiety, potentially reflecting the early effects of antidepressants in clinical practice. Such effect might be more evident in female subjects. Different drug dosages, treatment lengths, and sample selection need consideration in further experimental medicine and clinical studies.

We studied the effect of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against IL-17A in our model of mouse MHV-A59-infection. MAb anti-IL-17F and anti-IFN were used to complement the study. Results showed that transaminase levels markedly decreased in MHV-A59-infected mice treated with MAb anti-IL-17A whereas plasmatic Ig concentration sharply increased. Conversely, MAb anti-IL-17F enhanced transaminase liberation and did not affect Ig levels. Serum IFN was detected in mice infected with MHV-A59 and its concentration increased after MAb anti-IL-17A administration. Besides, MAb anti-IFN greatly augmented transaminase plasmatic levels. IL-17A neutralization did not affect MHV-A59-induction of HMGB1 liberation and slightly augmented plasmatic uric acid concentration. However, mice treated with the MAb failed to produce autoAb to FAH. The above results suggest a reciprocal regulation of Th1 and Th17 cells acting on the different MHV-A59 effects.

METHODS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated from 16 April 2020 to 7 January 2021 at this hospital were screened for ocular manifestations in the anterior and posterior segments. Conjunctival swabs were analyzed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. RESULTS: A total of 37 patients were enrolled in this study. In the anterior segment we found chemosis of the conjunctiva (5), hyposphagma (2) and conjunctivitis (1). In 11 patients vascular alterations and potentially disease-specific manifestations of the fundus were found in one or both eyes: retinal hemorrhages (5), cotton wool spots (5) and tortuosity (5). One patient demonstrated branch artery occlusion, one had branch retinal vein occlusion and two patients had positive conjunctival swab results in one or both eyes. CONCLUSION: Our findings of the anterior segment are commonly known, although not specific for COVID-19.

METHODS: Remnant blood samples from 7450 unique patients were collected over 4 months in 2020 for SARS-CoV-2 antibody (Ab), HCV Ab, and HIV-1/2 antigen and Ab. Among them, 5012 patients were tested by polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 based on clinical suspicion. Sociodemographics, ED clinical presentations, and outcomes associated with coinfections were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 729 (9.8%) patients had SARS-CoV-2 (acute or convalescent), 934 (12.5%) HCV, 372 (5.0%) HIV infection, and 211 patients (2.8%) had evidence of any coinfection (HCV/HIV, 1.5%; SARS-CoV-2/HCV, 0.7%; SARS-CoV-2/HIV, 0.3%; SARS-CoV-2/HCV/HIV, 0.3%).

MethodsIn an ongoing phase 2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04471519) the protocol was amended after six months to re-consent and randomise 184 previously vaccinated participants to receive a third dose of vaccine or placebo on Day 215. The primary outcome was to measure neutralising antibody titres by plaque-reduction neutralisation test (PRNT50) four weeks after the booster; safety as serious adverse events (SAE) was the key secondary outcome. FindingsFour weeks after a second BBV152 vaccination geometric mean titres (GMTs) of neutralising antibodies were 197{middle dot}0 PRNT50 (95% CI: 155{middle dot}6-249{middle dot}4); this level declined to 23{middle dot}9 PRNT50 (14{middle dot}0-40{middle dot}6) six months later, with a seroconversion rate of 75{middle dot}4% (95% CI: 68{middle dot}4-81{middle dot}6). Four weeks after booster vaccination the GMT increased on Day 243 to 746{middle dot}6 PRNT50 (514{middle dot}9-1081) compared with 100{middle dot}7 PRNT50 (43{middle dot}6-232{middle dot}6) in the placebo group. Corresponding seroconversion rates were 98{middle dot}7% (92{middle dot}8-99{middle dot}9) and 79{middle dot}8% (69{middle dot}6-87{middle dot}8). Increased titres in the placebo group were attributed to natural infection as the study was conducted during the second wave of COVID-19 in India. PRNT50 titres against the SARS-CoV-2 variants increased--Alpha (32{middle dot}6-fold), Beta (161{middle dot}0-fold), Delta (264{middle dot}7-fold), and Delta plus (174{middle dot}2-fold)--after the booster vaccination. We found that vaccine induces both memory B and T cells with a distinct AIM+ specific CD4+T central and effector memory phenotype, including CD8+ TEMRA phenotype.

InterpretationSix months after a two-dose BBV152 vaccination series cell mediated immunity and neutralising antibodies to both homologous (D614G) and heterologous strains (Alpha, Beta, Delta and Delta plus) persisted above baseline, although the magnitude of the responses had declined. Neutralising antibodies against homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV-2 variants increased 19- to 97-fold after a third vaccination.

Our focus is on the extent to which geographic mobility affected the stringency of governmental policy responses. Using daily data since the beginning of 2020, we find that societies that are more geographically mobile have governmental policy responses that are less stringent. We pursue an instrumental variable strategy that exploits climate data to identify arguably exogenous variation in geographic mobility levels, which lends a causal interpretation to our results. One explanation for the sub-optimal result is that it may be more costly (economically and politically) for governments to impose stringent policies on more mobile societies. By examining disaggregated mobility data, we show that the negative relation between geographic mobility and policy stringency is the strongest for commercially-oriented movements. The relation is weaker for geographic movements that relate to civil society.

The shortage of personal protective equipment, including N95 respirators, in hospital facilities has put frontline healthcare professionals at high risk for contracting this virus. AIM: To develop a reproducible and safe N95 respirator reprocessing method that satisfies all presented regulatory standards and that can be directly implemented by hospitals using existing available equipment. METHODS: A non-toxic gravity steam reprocessing method has been developed for the reuse of N95 respirators consisting of 30 min of steam treatment at 121C followed by 30 min of heat drying. Samples of model number 1860, 1860s, 1870+, and 9105 N95 respirators were either collected from hospitals (for microbiology testing) or purchased new (for functionality testing), with all functionality tests (i.e. filter efficiency, fit evaluation, and strap integrity) performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention using standard procedures established by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. FINDINGS: All tested models passed the minimum filter efficiency of 95% after three cycles of gravity steam reprocessing. The 1870+ N95 respirator model is the most promising model for reprocessing based on its efficient bacterial inactivation coupled with the maintenance of all other key functional respirator properties after multiple reprocessing steps. CONCLUSIONS: The gravity steam method can effectively reprocess N95 respirators over at least three reprocessing cycles without negatively impacting the functionality requirements set out by regulators.

METHODS: Patients with clinical N0 non-small cell lung cancer and total tumour size >30 mm on preoperative computed tomography who underwent complete resection with lobectomy between January 2007 and December 2017 were included. The patients were divided into three groups: pure solid tumour, low ground glass opacity ratio (1-39%) tumour and high ground glass opacity ratio (&#8805;40%) tumour. The cut-off line was determined based on the recurrence rate for every 10% ground glass opacity ratio. RESULTS: Among the 227 study patients, 129 (56.8%) had a pure solid tumour, 54 (23.8%) had a low ground glass opacity ratio tumour and 44 (19.4%) had a high ground glass opacity ratio tumour. Three-year recurrence-free survival was significantly shorter in patients with a pure solid tumour (57.4%) than in patients with a low ground glass opacity ratio (74.5%; P = 0.009) or a high ground glass opacity ratio tumour (92.1%; P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that ground glass opacity ratio was a significant independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.175; P = 0.037). CONCLUSION: Pure solid tumours comprised a large proportion of non-small cell lung cancer tumours >30 mm in size and their prognosis was poor.

Measurements of sequential viral loads were aggregated using the cubic spline smoothing function of a generalized additive model. The time to negative conversion was compared between symptom groups using survival analysis. RESULTS: In URT samples, viral RNA levels peaked on day 4 after symptom onset and rapidly decreased until day 10 for both E and RdRp genes, whereas those in LRT samples immediately peaked from symptom onset and decreased until days 15.6 and 15.0 for E and RdRp genes, respectively. Median (interquartile range) time to negative conversion was significantly longer in symptomatic (18.0 [13.0-25.0] days) patients than in asymptomatic (13.0 [9.5-17.5] days) patients.

BACKGROUND: Although ML models have been proposed to revolutionize medicine, their promise in predicting HF events has not been investigated in detail. METHODS: A systematic search was performed on Medline, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore for studies published between January 1, 2011 to July 14, 2021 that developed or validated at least one statistical or ML model that could predict all-cause mortality or all-cause readmission of HF patients. Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool was used to assess the risk of bias, and random effect model was used to evaluate the pooled c-statistics of included models. RESULT: Two-hundred and two statistical model studies and 78 ML model studies were included from the retrieved papers. The pooled c-index of statistical models in predicting all-cause mortality, ML models in predicting all-cause mortality, statistical models in predicting all-cause readmission, ML models in predicting all-cause readmission were 0.733 (95% confidence interval 0.724C0.742), 0.777 (0.752C0.803), 0.678 (0.651C0.706), and 0.660 (0.633C0.686), respectively, indicating that ML models did not show consistent superiority compared to statistical models. The head-to-head comparison revealed similar results. Meanwhile, the immoderate use of predictors limited the feasibility of ML models.

MATERIALS AND METHODS In accordance with previous work suggesting a correlation between the risk of rupture and the material properties of cerebral aneurysms, 12 fluid-structure interaction computations were performed on 12 \\"patient-specific\\" cases, corresponding to typical shapes and locations of cerebral aneurysms. The variations of the aneurysmal volume during the cardiac cycle (V) are compared by using wall material characteristics of either degraded or nondegraded tissues. RESULTS Aneurysms were located on 6 different arteries: middle cerebral artery (4), anterior cerebral artery (3), internal carotid artery (1), vertebral artery (1), ophthalmic artery (1), and basilar artery (1). Aneurysms presented different shapes (uniform or multilobulated) and diastolic volumes (from 18 to 392 mm3). The pulsatility (V/V) was significantly larger for a soft aneurysmal material (average of 26%) than for a stiff material (average of 4%). The difference between V, for each condition, was statistically significant: P=.005.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic search on PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. The search results underwent two-phase title/abstract and full-text screenings. We then analyzed SD-OCT measurements differences in patients with high BMI and controls, and performed meta-regression, sub-group analysis, quality assessment, and publication bias assessment. The measurements included macular thickness, cup to disc ratio, ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) and its sub-sectors, RNFL and peripapillary RNFL (pRNFL) and their sub-layers, and choroidal thickness and its sub-sectors. RESULTS: 19 studies were included in this meta-analysis accounting for 1813 individuals, 989 cases and 824 controls. There was an overall trend towards decreased thickness in high BMI patients, but only two measurements reached statistical significance: temporal retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (Standardized mean difference (SMD): -0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.53 to -0.14, p<0.01) and the choroidal region 1.0 mm nasal to fovea (SMD: -0.38, 95% CI: -0.60 to -0.16, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Some ocular layers are thinner in patients with higher BMI than the controls.

Here, we analyzed the viral data and clinical manifestations of 289 domestic Chinese COVID-19 patients and found that 21 individuals (7.3%) were readmitted for hospitalization after detection of SARS-CoV-2 after discharge. First, we experimentally confirmed that the virus was involved in the initial infection and was not a secondary infection. In positive retests, the virus was usually found in anal samples (15 of 21, 71.4%). Through analysis of the intracellular viral subgenomic messenger RNA (sgmRNA), we verified that positive retest patients had active viral replication in their gastrointestinal tracts (3 of 16 patients, 18.7%) but not in their respiratory tracts. Then, we found that viral persistence was not associated with high viral titers, delayed viral clearance, old age, or more severe clinical symptoms during the first hospitalization. In contrast, viral rebound was associated with significantly lower levels of and slower generation of viral receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgA and IgG antibodies. Our study demonstrated that the positive retest patients failed to create a robust protective humoral immune response, which might result in SARS-CoV-2 persistence in the gastrointestinal tract and possibly in active viral shedding.

We investigated the impact of acute and chronic changes in carbon supply on inter-guild competition in two moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBR), operated with (R1) and without (R0) external organic carbon supply. The microbial and nitrifying community composition of the reactors differed significantly. Interestingly, acute increases in the dissolved organic carbon inhibited nitrification in R1 ten times more than in R0. A sustained increase in the carbon supply decreased nitrification efficiency and increased denitrification activity to a greater extent in R1, and also increased the proportion of potential denitrifiers in both bioreactors. The findings suggest that autotrophic biofilms subjected to increases in carbon supply show higher nitrification and lower denitrification activity than carbon-fed biofilms. This has significant implications for the design of nitrifying bioreactors. Specifically, efficient removal of organic matter before the nitrification unit can improve the robustness of the bioreactor to varying influent quality. Thus, maintaining a low C/N ratio is important in nitrifying biofilters when acute carbon stress is expected or when anoxic activity (e.g. denitrification or H2S production) is undesirable, such as in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS).","output":"Nitrifying biofilms deprived of organic carbon show higher functional resilience to increases in carbon supply."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants intensifies globally, the burden of COVID-19 on the already strained health systems is becoming increasingly concerning.

Using the experience sampling method, the data in study 2 were collected from 115 consumers (employees) using ten iterations of 2-day continual questionnaires (Sunday and the following Monday) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results from multilevel structural equation modelling indicate that unneeded consumption behaviour positively impacts work engagement in a moderated mediating mode. Consumer indulgence positively moderates the mediating effect of recovery level on the relationship between indulgent consumption behaviour and work engagement, while perceived consumer effectiveness negatively moderates the mediating effect of recovery level.

Since infection during pregnancy can increase the risk for preeclampsia, a viral infection could further increase this in women with aPL. The goal of this study was to characterize the effect of viral components on trophoblast responses to aPL. METHOD OF STUDY A human first trimester trophoblast cell line was treated with or without aPL or control IgG in the presence of media, viral dsRNA or viral ssRNA. Supernatants were measured for inflammatory IL-1 and IL-8; inflammasome-associated uric acid and caspase-1 activity; and anti-angiogenic sFlt-1. Trophoblast migration was measured using a two-chamber assay. RESULTS Viral dsRNA augmented aPL-induced trophoblast caspase-1 activity and IL-1 and IL-8 secretion in an additive manner. Viral ssRNA inhibited aPL-induced uric acid, IL-1 and sFlt-1 secretion, and further exacerbated aPL-inhibition of trophoblast migration. CONCLUSION While viral ssRNA may have some protective effects on aPL-induced inflammation and anti-angiogenic responses, viral dsRNA exacerbated aPL-mediated inflammation and viral ssRNA further limited cell migration, which could prove detrimental to placentation. Thus, viral infections may contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with aPL. This article is protected by copyright.

Several commonly used approaches to control foodborne pathogens include antibiotics, natural antimicrobials, bacteriophages, bacteriocins, ionizing radiations, and heat. In addition, probiotics offer a potential intervention strategy for the prevention and control of foodborne infections. This review focuses on the use of probiotics and bioengineered probiotics to control foodborne pathogens, their antimicrobial actions, and their delivery strategies.

To tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, China imposed full lockdowns and thorough travel restrictions. This event represents an unprecedented inadvertent geoengineering experiment in vehicle emissions, emulating transition to EVs. Here we novelly exploited observations of air quality during the full lockdown to constrain predictions of a comprehensive chemical transport model. Large traffic flux reductions were near-linearly linked to reductions of NO 2 and PM 2.5 (correlation = 0.491 ~ 0.626). Extrapolating to a full conversion to EV results in a large reduction of PM 2.5 (30 ~ 70%) in most of central and south eastern China. A smaller reduction of PM 2.5 (10 ~ 20%) in Beijing and Tianjin was achievable due to the presence of major industrial emission sources which cause haze at a regional scale. The potential reductions in NO 2 were 40 ~ 90% in most of the megacities.

CASE SUMMARY: A 75-year-old man was admitted to our hospital complaining of loss of appetite, yellow urine, and abnormal liver function for the past 2 wk. Three months prior to admission, he was treated with two rounds of capecitabine in combination with camrelizumab for lymph node metastasis of esophageal cancer. Although liver function was normal before treatment, abnormal liver function appeared at week 5. Capecitabine and camrelizumab were discontinued. Ursodeoxycholic acid and methylprednisolone 40 mg daily were administered. Liver function continued to deteriorate. Prothrombin time and international normalized ratio were 19 s and 1.8, respectively. The patient was diagnosed with acute liver failure. A pathological analysis of liver biopsy indicated a strongly positive immunohistochemical staining of T8(+) cells, thereby suggesting that drug-induced liver injury was related to IRH caused by camrelizumab. Subsequently, we performed sequential dual-molecule plasma adsorption system (DPMAS) treatment with plasma exchange (PE). After two rounds of treatment, the patient's appetite significantly improved, the yellow color of urine reduced, and liver function improved (total bilirubin level decreased) after five rounds of treatment. Liver function normalized 4 wk after discharge. CONCLUSION: The use of sequential DPMAS with PE can reduce liver injury and systemic toxic reactions by clearing inflammatory mediators and harmful substances from blood, and regulate immune cell activity, which may be effective in the treatment of severe ICI-induced IRH.","output":"Efficacy of artificial liver support system in severe immune-associated hepatitis caused by camrelizumab: A case report and review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To evaluate the longitudinal changes in retinal vessel diameters in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

This is the first study to focus on highly time-resolved chemical speciation and source apportionment of PM2.5 to assess the impact of the lockdown and subsequent relaxations on the sources of ambient PM2.5 in Delhi, India. The elemental, organic, and black carbon fractions of PM2.5 were measured at the IIT Delhi campus from February 2020 to May 2020. We report source apportionment results using positive matrix factorization (PMF) of organic and elemental fractions of PM2.5 during the different phases of the lockdown. The resolved sources such as vehicular emissions, domestic coal combustion, and semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosol (SVOOA) were found to decrease by 96%, 95%, and 86%, respectively, during lockdown phase-1 as compared to pre-lockdown. An unforeseen rise in O3 concentrations with declining NOx levels was observed, similar to other parts of the globe, leading to the low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosols (LVOOA) increasing to almost double the pre-lockdown concentrations during the last phase of the lockdown. The effect of the lockdown was found to be less pronounced on other resolved sources like secondary chloride, power plants, dust-related, hydrocarbon-like organic aerosols (HOA), and biomass burning related emissions, which were also swayed by the changing meteorological conditions during the four lockdown phases. The results presented in this study provide a basis for future emission control strategies, quantifying the extent to which constraining certain anthropogenic activities can ameliorate the ambient air. These results have direct relevance to not only Delhi but the entire Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP), citing similar geographical and meteorological conditions common to the region along with overlapping regional emission sources. SUMMARY OF MAIN FINDINGS: We identify sources like vehicular emissions, domestic coal combustion, and semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosol (SVOOA) to be severely impacted by the lockdown, whereas ozone levels and, in turn, low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosols (LVOOA) rise by more than 95% compared to the pre-lockdown concentrations during the last phase of the lockdown. However, other sources resolved in this study, like secondary chloride, power plants, dust-related, hydrocarbon-like organic aerosols (HOA), and biomass burning related emissions, were mainly driven by the changes in the meteorological conditions rather than the lockdown.","output":"Variation in chemical composition and sources of PM2.5 during the COVID-19 lockdown in Delhi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives In July 2019, there were multiple reports on patients with hepatitis A among the visitors of a restaurant in Busan. The current study presents the results of an epidemiological investigation and outlines the supplementary measures that would help with hepatitis A control. Methods A cohort study was conducted for all 2,865 customers who visited restaurant A from June to July. Using a standardized questionnaire, participants reported the presence of hepatitis A symptoms and whether they had consumed any of 19 food items. As for participants who had visited public health centers, their specimens were collected. Results From the study cohort, 155 participants (5.4%) had confirmed hepatitis A. The epidemic curve was unimodal, and the median number of days from the restaurant visit to symptom onset was 31 days. A genotype analysis indicated that 89 of 90 tested patients had hepatitis A virus (HAV) genotype 1A. The results of a multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the ingestion of salted clams increased the risk of hepatitis A by 68.12 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.22-510.87). In an unopened package of salted clams found and secured through traceback investigation, HAV genotype 1A was detected. Conclusion To prevent people from ingesting uncooked clams, there needs to be more efforts to publicize the dangers of uncooked clams; the food sampling test standards for salted clams should also be expanded.

We detected high viral loads in swabs from the nose and throat of all of the macaques, as well as in bronchoalveolar lavages; in one macaque, we observed prolonged rectal shedding. Together, the rhesus macaque recapitulates the moderate disease that has been observed in the majority of human cases of COVID-19.

This hypothesis was taken up by the lay press and led to concerns among doctors and patients whether the use of these drugs was still safe and justified against the background of the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 with an increasing number of cases and deaths. In this article, we summarize what is known about the effect of RAS blockers or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the course of COVID-19 disease. In the case of RAS inhibition, we also find evidence for the opposite hypothesis, namely, that RAS inhibition in COVID-19 could be protective. In view of the inconsistent and limited evidence and after weighing up the benefits and risks, we would not currently recommend discontinuing or switching an effective treatment with RAS blockers. NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period. The choice of drug to treat COVID-19-associated fever or pain should be based on a benefit-risk assessment for known side effects (e.g., kidney damage, gastrointestinal ulceration).","output":"COVID-19 pandemic and therapy with ibuprofen or renin-angiotensin system blockers: no need for interruptions or changes in ongoing chronic treatments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Organ transplant recipients are vulnerable to multiple infectious agents and in a world with a circulating SARS-CoV-2 virus, it would be expected that patients who are immunosuppressed would have higher mortality. Objective To determine the COVID-19 mortality in transplant recipients. Methods We conducted a search in PubMed and Google scholar databases using the keywords for COVID-19 and transplantation. All related studies between January 1, 2020 and May 7, 2020 were reviewed. All relevant published articles related to COVID-19 in transplant recipients were included. Results 46 articles were included; they studied a total of 320 transplant patients-220 kidney transplant recipients, 42 liver, 19 heart, 22 lung, 8 HSCT, and 9 dual organ transplant recipients. The overall mortality rate was 20% and was variable among different organs and different countries. 65 transplant recipients died of complications attributable to COVID-19; 33 were males (15% of males in this cohort), 8 females (8% of females in this cohort), and 24 whose sex was not determined. They had a median age of 66 (range: 32-87) years. The median transplantation duration was 8 years (range: 30 days to 20 years). The most frequent comorbidity reported was hypertensions followed by diabetes mellitus, obesity, malignancy, ischemic heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The most frequent cause of death reported was acute respiratory distress syndrome. Conclusion Transplant recipients in our cohort had a high mortality rate.

Thus, it was observed that 61.4% of consumers modified their buying behaviour at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with those who modified it the most being the people who stockpiled the most food and went panic buying more often. This has made it possible to establish the profile of different significant consumer segments, and as a response, food production/distribution companies can implement different innovative strategies aimed at decreasing the impact of stockpiling and, therefore, the shortage of food. The possible strategies that companies can put into effect are creating a stock of non-perishable foods, increasing production capabilities in a sustainable way and, especially in light of the results obtained, boost the online sale and distribution of foods, with the goal of decreasing the amount of people in shops (which decreases the spreading of the pandemic and favours health) and preventing consumers from observing possible circumstantial shortages that would only encourage stockpiling and panic buying, even among consumers who have not changed their buying behaviour.","output":"Innovation Strategies of the Spanish Agri-Food Sector in Response to the Black Swan COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Taiwan, thyroid fine-needle aspiration cytology is easily accessible and reliable for evaluating thyroid nodules.

Interestingly, COVID-19-associated ARDS share biological and clinical features with sepsis-associated immunosuppression since lymphopenia and acquired infections associated with late mortality are frequently encountered. Mechanisms responsible for COVID-19-associated lymphopenia need to be explored since they could be responsible for delayed virus clearance and increased mortality rate among intensive care unit (ICU) patients. METHODS: A series of 26 clinically annotated COVID-19 patients were analyzed by thorough phenotypic and functional investigations at days 0, 4, and 7 after ICU admission. RESULTS: We revealed that, in the absence of any difference in demographic parameters nor medical history between the two groups, ARDS patients presented with an increased number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and a decreased number of CD8pos effector memory cell compared to patients hospitalized for COVID-19 moderate pneumonia. Interestingly, COVID-19-related MDSC expansion was directly correlated to lymphopenia and enhanced arginase activity. Lastly, T cell proliferative capacity in vitro was significantly reduced among COVID-19 patients and could be restored through arginine supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: The present study reports a critical role for MDSC in COVID-19-associated ARDS. Our findings open the possibility of arginine supplementation as an adjuvant therapy for these ICU patients, aiming to reduce immunosuppression and help virus clearance, thereby decreasing the duration of mechanical ventilation, nosocomial infection acquisition, and mortality.","output":"SARS-CoV-2-Induced ARDS Associates with MDSC Expansion, Lymphocyte Dysfunction, and Arginine Shortage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sweetness drives the consumption of added sugars, so understanding how to best measure sweet hedonics is important for developing strategies to lower sugar intake. However, methods to assess hedonic response to sweetness vary, making results across studies difficult to integrate. We compared methods to measure optimal sucrose concentration in 21 healthy adults (1) using paired-comparison preference tracking vs. ratings of liking, (2) with participants in the laboratory vs. at home, and (3) using aqueous solutions vs. vanilla milk. Tests were replicated on separate days to assess test-retest reliability. Test-retest reliability was similar between laboratory and home testing, but tended to be better for vanilla milk and preference tracking. Optimal sucrose concentration was virtually identical between laboratory and home, slightly lower when estimated via preference tracking, and about 50% lower in vanilla milk. However, optimal sucrose concentration correlated strongly between methods, locations, and stimuli. More than 50% of the variability in optimal sucrose concentration could be attributed to consistent differences among individuals, while much less variability was attributable to differences between methods. These results demonstrate convergent validity between methods, support testing at home, and suggest that aqueous solutions can be useful proxies for some commonly consumed beverages for measuring individual differences.","output":"Characterizing Individual Differences in Sweet Taste Hedonics: Test Methods, Locations, and Stimuli"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to clarify the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0) in the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and its various forms.

A recent hypothesis could shed some light on both aspects. Specifically, it has been proposed that, in the subject-to-subject transfer, SARS-CoV-2 conserves on its capsid the erythrocytes' antigens of the source subject. Thus these conserved antigens can potentially cause an immune reaction in a receiving subject that has previously acquired specific antibodies for the source subject antigens. This hypothesis implies a blood type-dependent infection rate. The strong geographical dependence of the blood type distribution could be, therefore, one of the factors at the origin of the observed heterogeneity in the epidemics spread. Here, we present an epidemiological deterministic model where the infection rules based on blood types are taken into account, and we compare our model outcomes with the exiting worldwide infection progression data.

SARS-CoV-2 highlights the global impact emergence events can have. Considering the history and diversity of coronaviruses (CoVs), especially in bats, SARS-CoV-2 will likely not be the last to spillover from animals into human populations. We sampled and tested wildlife in the central African country Cameroon to determine which CoVs are circulating and how they relate to previously detected human and animal CoVs. We collected animal and ecological data at sampling locations and used family-level consensus PCR combined with amplicon sequencing for virus detection. Between 2003 and 2018, samples were collected from 6,580 animals of several different orders. CoV RNA was detected in 175 bats, a civet, and a shrew. The CoV RNAs detected in the bats represented 17 different genetic clusters, coinciding with alpha (n=8) and beta (n=9) CoVs. Sequences resembling human CoV-229E (HCoV-229E) were found in 40 Hipposideridae bats. Phylogenetic analyses place the human derived HCoV-229E isolates closest to those from camels in terms of the S and N genes, but closest to isolates from bats for the E, M, and RdRp genes. The CoV RNA positivity rate in bats varied significantly (p<0.001) between the wet (8.2%) and dry season (4.5%). Most sampled species accordingly had a wet season high and dry season low, while for some the opposite was found. Eight of the suspected CoV species of which we detected RNA appear to be entirely novel CoV species, which suggests that CoV diversity in African wildlife is still rather poorly understood. The detection of multiple different variants of HCoV-229E-like viruses supports the bat reservoir hypothesis for this virus, with the phylogenetic results casting some doubt on camels as an intermediate host. The findings also support the previously proposed influence of ecological factors on CoV circulation, indicating a high level of underlying complexity to the viral ecology. These results indicate the importance of investing in surveillance activities among wild animals to detect all potential threats as well as sentinel surveillance among exposed humans to determine emerging threats.","output":"Wildlife in Cameroon harbor diverse coronaviruses including many isolates closely related to human coronavirus 229E"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The interaction of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) with erythrocytes was analyzed.

Susceptibility to agglutination was restored by resialylation of asialo-erythrocytes to contain 2,3-linked sialic acid. These results indicate that IBV attaches to receptors on erythrocytes, the crucial determinant of which is sialic acid 2,3-linked to galactose.

This study sought to determine the association between educational attainment and AL among a large sample of Black women. METHODS: We analyzed data among 4177 Black women from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey years 1999C2018. AL score was defined as the total for abnormal measures of eight biomarkers. We further categorized participants with AL score greater than or equal to 4 as having high AL. We calculated mean estimates of total allostatic load scores using generalized linear models. We performed modified Poisson Regression models with robust variance estimation to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) of high allostatic load and their associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by educational attainment. RESULTS: Black women with a college degree or higher had the lowest prevalence of high allostatic load (31.8% vs. 42.7%, 36.3%, 36.6%), and age adjusted mean allostatic load scores (mean = 1.90 vs. mean = 2.34, mean = 1.99, mean = 2.05) when compared to Black women with less than a high school diploma, high school diploma or GED, and some college or associates degree respectively.

However, cultural differences shape both the public policy response and individuals' behavioral responses to the crisis in ways that can impact infection dynamics and key health outcomes. To address this gap, we used meta-analytic methods to explore the global variability of three public health outcomes (i.e., crude test positivity, case/infection fatality, and mortality risk) during the first wave of the pandemic. This set of analyses identified several cultural/behavioral attributes (e.g., uncertainty avoidance and long-term vs. short-term normative orientation) as independent predictors of public health outcomes after adjusting for key demographic, political, economic, and health-system-related predictors; which were robust in sensitivity analyses. In conclusion, this study clearly demonstrates that cultural attributes do in fact account for some of the global disparities in COVID-19-attributed health outcomes. As a consequence, policymakers should more explicitly consider a society's cultural attributes alongside other important parameters such as demographic characteristics and health system constraints in order to develop better tailored and more effective policy responses.","output":"Exploring the Effect of Collective Cultural Attributes on Covid-19-Related Public Health Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic demands an urgent response from the transplant community in order to protect our vulnerable patient population We present the rare case of COVID-19 in a combined liver-kidney transplant recipient from the United States Case Report: The patient is a 77 year-old diabetic woman who presented to our transplant center with decompensated cryptogenic cirrhosis She underwent combined liver-kidney transplant Postoperatively, her liver enzymes normalized, and she no longer required dialysis She was discharged to a rehabilitation facility 12 days after transplant (POD #12) On POD #13, the patient had rehabilitation sessions with an occupational therapist who later tested positive for COVID-19 This day is presumed to be her first exposure, and subsequent days will be referred to as 'post-exposure days' (PEXD) On PEXD #9 (POD #22), the patient developed a fever of 103 degrees, accompanied by chills and nausea However, no dyspnea, cough, or respiratory complaints were present at presentation Other than an elevation in alkaline phosphatase of 168 U/L, her liver enzymes and creatinine were normal (Table 1) Chest CT only showed trace right pleural effusion with no pulmonary infiltrates, no ground-glass opacification, and no consolidation (Figure 1) Abdominal CT revealed a 20 x 15 cm fluid collection surrounding the left kidney graft Mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued, but prednisone and tacrolimus were continued Tacrolimus dosing was adjusted to achieve a target daily through level range of 6 - 10 ng/mL The following morning (PEXD #10), the patient underwent percutaneous drainage of her perinephric abscess Her fever and pain subsided following intervention On PEXD #11, the patient's COVID-19 test resulted as positive Isolation precautions were maintained Chest X ray was clear She had no dyspnea or cough, and she maintained oxygen saturation of 96-100% on room air A five-day course of treatment with oral hydroxychloroquine at 400 mg was planned, and started on PEXD #11 However, the patient had a significant elevation in liver enzymes immediately following treatment initiation The drug was discontinued on PEXD #13 The patient's liver enzymes improved following drug cessation We decided to initiate treatment with azithromycin on PEXD #15, completing a five-day treatment course The patient remained asymptomatic and did not require oxygen therapy at any point On PEXD #23 (hospital day 14, POD# 36), the patient was discharged home MMF was not restarted Tacrolimus and steroid taper were continued as scheduled Allograft function and chest imaging prior to discharge were normal Conclusions: Calcineurin inhibitors interfere with the cyclophilins and FKBP required by various coronaviridae for replication Along with steroids, they also dampen the cytokine storm The antiviral potential of calcineurin inhibitors and steroids warrants further investigation into their role as viable therapy for COVID-19","output":"First report of novel coronavirus infection following abdominal organ transplantation in North America during the covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Religiosity and spirituality have previously been found to have significant effects on mental and physical health.

This preliminary study was initiated to demonstrate the possibility of using electrospun fibers as a potential substrate in the application of seed germination activity. The drive of this preliminary study was to integrate the electrospun nanofiber-based material in exploring the current surge in home food production via seed germination in order to introduce cheap source of food without being distracted by the pandemic impact in general. Mung bean (Vigna radiata L. Wilczek) was chosen as it is easy and fast to sprout. Four samples of poly (-caprolactone)- (PCL-) based fibers were prepared by means of electrospinning technique, with the optimized flow rate between 0.05 and 0.20 ml/min at a fixed distance of 10 cm needle tip to collector. Mung bean seeds were allowed to germinate on the fabricated electrospun PCL fibers for 96 hours. Our observations include germination percentage, seedling weight, radicle length, and plumule growth. The highest radicle length and plumule length of seedlings were 27.8 mm and 6.7 mm, respectively. There were no inhibitory effects on seed germination and minimal structural fragmentation of smaller diameter electrospun fibers as revealed by FESEM. These results show that the seeds were able to germinate on electrospun PCL fiber substrate, owing to the properties of high surface area and excellent fluid water uptake of PCL fibers.

This study investigates the amount and intensity of daily physical activity (PA) in older adults, living under the social distancing guidelines during COVID-19 pandemic. In this cross-sectional study, 124 community-dwelling older adults (Age:60C96 years, mean:757.14) were recruited via word-ofCmouth and key person approach between March 2021-August 2021. Participants completed an online survey on COVID-19 questionnaires and wore an ActiGraph GT9X accelerometer on their non-dominant wrist for consecutive 7 days in free-living conditions. Euclidean Norm Minus One cut-points were used to estimate the total time spent in sedentary behavior (SB), light PA (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). Results showed that, 7% had COVID-positive, 55% perceived moderate severity of COVID in their area, 31% reported fear of COVID, and 14.5% were afraid of losing their life to COVID. On average, participants obtained 12.432.1 hours/day of SB, 3.471.05 hours/day of LPA and 42.7129.71 minutes/day of MVPA. MVPA minutes/day was significantly higher (P = 0.006) in participants aged 60-85 years than those aged 85+ years (45.38 minutes/day vs 14.25 minutes/day). When age-adjusted data was compared to pre-COVID-19 studies, we found COVID-19 pandemic had negatively impacted the physical activity level in older adults (29.33% decrease in MVPA and 39.2% increase in SB). These findings can be useful in developing guidelines and/or interventions to promote physical activity and healthy aging among older adults, particularly those in social isolation.","output":"Accelerometry-Based Assessment of Physical Activity in Older Adults During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Restaurants, particularly independently-owned ones that serve immigrant communities, are important community institutions in the promotion of dietary health. Yet, these restaurants remain under-researched, preventing meaningful collaborations with the public health sector for healthier community food environments. This research aimed to examine levels of acceptability of healthy eating promotion strategies (HEPS) in independently-owned Latin American restaurants (LARs) and identify resource needs for implementing HEPS in LARs. METHODS: We completed semi-structured, online discussions with LAR owners and staff (n = 20), predominantly from New York City (NYC), to examine current engagement, acceptability, potential barriers, and resource needs for the implementation of HEPS. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed independently by two coders using Dedoose, applying sentiment weighting to denote levels of acceptability for identified HEPS (1 = low, 2 = medium/neutral, 3 = high). Content analysis was used to examine factors associated with HEPS levels of acceptability and resource needs, including the influence of the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). RESULTS: The most acceptable HEPS was menu highlights of healthier items (mean rating = 2.8), followed by promotion of healthier items (mean rating = 2.7), increasing healthy offerings (mean rating = 2.6), nutrition information on the menu (mean rating = 2.3), and reduced portions (mean rating = 1.7). Acceptability was associated with factors related to perceived demand, revenue, and logistical constraints. COVID-19 had a mixed influence on HEPS engagement and acceptability. Identified resource needs to engage in HEPS included nutrition knowledge, additional expertise (e.g., design, social media, culinary skills), and assistance with food suppliers and other restaurant operational logistics. Respondents also identified potential policy incentives. CONCLUSIONS: LARs can positively influence eating behaviors but doing so requires balancing public health goals and business profitability. LARs also faced various constraints that require different levels of assistance and resources, underscoring the need for innovative engagement approaches, including incentives, to promote these changes.","output":"Promoting healthy eating in Latin American restaurants: a qualitative survey of views held by owners and staff"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: E-cigarette or Vaping Product Use Associated Lung Injury (EVALI) and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are both relatively new disease processes which can cause acute respiratory failure. This report describes the case of a 17-year-old male with a history of vaping cannabis during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Michigan. Report: A previously healthy 17-year-old male presented with cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, and hypoxia requiring 40L high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and 100% FiO2 to maintain oxyhemoglobin saturations of 88%. He showed no tachypnea or retractions, mimicking the happy hypoxia reported in COVID-19 patients. His physical exam demonstrated inspiratory crackles and migratory diminished breath sounds. Chest x-ray showed mild peri-bronchial thickening, subtle right perihilar opacities, and hyperexpansion. Bloodwork showed a procalcitonin of 10 nanograms/milliliter, ESR of 10 millimeters/hour, and CRP of 3.5 milligrams/deciliter. Three prior SARS-CoV2 tests were negative, but given clinical suspicion, the patient was treated as a Patient Under Investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 for 48 hours and re-tested. Care was aligned with institutional COVID-19 guidelines to minimize aerosol-generating procedures;diagnostic bronchoscopy, positive pressure ventilation, and transport for chest CT were discouraged, especially as our patient was awake, interactive, and with gradually improving trajectory. Infection prevention guidelines prohibited our patient's parents from leaving his room for a private interview, but friends alerted them to a history of vaping cannabis, which our patient corroborated. He was transitioned towards supportive care for EVALIinduced bronchoconstriction and improved with beta agonists, systemic steroids, and HFNC. After his fourth negative SARS CoV2 test, the patient underwent a high-resolution chest CT, which showed diffuse ground-glass opacities with subpleural sparing. He was discharged after four days with Pediatric Pulmonology follow up. He was counseled against further e-cigarette or cigarette use. Discussion: This case illustrates challenges in the diagnosis of EVALI during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among adolescents. Both conditions present with acute respiratory failure absent another source. Both can have significant hypoxia, elevated inflammatory markers, and an ARDS phenotype. Both demonstrate ground-glass opacities on CT scan. Importantly, here are differences in the workup, management, and public health implications of EVALI and COVID-19. Both are reportable to the Department of Public Health and warrant intervention: Anti-vaping campaigns and restriction on access for EVALI, infection control and immunization programs for COVID-19. As the world endeavors to contain the COVID-19 pandemic through surveillance, treatment, and immunization, we also hope to regain momentum against EVALI.","output":"What about the first public health crisis of 2019?

A new mobile colistin-resistance (mcr-9) gene was recently discovered; this discovery highlighted the need for rigorous monitoring of bacterial resistance against colistin. Salmonella is one of the major pathogens responsible for foodborne illnesses; however, there is minimal information regarding the presence of mcr genes in foodborne Salmonella strains. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of mcr genes among 178 Salmonella strains isolated from chicken meat in Korea. Antimicrobial susceptibility was measured using the broth microdilution method. Bioinformatics characterization of colistin-resistant strains and genetic environment of the mcr-9 gene were analyzed using next-generation sequencing. Transferability of the mcr-9 carrying colistin-resistant Salmonella strain was tested using broth-mating conjugation. Thirteen of the 178 Salmonella isolates showed colistin resistance, but only one strain, Salmonella Dessau ST14 (KUFSE-SAL043) from a traditional chicken market in Korea, carried an mcr family gene, mcr-9. This strain also carried other acquired antimicrobial resistance genes such as blaTEM-1B, qnrS1, and aac(6')-Iaa. Only the IncX1 plasmid replicon type was detected in this strain. In the strain KUFSE-SAL043, the mcr-9 gene was located between two insertion sequences, IS903B and IS26, followed by the downstream regulatory genes qseB-like and qseC-like, which were located between IS1R and IS1R. Conjugation tests revealed that the mcr-9 gene was successfully transferred to Escherichia coli J53 at a mean frequency of 2.03  10-7. This is the first report of a transferable mcr-9 gene in Salmonella isolated from chicken meat in Korea, highlighting the possibility of transfer of colistin resistance. Therefore, the wide use of colistin should be reconsidered, and a One Health perspective should be adopted to monitor the antimicrobial resistance of Enterobacteriaceae strains in humans, livestock, and the environment.","output":"Emergence of Transferable mcr-9 Gene-Carrying Colistin-Resistant Salmonella enterica Dessau ST14 Isolated from Retail Chicken Meat in Korea."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates the potential of deep learning methods to identify individuals with suspected COVID-19 infection using remotely collected heart-rate data.

OBJECTIVE The aim is to assess the effectiveness of internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMI) as a scalable approach for treating depression in a routine care setting. METHODS This is an observer-masked, multicenter, pragmatic randomized controlled trial with a randomization ratio of 1:1.Patients with CBP and diagnosed depressive disorder (mild to moderate severity) were recruited from 82 orthopedic rehabilitation clinics across Germany. The intervention group (IG) received a guided depression IMI tailored to CBP next to treatment-as-usual (TAU; including medication), while the control group (CG) received TAU. The primary outcome was observer-masked clinician-rated Hamilton depression severity (9-week follow-up). The secondary outcomes were: further depression outcomes, pain-related outcomes, health-related quality of life, and work capacity. Biostatistician blinded analyses using regression models were conducted by intention-to-treat and per protocol analysis. RESULTS Between October 2015 and July 2017, we randomly assigned 210 participants (IG, n = 105; CG, n = 105), mostly with only a mild pain intensity but substantial pain disability. No statistically significant difference in depression severity between IG and CG was observed at the 9-week follow-up ( = -0.19, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.05). Explorative secondary depression (4/9) and pain-related (4/6) outcomes were in part significant (p < 0.05). Health-related quality of life was significantly higher in the IG. No differences were found in work capacity. CONCLUSION The results indicate that an IMI for patients with CBP and depression in a routine care setting has limited impact on depression.

The proposed model allows the evaluation of the impact of easing intervention measures at specific times. To estimate the model parameters, the model was fitted to the daily reported COVID-19 cases in Kenya. Self initiated behavioral responses by individuals and large scale persistent testing proved to be the most effective measures to flatten the epidemic infection curve.The model illustrates the effect of mass testing on COVID-19 as well as individual self initiated behavioral change when the number of infected individuals increases.

Home monitors were issued at implant and wound reviews were done remotely via photo messages at one month or if prompted by the patient. Existing patients were given monitors on an ad hoc basis. A dedicated physiologist worked off site on home monitoring clinics. We assess the impact on our service and on patient experience of these changes one year after implementation. Methods Baseline characteristics of age at implant and distance of home address from hospital were collected from all patients undergoing pacemaker home monitoring. Patients were surveyed using an adapted version of the Generic Short Patient Experiences Questionnaire (GS-PEQ). Comparison was made with our standard face-to-face follow-up model (1, 3, and 12 months). Results Data was collected for 326 patients. 233 received a new permanent pacemaker from March 2020 onwards and 93 existing patients were issued with a home monitor. Average age at pacemaker implant was 80.6 year ( 9.9 years). The average one-way distance from home to outpatient clinic saved was 15.1 miles (10.4). 567 face-to-face appointments were saved. In an average day the off-site physiologist reviewed over 100 patient records, contacted 10 patients by phone and dictated reports on 20 patients (14 clinic patients and 6 home monitor alerts).Of patients surveyed 88% agreed with the statement 'I feel safe being cared for solely with a remote monitoring service', 84% agreed with the statement 'I receive the same standard of care via remote monitoring and face-toface appointments'. Time saved by avoiding a face to face appointment was more than 1 hour for 90% of respondents. Those surveyed requested communication of reassuring monitoring, the ability to contact the pacing team in the event of concerns and clearer instructions for the home monitoring device. Only 34% of newly implanted patients were able to send a photo message of their wound at one month without prompting or assistance. We did not get a post procedure photo in 38% and the rest either spoke to us about the wound or had a face-to face visit. There was a significant difference in mean age between those who sent a photo (73.72) and those who didn't (81.38) (P = 0.000607). Conclusion Rapid role out of a remote monitoring service for permanent pacemakers across Somerset was feasible, produced significant savings in clinics and was well received by patients. There were significant time savings for physiologists and patients.

The initial interviews were conducted between April and May 2020 and were followed up by a second interview between August and December 2020. RESULTS: A substantial percentage of patients (39% at the first and 32% at the second interview) reported an increase in pain intensity due to the pandemic. Exploratory analyses revealed that patients who already suffered from greater pain and who experienced greater restrictions due to the pandemic were more likely to express a pain worsening. Psychological factors such as negative expectations about the development of their pain and pain treatment and a high external locus of control were also associated with increases in pain.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the results of a rigorous, large-scale COVID-19 testing and monitoring program. DESIGN: The U.S. National Football League (NFL) and the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) instituted a large-scale COVID-19 monitoring program involving daily testing using 2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) platforms (Roche cobas and Thermo Fisher QuantStudio), a transcription-mediated amplification platform (Hologic Panther), and an antigen point-of-care (aPOC) test (Quidel Sofia). SETTING: 32 NFL clubs in 24 states during the 2020 NFL season. PARTICIPANTS: NFL players and staff. MEASUREMENTS: SARS-CoV-2 test results were described in the context of medically adjudicated status. Cycle threshold (Ct) values are reported when available. RESULTS: A total of 632 370 tests administered across 11 668 persons identified 270 (2.4%) COVID-19 cases from 1 August to 14 November 2020. Positive predictive values ranged from 73.0% to 82.0% across the RT-PCR platforms. High Ct values (33 to 37) often indicated early infection. For the first positive result, the median Ct value was 32.77 (interquartile range, 30.02 to 34.72) and 22% of Ct values were above 35. Among adjudicated COVID-19 cases tested with aPOC, 42.3% had a negative result. Positive concordance between aPOC test result and adjudicated case status increased as viral load increased. LIMITATIONS: Platforms varied by laboratory, and test variability may reflect procedural differences. CONCLUSION: Routine RT-PCR testing allowed early detection of infection.

SETTING: NHS outpatient clinics PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with RT-PCR diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection that did not require hospitalization MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The sensitivity with which prior infection was detected and quantitative antibody titres were assessed using four SARS-CoV-2 serologic assay platforms. Two platforms employed SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) based antigens and two employed nucleocapsid (N) based antigens. Serum neutralising antibody titres were measured using a validated pseudotyped virus SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay. The ability of the serological assays to predict neutralisation titres at various times after PCR diagnosis was assessed. RESULTS: The three of the four serological assays had sensitivities of 95 to100% at 21C40 days post PCR-diagnosis, while a fourth assay had a lower sensitivity of 85%. The relative sensitivities of the assays changed with time and the sensitivity of one assay that had an initial sensitivity of >95% declined to 85% at 61C80 post PCR diagnosis, and to 71% at 81C100 days post diagnosis. Median antibody titres decreased in one serologic assay but were maintained over the observation period in other assays. The trajectories of median antibody titres measured in serologic assays over this time period were not dependent on whether the SARS-CoV-2 N or S proteins were used as antigen source. A broad range of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres were evident in individual sera, that decreased over time in the majority of participants; the median neutralisation titre in the cohort decreased by 45% over 4 weeks. Each of the serological assays gave quantitative measurements of antibody titres that correlated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation titres, but, the S-based serological assay measurements better predicted serum neutralisation potency. The strength of correlation between serologic assay results and neutralisation titres deteriorated with time and decreases in neutralisation titres in individual participants were not well predicted by changes in antibody titres measured using serologic assays. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays differed in their comparative diagnostic performance over time. Different assays are more or less well suited for surveillance of populations for prior infection versus prediction of serum neutralisation potency. Continued monitoring of declining neutralisation titres during extended follow up should facilitate the establishment of appropriate serologic correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.","output":"Longitudinal analysis of clinical serology assay performance and neutralising antibody levels in COVID19 convalescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background & Objectives The massive outbreak of Novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has turned out to be a serious global health issue worldwide Currently, no drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of COVID-19 The current computational study was attempted to identify a novel therapeutic inhibitor against novel SARS-CoV-2 using in silico drug discovery pipeline Methods In the present study, the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor was the target for the designing of drugs against the deadly virus The 3D structure of the receptor was modeled & validated using a Swiss-model, Procheck & Errat server A molecular docking study was performed between a group of natural & synthetic compounds having proven anti-viral activity with ACE2 receptor using Autodock tool 1 5 6 The molecular dynamics simulation study was performed using Desmond v 12 to evaluate the stability and interaction of the ACE2 receptor with a ligand Results Based on the lowest binding energy, confirmation, and H-bond interaction, cinnamic acid (?5 20 kcal/mol), thymoquinone (?4 71 kcal/mol), and andrographolide (Kalmegh) (?4 00 kcal/mol) were screened out showing strong binding affinity to the active site of ACE2 receptor MD simulations suggest that cinnamic acid, thymoquinone, and andrographolide (Kalmegh) could efficiently activate the biological pathway without changing the conformation in the binding site of the ACE2 receptor The bioactivity and drug-likeness properties of compounds show their better pharmacological property and safer to use Interpretation & Conclusions The study concludes the high potential of cinnamic acid, thymoquinone, and andrographolide against the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 receptor protein Thus, the molecular docking and MD simulation study will aid in understanding the molecular interaction between ligand and receptor binding site, thereby leading to novel therapeutic intervention","output":"A molecular dynamics simulation study of the ACE2 receptor with screened natural inhibitors to identify novel drug candidate against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, causing the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, along with the global measures used to control the spread of the disease, have been particularly stressful for older individuals. Robust evidence suggests that stress\\\\related physiological processes may play a significant role in the onset of age\\\\related cognitive decline and dementia, such as Alzheimers disease (AD). For example, previous animal and human research have shown that stress exacerbates tau pathology and subsequent cognitive impairment. One important factor determining a persons level of stress is psychological resilience, which refers to a persons ability to return to equilibrium when difficulties occur. As such, resilience may buffer and protect individuals against the deleterious effects of stress. The objectives of this study were to examine the relationship between psychological resilience and tau burden in cognitively unimpaired individuals, and to evaluate whether amyloid (A?) pathology modifies this relationship. METHOD: A total of 114 older adults (mean age=74.5;66 females (57.9%)) enrolled in the Harvard Aging Brain Study or the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living study completed an electronic survey online including measures of psychological resilience (Connor\\\\Davidson Resilience Scale\\\\10, where a higher score indicates greater resilience) during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic period (May 2020). We used previously collected (mean time from survey=1.75 year) PET imaging data to assess A? and tau burden. RESULTS: Overall, participants demonstrated high levels of resilience (mean=29.5,range=9\\\\40). Multiple regression analyses (correcting for age, gender and time difference between survey and PET) demonstrated an interaction between resilience and amyloid on tau pathology (?=\\\\0.01,p=0.015, Figure1). Specifically, in A?+ individuals (SUVR>1.324), those with higher psychological resilience also had lower tau pathology. No relationship was seen in A?\\\\ individuals. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that greater resilience during the pandemic is associated with lower tau burden in individuals at higher risk of cognitive decline (i.e. preclinical AD). Future studies are needed to determine the impact of stress and psychological resilience on prospective pathological brain changes and subsequent cognitive decline. Furthermore, resilience may be an important target for interventions to support older adults navigating stressful situations and to lessen the influence of stressors on AD pathological processes.","output":"Greater psychological resilience during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic is associated with lower tau burden in cognitively unimpaired individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the individual differences in susceptibility to, or lifetime frequency of clinically distinguishable influenza in children. METHODS: Rapid enzyme linked immunoassay-confirmed influenza pediatric cases (n = 96) in season 1 (2017-2018) were compared to age-matched (mean 7.7 years) controls (n = 171) with no evidence of influenza in season 1. The 2 cohorts were again studied in season 2 (2018-2019) for influenza outcomes and influences. Medical records, questionnaires, and interviews were used to determine past influenza disease and vaccine histories. RESULTS: After season 2, known lifetime influenza illnesses per year of age averaged 22.6% in cases and 5.6% in controls, with 62% of controls still having never experienced known influenza. Having had prior influenza was marginally significant as a risk for season 1 influenza in cases versus controls (P = .055), yet a significant risk factor in controls for season 2 (P = .018). Influenza vaccine rates were significantly higher in controls than in cases for season 1, with a greater female vaccine benefit. Lack of previous influenza had greater calculated effectiveness (52%) than vaccination (17%-26%) in escaping season 2 influenza. Lifetime rates of vaccination did not correlate with lifetime rates of known influenza in either cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime clinically distinguishable influenza rates varied among children, with many escaping it for years even without being immunized against it. Findings of less than expected clinical influenza, no correlation between vaccination frequency and disease frequency, sex differences, and an association between past clinical influenza and current risk, point to innate differences in individual influenza experiences.","output":"Factors Influencing Frequency of Pediatric Clinically Distinguishable Influenza: A 2 Season Case-Control Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the use of telemedicine by physicians specializing in orthopaedics and traumatology at the authors institution, and to assess the rates of satisfaction and resolution for this type of care.

METHODS: A systematic review was conducted utilizing a literature search performed on the Medline, EMBASE and PubMed databases. The last search occurred on 14 July 2020. Data were extracted and recorded on a data extraction sheet by the reviewers, then categorized using the prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery (PPRR) model. Study quality was evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) checklist. RESULTS: Twelve articles addressing pharmacists roles in disasters were included. Of these, three addressed pharmacists roles during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacists roles in the prevention of emergencies, including COVID-19, are focused on chronic disease medication supply and education. Regarding pharmacists preparedness to perform their roles in disasters, they were more focused on health policy and population health planning, especially regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Direct patient care continues to support patients through medication availability, and pharmacists clinical roles are examples of their response to disasters. In addition, pharmacists have an important role in disaster recovery that involves several activities, such as restocking emergency kits and reestablishing normal stock. Studies were generally of a reasonable quality. However, some limitations were noted among studies, and higher quality studies that contribute to existing knowledge are needed.

COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) is a potential therapeutic, but there is limited data for patients with moderate-to-severe disease. Research Question: What are outcomes associated with administration of CCP in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 infection? Study Design and Methods: We conducted a propensity score-matched analysis of patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. The primary endpoints were in-hospital mortality. Secondary endpoints were number of days alive and ventilator-free at 30 days; length of hospital stay; and change in WHO scores from CCP administration (or index date) to discharge. Of 151 patients who received CCP, 132 had complete follow-up data. Patients were transfused after a median of 6 hospital days; thus, we investigated the effect of convalescent plasma before and after this timepoint with 77 early (within 6 days) and 55 late (after 6 days) recipients. Among 3,217 inpatients who did not receive CCP, 2,551 were available for matching. Results: Early CCP recipients, of whom 31 (40%) were on mechanical ventilation, had lower 14-day (15% vs 23%) and 30-day (38% vs 49%) mortality compared to a matched unexposed cohort, with nearly 50% lower likelihood of in-hospital mortality (HR 0.52, [95% CI 0.28-0.96]; P=0.036).

The novelty of the proposed approach is twofold: 1) the estimation of the reproduction number is achieved by convex optimization within a proximal-based inverse problem formulation, with constraints aimed at promoting piecewise smoothness; 2) the approach is developed in a multivariate setting, allowing for the simultaneous handling of multiple time series attached to different geographical regions, together with a spatial (graph-based) regularization of their evolutions in time. The effectiveness of the approach is first supported by simulations, and two main applications to real COVID-19 data are then discussed. The first one refers to the comparative evolution of the reproduction number for a number of countries, while the second one focuses on French departments and their joint analysis, leading to dynamic maps revealing the temporal co-evolution of their reproduction numbers.","output":"Spatial and temporal regularization to estimate COVID-19 reproduction number R(t): Promoting piecewise smoothness via convex optimization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current changes in vehicle movement due to 'lockdown' conditions (imposed in cities worldwide in response to the COVID-19 epidemic) provide opportunities to quantify the local impact of 'controlled interventions' on air quality and establish baseline pollution concentrations in cities. Here, we present a case study from Auckland, New Zealand, an isolated Southern Hemisphere city, which is largely unaffected by long-range pollution transport or industrial sources of air pollution. In this city, traffic flows reduced by 60-80% as a result of a government-led initiative to contain the virus by limiting all transport to only essential services. In this paper, ambient pollutant concentrations of NO2, O3, BC, PM2.5, and PM10 are compared between the lockdown period and comparable periods in the historical air pollution record, while taking into account changes in the local meteorology. We show that this 'natural experiment' in source emission reductions had significant but non-linear impacts on air quality. While emission inventories and receptor modelling approaches confirm the dominance of traffic sources for NOx (86%), and BC (72%) across the city, observations suggest a consequent reduction in NO2 of only 34-57% and a reduction in BC of 55-75%. The observed reductions in PM2.5 (still likely to be dominated by traffic emissions), and PM10 (dominated by sea salt, traffic emissions to a lesser extent, and affected by seasonality) were found to be significantly less (8-17% for PM2.5 and 7-20% for PM10).

Results Of the 328 included patients, 53 (16%) presented in the COVID-19 period. There was a mean fall of 38% in new stroke diagnoses (mean 1.13/day [SD 1.07] from 1.82/day [SD 1.38], p<0.01), which was related to a 59% decline in the number of daily transfers from referral centers (p<0.01), 25% fewer telestroke consultations (p=0.08), and 55% fewer patients presenting directly to our institution by private vehicle (p<0.01) and 29% fewer patients through emergency services (p=0.09).

Conclusions The observations at our tertiary care corroborate anecdotal reports that the number of new stroke diagnoses is falling, which seems related to a smaller proportion of patients seeking healthcare services for milder symptoms. These preliminary data warrant validation in larger, multi-center studies.","output":"Falling stroke rates during COVID-19 pandemic at a Comprehensive Stroke Center: Cover title: Falling stroke rates during COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vascular permeability triggered by inflammation or ischemia promotes edema, exacerbates disease progression and impairs tissue recovery. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent inducer of vascular permeability. VEGF plays an integral role in regulating vascular barrier function physiologically and in pathologies, including cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, retinal conditions and COVID-19-associated pulmonary edema, sepsis and acute lung injury. Understanding temporal molecular regulation of VEGF-induced vascular permeability will facilitate developing therapeutics to inhibit vascular permeability, while preserving tissue-restorative angiogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that VEGF signals through signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) to promote vascular permeability. We show that genetic STAT3 ablation reduces vascular permeability in STAT3-deficient endothelium of mice and VEGF-inducible zebrafish crossed with CRISPR/Cas9-generated Stat3 knockout zebrafish. Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) expression is transcriptionally regulated by STAT3, and VEGF-dependent STAT3 activation is regulated by JAK2. Pyrimethamine, an FDA-approved antimicrobial agent that inhibits STAT3-dependent transcription, substantially reduces VEGF-induced vascular permeability in zebrafish, mouse and human endothelium. Collectively, our findings suggest that VEGF/VEGFR-2/JAK2/STAT3 signaling regulates vascular barrier integrity, and inhibition of STAT3-dependent activity reduces VEGF-induced vascular permeability.

Herein, a layer of MoS2/g-C3N4 nanocomposite is introduced to zirconium oxide (ZrO2) nanoparticles to form a \\"particle-embedded-layered\\" structure. Thus, a narrow band gap (2.8 eV) starts developing, deliberated as a core photodegradation component. Under optimization, a high photocatalytic activity of 20 mg/L TC at pH 3 with ZrO2@MoS2/g-C3N4 nanocomposite was achieved with 94.8% photocatalytic degradation in 90 min. A photocatalytic degradation rate constant of 0.0230 min-1 is determined, which is 2.3 times greater than the rate constant for bare ZrO2 NPs. The superior photocatalytic activity of ZrO2@MoS2/g-C3N4 is due to the dual charge-transfer channel between the MoS2/g-C3N4 and ZrO2 nanoparticles, which promotes the formation of photogenerated e-/h+ pairs. Charge recombination produces many free electron-hole pairs, which aid photocatalyst reactions by producing superoxide and hydroxyl radicals via electron-hole pair generation. The possible mechanistic routes for TC were investigated in-depth, as pointed out by the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) investigation. Overall, this work shows that photocatalysis is a feasible sorbent approach for environmental antibiotic wastewater treatment.","output":"Promoting Spatial Charge Transfer of ZrO2 Nanoparticles: Embedded on Layered MoS2/g-C3N4 Nanocomposites for Visible-Light-Induced Photocatalytic Removal of Tetracycline"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Analyses of COVID-19 patients with preexisting interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pulmonary sarcoidosis is lacking but registries are ongoing.

It is possible that it is behavioural relevance rather than object plausibility per se which drives this effect. Here, we manipulated the biological relevance of objects (face or a non-face) and tested whether object relevance affects behavioural sensitivity and neural responses to depth-position. In a first experiment, we presented human observers with disparity-defined faces and non-faces, and observers were asked to judge the depth position of the target under signal-noise and clear (fine) task conditions. In the second experiment, we concurrently measured behavioural and fMRI responses to depth. We found that behavioural performance varied across stimulus conditions such that they were significantly worse for the upright face than the inverted face and the random shape in the SNR task, but worse for the random shape than the upright face in the feature task. Pattern analysis of fMRI responses revealed that activity of FFA was distinctly different during depth judgments of the upright face versus the other two stimuli, with its responses (and to a stronger extent, those of V3) appearing functionally-relevant to behavioural performance. We speculate that FFA is not only involved in object analysis, but exerts considerable influence on stereoscopic mechanisms as early as in V3 based on a broader appreciation of the stimulus' behavioural relevance.Significance StatementWe asked how disparity sensitivity is modulated by object (biological) relevance using behavioural and neuroimaging paradigms. We show that behavioural sensitivity to depth-position changes in biological (face) vs non-biological (random surface) contexts, and that these changes are task-dependent. Imaging results highlight a potentially key role of the fusiform region for governing the modulation of stereo encoding by object relevance. These findings highlight powerful interactions between object recognition mechanisms and stereoencoding, such that the utility of disparity information may be up/down weighed depending on the biological relevance of the object.","output":"Modulations of depth responses in the human brain by object context: Does biological relevance matter?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper provides an overview of the current global market and manufacturing landscape for hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).

The COVID-19 infection continues to be a pandemic and is currently causing overwhelming challenges to healthcare across the nations. Cancer patients represent a unique population vulnerable to COVID-19 infection due to their advanced age, intrinsic frailty, medical comorbidities, immunosuppression, and frequent health care visits for their underlying disease. Robust analysis of COVID-19 infection among cancer patients is crucial to aid in the optimal management of these patients. AIM: To identify contributors of worse outcomes in patients with malignancy and COVID-19 and to describe the role of critical care. METHODS: In this review, we summarized the information from seminal articles on the presentation and management of patients with COVID-19 and malignancy that were published before December 10, 2020. We searched the Pub Med and Medline database for COVID-19 and Cancer, Malignancy. Studies published in English, including adults with malignancy and COVID-19 infection, were eligible to be included in this review. Studies on patients that provided details on malignancy, clinical presentation, management, and outcome were included. Various details of malignancy that were included are the site of cancer, histopathological type, stage, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. Details of COVID-19 infection that were obtained are clinical presentation, the modality of testing, imaging, management, and outcome. Critical care details that were obtained were the type of the organ dysfunction and the requirement of organ support measures, requirement of noninvasive, invasive ventilation, management of vasopressor support, and outcome. Articles that did not have patient details, opinions, letters, and articles not published in English were excluded. All articles were reviewed by 2 independent clinicians. Articles were screened for the above terminologies by independent clinicians. RESULTS: We identified two thousand one hundred eighty-six articles, among which fifty-five were studies that had included patient details pertaining to COVID-19 and cancer (Figure 1). Among these, eighteen studies were eligible and were included in this review as shown in Table 1. A total of 5199 cancer patients were reported. The mean age of patients across all the studies was 64.3 years with male predominance was noted in 12 studies. The clinical presentation and diagnosis of these patients were similar to the general population. Most commonly reported malignancies with COVID-19 infection were hematological in 44% of patients, followed by thoracic malignancy in 11% of patients. The mean number of cancer patients with COVID-19 requiring critical care was 16%. The mean mortality reported was 27.4%. Among the studies that reported the presence of organ dysfunction, respiratory failure was reported in 52% of patients, of which 11.7% required mechanical ventilation. 72% of COVID-19 cancer patients required hospitalization across all the studies. The factors which are associated with the worse outcome from COVID-19 infections among the cancer patients were male gender, age  65 years, presence of higher comorbidity burden based on Charlson comorbidity index and cumulative illness reporting scale > 6, and smoking history. CONCLUSION: The majority of the cancer patients required intensive care due to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation. Appropriate contingency planning for these patients in terms of goals of care and judicious resource allocation in the resource-poor regions is the key. The factors associated with worse outcomes from COVID-19 infections were independent of oncological features such as tumor stage, disease status, or current provision of active anticancer therapy and it could be continued with caution.","output":"Clinical considerations for critically ill COVID-19 cancer patients: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: At present, COVID-19 is sweeping the world, and all countries are actively responding. During the COVID-19 epidemic, the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may be affected. METHODS: We reviewed data of patients with AMI from January 23 to April 23, 2020 (2020), and January 23 to April 23, 2019 (2019), who were admitted to two hospitals from Southern China. We collected clinical characteristics, comorbidities, treatment, prognosis, and key time segments to analyze. RESULTS: The total number of patients that had been diagnosed with AMI in the two hospitals was 218 in 2020 and 260 in 2019. The number of AMI patients that were admitted to hospitals per day decreased in 2020. The percentage of patients with AMI who refused hospitalization in 2020 was significantly higher than that in 2019 (5.0% vs 1.5%, p=0.028). There is no statistical difference in symptoms of the first medical contact (S2FMC) time between 2020 and 2019 (p=0.552). Door-to-balloon (D2B) time of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients who were treated with a primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) in 2020 was 79 (63.75C105.25) mins, while D2B time in 2019 was 57.5 (41.5C76.5) mins, which was statistically different from the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had an impact on the number of AMI patients who were admitted to hospitals and the time of treatment.

In 2014, the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices recommended routine use of PCV13 among adults aged 65 years or older; previously only 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) was recommended. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between the incidence of hospitalized all-cause pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) and PCV13 vaccination among older adults at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included adults at KPNC aged 65 years or older between July 1, 2015, and June 30, 2018, born after 1936 with no known history of PPV23 or PCV13 receipt before age 65. The study took place at an integrated health care system with an annual membership more than 4 million individuals, approximately 15% of whom are 65 years or older and broadly representative of the region. Data analysis took place from July 2018 to December 2021, and data collection took place from November 2016 to June 2018. EXPOSURES: PCV13 vaccination status was ascertained from the electronic medical record (EMR). Individuals were considered vaccinated 14 days following immunization. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: First hospitalized all-cause pneumonia was identified in the EMR using primary/secondary discharge diagnosis International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes. First hospitalized LRTI was identified using pneumonia codes and acute bronchitis codes. Relative risk (RR) of first pneumonia or LRTI hospitalization of individuals who were PCV13 vaccinated vs PCV13 unvaccinated was estimated using Poisson regressions adjusted for sex, race, ethnicity, age, influenza vaccine receipt, PPV23 receipt since age 65, pneumonia risk factors, health care use, and season. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated as (1CRR)  100%. RESULTS: Of 192 061 adults, 107 957 (56%) were female and 139 024 (72%) were White individuals. PCV13 coverage increased from 0 in 2014 to 135 608 (76.9%) by 2018. There were 3488 individuals with 3766 pneumonia hospitalizations and 3846 individuals with 4173 LRTI hospitalizations. PCV13 was associated with an adjusted VE of 10.0% (95% CI, 2.4-17.0; P = .01) against hospitalized pneumonia and 9.4% (95% CI, 2.1-16.1; P = .01) against hospitalized LRTI. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the context of a robust pediatric PCV13 immunization program, PCV13 vaccination of adults aged 65 years or older was associated with significant reductions in hospitalizations for all-cause pneumonia and LRTI. Vaccinating older adults with PCVs may provide broader public health benefit against pneumonia hospitalizations.","output":"Incidence and Estimated Vaccine Effectiveness Against Hospitalizations for All-Cause Pneumonia Among Older US Adults Who Were Vaccinated and Not Vaccinated With 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We draw on data from the Online Labour Index and interviews with freelancers in the United States securing work on online platforms, to illuminate effects of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

The most common initial symptoms of COVID-19 infection are cough, dyspnoea, fever, malaise and anosmia. Severe clinical manifestations include respiratory compromise, pneumonia, organ failure and death. There have been many other less common symptoms as a result of COVID-19 described in the literature, including significant rates of olfactory dysfunction.

It is defined as rapid hearing loss, &#8805;30 dB occurring over 3 consecutive days in three contiguous sound frequencies. The exact pathological process is yet to be fully characterised, though it is most commonly unilateral and commonly develops shortly following viral infection. Treatment typically consists of glucocorticoid steroids administered orally, via intratympanic injection or a combination of both routes though there are currently no standardised management of these patients.Bilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is rare, accounting for <2% of all cases.

Multivariate analysis showed that many factors were predictors of critically illness, including age >60 years (OR = 1.30, 95% CI [1.05, 1.61], p = 0.014), low oxygen saturation (OR = 0.93, 95% CI [0.91, 0.95], p<0.001), low Glasgow coma scale (OR = 0.75, 95% CI [0.67, 0.84], p<0.001), diabetes (OR = 1.62, 95% CI [1.26, 2.08], p<0.001), cancer (OR = 2.47, 95% CI [1.41, 4.35], p = 0.002), and serum ferritin (OR = 1.004, 95% CI [1.0003, 1.008], p = 0.031). CONCLUSION: In the present report, we demonstrated that many factors are associated with COVID-19 critical illness, including older age groups, fatigue, elevated temperature, increased pulse, lower oxygen saturation, the preexistence of diabetes, malignancies, cardiovascular disease, renal diseases, and pulmonary disease. Moreover, elevated serum levels of ALT, AST, and ferritin are associated with worse outcomes. Further studies are required to identify independent predictors of mortality for patients with COVID-19.","output":"Predictors of severity and development of critical illness of Egyptian COVID-19 patients: A multicenter study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Both the concepts of ecosystem services and social enterprise have gained popularity as means of addressing social and environmental issues in recent years. But while research on ecosystem services has focused on non-governmental organisation and local community-led approaches, the role of social enterprises has received less attention. In Scotland, social enterprises play an important role in delivering social and environmental justice, as well as reaping economic benefits through forest-based practices. These practices are often small-scale and attract participants from local communities. But despite this prominence their motivations and the challenges they face remain largely unexplored. This research attempts to integrate both concepts mainly using field observations and interviews, and to reinforce the findings with the existing literature. It explores the motivations and challenges of social enterprises in sustaining forest ecosystem services through a case study, and discusses their potential within the context of current policy. The research suggests that social enterprises are equipped to tackle a range of social and environmental issues. The enterprise under investigation aims to improve participants wellbeing and employability, as well as to provide public education and promote environmental awareness. But these efforts are often hindered by the difficulties of high requirements of the manager and staff members in balancing multiple objectives and most importantly, of managing financial risks. The research concludes that a practical method of assessing cultural ecosystem services as well as the use of innovative funding norms may resolve these challenges, allowing social enterprises to fill the current policy gap and create synergies in the fields of ecosystem services and social enterprise.","output":"Sustaining Forest Ecosystem Services Through Social Enterprises: Motivations and Challenges from a Case Study in Scotland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Successful navigation of the Covid-19 pandemic is predicated on public cooperation with safety measures and appropriate perception of risk, in which emotion and attention play important roles. Signatures of public emotion and attention are present in social media data, thus natural language analysis of this text enables near-to-real-time monitoring of indicators of public risk perception. We compare key epidemiological indicators of the progression of the pandemic with indicators of the public perception of the pandemic constructed from ~20 million unique Covid-19-related tweets from 12 countries posted between 10th March -- 14th June 2020. We find evidence of psychophysical numbing: Twitter users increasingly fixate on mortality, but in a decreasingly emotional and increasingly analytic tone. Semantic network analysis based on word co-occurrences reveals changes in the emotional framing of Covid-19 casualties that are consistent with this hypothesis. We also find that the average attention afforded to national Covid-19 mortality rates is modelled accurately with the Weber-Fechner and power law functions of sensory perception. Our parameter estimates for these models are consistent with estimates from psychological experiments, and indicate that users in this dataset exhibit differential sensitivity by country to the national Covid-19 death rates.

HIV testing, condom provision and facilitated linkage to HIV treatment have been funded by various bodies through non\\\\governmental organizations (NGOs). We investigated whether contact with these NGOs was associated with improved prevention and treatment outcomes among MSM in Ukraine. METHODS: Data were taken from four rounds of integrated bio\\\\behavioural surveys among MSM in Ukraine (2011, N = 5950; 2013, N = 8101; 2015, N = 4550; 2018, N = 5971) including HIV testing combined with questionnaire responses.

This paper presents findings related to the \\"universe\\" of people who called the toll-free service, from the sociocultural characteristics of the users to the information collected by the professionals during the psychological pathways until human satisfaction was achieved. We provide a retrospective description of an experience that took place between April and June 2020, and which involved users of the maternal-infant area calling from the whole Italy. (1) Methods: The aims of this study were to investigate the configuration of the indicators identified and to detect the possible correlations between them in the sample. There were 193 users who took advantage of the Service, 160 of whom continued beyond the reception service; it is this group that we report the findings from here. The tool used was a form reporting access to care and interventions, and the resulting data underwent a content analysis and the indicators were subject to non-parametric statistical analysis to analyze differences and relationships. (2) Results: There were many correlations among the indicators that revealed a high prevalence of calls due to personal motivations and requests for support, which later allowed users to gain a greater understanding of the underlying problems they were facing. The professionals running the service noticed a prevalence of weaknesses attributable to the negative emotions of its users, alongside a presence of cognitive and relational resources. The professionals' interventions, which can be characterized by a prevalence of social support, psychological rehabilitation, and psychoeducation, achieved outcomes of redefining users' relationships with themselves and others. All of the service's users have expressed a high level of satisfaction with it. (3) Discussion: Our results revealed the protective and transformative effects of the service for its users and the underlying importance of having an easily accessible psychological support system in place during emergencies, like the recent pandemic. In conditions like these, the great value of a remote support service should be noted, and despite its limitations, assures its own efficacy when a medical emergency precludes closer in-person forms of psychological assistance.","output":"The Lgami/Legmi Service-An Experience of Psychological Intervention in Maternal and Child Care during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health support has been sought by the public from online social media after the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

At the capillary level, where the largest area of brainCvascular interface occurs, pericytes adjust cerebral blood flow (CBF) by regulating capillary diameter and maintain the bloodCbrain barrier (BBB) by suppressing endothelial cell (EC) transcytosis and inducing tight junction expression between ECs. Pericytes also limit the infiltration of circulating leukocytes into the brain where resident microglia confine brain injury and provide the first line of defence against invading pathogens. Brain waste is cleared across the BBB into the blood, phagocytosed by microglia and astrocytes, or removed by the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through perivascular routesa process driven by respiratory motion and the pulsation of the heart, arteriolar smooth muscle, and possibly pericytes. Dirty CSF exits the brain and is probably drained around olfactory nerve rootlets and via the dural meningeal lymphatic vessels and possibly the skull bone marrow. The brain is widely regarded as an immune-privileged organ because it is accessible to few antigen-primed leukocytes. Leukocytes enter the brain via the meninges, the BBB, and the blood-CSF barrier. Advances in genetic and imaging tools have revealed that neurological diseases significantly alter immuneCbrain barrier interactions in at least three ways: (1) the brains immune-privileged status is compromised when pericytes are lost or lymphatic vessels are dysregulated; (2) immune cells release vasoactive molecules to regulate CBF, modulate arteriole stiffness, and can plug and eliminate capillaries which impairs CBF and possibly waste clearance; and (3) immuneCvascular interactions can make the BBB leaky via multiple mechanisms, thus aggravating the influx of undesirable substances and cells. Here, we review developments in these three areas and briefly discuss potential therapeutic avenues for restoring brain barrier functions.","output":"ImmuneCvascular mural cell interactions: consequences for immune cell trafficking, cerebral blood flow, and the bloodCbrain barrier"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Statistical literacy is more important than ever in the covid crisis, statistician David Spiegelhalter told the audience at a recent New Scientist event C but that means turning yourself into a data detective","output":"No more damned lies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Reflection on ethical behavior is undoubtedly one of the most important competencies required throughout a medical career, due to the series of dilemmas and difficult decisions that health professionals have to make when providing care to patients or communities, teaching other professionals, or conducting biomedical research. Given the complexity of the challenge, it is surprising that there is little literature about effective pedagogical strategies that enhance ethical reflection in medical students. The aim of this study is to evaluate new strategies for promoting ethical thinking and reflection, in a medical pharmacology course, using technologies that can be easily implemented in other courses and programs. METHODS To promote ethical reflection, we developed a role-playing game that was initially conducted face-to-face, but was quickly adapted to a digital environment, due to the changes in classroom interaction brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. The academic exercise was conducted in several steps: 1) The course was divided into groups that were assigned an ethical dilemma or controversial situation in pharmacology. Examples of ethical dilemmas are equal access to expensive therapies, health disasters caused by drugs or toxic substances, research in humans without review by ethics committees, academic fraud in clinical or basic research studies. 2) Each group had to generate a 10-minute newscast, in which they presented the dilemma in the form of a report, showing the point of view of the various actors involved (through the performance of the group members). 3) The newscast was shared through social networks with classmates, who reviewed the material asynchronously. 4) each expository group prepared an integration activity using, in a free way, digital tools (virtual boards, surveys and interactive quizzes, electronic forums, museum applications displayed on the Internet, etc) to seek to generate a deeper discussion about the assigned topic, in the classmates of the course. 5) the course mates and the teacher evaluated the quality of the elements of the activity by means of the mentimeter 6) at the end of the semester, an electronic survey with Likert-type questions was applied to evaluate the students' perception of the effectiveness of the activity and their learning in 24 ethical competencies relevant to the course. RESULTS During the two years of the innovation, the majority of students reported that the feedback provided by the professor (96%), group discussions (89%), role-playing (79%), and opportunities for personal reflection (71%) were the activities that contributed most to their learning of ethics in pharmacology. Most students (96%) reported that the activities were helpful to them in achieving the competencies of ethical reasoning and reflection. Assessment of each competency, described in table 1, demonstrated gains in all domains. CONCLUSIONS The use of interaction and discussion tools, individually or in teams, in the framework of a role-playing strategy, is an effective method to promote students' analysis of an ethical dilemma in medicine. Opening spaces for ethical discussion, in the midst of traditionally technical courses, helps students reflect more on the importance of course content and curricula, and how their learning will be useful for making better decisions as professionals.","output":"Fostering ethical reasoning in medical pharmacology through role-playing and digital tools."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Few reports have described the association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and sudden hearing loss. The precise pathophysiological mechanism causing this symptom is unknown. This report describes a case of sudden hearing loss in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. CASE REPORT A 67-year-old woman with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, was examined. She experienced sudden hearing loss in her right ear and disabling tinnitus. She underwent combined corticosteroid therapy (oral and intratympanic), resulting in an isolated improvement of 250 kHz in the right ear (from 60 dB, the threshold became 15 dB) and of 4, 6, and 8 kHz in the left ear (from 35 dB, 20 dB, and 35 dB, the thresholds became 15 dB, 5 dB and 20 dB, respectively).

Thus, formative research aiming to understand and determine the causes of weak and/or positive vaccination intentions is vital in order to ensure the success of future and current vaccination programmes through the provision of effective, evidence-based health messaging. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was completed by a sample of Irish (N = 500) and UK (N = 579) citizens using the online platform Qualtrics. Participants completed a questionnaire battery comprised of health, attitudes/beliefs, influences, and behavioural intention measures. Demographic information was also assessed. RESULTS: Results highlighted similar rates of vaccine intention among both samples; where a total of 76.8% Irish respondents, and 73.7% of UK respondents indicated that they intended to be immunized if the government advised them to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Overall, 23.2% of Irish respondents reported being vaccine hesitant or vaccine resistant, while a rate of 26.3% of UK respondents reported vaccine hesitancy or resistance. Univariate analysis highlighted that both gender and age played a significant role in vaccine intention, with women under age 30 reporting higher rate of vaccine hesitancy. Multivariate analysis revealed that significant correlates of vaccine acceptance included peer influence, GP influence, civic responsibility, perceived benefit, and positive vaccination attitudes. Those who reported vaccine resistance and hesitancy were more likely to have less positive vaccination attitudes and perceive higher vaccination risk. DISCUSSION: The current sociodemographic and psychological profiles of vaccine resistant and hesitant individuals provide a useful resource for informing health practitioners in the UK and Ireland with the means of enhancing pro-vaccine attitudes and promoting vaccination uptake. The current research shows indications of associations between distrust in the vaccine itself and vaccine hesitancy and resistance. Thus, to effectively design and deliver public health messages that ensures the success of vaccination uptake, it is likely that governments and public health officials will need to take actions to garner trust in the safety of the vaccine itself. Additionally, campaigns to decrease hesitancy and resistance in the COVID-19 vaccine may benefit in targeting altruism to increase willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19.","output":"The psychological and behavioural correlates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and resistance in Ireland and the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), also known as mesenchymal stem cells, have been intensely investigated for clinical applications within the last decades.

HCC develops rapidly and asymptomatic until advanced stage.1 The incidence of HCC in patients with cirrhosis is 2.5% per year.2 NICE guidelines recommend offering HCC surveillance to patients with cirrhosis using ultrasound scan (US) and serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) every six months.1 We undertook a close loop audit to assess performance of HCC surveillance at the local hospital and assessed the impact of the COVID pandemic on the service.MethodData was collected on patients admitted to hospital with cirrhosis in 1st cycle (16/12/18C05/04/19) and 2nd cycle (4/12/19C31/05/20). Intervention was performed on 04/12/2020 which included departmental posters and informing the doctors on Gastroenterology ward of the NICE guidelines. Data was collected on US and AFP follow up six months after the discharge. Exclusion criteria were patients under the age of 18, patients with known metastasis and on palliative management.ResultsTotal number of patients were 55 and 42 in the 1st and 2nd cycle respectively. Average age was 65 in the 1st cycle and 61 in the 2nd cycle. Overall, 48.5% were male and 51.5% were female patients. 6 monthly ultrasound follow up in patients reduced from 30.9% in 1st cycle to 23.8% in 2nd cycle during the COVID pandemic. Similarly, 6 monthly AFP follow-ups reduced from 34.5% in 1st cycle to 23.8% in 2nd cycle during the COVID pandemic. Although US and AFP follow-ups organised by the gastroenterology ward on discharge were 50% of all outpatients in six months in the 2nd cycle.DiscussionCOVID Pandemic, with the 1st UK lockdown taking place on 23/03/2020, has had a significant impact on the HCC surveillance of patients who were discharged from hospital. This could be due to disruption to the service provided by the hospital or the patients choice to avoid attending hospital during the COVID pandemic. The audit demonstrated that despite the disruption to the overall surveillance, the change implemented has resulted in people being followed up for HCC surveillance than previously when no follow up was organised by the discharging team at the hospital as this is mostly managed by the outpatient nurses. A re-audit following COVID pandemic would be useful to understand any benefit of such inpatient intervention on outpatient follow-up of patients with cirrhosis.ReferencesQuality statement 4: Surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma ;Liver disease ;Quality standards ;NICE [Internet].

To contain this unprecedented public crisis in China, a set of nationwide anti-epidemic discourse systems centered on war metaphors has guided the epidemic's prevention and control. While the public is immersed in the joy brought by the stage victory, most ignore the situation of the disadvantaged PWDs. Accordingly, this study adopts and presents a qualitative research method to explore the impact of war metaphors on PWDs. The results showed that while there was some formal and informal support for PWDs during this period, they were increasingly marginalized. Owing to the lack of a disability lens and institutional exclusion, PWDs were placed on the margins of the epidemic prevention and control system like outsiders. Affected by pragmatism under war metaphors, PWDs are regarded as non-contributory or inefficient persons; therefore, they are not prioritized and are thus placed into a state of being voiceless and invisible.

In this research, we identified consumers emotions on the adoption of use-oriented Product-Service-Systems (PSS) and the effect of COVID-19 on such emotions using pre- and amid-COVID-19 samples. The results indicate that positive emotions are generally more associated with the process of adopting use-oriented PSS. However, the negative effect of COVID-19 on emotions influencing the decision to use the PSS is significant. We found that during the pandemic, consumers moved from the positive side of emotions to the more negative one. The emotions with the highest frequencies in pre-COVID-19 data collection (sympathy, joy, and peacefulness) suffered a significant descent effect due to the pandemic. Also, negative emotions such as fear, shame, and guilt, which were already present in the pre-COVID-19 phase, showed an increase in manifestations in the amid-COVID-19 sample. COVID-19 has increased self-interest in people, and emotions that predict altruism and concern for society were affected. We also found that previous use experience as well as gender and education do not significantly moderate the effect of COVID-19 on consumption emotions, although these demographic variables have been confirmed in other studies as important moderators in pro-environmental consumption. Finally, the results demonstrated that younger people (between 18 and 24 years old) tend to be more impacted by pandemic. Theoretically, our study contributes (1) by using an emotions scale specifically developed for consumption situations, allowing to assess a greater amount of emotions, (2) by analysing basic emotions, in addition to the self-conscious ones, that interfere in the adoption of use-oriented PSS, and (3) by confirming that an external traumatic event alters consumption-related emotions. ? 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers","output":"Consumer emotions and collaborative consumption: The effect of COVID-19 on the adoption of use-oriented product-service systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis is regarded as an imbalanced Th1/Th2 cell-mediated response. The present study used microarray analysis to compare gene expression levels between allergic rhinitis patients before and after a series of acupoint herbal plaster applications. METHODS: In this experimental pilot study, volunteers experiencing sneezing, runny nose, and congestion for more than 9 months in the year following initial diagnoses were included after diagnostic confirmation by otolaryngologists to exclude patients with sinusitis and nasal polyps. Patients with persistent allergic rhinitis each received four acupoint herbal plaster treatments applied using the moxibustion technique. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ). Peripheral blood samples were analyzed using an ImmunoCAP Phadiatop test, and patients were classified as phadiatop (Ph)-positive or -negative. Microarray results were analyzed for genes that were differentially expressed between (1) Ph-positive and -negative patients treated with herbal plaster; and (2) before and after herbal plaster treatment in the Ph-positive patient group. Unsupervised and supervised methods were used for gene-expression data analysis. RESULTS: Nineteen Ph-positive and four Ph-negative participants with persistent allergic rhinitis were included in the study. RQLQ results indicated that the 19 Ph-positive volunteers experienced improvement in six of seven categories following acupoint herbal plaster treatments, whereas the four Ph-negative participants reported improvement in only two categories. Hierarchical clustering and principle component analysis of the gene expression profiles of Ph-positive and Cnegative participants indicated the groups exhibited distinct physiological responses to acupoint herbal treatment. Evaluation of gene networks using MetaCore identified that the Immune response_IL-13 signaling via JAK-STAT and the Inflammation_Interferon signaling were down- and up-regulated, respectively, among Ph-positive subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, we find that the IL-13 immune response via JAK-STAT signaling and interferon inflammation signaling were down- and upregulated, respectively, in the Ph-positive group. Further studies are required to verify these pathways in Ph-positive patients, and to determine the mechanism of such pathway dysregulation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02486159.

After the first successful case of intravenous BT to treat a systemic MDR infection at our institution in 2017, the Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics (IPATH) was created at the University of California, San Diego, in June 2018. METHODS: We reviewed IPATH consult requests from June 1, 2018, to April 30, 2020, and reviewed the regulatory process of initiating BT on a compassionate basis in the United States. We also reviewed outcomes of the first 10 cases at our center treated with intravenous BT (from April 1, 2017, onwards). RESULTS: Among 785 BT requests to IPATH, BT was administered to 17 of 119 patients in whom it was recommended. One-third of requests were for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium abscessus. Intravenous BT was safe with a successful outcome in 7/10 antibiotic-recalcitrant infections at our center (6 were before IPATH). BT may be safely self-administered by outpatients, used for infection suppression/prophylaxis, and combined successfully with antibiotics despite antibiotic resistance, and phage resistance may be overcome with new phage(s).

In this study, we screened a panel of naturally occurring and semi-synthetic oxysterols for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity using a cell culture infection assay. We show that the natural oxysterols, 7-ketocholesterol, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol, substantially inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation in cultured cells. Among semi-synthetic oxysterols, Oxy210 and Oxy232 displayed more robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities, reducing viral replication more than 90% at 10 M and 99% at 15 M, respectively. When orally administered in mice, peak plasma concentrations of Oxy210 fell into a therapeutically relevant range (19 M), based on the dose-dependent curve for antiviral activity in our cell-based assay. Mechanistic studies suggest that Oxy210 reduced replication of SARS-CoV-2 by disrupting the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs); intracellular membrane compartments associated with viral replication.

Background: Growing number of confirmed and deaths cases from the coronavirus worldwide, particularly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, has resulted concerns about the future of these countries and their deterioration. Also the European region is likely to face more casualties due to the delay in the virus reaching most of its regions and, of course, as the trend continues. Methods: We conducted a simulation in both current and ideal situation for the next month to predict the death rate and examine the reason for the difference in Italy, Iran and South Korea individually. If we assume the cultural and political factors and age pyramids distribution are similar across regions, the differences are mainly due either to the heavier health-care burden owing to the larger population or to the medical facilities diversities. Results: Our results for Italy showed higher death number, but the rate would be more for Iran. South Korea is also expected to have a smaller increase in the number of confirmed cases and deaths compared to Iran and Italy by the next month.

To better meet the emergent challenges of transporting cryopreserved allogeneic HPC during pandemics, there is an urgent need for External Quality Assurance (EQA) programs to evaluate reproducibility and harmonization of viable CD34(+) cell (vCD34(+)) HPC enumeration, as the current EQA programs are unsuitable for analysis of vCD34(+). The cost-effective distribution of HPC cryopreserved reference samples (CRSs) with acceptable reproducibility and specificity is key to the success of a vCD34(+) EQA program. METHODS: Cryopreserved HPC samples (n = 11) were either stored on dry ice for 1 to 4 days or for 1 day followed by liquid nitrogen (LN) storage for 1 to 3 days to assess optimal conditions for vCD34(+) EQA. Flow cytometric enumeration of vCD34(+) HPCs was performed using a single platform assay combined with 7-AAD viability dye exclusion. The optimum transportation condition was validated in pilot and multicenter national studies (n = 12). RESULTS: A combination of 1 day on dry ice followed by LN storage stabilized viability compared with continuous storage on dry ice. This study demonstrates that dispatch of CRSs on dry ice to recipient centers across a distance of 4000 km within 26 h, followed by LN storage, resulted in reproducible intercenter vCD34(+) enumeration. The estimated cost of safer and more convenient dry ice delivery is >20-fold lower than that of LN.

In contrast to other tumor indications, objective response rates to single-agent PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in ovarian cancer are limited, suggesting a need to identify combinatorial approaches that lead to tumor regression in a setting where checkpoint blockade alone is ineffective. Using a pre-clinical model of aggressive intraperitoneal ovarian cancer, we have previously reported on a heterologous prime/boost cancer vaccine that elicits robust anti-tumor immunity, prolongs survival of tumor-bearing mice, and which is further improved when combined with checkpoint blockade. As tumor control in this model is CD8 + T cell dependent, we reasoned that the prime/boost vaccine platform could be used to explore additional treatment combinations intended to bolster the effects of CD8 + T cells. Using whole tumor transcriptomic data, we identified candidate therapeutic targets anticipated to rationally combine with prime/boost vaccination. In the context of a highly effective cancer vaccine, CD27 agonism or antibody-mediated depletion of granulocytic cells each modestly increased tumor control following vaccination, with anti-PD-1 therapy further improving treatment efficacy. These findings support the use of immunotherapies with well-defined mechanisms(s) of action as a valuable platform for identifying candidate combination approaches for further therapeutic testing in ovarian cancer.

This condition does not involve the central nervous system (CNS) and is characterized by a state of hyperactive immunocompetent responsiveness. It develops as the result of an antigenic challenge by a viral protein, either from a viral infection or a vaccination. In order for MS to become a disease affecting the CNS, it is necessary for the blood-brain barrier's (BBB) impermeability to be altered. This is now a fully recognized fact. As a result of this change, the MS lesion, which consists of edema and inflammation occurs. It may but need not lead to demyelination. Several mechanisms can cause this increased permeability of the BBB. The role of the immune system, and in particular of T lymphocytes in initiating and continuing the process of lesion formation remains extremely controversial. In fact, there are unanswered questions regarding the actual target of MS: is it the myelin sheath itself or its forming cell, the oligodendrocyte, or is it the BBB itself leading to bystander demyelination? The role of mild, concussional trauma to the CNS in producing the alteration of the BBB and therefore acting as a trigger or facilitator in the development or enlargement of MS lesions in the CNS, is based on considerable clinical, neuropathological and experimental evidence. Along with another viral infection, it must be one of the commonest causes of progression of MS, and quite often leads to the onset of the clinical manifestations of an hitherto asymptomatic condition.","output":"The pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis: Additional considerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose of the Study: Viral respiratory diseases, like those caused by novel strains of influenza and Coronaviridae, have historically disproportionately affected pregnant women and conferred increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes.

University participants were recruited via convenience sampling using snowball methods. The reliability and validity of the Malay CSM (CSM-M) were rigorously evaluated, utilising both confirmatory factor analysis and Rasch analysis, in relation to sociodemographic variables and response to the depression, anxiety, and stress subscales of the Malay validation of the DASS-21, and also perceived stress (measured by the PSS) and psychological flexibility (AAQ-II). The sample comprised of 247 Malaysian participants. The McDonalds omega value for the Malay CSM was 0.935 indicating very good internal reliability. The CSM was significantly correlated with stress, anxiety, depression, perceived stress, and psychological flexibility. The Malay CSM properties were examined also with Rasch analysis, with satisfactory outcomes. There was positive correlated error between items 1 and 3, as well as negative correlated error between items 1 and 4. Hence, item 1 was excluded, leaving with 4 items.

A significant increase in emotional distress was expected in the general population, particularly among the high-risk groups such as the oldest, chronic patients, healthcare professionals, and psychopathology vulnerable people. There was an urgent need to adapt and create solutions to promote mental health. Given the recommendations to minimize face-to-face interactions, several helplines were widely developed.ObjectivesIn this work, we aim to reflect on the experience of a university helpline, that integrated efforts with the regional mental health care services.MethodsA University helpline was created to give support to the regional community outside academia. The team was created on an online teamwork platform, to communicate through the chat, carry videoconference meetings, and store useful files. A Manchester screening decision tree was adopted, to define a set of guidelines to provide support to the callers, based mainly on the guidelines defined by the Order of Portuguese Psychologists. Liaison with the mental health care services, including other specific helplines, was established.ResultsNotwithstanding all the efforts, the number of received calls was scarce, similarly to helplines created by other national universities and by other entities.ConclusionsA new approach to psychological intervention in crisis is needed, maintaining integrated efforts, and taking advantage of the opportunity to foster personalized mental health care in the digital era. It is important to continuously assess the value of integrated efforts in patient care and to the healthcare system.","output":"Integrated efforts to promote mental health care during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Reflecting on the experience of a university helpline"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microbes play important roles in human health and disease. The interaction between microbes and hosts is a reciprocal relationship, which remains largely under-explored. Current computational resources lack manually and consistently curated data to connect metagenomic data to pathogenic microbes, microbial core genes, and disease phenotypes. We developed the MicroPhenoDB database by manually curating and consistently integrating microbe-disease association data. MicroPhenoDB provides 5677 non-redundant associations between 1781 microbes and 542 human disease phenotypes across more than 22 human body sites. MicroPhenoDB also provides 696,934 relationships between 27,277 unique clade-specific core genes and 685 microbes. Disease phenotypes are classified and described using the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO). A refined score model was developed to prioritize the associations based on evidential metrics. The sequence search option in MicroPhenoDB enables rapid identification of existing pathogenic microbes in samples without running the usual metagenomic data processing and assembly. MicroPhenoDB offers data browsing, searching and visualization through user-friendly web interfaces and web service application programming interfaces. MicroPhenoDB is the first database platform to detail the relationships between pathogenic microbes, core genes, and disease phenotypes.

Low-volume intracapillary blood sampling can be undertaken by patients at home and returned by post and may ensure access to therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for all patients irrespective of shielding status.Methods: We undertook a cross-sectional blood sampling methods comparison study to assess the clinical validity and acceptability to patients of low volume intracapillary testing for serum TDM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) compared to conventional venepuncture. Sample types were compared using linear regression and fit-for-purpose equivalence was defined using total allowable error (TEa) rates derived using interassay coefficient of variations from routine clinical practice. Acceptability was assessed using a purpose-designed questionnaire.Findings: The median (IQR) volume of serum obtained using intracapillary sampling was 195L (130-210). We showed drug level equivalence (slope [95% CI]: TEa vs observed mean % difference) between intracapillary sampling and conventional venepuncture for adalimumab (102 [090-114]: 117% vs 21%), infliximab (108 [098-118]: 183% vs 12%), vedolizumab (091 [085-096]: 176% vs 41%), and ustekinumab (092 [090-094]: 194% vs 33%). Anti-drug antibody equivalence was observed for anti-adalimumab (096 [095-098]: 245% vs 21%) and anti-infliximab (089 [081-097]: 173% vs 13%) antibody levels. Most patients reported that intracapillary testing was easy, convenient, and that they preferred it to conventional venepuncture.Interpretation: Low-volume intracapillary blood sampling was equivalent to conventional venepuncture for the measurement of biologic drug and anti-drug antibodies. Patients preferred intra-capillary testing to conventional venepuncture. Irrespective of future COVID-19 surges, patient-led intracapillary blood sampling is likely to become a key adjunct to telemedicine in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.Funding: Novo Nordisk Foundation.

This has major implications for cardiovascular health care professionals and the management of their patients. CHALLENGES: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated physical isolation practices are likely to result in a range of mental health and psychosocial challenges. In addition to an increasing incidence of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation and post-traumatic stress, the pandemic may also witness an increase in substance abuse, domestic violence and relationship discord.

In this backdrop, some very normative questions become inevitable. How has the technical efficiency of the banks in India changed over time especially after the asset quality review, 2016? How does undesirable output like non-performing assets (NPA) impact the technical efficiency of banks in India? Does technical efficiency have anything to do with the ownership of banks? These are some of the questions we endeavour to answer through our study by employing three cornerstone methodologies namely DEA, Malmquist productivity index and SFA in the banking sector for the period 2014C2020.The results obtained from employing DEA and SFA both points toward the heterogeneity in the technical efficiency of public sector banks and private sectors banks operating in India. The results obtained from DEA are majorly three-fold. Firstly, private sector banks have fared better than the public sector banks, while the SFA scores show that the public sector ownership promotes efficiency. Secondly, the technical efficiency of public sector banks has consistently been falling from 2014 to 2017 only to rise in the later years, evidence corroborated by the SFA scores also. This trend is in line with the slew of measures adopted by the government and RBI like AQR and mergers of banks subsequently. Although according to the Malmquist productivity decomposition results, we find that productivity of banks have been falling for the period 2014C2020. Thirdly, the non-performing assets are detrimental for the efficiency of the banks. Like DEA, the SFA results also shows the presence of technical inefficiency in the Indian banking sector and a similar trend in the technical efficiency wherein the scores decline from 2014 through 2017 and then they rise subsequently.

Since the pulmonary circulation receives the entire cardiac output, the large surface area of the lung microvasculature is well suited for sensing mechanical, chemical, and cellular injury by inhaled or circulating substances. This endothelial barrier is dynamically regulated through exposure to these various stimuli of physiological and pathological origin and serves to regulate multiple key biological processes (including lung fluid balance and solute transport between vascular compartments). For example, an increase in vascular permeability is a necessary feature of the bodys defense mechanism to provide injured tissues with access to leucocytes, resulting in tissue edema due to fluid extravasation. However, during conditions of intense lung inflammation such as observed in acute lung injury or its severer form of acute respiratory distress syndrome, the large surface area becomes a liability and provides the opportunity for profound vascular permeability resulting in massive fluid accumulation in the alveolar space and progressively leading to pulmonary failure. Alterations in vascular permeability occur not only in acute inflammatory lung disorders primarily caused by sepsis, pneumonia, and trauma which result in high rates of patient morbidity and mortality, but are an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in subacute lung inflammatory disorders such as ischemiaCreperfusion injury, radiation lung injury, and asthma. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of endothelial barrier dysfunction is vital for the management and treatment of key and enigmatic pulmonary disorders.","output":"Acute Lung Injury: The Injured Lung Endothelium, Therapeutic Strategies for Barrier Protection, and Vascular Biomarkers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Measurement of the population's general knowledge of the coronavirus vaccine is very important to improve public acceptance and decrease vaccine hesitancy in confronting the disease.

This prospective diagnostic test accuracy study aims to evaluate the performance of four different COVID-19 rapid antigen tests compared to real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) between June and July 2020 to determine the feasibility of integrating these tests into the diagnostic algorithm in clinical settings. METHODS: Swabs were collected from 306 patients and analyzed using rRT-PCR and antigen tests from four different providers. RESULTS: The antigen tests sensitivities were 65.8%, 69.8%, 64.0%, and 64.3% for the STANDARD? Q COVID-19 Ag test, PCL COVID-19 Ag Rapid fluorescent immunoassay (FIA) test, BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag test, and Sofia SARS-CoV-2 antigen FIA test, respectively. Specificity was 94.1% for PCL COVID-19 Ag Rapid test and 100% for the other three assays.

Repurposing of Fluvoxamine for the treatment of COVID-19 is theorized to help in the prevention of the clinical deterioration of SARS CoV-2 patients. In our systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug under study in terms of its effect on the mortality and the risk of hospitalization and mechanical ventilation in non-critically ill COVID-19 patients. Methods: We performed a systematic search of seven electronic databases. The search results were screened based on the previously determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We determined the data related to our objectives. The mortality rates, rates of hospitalization, risk of mechanical ventilation and serious side effects were extracted from the studies that successfully met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then, the extracted data from the included studies was included in the meta-analysis. Results: Three studies, two randomized clinical trials and one observational cohort study, with 1762 patients, were the final outcome of our search and screening processes. Among all participants, 886 patients received Fluvoxamine while 876 were controls. Follow up periods ranged from 7 days to 28 days. There was no significant difference in the intention-to-treat mortality rates between the two groups (RR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.36 - 1.21, p-value = 0.18; I2 = 0%). However, Fluvoxamine decreased the per-protocol mortality compared to both placebo alone or placebo/standard care (RR = 0.09; 95% CI: 0.01 - 0.64, p-value = 0.02; I2 = 0% and RR = 0.09; 95% CI: 0.01 - 0.72, respectively). As compared to placebo or standard care, the all-cause hospitalization was significantly reduced in the fluvoxamine group (RR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.54 - 0.93, p-value = 0.01; I2 = 61%). This risk reduction was not significant when compared to placebo alone (RR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.57 - 1.00; p-value = 0.051; I2 = 48%). Furthermore, the risk of mechanical ventilation was not improved in the fluvoxamine group as compared to placebo (RR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.43 - 1.16, p-value = 0.17; I2 = 0%). The serious adverse effects were almost the same in the treatment group and the control (13% and 12% respectively). Conclusion: Fluvoxamine does not significantly reduce the mortality rates or the risk of mechanical ventilation in SARS CoV-2 patients. Nonetheless, it was found to have a good impact on reducing all cause hospitalization among patients with COVID-19 disease.

Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the technical and infrastructural feasibility to establish this type of scheme in Costa Rica targeting thedetection of pathogens of zoonotic and conservation importance in wildlife. Between 2018 and 2020, 85 carcasses of free-ranging vertebrates were admitted for post mortem analysis and complementary laboratory analysis, representing a solid basis for the implementation of a passive surveillance system for wildlife diseases in the country. However, we encounter during this research significant constraints that affected the availability of carcasses for analysis, mainly related to the initial identification of cases, detection biases towards events in populated- or easily accessible-areas with nearby located wildlife management centers, further associated with financial disincentives, and limited local logistics capacity. Thus resulting in the exclusion of some geographic regions of the country. This epidemiological surveillance scheme allowed us to estimate the general state of health of the countrys wildlife, establishing the cause of death of the analyzed animals as follows: (i) 46 (54.1%) traumatic events, (ii) 23 (27.1%) infectious agents, (iii) two (2.4%) degenerative illness, (iv) three (3.5%) presumably poisoning, and (v) in 11 (12.9%)undetermined.

It is uncertain if this approach benefits patients with LDL-C near 70 mg/dL. Lipoprotein(a) levels may influence residual risk. OBJECTIVES: In a post hoc analysis of the ODYSSEY Outcomes (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With Alirocumab) trial, the authors evaluated the benefit of adding the proprotein subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor alirocumab to optimized statin treatment in patients with LDL-C levels near 70 mg/dL. Effects were evaluated according to concurrent lipoprotein(a) levels. METHODS: ODYSSEY Outcomes compared alirocumab with placebo in 18,924 patients with recent acute coronary syndromes receiving optimized statin treatment. In 4,351 patients (23.0%), screening or randomization LDL-C was <70 mg/dL (median 69.4 mg/dL; interquartile range: 64.3C74.0 mg/dL); in 14,573 patients (77.0%), both determinations were 70 mg/dL (median 94.0 mg/dL; interquartile range: 83.2C111.0 mg/dL). RESULTS: In the lower LDL-C subgroup, MACE rates were 4.2 and 3.1 per 100 patient-years among placebo-treated patients with baseline lipoprotein(a) greater than or less than or equal to the median (13.7 mg/dL). Corresponding adjusted treatment hazard ratios were 0.68 (95% confidence interval [Cl]: 0.52C0.90) and 1.11 (95% Cl: 0.83C1.49), with treatment-lipoprotein(a) interaction on MACE (P(interaction) = 0.017). In the higher LDL-C subgroup, MACE rates were 4.7 and 3.8 per 100 patient-years among placebo-treated patients with lipoprotein(a) >13.7 mg/dL or 13.7 mg/dL; corresponding adjusted treatment hazard ratios were 0.82 (95% Cl: 0.72C0.92) and 0.89 (95% Cl: 0.75C1.06), with P(interaction) = 0.43. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with recent acute coronary syndromes and LDL-C near 70 mg/dL on optimized statin therapy, proprotein subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibition provides incremental clinical benefit only when lipoprotein(a) concentration is at least mildly elevated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample size of n = 700 was recruited in the study. The study included DPs from all over the world. A randomized selection of samples was done through dental groups present on social networks. An online survey was conducted in April 2020, using the Google Form software to provide questions and collect and elaborate answers. Data were analyzed using the statistical software STATA and presented in terms of percentages. RESULTS: About 78% of the study participants perceived a very high risk of COVID-19 contamination in dental settings. Nearly 80% of the study participants were willing to be subjected to rapid tests and the same could be performed on patients visiting their dental clinics, which could prevent the spread of the disease. About 55% of the participants had reported that additional costs for the rapid tests should be borne by the governments. CONCLUSION: The results of the present survey report that DPs do not feel safe and perceive a high risk of COVID-19 contagion and prevention of the disease could be done by performing rapid tests on dentists, dental staff, and patients visiting the dental clinics irrespective of age and gender of the participants.

The advantages of the LEM and the developed dynamic solution, such as simulation of arbitrary crack initiation and propagation, illustration and simulation of existing inherent material heterogeneity as well as stress redistribution upon crack opening, opens a new engineering field and tool for material analysis. To realize the time dependency of the dynamic LEM, the equation of motion of forced vibration is solved while using the Newmark-[Formula: see text] method and implementing the non-linear Newton-Raphson Jacobian method. The method validation is done according to the results of a boundary element method (BEM) in the plane P-SV-wave propagation within a plane strain domain. Further tests comparing the generated wave types, simulation and study of crack discontinuities as well as inherent heterogeneities in the geomaterials are conducted to illustrate the accurate applicability of the new dynamic lattice method. The results indicate that with increasing heterogeneity within the material, the wave field becomes significantly scattered and further analysis of wave fields according to the wavelength/heterogeneity ratio become indispensable. Therefore, in a heterogeneous medium, the application of continuum methods in relation to structural health monitoring should be precisely investigated and improved.

This phenomenon was attributed to the presence of cross-protective antibodies acquired by older individuals during previous exposures to H1N1 viruses. However, this hypothesis could not be empirically tested. To address this question, we compared viral replication and the development of the immune response in na?ve young adult and aged female rhesus macaques infected with A/California/04/2009 H1N1 (CA04) virus. We show higher viral loads in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and nasal and ocular swabs in aged animals, suggesting increased viral replication in both the lower and upper respiratory tracts. T cell proliferation was higher in the BAL fluid but delayed and reduced in peripheral blood in aged animals. This delay in proliferation correlated with a reduced frequency of effector CD4 T cells in old animals. Aged animals also mobilized inflammatory cytokines to higher levels in the BAL fluid. Finally, we compared changes in gene expression using microarray analysis of BAL fluid samples. Our analyses revealed that the largest difference in host response between aged and young adult animals was detected at day 4 postinfection, with a significantly higher induction of genes associated with inflammation and the innate immune response in aged animals. Overall, our data suggest that, in the absence of preexisting antibodies, CA04 infection in aged macaques is associated with changes in innate and adaptive immune responses that were shown to correlate with increased disease severity in other respiratory disease models.","output":"Increased viral loads and exacerbated innate host responses in aged macaques infected with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the COVID-19 pandemic first hit Wuhan, China, in December 2019, scientists have been racing to develop and test novel vaccines to protect against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Hence, we aimed to ascertain the value of CHADS(2), CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc, and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc-M (one point for male instead of female) scores to predict unfavorable outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We enrolled consecutive patients above 18 years of age with confirmed COVID-19,who were admitted between February 16 and November 1, 2020. The primary endpoint of this study was three-month all-cause mortality. The secondary endpoints were considered four major in-hospital clinical features, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac injury,acute kidney injury, and mechanical ventilation. Results: A total of 1,406 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were studied, among which 301(21.40%) patients died during the follow-up period. Regarding the risk scores, CHADS (2)1,CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc2, and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc-M2 were significantly associated with mortality. The performance of all risk scores for predicting mortality was satisfactory (area under the curve:0.668, 0.668, and 0.681, respectively). Appraising secondary endpoints, we found that all three risk scores were associated with increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, and mechanical ventilation. Lastly, we revealed that all risk scores were significantly correlated with serum levels of laboratory biomarkers. Conclusion: Our analysis illustrated that the CHADS(2), CHA2DS(2)-VASc, and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc-Mscores could aid prognostication of unfavorable outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

Similar liposomes equipped with a PEGylated lipoconjugate provided a pronounced anti-influenza effect of the isRNA in vivo.

To analyze the potential biological importance of the I gene, we disrupted its expression by site-directed mutagenesis using targeted RNA recombination.

In vitro translation studies showed that these mutations completely abolished synthesis of I protein, and immunological analysis of infected cell lysates confirmed this conclusion. The MHV I mutant was viable and grew to high titer. However, the I mutant had a reduced plaque size in comparison with its isogenic wild-type counterpart, suggesting that expression of I confers some minor growth advantage to the virus. The engineered mutations were stable during the course of experimental infection in mice, and the I mutant showed no significant differences from wild type in its ability to replicate in the brains or livers of infected animals.

To minimize sampling bias, global sequences were subsampled with probabilities corrected for their countries' monthly contribution to global new diagnoses. A time-scaled maximum likelihood tree was used to estimate most likely ancestral geographic locations (country or Canadian province), enabling identification of sublineages, defined as introduction events into Canada resulting in domestic transmission. Of 402 Canadian sublineages identified, the majority likely originated from the USA (54%), followed by Russia (7%), India (6%), Italy (6%), and the UK (5%). International introductions were mostly into Ontario (39%) and Quebec (38%). Among Pango lineages, B.1 was imported at least 191 separate times from 11 different countries. Introduction rates peaked in late March then diminished but were not eliminated following national interventions including restrictions on non-essential travel. We further identified 1,380 singleton importations, international importations that did not result in further sampled transmission, whereby representation of lineages and location were comparable to sublineages.

Household members may participate in a supplementary household transmission study. Community comparisons are made possible using a pre-existing, long-standing, and highly effective influenza surveillance program, based on MAI at 5 primary care clinics in the same geographical area. Results: Over the first 5 years, a-ILI occurred on 6,634 (0.20%) of 3,260,461 student school days. Viral pathogens were detected in 64.5% of 1,728 children visited at home with ARI. Influenza was the most commonly detected virus, noted in 23.3% of ill students. Influenza (p<0.001) and adenovirus (P=0.004) were significantly associated with a-ILI. Discussion: ORCHARDS uses a community-based design to detect and evaluate influenza trends over multiple seasons and to evaluate the utility of absenteeism for early detection of accelerated influenza and other respiratory pathogen transmission in schools and surrounding communities. Initial findings suggest the study design is succeeding in collecting appropriate data to achieve study objectives.","output":"The Oregon Child Absenteeism Due to Respiratory Disease Study (ORCHARDS):Rationale, Objectives, and Design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of the article is to assess the state of the Russian payment market and the impact on it of two main factors-the COVID-19 pandemic and the development of the digital economy Objectives of the article: 1) highlight the stages of development of the modern payment market in Russia;2) identify the dynamics of the payment market of the Russian Federation (infrastructure for the provision of payment and other financial services, the number of non-cash payments, the use of cash);3) to establish the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the development of the digital economy on the state of the Russian payment market As a result of solving the tasks, the following was established There are three stages to assess the Russian payment market Analysis of data on the infrastructure for the provision of payment and other financial services showed that since 2010 there has been an annual decrease in the number of banks The structure of non-cash payments is changing: the number and amount of transactions using payment cards are growing, the number and volume of money transfers are decreasing, and cash is being phased out The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and digitalization on the state of the Russian payment market reflects trends that are being strengthened by the pandemic and are shaping a sustainable trend ? 2020 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences","output":"The state of the Russian payment market: Digitalization and the impact of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants poses a constant threat of escape from monoclonal antibody and vaccine countermeasures.

Here, we use a directed evolution-based approach to engineer three neutralizing antibodies for enhanced binding to S protein. The engineered antibodies showed increased in vitro functional activity in terms of neutralization potency and/or breadth of neutralization against viral variants. Deep mutational scanning revealed that higher binding affinity reduced the total number of viral escape mutations. Studies in the Syrian hamster model showed two examples where the affinity matured antibody provided superior protection compared to the parental antibody. These data suggest that monoclonal antibodies for anti-viral indications could benefit from in vitro affinity maturation to reduce viral escape pathways and appropriate affinity maturation in vaccine immunization could help resist viral variation.","output":"Engineering SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies for increased potency and reduced viral escape"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: the COVID-19 pandemic has caused problems with respirator supplies. Reuse may minimise the impact of the shortage but requires the availability of an efficient and safe decontamination method. AIM: our objective is to determine whether the low-temperature-steam-2%-formaldehyde (LTSF) sterilisation process is effective, preserves the properties of filtering facepiece (FFP) respirators and allows safe reuse. METHODS: 14 unused FFP2, FFP3 and N95 respirator models were subjected to two decontamination cycles. After the second cycle, each model was visually inspected and accumulated residual formaldehyde levels were analysed according to the EN 14180. After one and two cycles, Fit factor (FF) was tested on all models and penetration tests with sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosols were additionally performed on five models. FINDINGS: decontamination physically altered three of the 14 models. All the residual formaldehyde values were below the permissible threshold. Irregular FF decreases and increases were observed after each cycle. In the sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosol penetration test, three devices obtained equivalent or superior results to those of the FFP classification with which they were marketed, both at the baseline level and after one and two decontamination cycles. Two other devices reduced their filtering capacity. CONCLUSION: One and two sterilisation cycles using LTSF do not alter the structure of most (11/14) respirators tested and did not degrade the fit or filtration capacity of any of the analysed respirators. The residual formaldehyde levels comply with the EN 14180 standard. This reprocessing method could be used in times of shortage of personal protective equipment.","output":"Filtering facepiece respirators decontamination using a low-temperature-steam-2% formaldehyde sterilisation process during a pandemic: a safe alternative for reuse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Exception from informed consent (EFIC) enables the enrollment of research subjects with emergent conditions to clinical trials without prior consent. EFIC study approval requires community consultation and public disclosure. We hypothesized that the integration of social media with targeted emails and in-person outreach is an effective community consultation strategy. METHODS We utilized social media with targeted emails and in-person outreach for the community consultation of the ACCESS cardiac arrest trial. Study advertisements were disseminated using Facebook and Instagram, and targeted emails were sent to emergency medicine, prehospital and cardiology providers. We also interviewed at-risk individuals with cardiac conditions, their caretakers, and patient advocacy groups. Participants were asked to complete a survey about their opinions about the study. RESULTS We collected 559 surveys over an 8-week period, and 70.5% of the surveys were obtained using social media. The mean age of survey respondents was 45 years; 89.9% were white and 60.1% were women. 91.3% believed ACCESS was an important study. Compared to the in-person group, more from social media (81.8% vs 63.3%, p < 0.05) and targeted email (77.4% vs 63.3%, p < 0.05) groups said they would include their loved ones in the study. More from the in-person group believed that their opinion would be considered seriously compared to the social media (75.9% vs 62.6%, p < 0.05) and targeted email (75.9% vs 54.5%, p < 0.05) groups. The incorporation of social media and targeted emails for community consultation reduced the cost per survey by 4-fold compared to an in-person only strategy. CONCLUSIONS The integration of social media with targeted emails and in-person outreach was a feasible and cost-saving approach for EFIC community consultation. Future work is necessary to determine the perception and best utilization of social media for community consultation.","output":"Integration of Social Media With Targeted Emails And In-Person Outreach For Exception From Informed Consent Community Consultation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computed tomography (CT) manifestations and treatment of children with COVID-19 are still unclear We report serial CT findings of a child with COVID-19 pneumonia who recovered without any sequelae","output":"Serial Computed Tomography Manifestations in a Child with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Bereavement due to cancer increases the risk of prolonged grief disorder. However, specialized treatment options for prolonged grief after a loss due to illness are still scarce. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to extend previous findings by evaluating a web-based cognitive behavioral intervention with asynchronous therapist support, consisting of structured writing tasks adapted specifically for prolonged grief after cancer bereavement. METHODS: The intervention was evaluated in a purely web-based randomized waitlist-controlled trial. Open-access recruitment of participants was conducted on the web. Prolonged grief (Inventory of Complicated Grief), depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, posttraumatic growth, somatization, sleep quality, and mental and physical health were assessed on the web via validated self-report measures. RESULTS: A total of 87 participants were randomized into the intervention group (IG; 44/87, 51%) or the waitlist control group (43/87, 49%). Of the participants, 7% (6/87) dropped out of the study (5/44, 11%, in the IG). Of the 39 completers in the IG, 37 (95%) completed all intervention tasks. The intervention reduced symptoms of prolonged grief (intention-to-treat: P<.001; (2)=0.34; Cohen d=0.80) to a clinically significant extent. It had favorable effects on depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, posttraumatic growth, and overall mental health but not on somatization, sleep quality, or physical health. CONCLUSIONS: The web-based intervention for prolonged grief after cancer bereavement is effective in reducing symptoms of prolonged grief disorder and accompanying syndromes in a timely, easily realizable manner and addresses specific challenges of bereavement to illness. Considering web-based approaches in future mental health care policy and practice can reduce health care gaps for those who are bereaved to cancer.

In order to examine the impact of such policies on schoolchildren, the aims of the present study were to (i) assess changes in the level of engagement in three internet-related activities (smartphone use, social media use, and gaming) before and during the COVID-19 outbreak, including prolonged and problematic engagement in these activities; (ii) investigate the differences of psychological distress before and after COVID-19 outbreak; and (iii) to use structural equation modeling to investigate the mediating roles of problematic internet-related behaviors in the causal relationships of psychological distress and time spent on internet-related activities. Methods: Self-report measures were used to assess internet-related activities and psychological distress. Time spent on internet-related activities, problematic use of internet-related activities, and psychological distress were collected from primary school students (N = 535; 265 boys; M age = 10.32 years [SD = 0.84]). The data were first collected before the COVID-19 outbreak (i.e., early November 2019) and then collected again during the school suspension due to COVID-19 outbreak (i.e., end of March 2020) for comparisons of changes. Results: Schoolchildren spent significantly more time on the smartphone (increased 1.02 h daily; P < 0.001) and social media (increased 0.73 h daily; P < 0.001) but not gaming (increased 0.14 h daily; P = 0.07) during the school suspension compared to the baseline. Schoolchildren who increased by 15 or 30 min daily on internet-related activities showed an increased level of psychological distress. The association between problematic use of social media and psychological distress was stronger during the school suspension (? = 0.584) than at the baseline (? = 0.451; P < 0.001). Conclusion: Increased problematic use of internet-related activities among schoolchildren was associated with greater psychological distress.

While these assessments usually include a focus on physical pain, there is less standardization of assessments of other physical symptoms and psychosocial, emotional, or spiritual needs. AIMS To improve the breadth of assessment of psychosocial and emotional needs, screen for symptoms other than pain among pediatric patients utilizing palliative care services, and to increase documentation of assessment data from 30%-40% to 80% through practice changes implemented in 2 Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles. METHODS This quality improvement project involved implementing provider education and adapting the palliative care consultation template in the electronic health record to improve breadth and consistency of assessment and documentation during consultations by the interdisciplinary pediatric palliative care team. Two PDSA cycles were performed. Chi squared tests and statistical control charts were used for data analysis. RESULTS There was statistically significant improvement in the inclusion of documentation of a pediatric palliative care social work note from baseline (32%) to Cycle 2 (57%). Physical symptom screening declined slightly, but not significantly (p = .32) and socio-emotional discussions also declined but not significantly (p = .05). CONCLUSIONS Screening for physical symptoms and discussions with patients and families about psychosocial/emotional needs during the initial palliative care consultations are extremely important in providing effective, holistic, patient-centered care. There is a need for development of pediatric-centric guidelines and quality measures to evaluate pediatric palliative care programs; further research is indicated to determine methods for evaluating compliance with these guidelines.","output":"Evaluation of a Quality Improvement Intervention to Improve Pediatric Palliative Care Consultation Processes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that has resulted in a global pandemic.

Owing to excellent public health measures that isolated focus cases and their contacts, and the use of supportive therapies, the epidemic was suppressed to the point that further cases have not appeared since 2005. However, despite intensive research since then (over 3500 publications), it remains an untreatable disease. The potential for re-emergence of the SARS-CoV or a similar virus with unknown but potentially serious consequences remains high. This is due in part to the extreme genetic variability of RNA viruses such as the coronaviruses, the many animal reservoirs that seem to be able host the SARS-CoV in which reassortment or recombination events could occur and the ability coronaviruses have to transmit relatively rapidly from species to species in a short period of time. Thus, it seems prudent to continue to explore and develop antiviral chemotherapies to treat SARS-CoV infections. To this end, the various efficacious anti-SARS-CoV therapies recently published from 2007 to 2010 are reviewed in this article. In addition, compounds that have been tested in various animal models and were found to reduce virus lung titers and/or were protective against death in lethal models of disease, or otherwise have been shown to ameliorate the effects of viral infection, are also reported.","output":"Recent developments in anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus chemotherapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The social identity model of risk taking proposes that people take more risks with ingroup members because they trust them more. While this can be beneficial in some circumstances, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic it has the potential to undermine an effective public health response if people underestimate the risk of contagion posed by ingroup members, or overestimate the risk of vaccines or treatments developed by outgroup members. METHODS: Three studies (two prospective surveys, one experiment) with community-based adults tested the potential for the social identity model of risk taking to explain risk perception and risk taking in the context of COVID-19. RESULTS: Study 1 was a two-wave study with a pre-COVID baseline, and found that people who identified more strongly as a member of their neighborhood pre-COVID tended to trust their neighbors more, and perceive interacting with them during COVID-19 lockdown to be less risky. Study 2 (N = 2033) replicated these findings in a two-wave nationally representative Australian sample. Study 3 (N = 216) was a pre-registered experiment which found that people indicated greater willingness to take a vaccine, and perceived it to be less risky, when it was developed by an ingroup compared to an outgroup source. We interpret this as evidence that the tendency to trust ingroup members more could be harnessed to enhance the COVID-19 response. CONCLUSIONS: Across all three studies, ingroup members were trusted more and were perceived to pose less health risk. These findings are discussed with a focus on how group processes can be more effectively incorporated into public health policy, both for the current pandemic and for future contagious disease threats.","output":"Perceived COVID-19 risk is attenuated by ingroup trust: evidence from three empirical studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many studies have shown that patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have different degrees of liver injury.

This review mainly summarizes the recently published works on the abnormal liver biochemical indicators and the mechanism of viral invasion with liver injury in COVID-19 patients. Generally, SARS-CoV-2 infection of the liver was caused by blood circulation or retrograde infection of the digestive tract, which led to the liver injury through direct cytopathic effect induced by virus or immunopathological effect caused by excessive inflammation. Besides these, hypoxia, endothelial injury and drug-induced jury were also the main reasons of liver injury in COVID-19 patients. In the liver function indicators, elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and lactate dehydrogenase levels with reduced albumin levels were observed in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 Invasion into the Liver and Hepatic Injury in Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For nsp1, the fact that the carboxy-terminal but not the amino-terminal half of the protein can be deleted suggests that there may be specific and distinct domains within the protein or that the entire protein is dispensable but that the RNA encoding the amino-terminal half of nsp1 cannot be deleted. The identification of specific required residues support the conclusion that it is the portion of the protein that is required for replication. The results of mutagenesis of the nsp14 coding region and flanking cleavage sites also provided important new insights into this protein and its requirements. Our previous study raised the question as to the essential nature of nsp14 in replication. The results of this study show that putative active site residues cannot be substituted without loss of replication in culture. Interestingly, mutagenesis of Tyr414 showed that while this residue can tolerate a number of substitutions, it was intolerant of Lysine or deletion. The results suggest that nsp14 is required for replication. However, whatever functions nsp14 serves appear to be retained by noncleaved or partially processed nsp14, since abolition of either the amino-terminal or carboxy-terminal cleavage site allowed recovery of viable virus.","output":"Effects of Mutagenesis of Murine Hepatitis Virus NSP1 and NSP14 on Replication in Culture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Following the implementation of a new electronic health record (EHR) system at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC), the demands of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced an abrupt reallocation of resources away from EHR adoption. To assist staff in focusing on techniques for improving EHR utilization, an optimization methodology was designed referencing the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) approach. Methods The study was performed using a methodology that comprised of two primary components as follows: (1) analysis of qualitative and quantitative data and (2) participation of frontline staff in project work groups. Working groups mapped out the current state of the identified workflows, designed and implemented interventions, monitored the effectiveness of each intervention, and scaled the proposed changes. Results As a result of the optimization methodology, clinical and operational workflows improved in the pilot department. Operationally, the pilot department increased enrollment of patients in the virtual patient portal by 20%, increased schedule utilization by 25%, and reduced average check-in time by 19%. Clinically, the pilot department had a statistically significant increase in dictation and NoteWriter tool note composition from their baseline month to their observed month. Compared with the control department, the pilot department had a statistically significant increase in SmartTool and dictation note composition. The control department showed smaller increases, and in some cases a decline in performance, in these areas of operational and clinical workflows. Conclusion The CFIR framework helped design an optimization methodology by applying a set of constructs to support effective organizational optimization, accounting for inner and outer settings. Through this methodology, the inner setting was supported in leading the identification and execution of interventions targeted to impact the outer setting.

A life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed to consider the conversion to electricity of rice straw, the production of which was based on the Philippine farming practice. Rice straw is treated as a milled rice coproduct and assumes an environmental burden which is allocated by mass. The results of an impact assessment for climate change was used directly in a system dynamic model to plot the accumulated greenhouse gas emissions from the system and compare with various cases in order to perform sensitivity analyses. At a productivity of 334 kWh/t, the global warming potential (GWP) of the system is equal to 0.642 kg CO2-eq/MJ, which is 27% lower than the GWP of rice straw on-site burning. Mitigating biogenic methane emissions from flooded rice fields could reduce the GWP of the system by 34%, while zero net carbon emissions can be achieved at 2.78 kg CO2/kg of milled rice carbon sequestration. Other sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are the use of fossil fuels and production of chemicals for agricultural use. The use of agricultural machinery and transport lorries has the highest impact on eutrophication potential and human toxicity, while the application of pesticides and fertilizers has the highest impact on ecotoxicity. The biomass energy ratio (BER) and net energy ratio (NER) of the system is 0.065 and 1.64, respectively. The BER and NER can be improved at a higher engine efficiency from 22% to 50%.

METHODS: In total, 2,104 teachers in higher education institutions in Southern China were surveyed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the Psychological Adjustment to Online Teaching Scale (a measure developed for this study) between March 25 and March 31, 2020. The collected data were analyzed using latent profile analysis. RESULTS: Based on their affective experiences during online teaching immediately after the COVID-19 outbreak, higher education teachers were divided into three latent classes: the common, ambivalent, and positive types. Among them, the positive type accounted for the largest proportion (44.85%), while the ambivalent type accounted for the smallest proportion (23.93%). The rest was the common type, which accounted for 31.15%. Significant differences in psychological adjustment to online teaching were found between the three latent classes. Regarding positive psychological adjustment, teachers belonging to the ambivalent type had significantly lower scores than those belonging to the other two types. Further, the common type had a significantly lower score than the positive type. Regarding negative psychological adjustment, the ambivalent type had a significantly higher score than the other two types, and the common type had a significantly higher score than the positive type.

Autopsies of patients confirm the presence of the coronaviruses in the CNS, especially in the brain. The invasion and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS is not clearly defined, but, because the endocytic pathway has become an important target for the development of therapeutic strategies for COVID-19, it is necessary to understand endocytic processes in the CNS. In addition, mitochondria and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways play a critical role in the antiviral immune response, and may also be critical for endocytic activity. Furthermore, dysfunctions of mitochondria and mTOR signaling pathways have been associated with some high-risk conditions such as diabetes and immunodeficiency for developing severe complications observed in COVID-19 patients. However, the role of these pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infection and spread are largely unknown. In this review, we discuss the potential mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the CNS and how mitochondria and mTOR pathways might regulate endocytic vesicle-mitochondria interactions and dynamics during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mechanisms that plausibly account for severe neurologic complications with COVID-19 and potential treatments with Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs targeting mitochondria and the mTOR pathways are also addressed.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Neuronal Invasion and Complications: Potential Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As social anthropologists, we feel more comfortable when we base our analyses on ethnographic fieldwork Obviously, this is impossible in the current circumstances, due to mandatory isolation Accepting these limitations, we want to outline a short reflection on the responses and experiences that the coronavirus pandemic has provoked in Argentina","output":"When a crisis is embedded in another crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic have led to a severe economic crisis.

Barriers to research implementation processes can threaten studies' validity, reducing the value to residents, staff, researchers and funders. We aimed to (i) identify and categorise contextual factors that may mediate outcomes of complex intervention studies in care homes and (ii) provide recommendations to minimise the risk of expensive research implementation failures. METHODS We conducted a systematic review using a framework synthesis approach viewed through a complex adaptive systems lens. We searched: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ASSIA databases and grey literature. We sought process evaluations of care home complex interventions published in English. Narrative data were indexed under 28 context domains. We performed an inductive thematic analysis across the context domains. RESULTS We included 33 process evaluations conducted in high-income countries, published between 2005 and 2019. Framework synthesis identified barriers to implementation that were more common at the task and organisational level. Inductive thematic analysis identified (i) avoiding procedural drift and (ii) participatory action and learning as key priorities for research teams. Research team recommendations include advice for protocol design and care home engagement. Care home team recommendations focus on internal resources and team dynamics. Collaborative recommendations apply to care homes' individual context and the importance of maintaining positive working relationships.

Recently, several statistical distributions have been considered for quantile modeling. The objective of this study is to provide a new computational package, two biomedical applications, one of them with COVID-19 data, and an up-to-date overview of parametric quantile regression. A fully parametric quantile regression is formulated by first parameterizing the baseline distribution in terms of a quantile. Then, we introduce a regression-based functional form through a link function. The density, distribution, and quantile functions, as well as the main properties of each distribution, are presented. We consider 18 distributions related to normal and non-normal settings for quantile modeling of continuous responses on the unit interval, four distributions for continuous response, and one distribution for discrete response. We implement an R package that includes estimation and model checking, density, distribution, and quantile functions, as well as random number generators, for distributions using quantile regression in both location and shape parameters. In summary, a number of studies have recently appeared applying parametric quantile regression as an alternative to the distribution-free quantile regression proposed in the literature. We have reviewed a wide body of parametric quantile regression models, developed an R package which allows us, in a simple way, to fit a variety of distributions, and applied these models to two examples with biomedical real-world data from Brazil and COVID-19 data from US for illustrative purposes. Parametric and non-parametric quantile regressions are compared with these two data sets.","output":"An overview on parametric quantile regression models and their computational implementation with applications to biomedical problems including COVID-19 data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Weimaining (WMN) is a condensed Tannin compound extracted from Fagopyrum cymosum (Trevir.)

WMN has inhibitory effects on multiple cancer types and is widely used in clinical practice; however, the mechanism underlying the anti-tumor effect of WMN is still unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY To investigate the effect of WMN on the cellular activity and apoptosis of mouse breast cancer 4T1-luc2 cells, and caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-3 expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS Luciferase-labeled mouse breast cancer 4T1-luc2 cells were inoculated into the mouse breast pad to establish a luciferase-labeled mouse breast cancer cell model. BALB/C-nu mice were randomly divided into model, WMN, and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) groups (n=10). Another 10 mice served as the normal control group (no cancer cell injection). The WMN group was administered WMN 250 mg/kg per day for 14 days, the LMWH group was given LMWH (1500 U/kg) daily for 14 days by intraperitoneal injection, and the model and normal control groups were given an equal dose of 0.9% NaCl. The number and distribution of transplanted tumors in 4T1-luc2 breast cancer cells were observed in nude mice by an in vivo imaging system at the time of inoculation after successful modeling, and on days 7 and 14 after drug administration. Tumor cell apoptosis was detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method; caspase-3 mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting was applied to detect the levels of caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-3 protein expression. RESULTS The apoptosis index (AI) of the WMN group was detected by the TUNEL method, and the AI increased with the increase of treatment time. Compared with the model group, the mRNA expression of caspase-3 and the protein levels of caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-3 were notably elevated in the WMN group. After in vivo bioluminescent imaging, the total photon number of the WMN group was found to be lower than that of the LWMH group on day 14 after administration. Additionally, the AI and expression levels of caspase-3 mRNA, caspase-3, and cleaved-caspase-3 protein of the WMN group were higher than those of the LWMH group. CONCLUSION WMN can effectively suppress the growth of 4T1-luc2 breast cancer xenografts in mice, and promote the apoptosis of breast cancer cells by upregulating the expression of caspase-3.","output":"Effect of Weimaining on Apoptosis and Caspase-3 Expression in a Breast Cancer Mouse Model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ninety-five effusion samples were collected from cats with suspected feline infectious peritonitis in northern Taiwan; these samples showed a 47.4% (45/95) feline coronavirus (FCoV) positivity rate on immunofluorescence staining and RT-PCR.

(2020). Firstly, we find that the total return connectedness of the US commodity and financial assets is stronger than that of the Chinese commodity and financial assets in most cases, and both of them increase rapidly after the outbreak of COVID-19. Secondly, gold is a net transmitter of return shocks in both the Chinese and the US markets before the burst of COVID-19 pandemic, while stock and currency become net transmitters of shocks in both markets after that. Thirdly, corn usually receives the shocks from other commodity and financial assets in both China and the US markets during the COVID-19 epidemic, and the shocks it receives peak during this period, making it the strongest net receiver of shocks. Fourthly, crude oil shifts from a net transmitter to a net receiver of shocks in China after the outbreak of COVID-19, but it remains to be a net transmitter of shocks in the US. Finally, bond changes from a net receiver to a net transmitter of shocks in China after the outbreak of the epidemic, but converts from a net transmitter to a net receiver of shock in the US.

PURPOSE This study aimed to demonstrate noninferiority of SYSTANE iLux compared with LipiFlow at 12 months after single treatment in meibomian gland dysfunction subjects with evaporative dry eye. METHODS In this prospective, randomized, multicenter, assessor-masked, parallel-group trial, subjects (N = 236; aged 18 years) with meibomian gland score (MGS) of 12 in lower eyelids, noninvasive tear breakup time (NITBUT; first breakup) of <10 seconds, and Impact of Dry Eye on Everyday Life-Symptom Bother (IDEEL-SB) module score of >16 were randomized (1:1) to receive SYSTANE iLux (n = 119) or LipiFlow (n = 117). Subjects attended a total of eight visits, including screening, treatment, and follow-up visits at 2 weeks and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months/exit, to evaluate change from baseline in MGS, NITBUT, IDEEL-SB module score, and safety outcomes. RESULTS A total of 227 subjects completed the study (mean  standard deviation age, 57.3  13.8 years). At 12 months, least squares mean change from baseline in MGS was similar between iLux and LipiFlow (17.4  1.97 vs. 17.8  1.98). Noninferiority of SYSTANE iLux compared with LipiFlow in change from baseline in MGS (95% lower confidence limit of least squares mean difference, >-5), NITBUT (>-2.5 seconds), and IDEEL-SB score (95% upper confidence limit, <12) was achieved at all post-treatment visits.

This study analysed untargeted metabolomics combined with proteomics of serum from patients with sepsis to reveal the underlying pathological mechanisms involved in sepsis. METHODS: A total of 63 patients with sepsis and 43 normal controls were enrolled from a prospective multicentre cohort. The biological functions of the metabolome were assessed by coexpression network analysis. A molecular network based on metabolomics and proteomics data was constructed to investigate the key molecules. RESULTS: Untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed widespread dysregulation of amino acid metabolism, which regulates inflammation and immunity, in patients with sepsis. Seventy-three differentially expressed metabolites (|log(2) fold change| > 1.5, adjusted P value < 0.05 and variable importance in the projection (VIP) > 1.5) that could predict sepsis were identified. External validation of the hub metabolites was consistent with the derivation results (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC): 0.81C0.96/0.62C1.00). The pentose phosphate pathway was found to be related to sepsis-associated encephalopathy. Phenylalanine metabolism was associated with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury. The key molecular alterations of the multiomics network in sepsis compared to normal controls implicate acute inflammatory response, platelet degranulation, myeloid cell activation involved in immune response and phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, and arginine biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Integrated analysis of untargeted metabolomics and proteomics revealed characteristic metabolite and protein alterations in sepsis, which were mainly involved in inflammation-related pathways and amino acid metabolism.

Here we report on the humoral memory response in a cohort of 87 individuals assessed at 1.3 and 6.2 months after infection. We find that IgM, and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody titres decrease significantly with IgA being less affected. Concurrently, neutralizing activity in plasma decreases by fivefold in pseudotype virus assays. In contrast, the number of RBD-specific memory B cells is unchanged. Memory B cells display clonal turnover after 6.2 months, and the antibodies they express have greater somatic hypermutation, increased potency and resistance to RBD mutations, indicative of continued evolution of the humoral response.

It evaluates the trends between 2001 and 2019 in all airports in Europe using OAG supply information (seats by carrier). Results show two different phases of LCC rise in Europe, 2001 to 2008 and 2009 to 2019, marked by the effects of the financial crisis of the Great Recession. The analysis highlights the role that LCCs have played in boosting the growth of both primary and secondary airports.

In light of our review, we developed a summary of correspondences and problems linked to compound disasters involving conjunctions of outbreaks/endemics and natural disasters that could offer insights for developing measures to deal with natural disasters that occur in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We subsequently attempted to differentiate the characteristics of evacuation measures relating to COVID-19 from those relating to other infectious diseases using three sets of extracted keywords: (1) surveillance and information sharing, (2) evacuation center environment and stockpiled supplies, and (3) community disaster risk reduction and community leadership. We identified issues relating to evacuation measures that would need to be explored further to improve disaster management and preparedness in the future.","output":"Implementation of evacuation measures during natural disasters under conditions of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic based on a review of previous responses to complex disasters in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We provide quantitative predictions of first-order supply and demand shocks for the US economy associated with the COVID-19 pandemic at the level of individual occupations and industries. To analyse the supply shock, we classify industries as essential or non-essential and construct a Remote Labour Index, which measures the ability of different occupations to work from home. Demand shocks are based on a study of the likely effect of a severe influenza epidemic developed by the US Congressional Budget Office. Compared to the pre-COVID period, these shocks would threaten around 20 per cent of the US economys GDP, jeopardize 23 per cent of jobs, and reduce total wage income by 16 per cent. At the industry level, sectors such as transport are likely to be output-constrained by demand shocks, while sectors relating to manufacturing, mining, and services are more likely to be constrained by supply shocks. Entertainment, restaurants, and tourism face large supply and demand shocks. At the occupation level, we show that high-wage occupations are relatively immune from adverse supply- and demand-side shocks, while low-wage occupations are much more vulnerable. We should emphasize that our results are only first-order shockswe expect them to be substantially amplified by feedback effects in the production network.","output":"Supply and demand shocks in the COVID-19 pandemic: an industry and occupation perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cellular and tissue-level edema is a common feature of acute viral infections, including covid-19. However, there is little understanding of the effects of tissue edema on antiviral effector mechanisms. In as much as defects in IFN- function (such as due to presence of autoantibodies) are now implicated in enhanced severity of covid-19 disease, we investigated how hypoosmolarity and cellular edema might affect the antiviral activity of IFN--induced human MxA GTPase, a major antiviral effector against several RNA and DNA viruses. We had previously discovered that cytoplasmic human MxA existed in the cytoplasm in phase-separated membraneless biomolecular condensates with a gel-like internal consistency. The vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) nucleocapsid (N) protein associated with such MxA condensates in cells exhibiting an antiviral phenotype. Unexpectedly, MxA condensates displayed rapid and reversible osmosensing properties. Condensates of both IFN--induced endogenous MxA and of exogenous GFP-MxA expressed in human A549 lung and Huh7 hepatoma cells rapidly disassembled within 1-2 min when cells were exposed to hypotonic buffer (approx. 50 mOsm), and rapidly reassembled into new structures within 1-2 min of shifting of cells to isotonic culture medium (approx. 330 mOsm). GFP-MxA condensates in cells continuously exposed to culture medium in the range one-fourth, one-third or one-half isotonicity first rapidly disassembled within 1-2 min, and then, in most cells. spontaneously reassembled 7-15 min later into new structures. The data are consistent with cytoplasmic \\"crowding\\" as the mechanism driving MxA condensate formation. In terms of antiviral function, one 5 min cycle of disassembly and reassembly of GFP-MxA condensates at 1 or 2 hr after VSV infection did not affect MxA antiviral activity. Additionally, continuous exposure of GFP-MxA expressing A549 lung cells to culture medium at one-fourth or one-third tonicity (thus triggering a cycle of disassembly and slower spontaneous reassembly in the continued presence of hypotonic culture medium) together with a VSV challenge, left antiviral activity largely unaffected. Such cultures showed an increase in number of cells with VSV N colocalized with the reassembled GFP-MxA condensates. The data reveal a novel property of MxA biomolecular condensates - rapid and reversible osmosensing. Importantly, antiviral activity was largely unaffected by tonicity-driven disassembly/reassembly mimicking conditions of cellular and tissue-level edema.","output":"Osmosensing by cytoplasmic biomolecular condensates of antiviral MxA GTPase."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microfluidic- and nanofluidics-based nucleic acid sensing and analysis have become of interest to the public, especially during the current COVID pandemic.

We test predictions derived from this theory using longitudinal data from a UK sample on widely-used measures of the two dimensions C right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO), respectively. Consistent with the theory, RWA but not SDO significantly increased following the pandemic, and worry about COVID-19 predicts this effect. Moreover, consistent with the theory, higher RWA predicts more worried and conformist/norm-enforcing responses, while lower SDO predicts more cooperative/empathic responses.

Few studies have evaluated COVID-19-related racial/ethnic disparities in radiology. PURPOSE: To evaluate whether Non-White minority patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection presented with increased severity on admission CXR compared with White/Non-Hispanic patients. METHODS: Single-institution, retrospective cohort study approved by the IRB. Patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection (3/27/20-4/10/20) were identified using the electronic medical record (EMR) (n=326, mean age: 59 years (SD: 17 years), M:F (188:138). Primary outcome was severity of lung disease on admission CXR, measured by modified Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (mRALE) score. Secondary outcome was a composite adverse clinical outcome of intubation, ICU admission, or death. Primary exposure was racial/ethnic category: White/Non-Hispanic versus Non-White [i.e., Hispanic, Black, Asian, Other]. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between mRALE scores and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Non-White patients had significantly higher mRALE scores (median 6.1, 95% CI 5.4C6.7) compared with White/Non-Hispanic patients (median 4.2, 95% CI 3.6C4.9) (unadjusted average difference 1.8, 95% CI 0.9C2.8, p<0.01). For both White (Adjusted HR, 1.3, 95%CI 1.2-1.4, p<0.001) and Non-White patients (Adjusted HR 1.2, 95%CI 1.1-1.3, p<0.001), increasing mRALE scores were associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing composite adverse outcome with no evidence of interaction (p = 0.16). Multivariable linear regression analyses demonstrated that Non-White patients presented with higher mRALE scores on admission CXR versus White/Non-Hispanic patients (adjusted average difference 1.6, 95% CI 0.5C2.7, p<0.01). Adjustment for hypothesized mediators revealed that the association between race/ethnicity and mRALE scores was mediated by limited English proficiency (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Non-White patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection were more likely to present with higher severity of disease on admission CXR than White/Non-Hispanic patients, and increased severity was associated with worse outcomes for all patients.","output":"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Disease Severity on Admission Chest Radiographs among Patients Admitted with Confirmed COVID-19: A Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging viral disease and dromedary camels are known to be the source of human spill over events.

We conducted nine interviews, surveyed 23 employees and analyzed a hackathon demo. We found that hackathons provide both individual and organizational benefits of innovation, personal interests, and acquiring new skills and competences. Several challenges such as added stress due to stopping the regular work, employees fearing not having enough contribution to deliver and potential mismatch between individual and organizational goals were also found.

In the first wave of the pandemic in many countries, 30-70% of all deaths from or with SARS-CoV-2 were LTCF residents, although their proportion in the population is typically less than 1%. Findings from LTCFs in Frankfurt am Main (March 2020-September 2021) are presented below and discussed in terms of necessary improvements. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The reports of positive PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 in residents and staff of the LTCF in Frankfurt am Main and their symptoms were descriptively evaluated. In addition, the total deaths in nursing homes from 2018 to June 2021 were surveyed per quarter. RESULTS: In the first pandemic wave (March-May 2020), 111 SARS-CoV-2-positive LTCF residents were reported to the Public Health Department in Frankfurt am Main, of whom 40% were asymptomatic, 48% were hospitalized, and 23% died. In the subsequent pandemic phases through September 30, 2021, additional 1196 residents infected with SARS-CoV-2 were reported, with most of them being asymptomatic (70%); they were hospitalized less frequently (27%). Mortality was also lower (17.6%). Overall mortality in LTCF was 7.6% higher in 2020 than in 2019 and 1.1% higher than in the \\"flu year\\" of 2018. DISCUSSION: In contrast to the first wave, when only a few LTCF residents contracted COVID-19, in the second pandemic wave in autumn/winter 2020/21, with high incidences in the general population, SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in LTCF in Frankfurt could not be prevented, despite extensive hygiene, infection prevention, and contact mitigation measures (including visitor restrictions) that massively limited residents' quality of life and their personal rights. Only when vaccination rates increased among residents and staff from April 2021 onwards, there were no massive outbreaks. To better protect LTCF residents, an appropriate balance was called for between protecting against infection and avoiding collateral damage by maintaining the freedom and quality of life of nursing home residents as best as possible.","output":"[The SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic in Long-Term Care Facilities for the Elderly: Analysis of Data from Frankfurt am Main, Germany, March 2020 - September 2021]./ Die SARS-CoV-2-Pandemie in Altenpflegeheimen: Erkenntnisse und Analysen in Frankfurt am Main von M?rz 2020 bis September 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to analyze the interactions of both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine with SARS-CoV-2 and identify their possible role for the prevention/treatment of COVID-19 by molecular docking studies.

We report the prevalence of early recanalization in patients with stroke because of large vessel occlusion treated with and without intravenous alteplase and endovascular thrombectomy, and its association with clinical outcome. METHODS Patients with acute ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion from the ESCAPE trial (Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Anterior Circulation Proximal Occlusion With Emphasis on Minimizing CT to Recanalization Times Trial) were included in this post hoc analysis. Outcomes of interest were the prevalence of early recanalization (1) and good outcome (2), defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 at 90 days. RESULTS Among 147 patients who did not receive endovascular thrombectomy, early recanalization occurred in 4/30 (13.3%) patients without and 48/117 (41.0%) patients with intravenous alteplase (adjusted risk ratios, 3.2 [95% CI, 1.2-8.1]).

MethodsWe prospectively evaluated the Institutional Covid Vaccination Database to categorize the SARS-CoV-2 positive healthcare workers into 2 cohorts: infected vaccinated and infected unvaccinated cohort. Along with comparing the descriptive statistics of the cohorts, the relative risk (RR), relative risk reduction (RRR), and the vaccine effectiveness were calculated.

ResultsOut of the 324 healthcare workers employed in our institution 243 (75%) were vaccinated. When 6.58% (16) of the vaccinated healthcare workers were tested positive, 43.75% (35) were infected in the unvaccinated cohort and the median time of infection in the vaccinated cohort was 65 days (range 20 -91 days). While the cox proportionality model reveals that the age, sex, and the contact exposure status of the cohort are not significant factors for getting infected after being vaccinated, binary logistic regression proves that a significant relationship exists between the incidence of infection and the unvaccinated status (p = 0.001, OR = 4.278).

This positive outcome of pandemic has given the indication that the future of energy belong to green energy and one of the emerging source of green energy is Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). LIBs are the backbone of the electric vehicles but there are some major issues faced by the them like poor thermal performance, thermal runaway, fire hazards and faster rate of discharge under low and high temperature environment,. Therefore to overcome these problems most of the researchers have come up with new methods of controlling and maintaining the overall thermal performance of the LIBs. The present review paper mainly is focused on optimization of thermal and structural design parameters of the LIBs under different BTMSs. The optimized BTMS generally demonstrated in this paper are maximum temperature of battery cell, battery pack or battery module, temperature uniformity, maximum or average temperature difference, inlet temperature of coolant, flow velocity, and pressure drop. Whereas the major structural design optimization parameters highlighted in this paper are type of flow channel, number of channels, length of channel, diameter of channel, cell to cell spacing, inlet and outlet plenum angle and arrangement of channels. These optimized parameters investigated under different BTMS heads such as air, PCM (phase change material), mini-channel, heat pipe, and water cooling are reported profoundly in this review article. The data are categorized and the results of the recent studies are summarized for each method. Critical review on use of various optimization algorithms (like ant colony, genetic, particle swarm, response surface, NSGA-II, etc.) for design parameter optimization are presented and categorized for different BTMS to boost their objectives. The single objective optimization techniques helps in obtaining the optimal value of important design parameters related to the thermal performance of battery cooling systems. Finally, multi-objective optimization technique is also discussed to get an idea of how to get the trade-off between the various conflicting parameters of interest such as energy, cost, pressure drop, size, arrangement, etc. which is related to minimization and thermal efficiency/performance of the battery system related to maximization.

Within this scope, several competition authorities and jurisdictions have adopted remote working models, and made the necessary infrastructure functional. In this regard, it is noteworthy that oral hearing meetings held before competition authorities have started to be conducted remotely via different communication tools. In terms of the adaptation to the ongoing pandemic in Turkey, it is observed that the Turkish Competition Authority has begun to conduct online oral hearings, which were delayed for a long time. However, the lack of any legal basis for conducting online oral hearings brings some legal questions with it. Although the domestic law that allows online trials to be held within the meaning of criminal, civil and administrative procedures has been in place for some time, the compatibility of these trials with the judicial principles is open to discussion. In this respect, the first part of this study explains the legal basis of oral hearings conducted before the Turkish Competition Authority. Following the explanations on online oral hearings within the scope of the principles of direct evaluation, right to a fair trial and publicity, which prevail in criminal procedure, the legal basis regulated by different domestic laws of procedures will be put forward. Finally, online oral hearings conducted before the Turkish Competition Authority will be assessed in consideration of the above-mentioned explanations.","output":"Legal Assessment of Online Oral Hearings in Competition Law"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Prioritizing patients in need of intensive care is necessary to reduce the mortality rate during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although several scoring methods have been introduced, many require laboratory or radiographic findings that are not always easily available. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop a machine learning model that predicts the need for intensive care for patients with COVID-19 using easily obtainable characteristics-baseline demographics, comorbidities, and symptoms. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed using a nationwide cohort in South Korea. Patients admitted to 100 hospitals from January 25, 2020, to June 3, 2020, were included. Patient information was collected retrospectively by the attending physicians in each hospital and uploaded to an online case report form. Variables that could be easily provided were extracted. The variables were age, sex, smoking history, body temperature, comorbidities, activities of daily living, and symptoms. The primary outcome was the need for intensive care, defined as admission to the intensive care unit, use of extracorporeal life support, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, or death within 30 days of hospitalization. Patients admitted until March 20, 2020, were included in the derivation group to develop prediction models using an automated machine learning technique. The models were externally validated in patients admitted after March 21, 2020. The machine learning model with the best discrimination performance was selected and compared against the CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and 65 years of age or older) score using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: A total of 4787 patients were included in the analysis, of which 3294 were assigned to the derivation group and 1493 to the validation group. Among the 4787 patients, 460 (9.6%) patients needed intensive care. Of the 55 machine learning models developed, the XGBoost model revealed the highest discrimination performance. The AUC of the XGBoost model was 0.897 (95% CI 0.877-0.917) for the derivation group and 0.885 (95% CI 0.855-0.915) for the validation group. Both the AUCs were superior to those of CURB-65, which were 0.836 (95% CI 0.825-0.847) and 0.843 (95% CI 0.829-0.857), respectively.

Indeed, small RNA-mediated silencing or RNA interference (RNAi) is one of the earliest forms of antiviral immunity. Although it represents the main defense system against viruses in many organisms, the antiviral role of RNAi has not been clearly proven in higher vertebrates. However, it is well established that their response to viral infection relies on the recognition of viral RNAs by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to trigger activation of the interferon pathway. In the present work, we report the existence of a novel small noncoding RNA population produced in mammalian cells upon RNA virus infection. Using Sindbis virus (SINV) as a prototypic arbovirus model, we profiled the small RNA population of infected cells in both human and African green monkey cell lines. Here, we provide evidence for the presence of discrete small RNAs of viral origin that are not associated with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), that are highly expressed and detected by Northern blot analysis, and that accumulate as 21- to 28-nucleotide (nt) species during infection. We report that the cellular antiviral endoribonuclease RNase L cleaves the viral genome, producing in turn the small RNAs. Surprisingly, we uncovered the presence of a modification on the 3-end nucleotide of SINV-derived viral small RNAs (SvsRNAs) that might be at the origin of their stability. Altogether, our findings show that stable modified small viral RNAs could represent a novel way to modulate host-virus interaction upon SINV infection.","output":"Identification of RNase L-Dependent, 3-End-Modified, Viral Small RNAs in Sindbis Virus-Infected Mammalian Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This commentary amplifies the insidious nature of the novel coronavirus (resulting in COVID19) and its ubiquitous spread, which disproportionately and adversely affect the health and well-being of people of color The consequence is poor health outcomes and premature death Ample previous literature documents health inequities in the morbidity and mortality statistics for Black and Brown people in the United States Their excess deaths are due to disproportionately high rates of serious health conditions (diabetes;hypertension;asthma;and lung, kidney, and heart disease), as well as structural factors having to do with income, employment, and the built environment in which they live The health conditions are exacerbated with ongoing societal problems and stress emerging from the country's history of dehumanizing racial inequities Current discrimination comes most virulently in the form of systematic and institutionalized racist policies that keep racial and ethnic minorities marginalized and disempowered Furthermore, people of color encounter the immediate external pressures of working away from home and using public transportation during the country's extraordinary ongoing lockdown, heightening the risk of exposure to the virus Moreover, the same population is overrepresented in jails and prisons where social distancing is impossible Any virulent virus without a vaccine is bound to become a human petri dish in which people of color in the U S today are caught The war against the coronavirus for people of color is part and parcel of the war to eliminate historic inequities and to level the socioeconomic playing field This article covers the racial/ethnic inequities in morbidity and mortality from COVID19 and the slow and untimely response by the federal government to address mediation of the spread of the virus For people of color to transcend the coronavirus pandemic crisis there must be comprehensive access to COVID-19 testing and early, sustained, and affordable access to health care, including hospitalization Such access will require national leadership, which seems to be in short supply","output":"The African American Petri Dish"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction/Background*We present a rare case of high-grade poorly differentiated sarcoma.

METHODS: An online non-probability sample survey was used to assess psychological distress symptoms and burnout among perinatal healthcare professionals (PHPs) during the pandemic in Italy. The questionnaire included the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Demographic and occupational factors associated with stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms were analyzed. RESULTS: The sample size was 195. The estimated self-reported rates of moderate to severe anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, and perceived stress levels were 18.7, 18.7, and 21.5%, respectively. Furthermore, 6.2% of respondents reported burnout.

Apart from being studied by legal scholars, the notion of vulnerability has been embodied in concrete legal rules and transferred to national case law allowing courts to set its boundaries by the power of judicial interpretation. Even though it would be hard to contest Schroeder and Gefenas's statement that it is not necessary for an academic to say what vulnerability is because common sense dictates the existence of it, recent scholarly analysis clearly shows that the concept itself has become intolerably vague and slippery. More precisely, it is not quite clear what the essence of vulnerability is and what the effects of its gradation as well as repercussions are on other constitutional institutes across the human rights spectrum. The noted vagueness poses a great concern, particularly in the time of COVID-19, the greatest social stressor that humanity has faced in recent months. The COVID-19 crisis has had untold consequences on our health, mental well-being, educational growth, and economic stability.

Ivermectin treatment showed the highest selectivity index. Combination drug therapy was also evaluated using remdesivir (6 M) together with chloroquine (15 M), ivermectin (2 M) or doxycycline (15 M) C above their IC50 values and at high macrophage cell viability of over 95%. The combination of remdesivir and ivermectin exhibited highly potent synergism by achieving significant reductions of about 7-log(10) of live virus and 2.5-log(10) of viral RNA in infected macrophages. This combination also resulted in the lowest cytokine levels of IL-6, TNF-, and leukemia inhibitory factor. The next best synergistic combination was remdesivir with doxycycline, which decreased levels of live virus by ~3-log(10) and viral RNA by ~1.5-log(10).

DESIGN.C Six SARS-CoV-2 serology assays were utilized to assess 954 samples collected during a 12 months period from 315 COVID-19 convalescents. The tests determined either antibodies against the viral nucleocapsid (anti-NC) or spike protein (anti-S). Two assays did not distinguish between antibody classes whereas the others selectively measured immunoglubulins G (IgG) antibodies. PNT was used to detect the presence of neutralizing antibodies. RESULTS.C Comparison of qualitative results showed only slight to moderate concordance between the assays (Cohen's kappa < 0.57). Significant correlations (P < .001) were observed between the antibody titers from all quantitative assays. However, titer changes were not detected equally.

This assumption is corroborated by reduced mitochondrial fitness in many established risk factors of COVID-19, like age, various chronic diseases or obesity.

We do not know when, who will pay for them, or the logistical aspects (e.g., storage and administration). We do not even know how effective they will be. Moreover, we must plan for mass vaccination in a chaotic and politically charged context that bears little resemblance to the ones with which we have experience. Nevertheless, in this fight, vaccines could be our winning blow. We are getting better at working with unknowns and in disrupted environments during COVID-19. We have some time to prepare, and we have some extant knowledge and experience in vaccine distribution and uptake. Health care teams can use these to best their adversary, and we can and should begin now. The aim of this article is to discuss how to mobilize interprofessional teams within systems of care to engage best practices in vaccine dissemination and uptake in the unique COVID-19 context. We begin by discussing challenges to dissemination and uptake and then provide solutions using our experiences in the primary care system.

The paper concludes by examining the current crisis in which a fragmented professoriate is facing market-driven working conditions, exacerbated by the uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Each mouse was infected percutaneously with 20 S. japonicum cercariae. Hepatic mass index (HMI), liver egg granulomas, hepatic fibrosis biomarkers and serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were investigated. Treg and Th17 frequency was determined by flow cytometry. Expressions of Foxp3, ST2, TGF-1, IL-10, RORt, and IL-17A were measured via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Concentrations of TGF-1, IL-10 and IL-17A were tested with ELISA. In vitro experiments, mRNA expressions of Foxp3, TGF-1, IL-10, Atg5, Beclin-1 and p62 associated with polarization of Treg by recombinant mouse IL-33 (rmIL-33) were detected by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: An increased expression of IL-33/ST2 was shown in S. japonicum-infected mice. Deficiency of IL-33 or ST2 gene led to an aggravated liver pathology, which was evidenced by elevated hepatic granuloma volume, HMI and ALT levels and fibrosis, which was demonstrated by increased hepatic collagen deposition in the infected mice. Injection of rmIL-33 into the infected IL-33(?/?) mice strongly abrogated the liver pathology and fibrosis, whereas no detectable effect with injecting rmIL-33 into the infected ST2(?/?) mice. Furthermore, depletion of the IL-33/ST2 axis inhibited Treg, accompanied by increased Th17. rmIL-33 treatment upregulated Treg and downregulated Th17 in the infected IL-33(?/?) mice, while no effect in the infected ST2(?/?) mice. rmIL-33 led to elevated expressions of Atg5, Beclin-1 and inhibited expression of p62 in expansion of Treg. CONCLUSION: The IL-33/ST2 axis plays a protective role in S. japonicum infected mice, which is closely related to increasing Treg responses as well as suppressing Th17 responses. Expansion of Treg by IL-33 may be associated with its regulation of autophagy.","output":"IL-33/ST2 Axis Deficiency Exacerbates Hepatic Pathology by Regulating Treg and Th17 Cells in Murine Schistosomiasis Japonica"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With advances in library construction protocols and next-generation sequencing technologies, viral metagenomic sequencing has become the major source for novel virus discovery. Conducting taxonomic classification for metagenomic data is an important means to characterize the viral composition in the underlying samples. However, RNA viruses are abundant and highly diverse, jeopardizing the sensitivity of comparison-based classification methods. To improve the sensitivity of read-level taxonomic classification, we developed an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene-based read classification tool RdRpBin. It combines alignment-based strategy with machine learning models in order to fully exploit the sequence properties of RdRp. We tested our method and compared its performance with the state-of-the-art tools on the simulated and real sequencing data. RdRpBin competes favorably with all. In particular, when the query RNA viruses share low sequence similarity with the known viruses ([Formula: see text]), our tool can still maintain a higher F-score than the state-of-the-art tools. The experimental results on real data also showed that RdRpBin can classify more RNA viral reads with a relatively low false-positive rate. Thus, RdRpBin can be utilized to classify novel and diverged RNA viruses.","output":"RdRp-based sensitive taxonomic classification of RNA viruses for metagenomic data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Faced with this critical situation and directly involved in the treatment and care of COVID-19 patients, front-line healthcare workers are at high risk in terms of mental health symptoms. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the stress, anxiety, depression, and insomnia levels of intensive care nurses during the pandemic with a structural equation model. DESIGN: A multi-site survey study. METHODS: The study was performed with 194 nurses working in the intensive care units of five hospitals in Istanbul in July 2020. Data were collected using the Depression Anxiety Stress-21 Scale and Insomnia Severity Index electronically. The data were evaluated with descriptive statistics in SPSS package program. In order to test the structural model and hypotheses of the research, path analysis was performed with LISREL statistical software program. A validation study for the suitability of these scales to the study sample was done by the researchers using the confirmatory factor analysis method. The study conforms to the TREND checklist. RESULTS: In this study, the majority of the intensive care nurses had moderate to extremely severe depression (65.5%), anxiety (58.3%) and stress (72.3%) scores; in addition, 39.7% of the nurses experienced moderate or severe insomnia. Within the framework of a structural model; the effects of stress, anxiety and insomnia on depression, which is the dependent variable, were found to be statistically significant (p < .001).

Main funding source(s): Barts Charity UCLH Charity ONBEHALF: COVIDsortium BACKGROUND: Recent CMR studies have reported cardiac abnormalities after COVID-19 are common, even after mild, non-hospitalised illness with evidence of ongoing myocardial inflammation. Such a prevalence of chronic myocarditis after mild disease has prompted societal concerns in diverse domains, and suggests that screening should be considered post COVID-19, even in asymptomatic individuals. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has proven utility for diagnosis in patients with COVID-19 infection and elevated troponin from unclear causes by measuring cardiac structure, function, myocardial scar (late gadolinium enhancement) and oedema (T1 and T2 mapping). OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the prevalence and extent of late cardiac and cardiovascular sequelae after mild non-hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Participants were recruited from COVIDsortium, a three-hospital prospective study of 731 healthcare workers who underwent first wave weekly symptom, PCR and serology assessment over 4 months, with seroconversion in 21.5% (n = 157). At 6 months post infection, 74 seropositive and 75 age-, sex-, ethnicity-matched seronegative controls were recruited for cardiovascular phenotyping (comprehensive phantom-calibrated Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance and blood biomarkers). Analysis was blinded, using objective AI analytics where available. RESULTS: 149 subjects (mean age 37 years, range 18-63, 58% female) were recruited. Seropositive infections had been mild with case definition/non-case definition/asymptomatic disease in 45(61%), 18(24%) and 11(15%) with one person hospitalised (for 2 days). Between seropositive and seronegative groups, there were no differences in cardiac structure (left ventricular volumes, mass; atrial area), function (ejection fraction, global longitudinal shortening, aortic distensibility), tissue characterisation (T1, T2, ECV mapping, late gadolinium enhancement) or biomarkers (troponin, NT-proBNP). With abnormal defined by the 75 seronegatives (2 standard deviations from mean, e.g. EF < 54%, septal T1 > 1072ms, septal T2 > 52.4ms), individuals had abnormalities including reduced EF (n = 2, minimum 50%), T1 elevation (n = 6), T2 elevation (n = 9), LGE (n = 13, median 1%, max 5% of myocardium), biomarker elevation (borderline troponin elevation in 4; all NT-proBNP normal). These were distributed equally between seropositive and seronegative individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular abnormalities are no more common in seropositive vs seronegative otherwise healthy, workforce representative individuals 6 months post mild SARS-CoV-2 infection.

However, whether and how such models might be implemented and useful in clinical practice remain unknown. To ultimately make automated suicide riskCprediction models useful in practice, and thus better prevent patient suicides, it is critical to partner with key stakeholders, including the frontline providers who will be using such tools, at each stage of the implementation process. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this focus group study is to inform ongoing and future efforts to deploy suicide riskCprediction models in clinical practice. The specific goals are to better understand hospital providers current practices for assessing and managing suicide risk; determine providers perspectives on using automated suicide riskCprediction models in practice; and identify barriers, facilitators, recommendations, and factors to consider. METHODS: We conducted 10 two-hour focus groups with a total of 40 providers from psychiatry, internal medicine and primary care, emergency medicine, and obstetrics and gynecology departments within an urban academic medical center. Audio recordings of open-ended group discussions were transcribed and coded for relevant and recurrent themes by 2 independent study staff members. All coded text was reviewed and discrepancies were resolved in consensus meetings with doctoral-level staff. RESULTS: Although most providers reported using standardized suicide risk assessment tools in their clinical practices, existing tools were commonly described as unhelpful and providers indicated dissatisfaction with current suicide risk assessment methods. Overall, providers general attitudes toward the practical use of automated suicide riskCprediction models and corresponding clinical decision support tools were positive. Providers were especially interested in the potential to identify high-risk patients who might be missed by traditional screening methods. Some expressed skepticism about the potential usefulness of these models in routine care; specific barriers included concerns about liability, alert fatigue, and increased demand on the health care system. Key facilitators included presenting specific patient-level features contributing to risk scores, emphasizing changes in risk over time, and developing systematic clinical workflows and provider training. Participants also recommended considering risk-prediction windows, timing of alerts, who will have access to model predictions, and variability across treatment settings. CONCLUSIONS: Providers were dissatisfied with current suicide risk assessment methods and were open to the use of a machine learningCbased risk-prediction system to inform clinical decision-making. They also raised multiple concerns about potential barriers to the usefulness of this approach and suggested several possible facilitators. Future efforts in this area will benefit from incorporating systematic qualitative feedback from providers, patients, administrators, and payers on the use of these new approaches in routine care, especially given the complex, sensitive, and unfortunately still stigmatized nature of suicide risk.","output":"Implementing Machine Learning Models for Suicide Risk Prediction in Clinical Practice: Focus Group Study With Hospital Providers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The scope of this research endeavor was the determination of the applicability of over the counter mouthwash solutions in reducing the viral load in the saliva of COVID-19 patients and hence decreasing their infectivity. Beyond that, new experimental mouthwashes were investigated in terms of a possible positive immune modulation, which might offer an additional opportunity for a positive pharmaceutical effect. METHODS: The effectivity of the mouth washing solution was determined on 34 hospitalized COVID-19 patients by measuring the viral load by RT-qPCR in pharyngeal swabs, which were taken before and after rinsing. The inflammatory modulation thru the experimental solutions was assayed in an in vitro model of virus infected nasopharyngeal epithelium cells. RESULTS: The clinical pilot study demonstrated that the mouth rinsing solution was able to reduce the viral load by about 90% in the saliva of most patients. This reduction was determined to persist for about 6 h. In the experimental solutions, the ingredients dexpanthenol and zinc were able to reduce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the cell culture model, while the antiviral response was not altered significantly. CONCLUSION: We recommend the application of mouth wash solutions to COVID-19 patients, since our results indicate a reduction in infectivity and might govern the protection of health care professionals.

The synergism also occurred when the cells were treated with IFN  and a viral replication mimicker (dsRNA) both in vitro and in vivo. Despite the requirement of type I interferon (IFNAR) signaling in dsRNA-induced CXCL10, the synergism was independent of the IFNAR pathway since it wasnt affected by the addition of a neutralizing IFNAR antibody or the complete lack of IFNAR expression. Furthermore, the same synergistic effect was also observed when a CXCL10 promoter reporter was examined. Although the responsive promoter region contains both ISRE and NFB sites, western blot analysis indicated that the combined treatment of IFN  and dsRNA significantly augmented NFB but not STAT1 activation as compared to the single treatment. Therefore, we conclude that IFN  and dsRNA act in concert to potentiate CXCL10 expression in airway epithelial cells via an NFB-dependent but IFNAR-STAT independent pathway and it is at least partly regulated at the transcriptional level.","output":"Synergistic Up-Regulation of CXCL10 by Virus and IFN  in Human Airway Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE As COVID-19 is a new emerging disease, the hematological/immunological changes that develop in the infected patients remain unknown.

Afterwards, information such as patients' history, presentations, paraclinical data, treatment course and outcome were extracted from the records. RESULTS A total of 58 documents were considered to be eligible for data extraction which described 94 patients with COVID-19 who developed hematologic autoimmune disorder in their course of infection. Of these patients with COVID-19, the most common hematologic autoimmune disorder was immune thrombocytopenic purpura (55 cases) followed by autoimmune hemolytic anemia (22 cases).

Five one-step reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays, targeting the polymerase (IP2 and IP4), the envelope (E), and the nucleoprotein (N1 and N2) genome regions, were employed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection in 24-h composite wastewater samples concentrated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a sewage sample collected 41 days ahead of the declaration of the first COVID-19 case.

For the latter objective, a model was applied for the estimation of the total number of shedders, evidencing a high proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals. In this way, an infection prevalence of 2.0 to 6.5% was figured. On the other hand, proportions of around 0.12% and 0.09% of the total population were determined to be required for positive detection in the two WWTPs. At the end of the lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 RNA apparently disappeared in the WWTPs but could still be detected in grab samples from four urban sewers.

In addition, SARS-CoV-2 occurrence in wastewater evidenced the efficacy of the adopted lockdown measures on the circulation of the virus. Health authorities profited from WBE to complement other inputs and adopt rapid and adequate measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. For example, sentinel surveillance of specific sewers helped to locate COVID-19 hot spots and to conduct massive numbers of RT-PCR tests among the population.","output":"Time Evolution of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wastewater during the First Pandemic Wave of COVID-19 in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a case of lophomoniasis in a kidney post\\\\transplantation patient.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the accuracy of machine learningCbased facial and vocal measurements acquired through automated assessments conducted remotely through smartphones. METHODS: Measurements of facial and vocal characteristics including facial expressivity, vocal acoustics, and speech prevalence were assessed in 20 patients with schizophrenia over the course of 2 weeks in response to two classes of prompts previously utilized in experimental laboratory assessments: evoked prompts, where subjects are guided to produce specific facial expressions and speech; and spontaneous prompts, where subjects are presented stimuli in the form of emotionally evocative imagery and asked to freely respond. Facial and vocal measurements were assessed in relation to schizophrenia symptom severity using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. RESULTS: Vocal markers including speech prevalence, vocal jitter, fundamental frequency, and vocal intensity demonstrated specificity as markers of negative symptom severity, while measurement of facial expressivity demonstrated itself as a robust marker of overall schizophrenia symptom severity.

Although many vaccines were found to be highly effective against the reference COVID-19 strain, the same level of protection may not be found against mutation strains. The objective of this study is to systematically review relevant studies in the literature and compare the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines against new variants. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of research published in Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar until 30 August 2021. Studies including clinical trials, prospective cohorts, retrospective cohorts, and test negative case-controls that reported vaccine effectiveness against any COVID-19 variants were considered. PRISMA recommendations were adopted for screening, eligibility, and inclusion. Results: 129 unique studies were reviewed by the search criteria, of which 35 met the inclusion criteria. These comprised of 13 test negative case-control studies, 6 Phase 1C3 clinical trials, and 16 observational studies. The study location, type, vaccines used, variants considered, and reported efficacies were highlighted. Conclusion: Full vaccination (two doses) offers strong protection against Alpha (B.1.1.7) with 13 out of 15 studies reporting more than 84% efficacy. The results are not conclusive against the Beta (B.1.351) variant for fully vaccinated individuals with 4 out of 7 studies reporting efficacies between 22 and 60% and 3 out of 7 studies reporting efficacies between 75 and 100%.

METHODS: A multicentre observational study was performed from 22 February through 30 June 2020. We included consecutive adult patients with severe COVID-19, defined as respiratory rate &#8805;30 breath per minute, oxygen saturation &#8804;93% on ambient air or arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen &#8804;300 mm Hg. We excluded patients being treated with other immunomodulant drugs, receiving low-dose corticosteroids and receiving corticosteroids 72 hours after admission. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality from hospital admission. The main exposure variable was corticosteroid therapy at a dose of &#8805;0.5 mg/kg of prednisone equivalents. It was introduced as binomial covariate in a logistic regression model for the primary endpoint and inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score. RESULTS: Of 1717 patients with COVID-19 evaluated, 513 were included in the study, and of these, 170 (33%) were treated with corticosteroids. During hospitalization, 166 patients (34%) met the criteria of the primary outcome (60/170, 35% in the corticosteroid group and 106/343, 31% in the noncorticosteroid group). At multivariable analysis corticosteroid treatment was not associated with lower 30-day mortality rate (adjusted odds ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.20-1.74; p 0.33). After inverse probability of treatment weighting, corticosteroids were not associated with lower 30-day mortality (average treatment effect, 0.05; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.09; p 0.12).

Mortality scales can aid frontline providers in low-resource settings (LRS) in identifying those at greatest risk of death so that limited resources can be directed towards those in greatest need and unnecessary loss of life is prevented. While many prognostication tools have been developed for, or applied to, COVID-19 patients, no tools to date have been purpose-designed for, and validated in, LRS. Objectives: This study aimed to develop a pragmatic tool to assist LRS frontline providers in evaluating in-hospital mortality risk using only easy-to-obtain demographic and clinical inputs. Methods: Machine learning was used on data from a retrospective cohort of Sudanese COVID-19 patients at two government referral hospitals to derive contextually appropriate mortality indices for COVID-19, which were then assessed by C-indices. Findings: Data from 467 patients were used to derive two versions of the AFEM COVID-19 Mortality Scale (AFEM-CMS), which evaluates in-hospital mortality risk using demographic and clinical inputs that are readily obtainable in hospital receiving areas. Both versions of the tool include age, sex, number of comorbidities, Glasgow Coma Scale, respiratory rate, and systolic blood pressure; in settings with pulse oximetry, oxygen saturation is included and in settings without access, heart rate is included. The AFEM-CMS showed good discrimination: the model including pulse oximetry had a C-statistic of 0.775 (95% CI: 0.737-0.813) and the model excluding it had a C-statistic of 0.719 (95% CI: 0.678-0.760). Conclusions: In the face of an enduring pandemic in many LRS, the AFEM-CMS serves as a practical solution to aid frontline providers in effectively allocating healthcare resources. The tool's generalisability is likely narrow outside of similar extremely LRS settings, and further validation studies are essential prior to broader use.","output":"Derivation of a Contextually-Appropriate COVID-19 Mortality Scale for Low-Resource Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between leaders' expressed traits and their impact on their country's COVID-19 outcomes Some leaders are over relying on masculine traits and dismissing feminine traits An alternative - androgynous leadership - supports leaders in drawing from the full portfolio of behaviors Design/methodology/approach This paper has a theoretical approach using an extensive review of the literature Findings Leaders can take a number of actions to fully embrace androgynous leadership These actions include building a diverse \\"tempered\\" team, communicating with respect, recognizing the impact of framing and moving from autopilot to realizing their best androgynous self Research limitations/implications Research limitations include a critique of Bem's framework as outdated and dichotomous;a categorization of feminine, masculine and neutral behaviors that is determined by the authors;and a focus on leadership style that does not take other dimensions, such as health-care systems, into account Practical implications The authors propose that an \\"androgynous\\" leadership style has been used effectively by some political leaders around the globe in the COVID-19 crisis The COVID-19 context has provided a laboratory for developing and building competence as androgynous leaders Social implications The mental capacity to look at a situation, pause and explicitly select effective behavior is necessary, but oftentimes, it is not put into practice By not drawing from a larger portfolio of androgynous behaviors, the opportunity for leaders to their best work is missed Originality/value There is an acknowledgement of the benefits of the combination of masculine and feminine leadership traits There are also clear recommendations supporting leaders in developing their androgynous leadership skills","output":"Feminine?

The primary objectives of this study were to determine individual participant data sharing plans reported in recently registered clinical trial registration records, how data sharing commitment relates to clinical trial characteristics, and principal investigators' attitudes, motivations and barriers to data sharing. The secondary objective was to derive recommendations to overcome identified barriers to data sharing. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study of all interventional trials registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) from 1 December 2018 to 30 November 2019, and an online cross-sectional survey of their principal investigators. RESULTS In the cohort study of all clinical trials registered on the ANZCTR in the study period (n=1517), commitment to share data was low (22%, 329/1517). In the cross-sectional survey (n=281, 23% response rate), principal investigators showed strong support for the concept of data sharing (77%, 216/281) but a substantially lower intention to actually share data from their clinical trials (40%, 111/281). Major barriers to data sharing included lacking informed consent to share data, protecting participant confidentiality, and preventing misinterpretation of data or misleading secondary analyses.

Acute HF was sub-classified as \\"de novo\\" vs. \\"acute-on-chronic\\" based on the absence or presence of prior HF. Clinical features, biomarker profiles, and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: Among 901 COVID-19 ICU admissions, 80 (8.9%) had acute HF, including 18 (2.0%) with classic cardiogenic shock (CS) and 37 (4.1%) with vasodilatory CS.

We undertook a scoping review to evaluate the extent of CWR uptake in oncology, and barriers and facilitators to implementation. Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, Emcare Nursing and Scopus was conducted for articles published between 2012 and March 6, 2020 pertaining to cancer-specific CWR. Articles were excluded if they did not report on cancer-specific recommendations, were commentaries/opinions, reported on screening or prevention, focused on pediatric populations, or were not in English. Retained articles were thematically grouped based on study objective. Implementation strategies, barriers and facilitators were summarized for articles implementing a recommendation into practice. Results: The search yielded 8565 articles;98 articles were retained, addressing 32 unique recommendations. Use of active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer (14/98) and reduction of imaging in early breast cancer (13/98) were the most commonly evaluated CWR. Of the 29 articles reporting on pre-post CW campaign adherence, 20 reported improved compliance without further intervention. In articles evaluating factors associated with CWRconcordance (62/98), age (23/62), stage or risk (22/62), and geographic location (21/62) most commonly influenced care decisions. Few articles described the development of interventions to improve concordance (1/98) or a protocol to evaluate implementation (2/98) with no further testing of their design. Of the 10/98 articles that evaluated implementation of a CWR, all reported improved compliance (range: 3-73% improvement). Implementation strategies were used in combination and most often included provider education (8/10), stakeholder engagement (6/10), and forced function (4/10). Preconceived views and reluctance to adopt new practices were the most commonly reported barriers to implementation;the use of technology to update practice and the use of education and evidence to build provider buy-in were the most common facilitators. Conclusions: In the eight years since the initial publication of oncologyspecific CW recommendations, uptake has been limited. Publication of the recommendations has resulted in some passive improvements in care. Further adoption of CWR likely requires an implementation strategy that includes building stakeholder buy-in, and utilization of updated order sets and forced functions in technology to facilitate change.

The purpose of this review is to advance the understanding of how grandfamilies have been impacted by the opioid epidemic by using a systemic perspective to highlight themes and major conclusions within the existing conceptual and empirical literature. The review reveals five systemically informed themes including the assumption of caregiving responsibilities, grandparent stress and well-being, caring for vulnerable grandchildren, navigating relationships with parents, and contextual stressors of societal stigma and barriers to service.

The risk in middle\\\\income countries where the distributions of age groups and preexisting conditions may differ is less known. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether pregnant women with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection are at increased risk for severe COVID\\\\19 compared to nonpregnant women in Colombia. METHODS: We analysed national surveillance data from Colombia, of women aged 15C44 years with laboratory\\\\confirmed infection with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 by molecular or antigen testing, from 6 March 2020 to 12 December 2020. An enhanced follow\\\\up of pregnant women with COVID\\\\19 was established to monitor pregnancy and birth outcomes. RESULTS: Of 371,363 women aged 15C44 years with laboratory\\\\confirmed SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection, 1.5% (n = 5614) were reported as pregnant; among those, 2610 (46.5%) were considered a complete pregnancy for reporting purposes at the time of analysis. Hospitalisation (23.9%) and death (1.3%) occurred more frequently among pregnant symptomatic women compared to nonpregnant symptomatic women (2.9% and 0.3%, respectively). Compared to nonpregnant symptomatic women, pregnant symptomatic women were at increased risk of hospitalisation (adjusted risk ratio (RR) 2.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.07, 2.32) and death (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.60, 2.07), after adjusting for age, type of health insurance and presence of certain underlying medical conditions. Among complete pregnancies, 55 (2.1%) were pregnancy losses, 72 (2.8%) resulted in term low birthweight infants and 375 (14.4%) were preterm deliveries. CONCLUSIONS: Although pregnant women were infrequently reported with laboratory\\\\confirmed SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection, pregnant symptomatic women with COVID\\\\19 were at increased risk for hospitalisation and death compared to nonpregnant symptomatic women. Almost all infections we reported on were third\\\\trimester infections; ongoing follow\\\\up is needed to determine pregnancy outcomes among women infected earlier in pregnancy.

This paper thus sought to determine whether RA could improve baseline barrier function and attenuate TNF--induced barrier leak in the human bronchial epithelial cell culture model, 16HBE14o- (16HBE). We show for the first time that RA increases baseline barrier function of these cell layers indicated by an 89% increase in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and 22% decrease in (14)C-mannitol flux. A simultaneous, RA-induced 70% increase in claudin-4 attests to RA affecting the tight junctional (TJ) complex itself. RA was also effective in alleviating TNF--induced 16HBE barrier leak, attenuating 60% of the TNF--induced leak to (14)C-mannitol and 80% of the leak to (14)C-inulin. Interleukin-6-induced barrier leak was also reduced by RA. Treatment of 16HBE cell layers with TNF- resulted in dramatic decrease in immunostaining for occludin and claudin-4, as well as a downward band-shift in occludin Western immunoblots. The presence of RA partially reversed TNF-s effects on these select TJ proteins. Lastly, RA completely abrogated the TNF--induced increase in ERK-1,2 phosphorylation without significantly decreasing the TNF-driven increase in total ERK-1,2. This study suggests RA could be effective as a prophylactic agent in minimizing airway barrier leak and as a therapeutic in preventing leak triggered by inflammatory cascades. Given the growing literature suggesting a cytokine storm may be related to COVID-19 morbidity, RA may be a useful adjuvant for use with anti-viral therapies.","output":"Retinoic acid improves baseline barrier function and attenuates TNF--induced barrier leak in human bronchial epithelial cell culture model, 16HBE 14o-"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an evolving global health crisis. Despite recent efforts, there are numerous notable gaps in the understanding of MERS-CoV seasonal diversity. We aimed at investigating the global seasonal occurrence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreaks. MATERIALS AND METHODS We obtained the data on the prevalence and occurrence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection from the World Health Organization (WHO) for all the MERS cases reported from the various countries and their allied ministries. We also recorded the research documents published in various global scientific journals on the seasonal occurrence of MERS-CoV infection during the period 2012-2017. RESULTS Worldwide 2048 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported from June 2012 to the Dec 2017. 1680 (82.03%) cases were from the Saudi Arabia and 368 (17.96%) cases were reported from the other countries of the world. The maximum number of cases reported in June was 474 (23.14%). 287 (14.01%) cases were reported from Saudi Arabia and remaining 187 (9.13%) cases were reported from all over the world. The number of cases reported from April to June was 396 (19.33%) while the cases encountered from October to December were 231 (11.27%). CONCLUSIONS The highest global seasonal occurrence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-MERS-CoV outbreak cases were found in the month of June, while the lowest was found in the month of January during the period of 2012 to 2017. The pattern of MERS-CoV infections has been observed to have seasonal variations. It is suggested that the health officials should highlight the seasonal occurrence of MERS-CoV outbreak and take better preventive measures to minimize the disease burden nationally and globally.","output":"Global seasonal occurrence of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Baricitinib (BTB) is an orally administered Janus kinase inhibitor, therapeutically used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Recently it has also been approved for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. In this study, four different BTB-loaded lipids (stearin)-polymer (Poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide)) hybrid nanoparticles (B-PLN1 to B-PLN4) were prepared by the single-step nanoprecipitation method. Next, they were characterised in terms of physicochemical properties such as particle size, zeta potential (P), polydispersity index (PDI), entrapment efficiency (EE) and drug loading (DL). Based on preliminary evaluation, the B-PLN4 was regarded as the optimised formulation with particle size (272  7.6 nm), PDI (0.225), P (?36.5  3.1 mV), %EE (71.6  1.5%) and %DL (2.87  0.42%). This formulation (B-PLN4) was further assessed concerning morphology, in vitro release, and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies in rats. The in vitro release profile exhibited a sustained release pattern well-fitted by the KorsmeyerCPeppas kinetic model (R(2) = 0.879). The in vivo pharmacokinetic data showed an enhancement (2.92 times more) in bioavailability in comparison to the normal suspension of pure BTB. These data concluded that the formulated lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles could be a promising drug delivery option to enhance the bioavailability of BTB. Overall, this study provides a scientific basis for future studies on the entrapment efficiency of lipid-polymer hybrid systems as promising carriers for overcoming pharmacokinetic limitations.","output":"Development of Sustained Release Baricitinib Loaded Lipid-Polymer Hybrid Nanoparticles with Improved Oral Bioavailability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper deals with the mathematical modeling and numerical simulations related to the coronavirus dynamics.

Methods: We included 117 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The patients were divided into a hypertensive group and a control group. Biochemical, complete blood count and imaging data of the patients were recorded. Mortality of patients with and without HT was evaluated. The effect of antihypertensive therapy on mortality was evaluated. Results: In thorax CT, ground glass opacity and pneumonic consolidation were found statistically significantly higher in the hypertensive group (p <0,001). Hospital stay duration (days) of the patients were significantly longer in the hypertensive group and need for intensive care unit was statistically higher in the hypertensive group (p <0,001). Mortality of hypertensive patients was higher than of those without hypertension (p <0,001). There was no statistically significant difference in mortality in antihypertensive treatment groups (p = 0,801). Conclusion: Hypertension is an important risk factor that increases mortality in COVID-19 patients. Uncontrolled hypertension was common in most patients. Inflammatory parameters are higher especially in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension have a higher risk of mortality. There is no data to suggesting that the use of ACEI/ARB worsens prognosis.

In this work, we study a social distancing game among the agents of a population, who determine their social interactions during the spread of an epidemic. The interconnections between the agents are modeled by a network and local interactions are considered. The payoffs of the agents depend on their benefits from their social interactions, as well as on the costs to their health due to their possible contamination. The information available to the agents during the decision making plays a crucial role in our model. We examine two extreme cases. In the first case, the agents know exactly the health states of their neighbors and in the second they have statistical information for the global prevalence of the epidemic. The Nash equilibria of the games are studied and, interestingly, in the second case the equilibrium strategies for an agent are either full isolation or no social distancing at all. Experimental studies are presented through simulations, where we observe that in the first case of perfect local information the agents can affect significantly the prevalence of the epidemic with low cost for their sociability, while in the second case they have to pay the burden of not being well informed. Moreover, the effects of the information quality (fake news), the health care system capacity and the network structure are discussed and relevant simulations are provided, which indicate that these parameters affect the size, the peak and the start of the outbreak, as well as the possibility of a second outbreak.","output":"Games of Social Distancing during an Epidemic: Local vs Statistical Information"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Dermatologic care was halted because of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, prompting us to study the usefulness of direct-to-patient teledermatology via a mobile application We aimed to evaluate the service as a tool for avoiding face-to-face consultations, describe the main conditions diagnosed, and assess levels of patient and physician satisfaction Material and method Prospective descriptive study of new patients who met the inclusion criteria Descriptive statistics for all variables were analyzed with SPSS Results Of the 1,497 patients who agreed to participate in the study, 25% (n = 374) sent an image to a consultant dermatologist through the mobile application Sixty-four patients (17%) were discharged directly and referred to primary care for follow-up A face-to-face consultation was avoided for at least 3 months in 85% of patients (n = 318);87 1% (n = 325) received a diagnosis and the dermatologist's level of confidence in this diagnosis was 7 or higher in 77 5% of cases (n = 290) The quality of the images sent was considered sufficient in 52 1% of cases Patients rated their satisfaction with a score of 4 5 out of 5 Eleven of the 16 dermatologists rated their satisfaction as good overall The most common conditions were inflammatory and melanocytic lesions The main diagnoses were nevi, acne, and eczema Discussion Direct-to-patient store-and-forward teledermatology is an effective means of evaluating new patients Both clinicians and patients expressed high levels of satisfaction with the service Systems enabling the addition of digital images to patient records are necessary to ensure the efficiency of teledermatology Resumen Antecedentes Como consecuencia de la pandemia por la COVID-19 ces la actividad dermatolgica asistencial, por lo que iniciamos un estudio para evaluar la utilidad de la teledermatologa (TD) directa entre paciente y dermatlogo a travs de una App El objetivo fue evaluar el impacto de esta herramienta para evitar consultas presenciales, as como describir los principales diagnsticos y la satisfaccin de pacientes y mdicos Material y mtodo Estudio descriptivo prospectivo Se incluyen pacientes nuevos que cumplen criterios de inclusin Se realiz un anlisis descriptivo de todas las variables mediante el programa estadstico SPSS Resultados De los 1 497 pacientes que aceptaron participar el 25% (n = 374) enviaron una consulta virtual con imagen De entre ellos el 17% (n = 64) fueron dados de alta de forma directa para control por atencin primaria En un 85% (n = 318) de los pacientes se logra evitar la consulta presencial durante al menos 3 meses Se emiti un diagnstico en el 87,1% (n = 325) de los pacientes, siendo la confianza en el diagnstico  7/10 en el 77,5% (n = 290) La calidad de la imagen fue suficiente en el 52,1% La satisfaccin del paciente fue de 4,5/5 Once de 16 dermatlogos consideraron la TD til globalmente La afeccin ms frecuente fue la inflamatoria y melanoctica, siendo los diagnsticos ms habituales nevus, acn y eccema Discusin La TD directa asncrona es una herramienta eficaz para valorar pacientes nuevos, con un alto grado de satisfaccin para mdicos y pacientes El desarrollo de un sistema de TD eficiente implica la integracin de la imagen digital en los sistemas de informacin mdicos","output":"Direct-to-Patient Teledermatology During COVID-19 Lockdown in a Health District in Madrid, Spain: The EVIDE-19 Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the proximity to China and millions of international travelers yearly, Taiwan was thought to be at a great risk to be hit hard by the COVID-19.

Total number of children in the household and their chronic health conditions were also assessed. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate the intention to vaccinate children against the COVID-19 and associations with other variables. KEY FINDINGS: The survey response rate was 32.30% (595/1842). Most of the participants were White (72.1%), 31C40 years old (55.46%) and married or in a cohabiting relationship (90.25).

Top factors associated with intention were perceived susceptibility (P = 0.002), benefits (P < 0.001), barriers (P < 0.001), cues to action (P < 0.001) and the presence of healthcare workers in the household (P = 0.032). The main barriers were concerns about vaccine safety, efficacy and side effects. The strongest cue to action was enough information being provided followed by doctors recommendations.

A model fitting strategy built upon nonparametric smoothing is employed for estimating the time-varying parameters, while profiling over the time-independent parameters. Confidence bands of the parameters are obtained through a residual bootstrap procedure. A key feature of the methodology is its ability to estimate latent unobservable compartments such as the number of asymptomatic but infected individuals who are known to be the key vectors of COVID-19 spread. The nature of the disease dynamics is further quantified by relevant epidemiological markers that make use of the estimates of latent compartments. The methodology is applied to understand the true extent and dynamics of the pandemic in various states within the United States (US).","output":"Inference on the dynamics of COVID-19 in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When will self-interested vaccine-rich countries voluntarily donate their surplus vaccines to vaccine-poor countries during a pandemic? We develop a game-theoretic approach to address this question. We identify vaccine-rich countries optimal surplus donation strategies, and then examine whether these strategies are stable (Nash equilibrium or self-enforcing international agreement). We identify parameter ranges in which full or partial surplus stock donations are optimal for the donor countries. Within a more restrictive parameter region, these optimal strategies are also stable. This implies that, under certain conditions (notably a total amount of surplus vaccines that is sufficiently large), simple coordination can lead to significant donations by strictly self-interested vaccine-rich countries. On the other hand, if the total amount that the countries can donate is small, we expect no contribution from self-interested countries. The results of this analysis provide guidance to policy makers in identifying the circumstances in which coordination efforts are likely to be effective.","output":"The rich-to-poor vaccine donation game: When will self-interested countries donate their surplus vaccines during pandemics?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Given the lack of information on the psychological impact of COVID-19 on people aged 60, we aimed to describe their psychological responses to this pandemic and lockdown situation and compare them with those under 60 years of age. METHODS Secondary analysis of a larger online cross-sectional study designed to determine the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown across Spain. We analyzed a total of 1690 respondents aged 60 years and compared them with 13,363 respondents under 60 years of age. We employed the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale and the Impact of Event Scale to evaluate psychological responses. RESULTS In all, 52.6% of women and 34.3% of men were found to be probable cases of any emotional distress (p < 0.001). In both sexes, the most common psychological response was avoidance behavior (34.7% and 23.8%, respectively), followed by depression (28.5 and 14.2%). Older women and men were considered probable cases of any emotional distress less often than younger ones (women: 52.6% vs. 72.3%, p < 0.001; men: 34.3% vs. 50.6%, p < 0.001). Finally, the results of the binary logistic regression showed that only depressive and stress responses are psychological factors associated with age group [age  60 years, O.R. = 0.617 (95% CI = 0.501 - 0.759) and 0.437 (95% CI = 0.334 - 0.573), respectively]. CONCLUSION Contrary to our hypothesis and despite the high percentage of emotional distress we found in older adults, especially women, they are actually at lower risk of developing depressive and stress consequences from COVID-19 and lockdown than those under 60 years of age. That said, we believe our results highlight the need for expert guidance in this age group, especially older women living alone.","output":"Are older adults also at higher psychological risk from COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Zukamu granules may play a potential role in the fight against the Coronavirus, COVID-19. The purpose of this study is to explore the mechanisms of Zukamu granules using network pharmacology combined with molecular docking. Methods: The Traditional Chinese Medicine systems pharmacology (TCMSP) database was used to filter the active compounds and the targets of each drug in the prescription. The Genecards and OMIM databases were used for identifying the targets related to COVID-19. The STRING database was used to analyze the intersection targets. Compound - target interaction and protein-protein interaction networks were constructed using Cytoscape to decipher the anti-COVID-19 mechanisms of action of the prescription. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of action. Finally, the interaction between the targets and the active compounds was verified by molecular docking technology. Results: A total of 66 targets were identified. Further analysis identified 10 most important targets and 12 key compounds. Besides, 1340 biological process, 43 cell composition, and 87 molecular function items were obtained (P < 0.05). One hundred and thirty pathways were obtained (P < 0.05). The results of molecular docking showed that there was a stable binding between the active compounds and the targets.

A study was undertaken to determine: 1) stress levels of pharmacy faculty and first-year pharmacy students; 2) whether gender affected faculty and/or student stress levels disproportionally; and 3) how child and family care responsibilities influenced stress levels. Methods: All first-year (P1) students enrolled in a College of Pharmacy were surveyed along with faculty. Stress levels were assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS10). Additional demographic information, including items related to children and family obligations, was collected. Results: Faculty reported average perceived stress levels (M=15.50) while first-year students reported high perceived stress levels (M=21.14). Perceived stress levels of female faculty (M=16.43) were higher than those of male faculty (M=12.00). Perceived stress levels of female students (M=22.60) were higher than those of male students (M=16.78).

Perceived stress levels of female students with []10 hours of family obligations per week (M=22.71) were higher than male pharmacy students with []10 hours (M=12.80). Conclusion: Lower levels of perceived stress for faculty compared to students may be due to the development of coping strategies coinciding with maturity.

This search may well benefit from the experiences of the animal health profession in the development and use of coronavirus vaccines in domestic animal species. These animal vaccines will in no way protect humans against COVID-19 but knowledge of the difficulties encountered in vaccinating animals may help avoid or minimize similar problems arising in humans. Diverse coronaviruses can infect the domestic species from dogs and cats, to cattle and pigs to poultry. Many of these infections are controlled by routine vaccination. Thus, canine coronavirus vaccines are protective in puppies but the disease itself is mild and self-limiting. Feline coronavirus infections may be mild or may result in a lethal immune-mediated disease - feline infectious peritonitis. As a result, vaccination of domestic cats must seek to generate- protective immunity without causing immune-mediated disease. Vaccines against bovine coronavirus are widely employed in cattle where they protect against enteric and respiratory disease in young calves. Two major livestock species suffer from economically significant and severe coronavirus diseases. Thus, pigs may be infected with six different coronaviruses, one of which, porcine epidemic diarrhea, has proven difficult to control despite the development of several innovative vaccines. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus undergoes frequent genetic changes. Likewise, infectious bronchitis coronavirus causes an economically devastating disease of chickens. It too undergoes frequent genetic shifts and as a result, can only be controlled by extensive and repeated vaccination. Other issues that have been encountered in developing these animal vaccines include a relatively short duration of protective immunity, and a lack of effectiveness of inactivated vaccines.

Here, we introduce sc-linker, a framework for integrating single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), epigenomic maps and GWAS summary statistics to infer the underlying cell types and processes by which genetic variants influence disease. We analyzed 1.6 million scRNA-seq profiles from 209 individuals spanning 11 tissue types and 6 disease conditions, and constructed gene programs capturing cell types, disease progression, and cellular processes both within and across cell types. We evaluated these gene programs for disease enrichment by transforming them to SNP annotations with tissue-specific epigenomic maps and computing enrichment scores across 60 diseases and complex traits (average N=297K). Cell type, disease progression, and cellular process programs captured distinct heritability signals even within the same cell type, as we show in multiple complex diseases that affect the brain (Alzheimers disease, multiple sclerosis), colon (ulcerative colitis) and lung (asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, severe COVID-19). The inferred disease enrichments recapitulated known biology and highlighted novel cell-disease relationships, including GABAergic neurons in major depressive disorder (MDD), a disease progression M cell program in ulcerative colitis, and a disease-specific complement cascade process in multiple sclerosis. In autoimmune disease, both healthy and disease progression immune cell type programs were associated, whereas for epithelial cells, disease progression programs were most prominent, perhaps suggesting a role in disease progression over initiation.

Our findings revealed a marked reduction in the ambient AQI (estimated mean reduction of 17.75% and 20.70%, respectively), tropospheric NO2 density, and land surface temperature (LST) during post-lockdown compared with the pre-lockdown period or corresponding months in 2019, except for a few sites with substantial coal mining and active power plants. We observed a modest increase in the O3 density post-lockdown, thereby indicating improved tropospheric air quality. As a favorable outcome of the COVID-19 lockdown, road accident-related mortalities declined by 72-folds. Cities with poor air quality correlate with higher COVID-19 cases and deaths (r = 0.504 and r = 0.590 for NO2; r = 0.744 and r = 0.435 for AQI).

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to extend our work in IL-13 biology to determine whether airway epithelial cell expression of 2 key mediators critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection, namely, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), are modulated by IL-13. METHODS: We determined effects of IL-13 treatment on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression ex vivo in primary airway epithelial cells from participants with and without type 2 asthma obtained by bronchoscopy. We also examined expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in 2 data sets containing gene expression data from nasal and airway epithelial cells from children and adults with asthma and allergic rhinitis. RESULTS: IL-13 significantly reduced ACE2 and increased TMPRSS2 expression ex vivo in airway epithelial cells. In 2 independent data sets, ACE2 expression was significantly reduced and TMPRSS2 expression was significantly increased in the nasal and airway epithelial cells in type 2 asthma and allergic rhinitis. ACE2 expression was significantly negatively associated with type 2 cytokines, whereas TMPRSS2 expression was significantly positively associated with type 2 cytokines.

First of all the basic characteristics of life and the types of biological contaminants and potentially infectious agents of pharmaceutical products will be discussed: viz. prions, viruses, mollicutes, bacteria, fungi, and endotoxins. In the next section factors affecting survival and growth of micro-organisms are discussed. In addition to well-known factors such as time, temperature, and chemical and physical characteristics of the environment, attention will be paid to biofilm formation. Primary microbiological contamination is prevented by implementing an adequate microbiological quality control and quality assurance program and by following cGMPs during production.

The specificity and platelet-activating activity of VITT antibodies strikingly resemble that of antibodies detected in autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), but their features remain poorly characterized. In particular, a better knowledge of these antibodies should help to understand the mechanisms leading to hypercoagulability and the particular thrombotic events observed in VITT, but rarely in typical HIT. We have recently developed a chimeric IgG1 anti-PF4 antibody, 1E12, which strongly mimics autoimmune HIT antibodies in terms of specificity and cellular effects. Therefore, we assessed whether 1E12 could mimic VITT antibodies. We then evaluated the capability of DG-1E12, a deglycosylated form of 1E12 unable to bind FcR, to inhibit cellular activation induced by VITT antibodies. Methods and Results Using a PF4-sensitized serotonin release assay (PF4-SRA) (Vayne C, New Engl J Med, 2021), we demonstrated that 1E12 (5 and 10 g/mL) strongly activated platelets, with a pattern similar to that obtained with human VITT samples (n=7), i.e. in a PF4-dependent manner and without heparin. This platelet activation was inhibited by low heparin concentration (0.5 IU/mL), an effect also observed with VITT samples. Serotonin release induced by 1E12 was also fully inhibited by IV-3, a monoclonal antibody blocking FcRIIa, or by IdeS, a bacterial protease that cleaves IgG and strongly inhibits the binding of IgG antibodies to FcRIIa. This inhibitory effect of IV-3 and IdeS strongly supports that interactions between pathogenic anti-PF4 IgG and FcRIIa play a central role in VITT. Incubation of 1E12 or VITT samples with isolated neutrophils (PMN) and platelets with PF4 (10 g/mL) strongly induced DNA release and NETosis, supporting that PMN are involved in the processes leading to thrombosis in VITT. Furthermore, when whole blood from healthy donors incubated with 1E12 or VITT plasma was perfused in capillaries coated with von Willebrand Factor, numerous large platelet/leukocyte aggregates containing fibrin(ogen) were formed. To investigate whether 1E12 and VITT antibodies recognize overlapping epitopes on PF4, we then performed competitive assays with a deglycosylated form of 1E12 (DG-1E12), still able to bind PF4 but not to interact with Fc receptors. In PF4-SRA, pre-incubation of DG-1E12 (50 g/mL) dramatically reduced platelet activation induced by VITT antibodies, which was fully abrogated for 9 of the 14 VITT samples tested. Additional experiments using a whole blood PF4-enhanced flow cytometry assay recently designed for VITT diagnosis (Handtke et al, Blood 2021), confirmed that DG-1E12 fully prevented platelet activation induced by VITT antibodies. Moreover, when platelets and neutrophils were pre-incubated with DG-1E12 (100 g/mL), NETosis and thus DNA release, nuclear rounding, and DNA decondensation induced by VITT antibodies were completely inhibited. Finally, DG-1E12 (100 g/mL) also fully abolished VITT antibody-mediated thrombus formation in whole blood in vitro under vein flow conditions. Comparatively, DG-1E12 did not inhibit ALB6, a murine monoclonal anti-CD9 antibody, which also strongly activates platelets in a FcRIIa-dependent manner. Conclusions Our results show that 1E12 exhibits features similar to those of human VITT antibodies in terms of specificity, affinity and cellular effects, and could therefore be used as a model antibody to study the pathophysiology of VITT. Our data also demonstrate that DG-1E12 prevents blood cell activation and thrombus formation induced by VITT antibodies, likely due to the competitive effect of its Fab fragment on antibody binding to PF4. DG-1E12 may allow the development of a new drug neutralizing the pathogenic effect of autoimmune anti-PF4 antibodies, such as those associated with VITT.

Exploration of protective factors for adolescent mental health is urgently needed, and no research has examined the role of parental involvement. METHODS: From March to April 2020, valid data were collected from 1663 Chinese adolescents through online demographic and other questionnaires. Parental involvement at home was assessed by an adapted questionnaire on parental support in learning at home, stress since the COVID-19 outbreak was measured by the Perceived Stress Scale, and three negative psychological outcomes (i.e., depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS)) were measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale, and PTSD Check List-Civilian Version, respectively. RESULTS: In total, 35.4%, 21% and 25% of adolescents had depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and PTSS, respectively. Three moderated mediation models consistently showed the following: a. Parental involvement indirectly reduced the three psychological problems by alleviating perceived stress, and the indirect effects were not moderated by sex. b. There were negative direct effects of parental involvement on the three psychological problems, and the links were not moderated by sex. c. Sex moderated the associations between perceived stress and the three psychological problems.

Immune responses can be evoked through diverse inducible pathways. However, various constitutive mechanisms are also required for immunocompetence. The inducible responses of pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system and antigen-specific receptors of the adaptive immune system are highly effective, but they also have the potential to cause extensive immunopathology and tissue damage, as seen in many infectious and autoinflammatory diseases. By contrast, constitutive innate immune mechanisms, including restriction factors, basal autophagy and proteasomal degradation, tend to limit immune responses, with loss-of-function mutations in these pathways leading to inflammation. Although they function through a broad and heterogeneous set of mechanisms, the constitutive immune responses all function as early barriers to infection and aim to minimize any disruption of homeostasis.

Social distancing is still one of the main methods to reduce spread, but it entails a high toll on personal freedom and economic life. Alternative mitigation strategies that do not come with the same problems but are effective at preventing disease spread are therefore needed. Repetitive mass-testing using PCR assays for viral RNA has been suggested, but as a stand-alone strategy this would be prohibitively resource intensive. Here, we suggest a strategy that aims at targeting the limited resources available for viral RNA testing to subgroups that are more likely than the average population to yield a positive test result. Importantly, these pre-selected subgroups include symptom-free people. By testing everyone in these subgroups, in addition to symptomatic cases, large fractions of pre- and asymptomatic people can be identified, which is only possible by testing-based mitigation. We call this strategy smart testing (ST). In principle, pre-selected subgroups can be found in different ways, but for the purpose of this study we analyze a pre-selection procedure based on cheap and fast virus antigen tests. We quantify the potential reduction of the epidemic reproduction number by such a two-stage ST strategy. In addition to a scenario where such a strategy is available to the whole population, we analyze local applications, e.g. in a country, company, or school, where the tested subgroups are also in exchange with the untested population. Our results suggest that a two-stage ST strategy can be effective to curb pandemic spread, at costs that are clearly outweighed by the economic benefit. It is technically and logistically feasible to employ such a strategy, and our model predicts that it is even effective when applied only within local groups. We therefore recommend adding two-stage ST to the portfolio of available mitigation strategies, which allow easing social distancing measures without compromising public health.","output":"Smart investment of virus RNA testing resources to enhance Covid-19 mitigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 pandemic has caused havoc worldwide.

Although nearly a 50% of severe influenza present with pneumonia, the effect of early ( 2 days after illness onset) neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) use on the clinical outcomes of influenza A-related pneumonia (FluA-p) has rarely been assessed. Furthermore, data about the administration of NAIs in the real-world management of Flu-p in China are limited. METHODS: Data of patients hospitalised with FluA-p from five teaching hospitals in China from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. The impact of early NAI therapy on the outcomes in FluA-p patients, and the indications of early NAI administration by clinicians were evaluated by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In total, 693 FluA-p patients were included. Of these patients, 33.5% (232/693) were treated early. After adjusting for weighted propensity scores for treatment, systemic corticosteroid and antibiotic use, a multivariate logistic regression model showed that early NAI therapy was associated with decreased risk for invasive ventilation [odds ratio (OR) 0.511, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.312C0.835, p = 0.007) and 30-day mortality (OR 0.533, 95% CI 0.210C0.807, p < 0.001) in FluA-p patients. A multivariate logistic regression model confirmed early NAI use (OR 0.415, 95% CI 0.195C0.858, p = 0.001) was a predictor for 30-day mortality in FluA-p patients and a positive rapid influenza diagnostic test was the only indication (OR 3.586, 95% CI 1.259C10.219, p < 0.001) related to the prescription of early NAI by clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: Early NAI therapy is associated with better outcomes in FluA-p patients.

RESULTS: Of the 102 patients, 55.9% progressed with AKI, and the majority (66.7%) was classified as stage 3. Multivariate logistic regression showed age (RC 1.101; 95% CI 1.026 - 1.181; p = 0.0070), estimated glomerular filtration rate - eGFR (RC 1.127; 95% CI 1.022 - 1.243; p = 0.0170) and hypertension (RC 3.212; 95% CI 1.065 - 9.690; p = 0.0380) as independent predictors of AKI. Twenty-three patients died. In the group without kidney injury, there were 8.9% deaths, while in the group with AKI, 33.3% of patients died (RR 5.125; 95% CI 1.598 - 16.431; p = 0.0060). The average survival, in days, was higher in the group without AKI. Cox multivariate analysis showed age (RR 1.054; 95% CI 1.014 - 1.095; p = 0.0080) and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (RR 8.953; 95% CI 1.128 - 71.048; p = 0.0380) as predictors of hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: We found a high incidence of AKI; and as predictive factors for its occurrence: age, eGFR and hypertension. AKI was associated with higher hospital mortality.","output":"Acute kidney injury in patients with Covid-19 in a Brazilian ICU: incidence, predictors and in-hospital mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected several economic sectors in India, dragging many to the brink of survival. In particular, the already fragile horticulture industry is now facing a double burden of a weak value chain management system as well as perishability of produce (fresh fruits and vegetables), this pandemic season. Also, the strict enforcement of lockdown has altered both demand and supply factors, which in turn have shocked various linkages in the value chain of fresh fruits and vegetables. So, this paper dissects the value chain management of grapes and its processed products, namely juice, wine, and raisins in Maharashtra, the largest producer of grapes in India. For this, a value chain analysis (VCA) is carried out by computing the degree of value addition to uncover the rupture points caused by the pandemic as well as advocate policy measures to build a resilient system. The value chain analysis shows that post-COVID-19, the degree of value addition, has shot up for the intermediary agents, i.e., pre-harvest contractors, at the expense of the farmers. Using the insights from the VCA results plus the demand and supply shocks, various policy measures are elucidated to strengthen the grape value chain.","output":"Value chain management under COVID-19: responses and lessons from grape production in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Autoregulatory dysfunction is an important contributor to brain injury in premature infants, particularly intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). The autoregulatory system acts as a filter that dampens the systemic blood flow to follow a normal cerebral perfusion profile. METHODS Simultaneous arterial blood pressure and cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data were collected from infants born before 28 wk estimated gestational age. The resulting data were preprocessed and then divided into nonoverlapping 20-min epochs. The transfer function estimate was calculated to determine dampening ability. RESULTS Sixty-two infants were prospectively recruited with a mean estimated gestational age of 25.4  1.3 wk and birth weight of 832  199 g. 67% were male, 24/62 had IVH, 17/62 received dopamine, 47/62 had antenatal steroid exposure, and 22/62 received fentanyl.Advancing estimated gestational age and birth weight z-score predicted stronger dampening while African-American race and IVH of any grade predicted weaker dampening. CONCLUSION This preliminary report suggests an impairment in dampening ability associated with immaturity, decreased birth weight z-score, and African-American race. Decreased dampening is also associated with IVH, although these results cannot distinguish between decreased dampening as an antecedent or sequela of IVH. These observations should be studied in a larger sample.","output":"A novel method for assessing cerebral autoregulation in preterm infants using transfer function analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid pace of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) pandemic presents challenges to the real-time collection of population-scale data to inform near-term public health needs as well as future investigations.

METHODS A convenience sample of 17 anesthesia residents and fellows with at least 3 years of anesthesia training was recruited from teaching hospitals in Toronto for a randomized crossover trial. Each participant passed each DLT over an AEC in an airway simulator, visualized and video recorded via a video laryngoscope (GlideScope). The order of exchange was randomized by blindly pulling the name of the manufacturer of a DLT from a box. The primary outcome was time to intubate, defined as time from the bronchial lumen entering the GlideScope view to the bronchial lumen passing the vocal cords. Also recorded were participants' subjective rating of the ease of use and failure rate, defined as an attempt >150-second duration. RESULTS Time to intubate was faster with the Fuji-Phycon DLT (median 2 seconds) compared with both the Rusch (median 27 seconds, P = 0.0144) and Mallinckrodt (median 21 seconds, P = 0.0117). On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being very easy to use and 1 being very difficult, the Fuji-Phycon was judged to be easier to use (median 10 seconds) compared with the Rusch (median 3, P = 0.0186) and the Mallinckrodt (median 4 seconds, P = 0.0123).

From August to December 2020, every sixth of overall 784 independent index cases was associated with secondary cases in educational institutions. Monitoring of 14 594 institutional high-risk contacts (89% PCR-tested) of 441 index cases during quarantine revealed 196 secondary cases (SAR 1.34%, 0.99C1.78).

In this study, we did a comparative analysis of ORF1a and ORF1b by using the first isolate (Wuhan strain) as the parent sequence. We observed that most of the nucleotide mutations are C to U transitions. The rate of synonymous C to U transitions is significantly higher than the rate of nonsynonymous ones, indicating negative selection on amino acid substitutions. Further, trends in nucleotide usage bias have been investigated in 49 coronaviruses species. A strong bias in nucleotide usage in fourfold degenerated sites towards uracil residues is seen in ORF1 of all the studied coronaviruses. A more substantial mutational U pressure is observed in ORF1a than in ORF1b owing to the translation of ORF1ab via programmed ribosomal frameshifting. Unlike other nucleotide mutations, mutational U pressure caused by cytosine deamination, mostly occurring in the RNA-plus strand, cannot be corrected by the proof-reading machinery of coronaviruses. The knowledge generated on the direction of mutational pressure during translation of viral RNA-plus strands has implications for vaccine and nucleoside analogue development for treating covid-19 and other coronavirus infections.","output":"Translation-associated mutational U-pressure in the first ORF of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been declared a global health emergency.

Herein, we employed accurate mass/high resolution mass spectrometry to demonstrate that the active site serine (S465) and C651 of iPLA2 are covalently cross-linked during incubations with BEL demonstrating their close spatial proximity. This cross-link results in macroscopic alterations in enzyme molecular geometry evidenced by anomalous migration of the cross-linked enzyme by SDS-PAGE. Molecular models of iPLA2 constructed from the crystal structure of iPLA2 (patatin) indicate that the distance between S465 and C651 is approximately 10 ? within the active site of iPLA2. Kinetic analysis of the formation of the 75 kDa iPLA2-BEL species with the (R) and (S) enantiomers of BEL demonstrated that the reaction of (S)-BEL with iPLA2 was more rapid than for (R)-BEL paralleling the enantioselectivity for the inhibition of catalysis by each inhibitor with iPLA2. Moreover, we demonstrate that the previously identified selective acylation of iPLA2 by oleoyl-CoA occurs at C651 thereby indicating the importance of active site architecture for acylation of this enzyme. Collectively, these results identify C651 as a highly reactive nucleophilic residue within the active site of iPLA2 which is thioesterified by BEL, acylated by oleoyl-CoA, and located in close spatial proximity to the catalytic serine thereby providing important chemical insights on the mechanisms through which BEL inhibits iPLA2 and the topology of the active site.","output":"Mechanism-based inhibition of iPLA2 demonstrates a highly reactive cysteine residue (C651) that interacts with the active site: mass spectrometric elucidation of the mechanisms underlying inhibition."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Unlike previous crisis where investors tend to put their assets in safe havens like gold, the recent coronavirus pandemic is characterised by an increase in the Bitcoin purchasing described as risk heaven This paper aims to analyse the Bitcoin dynamics and the investor response by focusing on herd biases Therefore, the main objective of this work is to study the degree of efficiency through multifractal analysis in order to detect herd behaviour leading to build the best predictions and strategies Design/methodology/approach: This paper develops a novel methodology that detects the presence of herding biases and assesses the inefficiency of Bitcoin through an inefficiency index (MLM) by using statistical indicators defined by measures of persistence This study, also, investigates the nonlinear dynamical properties of Bitcoin by estimating the Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) leading to deduce the effect of COVID-19 on the Bitcoin performance Besides, this work performs an event study to capture abnormal changes created by COVID-19 related events capable to analyse the Bitcoin market response Findings: The empirical results of the generalized Hurst exponent GHE estimation indicates that Bitcoin is multifractal before this pandemic and becomes less fractal after the outbreak Using an efficiency index (MLM), Bitcoin is found to be more efficient after the pandemic Based on the Hausdorff topology, the authors showed that this pandemic has reduced the herd bias Research limitations/implications: The uncertainty of COVID-19 disease and the lasting of its duration make it difficult to make the best prediction Practical implications: The main contribution of this study is the evaluation of the Bitcoin value after the COVID19 outbreak This work has practical implications as it provides new insights on trading opportunities and social reactions Originality/value: To the authors knowledge, this work represents the first study that analyses the Bitcoin response to different events related to COVID-19 and detects the presence of herding behaviour in such a crisis ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"COVID-19, bitcoin market efficiency, herd behaviour"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Compare the efficacy of full-endoscopic lumbar decompression surgery (FELDS) and open decompression and fusion surgery (ODFS) for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 358 LSS patients treated by FELDS (FELD group) or ODFS (open group) was undertaken. There were 177 patients in the FELDS group with a mean age of 65.479.26 years and 181 patients in the open group with a mean age of 64.1810.24 years. Duration of follow-up was 38.6311.88 months in the FELDS group and 38.5612.29 months in the open group. Visual analog scale (VAS) score, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Modified MacNab criteria were used to access clinical outcomes. Surgical outcomes (duration of surgical procedure, blood loss, complications, duration of postoperative hospital stay (DOPHS), prevalence of revision procedures) were evaluated. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate the change in the Pfirrmann grade at adjacent segments. RESULTS: VAS score (leg and back) and ODI improved significantly in both groups (P<0.001). Success rate reached 86.55% and 90.60% in the FELDS group and open group (P>0.05), respectively. Procedure duration (84.12 vs 112.08 min), blood loss (7.97 vs 279.67 mL), and DOPHS (2.68 vs 4.78 days) of the FELDS group were significantly better than those of the open group (P<0.05). Total prevalence of complications and procedure revisions was 14.69% and 10.73% in the FELD group, respectively, but did not show a significant difference with that in the open group (12.15% and 9.39%, respectively). The Pfirrmann grade increased in 13.04% of adjacent segments in the FELDS group, significantly better than that in the open group (32.67%) (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: FELDS had the same efficacy as ODFS for LSS treatment. FELDS had the advantages of minimal invasiveness, less surgical trauma, rapid recovery, and lower risk of degeneration of adjacent segments compared with that of ODFS.","output":"Full-Endoscopic Lumbar Decompression versus Open Decompression and Fusion Surgery for the Lumbar Spinal Stenosis: A 3-Year Follow-Up Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is no doubt that the world is currently experiencing turbulent times. Not even diplomacy could escape change when Covid-19 hit the world in January 2020. Old approaches that have been in place for decades, even centuries, changed drastically, and diplomacy could not expect to continue as if nothing had happened. Approach to and application and operation of diplomacy has essentially been affected. In the era after Covid-19, countries and diplomats will still have to pay attention to these variables and will hardly be able to return to a previous era. Furthermore, domestic politics play an important role when considering strategic foreign policy decisions due to the threats that are expected or are already being carried out in connection with national security issues. Decisions on foreign affairs must therefore be evaluated in a certain domestic context because they develop mainly within national borders. In recent decades, the link between the two has become closer. The concepts of national interest, national security, domestic politics, and foreign policy have now become even more intertwined. Consequently, the question arises involuntarily: how are diplomats prepared and trained for this new world. Nowadays, diplomats are expected to be international advisers. Geopolitical views and applications have become more and more important, and the world is more interconnected than ever before. Understanding the global system is an inevitable requirement. The era requires people who can make difficult decisions and who will not worry about fine protocol rules being strictly enforced and adhered to anymore. These international advisers are now more than ever involved and instrumental in decision-making processes of peace and national security. This interdisciplinary role that these advisers must play is a challenging one that requires skilful dynamics. Contemporary diplomacy is changing at an unprecedented pace and is characterised by new role players, new issues, and new responsibilities. Multilateralism, which was the key to diplomacy since World War II has only gained momentum in the last 30 years, and with Covid-19, the importance of multilateral diplomacy was reaffirmed. In the span of two years, Covid-19 has revealed itself as a great equaliser, proving how interdependent the whole world really is. Covid-19 has unequivocally proved that the future of diplomacy is multilaterally driven. In addition, Covid-19 prevents personal contact and meetings, but foreign policymakers have been forced to adapt to a new digital norm. That digital revolution not only makes a wealth of information available, but also increases the speed at which decisions must be made. Diplomats similarly benefit from gathering and sharing knowledge, and this knowledge is made available at an unprecedented rate and needs to be managed. Knowledge management is the efficient handling of information and resources within a particular organisation. Knowledge diplomacy and a knowledge management system are both important because they increase the effectiveness of an institutions decision-making ability and ensure that all employees have access to overall expertise within the organisation. Knowledge management is consequently the conscious process of defining, structuring, retaining, and sharing knowledge and experience of employees within an organisation. The term knowledge diplomacy is becoming more and more popular and is used in different ways. Knowledge diplomacy, therefore, understands the role that international higher education, research, and innovation can play in strengthening relations between states. The impact of technology on the practice of diplomacy in the time of Covid-19 also inevitably emphasised the growing importance of conducting diplomacy digitally. Diplomats need to take a proactive approach to digitisation and acquire the skills needed to further promote domestic diplomacy through digital platforms as an important new component of future public diplomacy. The fight against the emergence of digital disinformation must, due to the nature of the decidedly negative implications of fake news, also receive pertinent attention. The subject of cyber security is most important and may not be ignored. Science diplomacy has become increasingly important. Another important aspect that diplomats should actively consider is how corporations continue to grow in their ability to practise public diplomacy. States are no longer the only international role players in the ever-growing diplomatic scene. Therefore, in order not to run the risk of becoming an endangered activity C which may become increasingly irrelevant because of increasing technological advances C diplomatic representation in the digital age must be intensified in order to increase diplomatic engagement and become a critical tool in an era of complex interdependence and globalisation. The number of role players involved in foreign affairs and diplomacy in one way or another has increased tremendously in recent decades. The longer the pandemic lasts, the more the world changes, and the challenge for diplomats is to manage these changes. The role of China and Russia in following their own world vision is an aspect of growing importance and demands constant vigilance. (English) [ FROM AUTHOR] Die wreld beleef onstuimige tye en nie eens diplomasie kon veranderinge ontsnap toe Covid-19 die wreld in Januarie 2020 getref het nie. Hedendaagse diplomasie verander teen n ongekende tempo en word gekenmerk deur nuwe rolspelers, nuwe vraagstukke en verantwoordelikhede en ook om diplomasie op digitale wyse te bedryf. Ou benaderings wat vir dekades, selfs eeue gegeld het, het drasties verander. Diplomasie kon nie verwag om steeds op sy eie voort te gaan asof niks gebeur het nie. Benadering tot en toepassing en bedryf van diplomasie is in die afgelope twee jaar tot in sy wese geraak. Die velerlei onderwerpe waaraan diplomate hul aandag moet skenk, neem steeds toe in omvang en intensiteit. Gevolglik kan alles nie in die bestek van n enkele artikel beskryf en uiteengesit word nie. Daarom is parameters gestel waarbinne bepaalde onderwerpe sinvol aangespreek word. Bykomend hiertoe word gepoog om die wesentlike probleme wat diplomate oor n wye veld in die gesig staar aan te spreek in die lig van die buitengewone omstandighede wat hulle moet hanteer. Die vraag is nou hoe diplomate vir hierdie nuwe wreld in hul beroep voorberei en geskool word. Deesdae word van hulle verwag om internasionale adviseurs te wees en om nou meer as ooit tevore betrokke en instrumenteel in besluitnemingsprosesse van vrede en nasionale veiligheid te wees. Hierdie interdissiplinre rol is n uitdagende een wat baie dinamika vereis. Met Covid-19 is die belangrikheid van multilaterale diplomasie herbevestig. Die digitale rewolusie stel nie net n magdom meer inligting beskikbaar nie, maar vereis spoedeisende besluitneming. Kennisbestuur is die doeltreffende hantering van inligting en hulpbronne binne n bepaalde organisasie. Kennisdiplomasie en die toepassing van n kennisbestuurstelsel is belangrik omdat dit die doeltreffendheid van n instelling se besluitnemingsvermo? verhoog. State is nie meer die enigste internasionale rolspelers in die steeds groeiende diplomatieke toneel nie. Die aantal rolspelers wat by buitelandse aangeleenthede betrokke is en diplomasie op een of ander wyse bedryf, het die afgelope dekades geweldig toegeneem. Hoe langer die pandemie aanhou, hoe meer verander die wreld. Gepaardgaande met die snelontwikkelende metodes om data te verwerk en te versprei, het die kwessie van kuberveiligheid eksponensieel toegeneem. So is wetenskapdiplomasie, insluitende ruimtediplomasie, ook belangrik om van kennis te neem. Die uitdaging waarvoor diplomate te staan kom, is om hierdie veranderinge oordeelkundig en met nuwe vaardighede te bestuur.

Such clothing is predominantly single-use, made of plastic-based synthetic fibres such as polypropylene and polyester, low cost and able to provide protection against pathogens. However, the environmental impacts of synthetic fibre-based clothing are significant and well-documented. Despite growing environmental concerns with single-use plastic-based protective clothing, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has seen a significant increase in their use, that could result in a further surge of oceanic plastic pollution, adding to mass of plastic waste that already threatens marine life. In this review, we briefly discuss the nature of the raw materials involved in the production of such clothing, as well as manufacturing techniques and the PPE supply chain. We identify the environmental impacts at critical points in the protective clothing value chain from production to consumption, focusing on water use, chemical pollution, CO2 emissions and waste. On the basis of these environmental impacts, we outline the need for fundamental changes in the business model, including increased usage of reusable protective clothing, addressing supply chain bottlenecks, establishing better waste management, and the use of sustainable materials and processes without associated environmental problems.","output":"Environmental Impacts of Personal Protective Clothing Used to Combat COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus pandemic is widely changing our professional daily practice and preventive measures must be taken and taught.

Between November 2018 and April 2019 we conducted three discussion groups with professionals and another with a group of female users. Data analysis was guided by a categorical content analysis model. The results show a tendency to understand and address vulnerability from an ethics of care based on a community care model, with differences in the discourses of men and women who participated in the research.

Therefore, we are reporting a case of a 34-year-old male not known to have any chronic illness. His severe COVID-19 infection resolved four days prior to presentation to the Emergency Department with pustular rash on erythematous base over his face, neck, upper limbs, anterior and posterior trunk including oral cavity and tounge. The rash started after he took azithromycin, oseltamivir, ribavirin, lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine, prednisolone, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, interferon (IFN) beta, and ceftazidime for COVID-19. Skin punch biopsy was done and he was diagnosed with AGEP but it was still not known if it was related to COVID-19 or a drug-induced condition.

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between ethnicity and outcomes of coronavirus positivity and hospitalization. DESIGN An observational cohort study using electronic health record (EHR) data from a large community healthcare system in Washington State across the first phase of the pandemic (March 5 - June 7, 2020). RESULTS A total of 18,667 patients (65.9% of all tested) with EHR-documented ethnicity were included. Overall, 6.4% of patients tested positive for coronavirus. Among Latinx patients, 18.6% of those tested were positive, compared to only 4.0% of tested White patients. Multivariable logistic regression revealed significantly higher odds of positivity for Latinxs (aOR = 4.96, 95% CI 4.19-5.87), Asians (aOR = 2.33, 95% CI 1.74-3.08), Blacks (aOR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.43-2.31), and members of other ethnic minority groups (aOR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.80-2.95), compared to Whites in models adjusting for relevant confounders. Latinxs had a higher percentage of self-pay insurance (22.2%) compared to other ethnic groups (7.9-15.8%) and, among those who tested positive, were the only ethnic subpopulation with significantly higher odds than Whites to be hospitalized for COVID-19 (aOR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.45-3.33). We observed a positive correlation between infection and the percentage of Latinxs (r = 0.61, 95% CI 0.45-0.74), Blacks (r = 0.51, 95% CI 0.32-0.66), or Asians (r = 0.64, 95% CI 0.49-0.76) in a given zip-code. This correlationwas negative for Whites (r = -0.63, 95% CI -0.75, -0.45). CONCLUSIONS We present empirical evidence of higher rates of coronavirus positivity among People of Color compared to White people in Washington State.

It is endemic to Venezuelas western region, and it is the etiological agent of Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever (VHF). Similar to other arenaviral hemorrhagic fevers, VHF is characterized by fever, mild hemorrhagic signs, nonspecific symptoms, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. Patients with severe disease usually develop signs of internal bleeding. Due to the absence of reference laboratories that can handle GTOV in endemic areas, diagnosis is primarily clinical and epidemiological. No antiviral therapies are available; thus, treatment includes only supportive analgesia and fluids. GTOV is transmitted by contact with the excreta of its rodent reservoir, Zygodontomys brevicauda. The main reasons for the emergence of the disease may be the increase in the human population, migration, and changes in land use patterns in rural areas. Social and environmental changes could make VHF an important cause of underdiagnosed acute febrile illnesses in regions near the endemic areas. Although there is evidence that GTOV circulates among rodents in different Venezuelan states, VHF cases have only been reported in the states of Portuguesa and Barinas. However, due to the increased frequency of invasions by humans into wildlife habitats, it is probable that VHF could become a public health problem in the nearby regions of Colombia and Brazil.

Shortages in staff, operating theatre space and intensive care beds has led to a significant reduction in the provision of surgical care. Even vascular surgery, often insulated from resource scarcity due to its status as an urgent specialty, has limited capacity due to the pandemic. Furthermore, many vascular surgical patients are elderly with multiple comorbidities putting them at increased risk of COVID-19 and its complications. There is an urgent need to investigate the impact on patients presenting to vascular surgeons during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and Analysis: The COvid-19 Vascular sERvice (COVER) study has been designed to investigate the worldwide impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vascular surgery, at both service provision and individual patient level. COVER is running as a collaborative study through the Vascular and Endovascular Research Network (VERN) with the support of numerous national (Vascular Society of Great Britain and Ireland, British Society of Endovascular Therapy, British Society of Interventional Radiology, Rouleaux Club) and an evolving number of international organisations (Vascupedia, SingVasc, Audible Bleeding (USA), Australian and New Zealand Vascular Trials Network (ANZVTN)). The study has 3 Tiers: Tier 1 is a survey of vascular surgeons to capture longitudinal changes to the provision of vascular services within their hospital; Tier 2 captures data on vascular and endovascular procedures performed during the pandemic; and Tier 3 will capture any deviations to patient management strategies from pre-pandemic best practice. Data submission and collection will be electronic using online survey tools (Tier 1: SurveyMonkey for service provision data) and encrypted data capture forms (Tiers 2 and 3: REDCap for patient level data). Tier 1 data will undergo real-time serial analysis to determine longitudinal changes in practice, with country-specific analyses also performed.

OBJECTIVE: To study the diagnostic modalities used in the evaluation and management of drug allergy/drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs) among member societies of the Asia Pacific Association of Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology (APAAACI). METHODS: A questionnaire comprising 41 questions was circulated electronically to member societies and individual members of APAAACI between January 23, 2020 and March 6, 2020. RESULTS: Twenty-six respondents from 15 member societies and 1 individual member responded. European DHR guidelines were most commonly used. Skin prick and intradermal testing was used by 100%, with only 60% having access to commercial penicillin skin test reagents. In vitro-speci?c IgE tests were used by 75%, and basophil activation test by 56.3% for immediate DHR. Patch tests were used by 75% in contrast to lymphocyte transformation tests by 25% for nonimmediate DHR. Drug provocation tests were used by 68.8%, the most common indication being to exclude hypersensitivity where history/symptoms were not suggestive of drug hypersensitivity/allergy (93.3%). Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype testing was mandatory among 25% respondents before new carbamazepine prescriptions, and 8.3% for allopurinol prescriptions. CONCLUSIONS: There was increased use of skin testing for iodinated contrast media hypersensitivity and patch testing for nonimmediate DHR. HLA genotype testing prior to new carbamazepine, allopurinol and abacavir prescriptions remain variable despite strong associations for severe cutaneous adverse reactions with Asian ethnicity.

Considering their critical role in reducing disease burden, the increasing demand outpacing production, and that most currently approved vaccines follow a two-dose regimen, the cost-effectiveness of delaying the second dose to increment the coverage of the population receiving the first dose is often debated. Finding the best solution is complex due to the trade-off between vaccinating more people with lower level of protection and guaranteeing higher protection to a fewer number of individuals. Here we present a novel extended age-structured SEIR mathematical model that includes a two-dose vaccination schedule with a between-doses delay modelled through delay differential equations and linear optimization of vaccination rates. Simulations for each time window and for different types of vaccines and production rates were run to find the optimal time window between doses, that is, the one that minimizes the number of deaths. We found that the best strategy depends on an interplay between the vaccine production rate and the relative efficacy of the first dose. In the scenario of low first-dose efficacy, it is always better to apply the second dose as soon as possible, while for high first-dose efficacy, the optimal window depends on the production rate and also on second-dose efficacy provided by each type of vaccine. We also found that the rate of spread of the infection does not affect significantly the thresholds of the optimal window, but is an important factor in the absolute number of total deaths.

Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling-1 (SOCS1) is an inducible, intracellular protein that regulates IFN- signaling by dampening JAK/STAT signaling. Using Fas deficient, MRL/MpJ-Faslpr/J (MRL/lpr) mice, which develop lupus-like disease spontaneously, we tested the hypothesis that a peptide mimic of the SOCS1 kinase inhibitory region (SOCS1-KIR) would inhibit lymphocyte activation and modulate lupus-associated pathologies. Consistent with in vitro studies, SOCS1-KIR intraperitoneal administration reduced the frequency, activation, and cytokine production of memory CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes within the peripheral blood, spleen, and lymph nodes. In addition, SOCS1-KIR administration reduced lymphadenopathy, severity of skin lesions, autoantibody production, and modestly reduced kidney pathology. On a cellular level, peritoneal SOCS1-KIR administration enhanced Foxp3 expression in total splenic and follicular regulatory T cells, reduced the effector memory/na?ve T lymphocyte ratio for both CD4+ and CD8+ cells, and reduced the frequency of GL7+ germinal center enriched B cells. Together, these data show that SOCS1-KIR treatment reduced auto-reactive lymphocyte effector functions and suggest that therapeutic targeting of the SOCS1 pathway through peptide administration may have efficacy in mitigating autoimmune pathologies.","output":"Suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 mimetic peptides attenuate lymphocyte activation in the MRL/lpr mouse autoimmune model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a substantial global market for orthopedic implants, but these implants still face the problem of a high failure rate in the short and long term after implantation due to the complex physiological conditions in the body. The use of multifunctional coatings on orthopedic implants has been proposed as an effective way to overcome a range of difficulties. Here, a multifunctional (TA@HA/Lys)(n) coating composed of tannic acid (TA), hydroxyapatite (HA), and lysozyme (Lys) was fabricated in a layer-by-layer (LBL) manner, where TA deposited onto HA firmly stuck Lys and HA together. The deposition of TA onto HA, the growth of (TA@HA/Lys)(n), and multiple related biofunctionalities were thoroughly investigated. Our data demonstrated that such a hybrid coating displayed antibacterial and antioxidant effects, and also facilitated the rapid attachment of cells [both mouse embryo osteoblast precursor cells (MC3T3-E1) and dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs)] in the early stage and their proliferation over a long period. This accelerated osteogenesis in vitro and promoted bone formation in vivo.

Its use is associated with harmful general and oral health consequences. This survey aimed to assess self-reported oral hygiene practices, oral and general health events, and changes in physiological functions (including physical status, smell, taste, breathing, appetite, etc.) due to E-cigarette use among dental students. METHODS: This online, multicounty survey involved undergraduate dental students from 20 dental schools across 11 different countries. The questionnaire included demographic characteristics, E-cigarette practices, self-reported complaints, and associated physiological changes due to E-cigarette smoking. Data were descriptively presented as frequencies and percentages. A Chi-square test was used to assess the potential associations between the study group and sub-groups with the different factors. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS at P < 0.05. RESULTS: Most respondents reported regular brushing of their teeth, whereas only 70% used additional oral hygiene aids. Reported frequencies of complaints ranged from as low as 3.3% for tongue inflammation to as high as 53.3% for headache, with significant differences between E-cigarette users and non-users. Compared to non-smokers, E-cigarette users reported significantly higher prevalence of dry mouth (33.1% vs. 23.4%; P < 0.001), black tongue (5.9% vs. 2.8%; P = 0.002), and heart palpitation (26.3%% vs. 22.8%; P = 0.001).

Prefusion-stabilized RSV F variants have been engineered as vaccine antigens, but crystal structures of these variants have revealed conformational differences in a key antigenic site located at the apex of the trimer, referred to as antigenic site ?. Currently, it is unclear if flexibility in this region is an inherent property of prefusion RSV F or if it is related to inadequate stabilization of site ? in the engineered variants. Therefore, we set out to investigate the conformational flexibility of antigenic site ?, as well as the ability of the human immune system to recognize alternative conformations of this site, by determining crystal structures of prefusion RSV F bound to neutralizing human-derived antibodies AM22 and RSD5. Both antibodies bound with high affinity and were specific for the prefusion conformation of RSV F. Crystal structures of the complexes revealed that the antibodies recognized distinct conformations of antigenic site ?, each diverging at a conserved proline residue located in the middle of an -helix. These data suggest that antigenic site ? exists as an ensemble of conformations, with individual antibodies recognizing discrete states. Collectively, these results have implications for the refolding of pneumovirus and paramyxovirus fusion proteins and should inform development of prefusion-stabilized RSV F vaccine candidates.","output":"Alternative conformations of a major antigenic site on RSV F"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been considerable interest in applying electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) simultaneously for multimodal assessment of brain function.

Empirical evidence confirms that one cause is the lack of professional identity demonstrated by doctors. Medical professionals are required to maintain high standards of competence and moral responsibility, and demonstrate qualities such as respect, compassion, integrity, responsiveness to needs, and commitment to sound ethical practice in order to maintain professional privilege. These principles and appropriate professional conduct are the foundation of the professional identity of the medical profession. METHODS: A quantitative approach was adopted by distributing paper-based questionnaires to doctors and patients in two hospitals (Level III and Level II) in Jinan, Shandong province, China. FINDINGS: In total, 614 doctors and 1184 inpatients on discharge from the surgical and internal medicine units of the two hospitals participated in the survey yielding 90% response rates. The study confirmed the variation amongst doctors in demonstrating their professionalism in terms of respecting patients views and preferences when determining diagnostic procedures and treatment plans, and when making ethical decisions. Although 90% patients indicated that they showed respects to doctors, close to 20% of the doctors disagreed that they received high respect from patients. About 12% of doctors prescribed unnecessary diagnostic procedures to patient for the purpose of generating profit and more than 20% of patients indicated that they gave gifts to doctors in order to receive better treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although about 80% of doctors demonstrated certain aspects of professionalism required by practitioners, the inconsistency across the medical workforce may exacerbate tense doctor-patient relationships. A review of medical curricula and focus of the internship program is required in order to assist medical graduates with forming required professional identity in order to improve patient satisfaction and better clinical outcomes. To be effective, a more systematic approach is recommended.

We sought to determine how effective and safe procedural skill acquisition is in French ICUs and to identify failure and complication risk factors. DESIGN Multicenter prospective observational study. Invasive procedures performed by residents were recorded during two consecutive semesters. SETTING Eighty-four residents. SUBJECTS Eighty-four residents. INTERVENTION None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Number of invasive procedures performed, failure and complication rates, supervision, and assistance provided. Five thousand six hundred seventeen procedures were prospectively studied: 1,007 tracheal intubations, 1,272 arterial and 2,586 central venous catheter insertions, 457 fiberoptic bronchoscopies, and 295 chest tube insertions. During the semesters, residents performed a median of 10 intubations, 14 arterial catheter insertions, and 26 central venous catheter insertions. Complication rates were low, similar to those in the literature: 8.6% desaturation and 7.4% esophageal placement during intubation; 0.4% and 2.3% pneumothorax with jugular and subclavian central venous catheter insertions, respectively. We identified risk factors for failure and complications. Higher rates of failure and complications for intubation were associated with residents with no or little previous experience (p < 0.001); failure of internal jugular vein catheterization was associated with left-side insertion (p = 0.005) and absence of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.007). Supervision and assistance were more frequent at the beginning of the semester and for intubation and chest tube insertion. Finally, residents had less access to fiberoptic bronchoscopy and chest tube insertion. CONCLUSION Procedural skills acquisition by residents in the ICU appears feasible and safe with complication rates comparable to what has previously been reported. We identified specific procedures and situations associated with higher failure and complication rates that could require proactive training. Questions still remain regarding minimal numbers of procedures to attain competence and how best to provide procedural training.","output":"Acquiring procedural skills in ICUs: a prospective multicenter study*."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper discusses alternatives to on-campus teaching laboratories, to allow for hands-on learning for remote students.

SL-CoVs and SARS-CoVs share identical genome organizations and high sequence identities, with the main exception of the N terminus of the spike protein (S), known to be responsible for receptor binding in CoVs. In this study, we investigated the receptor usage of the SL-CoV S by combining a human immunodeficiency virus-based pseudovirus system with cell lines expressing the ACE2 molecules of human, civet, or horseshoe bat. In addition to full-length S of SL-CoV and SARS-CoV, a series of S chimeras was constructed by inserting different sequences of the SARS-CoV S into the SL-CoV S backbone. Several important observations were made from this study. First, the SL-CoV S was unable to use any of the three ACE2 molecules as its receptor. Second, the SARS-CoV S failed to enter cells expressing the bat ACE2. Third, the chimeric S covering the previously defined receptor-binding domain gained its ability to enter cells via human ACE2, albeit with different efficiencies for different constructs. Fourth, a minimal insert region (amino acids 310 to 518) was found to be sufficient to convert the SL-CoV S from non-ACE2 binding to human ACE2 binding, indicating that the SL-CoV S is largely compatible with SARS-CoV S protein both in structure and in function.

Next, infants heard 2 test passages. One included the well-formed unit, and the other included the ill-formed sequence. In Experiment 1, infants listened longer to the passage containing the well-formed unit, suggesting that such units, even when they are embedded, are better recognized. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that this better recognition does not depend on an acoustic match between the familiarized sequences and their later embeddings.

This occurs sometimes through not granting authorship to the librarian who performed the intellectual contribution of search development and sometimes through a devaluing of the search process by the choice of language used to describe the search.

Interest in hydroxychloroquine has increased as it is being examined as a potential treatment and prophylaxis for coronavirus disease 2019. Data on the risks of specific birth defects associated with hydroxychloroquine use are sparse. METHODS: Using data from two caseCcontrol studies (National Birth Defects Prevention Study and Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study), we described women who reported hydroxychloroquine use in pregnancy and the presence of specific major birth defects in their offspring. Cases had at least one major birth defect and controls were live\\\\born healthy infants. Women self\\\\reported medication use information in the few months before pregnancy through delivery. RESULTS: In total, 0.06% (19/31,468) of case and 0.04% (5/11,614) of control mothers in National Birth Defects Prevention Study, and 0.04% (11/29,838) of case and 0.05% (7/12,868) of control mothers in Birth Defects Study reported hydroxychloroquine use. Hydroxychloroquine users had complicated medical histories and frequent medication use for a variety of conditions. The observed birth defects among women taking hydroxychloroquine were varied and included nine oral cleft cases; the elevated observed:expected ratios for specific oral cleft phenotypes and for oral clefts overall had 95% confidence intervals that included 1.0.

The virus is the pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is infectious through human-to-human transmission. The fact that 2019-nCoV is very close to SARS-CoV has been proved by several evidences, but there are significant differences between MERS-CoV and them. Therefore, in this work, we used MERS-CoV as a probe to find the homology proteins with conserved sequences among these three known human highly pathogenic coronaviruses.MethodsThe primary protein sequences of three viruses translated from the complete genome were downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The sequence alignments of ORF1ab proteins of three viruses were done by using Clustal Omega. The assessments of the feasibility of homology modeling were performed by using SWISS-MODEL.ResultsHere, by using computational biology, we propose that four nonstructural proteins nsp12, nsp13, nsp14, and nsp16 exhibit considerable homology among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and 2019-nCoV. Among them, nsp12 and nsp13 amino acid sequences are more conserved. Considering the crucial role of these two proteins in the process of virus invasion and pathological response, we first proposed these two proteins as priority targets to design new or screen existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. The high consistency of primary sequence indicates the great similarity of three-dimensional structure and similar targets are likely to be inhibited by the same inhibitor. The inhibitors designed for these targets are likely to have broad-spectrum antiviral effect.ConclusionVery recently, some clinical trial reports preliminarily proved that Favipiravir and Remdesivir are effective for COVID-19. These clinical data provide some proof and basis for our conjecture in some degree. It is believed that the effective broad-spectrum antiviral drugs are not only helpful for the current epidemic situation, but also more beneficial for the future unpredictable epidemic situation.","output":"In Silico Identification of Nsp12 and Nsp13 as Potential Targets for Development of Broad-spectrum Antiviral Agents Against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Paediatric scurvy is uncommon in the modern age but cases have been reported in children with neurodevelopmental issues and restricted dietary habits.

RESULTS: We confirmed 518 cases of out-of-hospital stroke. During the baseline period up to February 25, 2020, the daily stroke admission rate was stable, with the slope of the regression describing the number of admissions over time equal to -0.33 (se = 1.21), not significantly different from 0 (p = 0.79), with daily admissions averaging 41. During the pandemic period, the slope was -4.4 (se = 1.00); i.e., the number of stroke admissions decreased an average of 4.4 per week, (p = 0.005), with weekly admissions averaging 23, a reduction of 44% versus baseline.

The sorption and the immobilization experiments indicated a higher sorption capacity and immobilization efficiency of Pb compared to those of Cd. The characteristics of XRD, FTIR, SEM, and XPS manifested that dissolution-precipitation, cation exchange, complexation, and cation- interaction were the main four mechanisms for the sorption of Pb2+ and Cd2+ using composite material PC1 (nHAP/BC = 1/1). From semi-quantitative analysis, the mineral effect accounted for the majority of the immobilization of Pb and Cd. Due to obvious Pb-precipitates in the sorbed material, dissolution-precipitation primarily affected the sorption of Pb using PC1, while the immobilization of Cd was mainly attributable to cation exchange. Such results corresponded to the stable Pb-precipitates and unstable Cd-compounds in soil, among which the latter was prone to be released into the environment. The sorption capacity in aqueous solutions and the immobilization efficiencies in the soil for both Pb and Cd increased with the addition of nHAP, which were linearly correlated to the nHAP proportion in the composite materials. In future practical applications, the percentages of composite materials can be designed according to the specific pollutant concentration.

Perfusion maps that were analyzed included cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time, and time to peak. Among the 10 patients with acute VST included in this study, 9 had perfusion abnormalities. All perfusion abnormalities were localized in areas adjacent to the occluded sinus and did not match typical anterior or posterior circulation arterial territories. Bilateral perfusion deficits were seen in 4 cases. In 2 cases, parenchymal hemorrhage was diagnosed on noncontrast CT imaging; in those cases, focal CBV and CBF were reduced. KEY MESSAGES Whole-brain CT perfusion imaging with 320-detector-row scanners can further assist in establishing the diagnosis of VST by detecting perfusion abnormalities corresponding to venous and not arterial territories. CT perfusion could assist in the differentiation between focal reversible changes, such as those caused by vasogenic edema, and irreversible changes due to infarction.","output":"Whole-Brain Computed Tomographic Perfusion Imaging in Acute Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Tropospheric oxidant pollutants may injure the respiratory tract. Cystic fibrosis (CF) respiratory disease involves significant inflammation and excessive oxidative stress, and exposure to air pollutants can magnify the lung damage. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between the short-term variation in the concentration of air pollutants in metropolitan S?o Paulo, Brazil, and the occurrence of respiratory exacerbations in children and adolescents with CF. Methods A longitudinal panel of repeated measurements was obtained from 103 patients attending the outpatient center of our institution from September 6, 2006 through September 4, 2007. Daily concentrations of inhaled particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone (O3), carbon monoxide, and meteorologic variables, such as the minimum temperature and relative humidity, were evaluated.

METHODS: This exploratory, retrospective analysis utilized data from the UKs Clinical Practice Research Datalink, linked to Hospital Episodes Statistics and the Office for National Statistics databases. Adults (18 years) with first RAAS inhibitor use (defined as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2014 were eligible for inclusion. Time to the first occurrence of adverse clinical outcomes [all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalization, cardiac arrhythmia, heart failure hospitalization, cardiac arrest, advancement in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage and acute kidney injury] was compared between RAAS inhibitor users with and without interruptions or cessations to treatment during follow-up.

This paper explores 1) barriers and facilitating factors associated with mental health service delivery via primary care settings during the first two pandemic waves in Quebec, Canada, and 2) recommendations to addressing these barriers. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study design was used. Semi-structured interviews with 20 participants (health managers, family physicians, mental health clinicians) were conducted and coded using a thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Barriers and facilitating factors were organized according to Chaudoir et al. (2013)s framework of structural, organizational, provider- and patient-related, as well as innovation (technological modalities for service delivery) categories. Barriers included relocation of mental health staff to non-mental health related COVID-19 tasks (structural); mental health service interruption (organizational); mental health staff on preventive/medical leave (provider); the pandemics effect on consultations (i.e., perceptions of increased demand) (patients); and challenges with the use of technological modalities (innovation). Facilitating factors included reinforcements to mental health care teams (structural); perceptions of reductions in wait times for mental health evaluations during the second wave due to diminished FP referrals in the first wave, as well as supports (i.e., management, private sector, mental health trained staff) for mental health service delivery (organizational); staffs mental health consultation practices (provider); and advantages in increasing the use of technological modalities in practice (innovation). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore barriers and facilitating factors to mental health service delivery during the pandemic in Quebec, Canada. Some barriers identified were caused by the pandemic, such as the relocation of staff to non-mental health services and mental health service interruption.

Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), especially those exploiting the PD1-PD-L1 axis, have recently been granted landmark regulatory approvals in TNBC, they provide benefit only to a subset of TNBC patients. To impact mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance to the anti-tumor immune response, novel targets such as ICOS, LAG3 and TIM3 are currently being explored at preclinical and early-phase clinical levels. AREAS COVERED This article examines the landscape of the immune therapeutics investigated in early-phase clinical trials for TNBC. Preclinical rationale is provided for each immune target, predominant expression, and function. Clinical implications and preliminary available trial results are discussed and finally, we reflect on aspects of future expectations and challenges in this field. EXPERT OPINION Several immune strategies have been investigated in TNBC, including co-inhibitory molecules beyond PD1-PD-L1 axis, co-stimulatory checkpoints, cancer vaccines, adoptive cell transfer, combination therapies, as well as different routes of administration. Most of approaches showed signs of anti-cancer activity and a good safety profile in early-phase clinical trials. Since IO provided benefit only to a small subgroup of TNBC patients so far, identifying predictive biomarkers is a priority to refine patient-selection. Data from ongoing clinical trials, with the gradually improving interpretation of the breast tumor immune environment will hopefully refine the role of new immune targets for the treatment of TNBC.","output":"Novel immune targets for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to describe the experience of teleconsultations addressed at our hospital in India during the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown. METHODS: This cross-sectional hospital-based study included 977 teleconsultations presenting between April 1(st) and May 31, 2020. A two-level protocol was implemented to triage the calls. RESULTS: Overall, 977 teleconsultation were addressed. Of the 621 teleconsultation addressed the most common queries were related to redness/pain/ watering/blurred vision/itching/irritation (52.49%), followed by queries related to medications (28.01%), appointments (18.84%) & 0.64% cited an emergency need to visit the hospital due to sudden loss of vision. The majority of the queries were directed to the department of cornea (58.93%) followed by retina (16.26%), cataract (13.04%), glaucoma (10.14%) & pediatric ophthalmology (1.61%). The most common advice given to the patient was related to medications (47.66%) followed by appointment-related queries (31.72%) & fixing of surgical appointment (20.61%). Among the 356 preterm babies that were screened, 57 (16.01%) were diagnosed with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Of them 3 required laser and 3 were given injection. CONCLUSION: Teleconsultation is here to stay beyond the pandemic. WhatsApp was the preferred modality of communication for us. Teleophthalmology has given us insights to use this evolving technology to reach out to the population at large to provide eye care services. We believe that this mode of teleophthalmology has helped us in providing feasible eye care to the patients.","output":"Impact of teleophthalmology during COVID-19 lockdown in a tertiary care center in South India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically affected residents' life. Whether the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly influenced the residents' health-promoting lifestyle, and life satisfaction is an urgent problem to be studied. Based on Health Belief Model (HBM), this paper explored and compared the responses of residents' health-promoting lifestyle and life satisfaction on the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected from a sample of 2,054 residents in Wuhan by questionnaire survey. The results show that the total score of health-promoting lifestyle after the COVID-19 pandemic has increased significantly compared with that before the COVID-19 pandemic, and the scores of all dimensions of health-promoting lifestyle have improved. Among them, the scores of exercises, self-actualization, and stress management are significantly higher than those before the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the score of residents' life satisfaction has shown a downward trend. There were also significant differences in life satisfaction on the demographic variables, such as gender, age, education level, marital status, and family average income. The findings are of great significance in promoting residents' health-promoting lifestyles and life satisfaction in the context of the extraordinary pandemic.","output":"Comparative Study on Residents' Health-Promoting Lifestyle and Life Satisfaction in Wuhan Before and After the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nature exposure is known to promote physical and mental health. However, actual nature exposure may be difficult to achieve for the population of people with physical disabilities or chronic conditions. Therefore, many attempts have been made to duplicate nature exposure via media devices, and virtual reality (VR) is deemed as a promising technology due to its advantage in creating a sense of immersion. Generally, current studies suggest that being exposed to virtual nature may contribute to psychological and physiological relaxation. Besides, some pieces of evidence indicate that virtual nature may improve attentional resources, cognitive performance, and pain experience. Although VR is deemed as an advanced media, insufficient evidence was found concerning the advantages of VR over traditional two-dimensional media when it comes to simulated nature exposure. On the other hand, computer-generated (CG) scenarios were found to be more beneficial than 360 videos, and mini-games may be useful in creating an interactive VR format for simulated nature exposure.

The computational model is shown to be complete in the sense that not only does an involutory Turing machine always compute an involution but also every involutory computable function can be computed by an involutory Turing machine. As any involution is injective (hence reversible), any involutory Turing machine forms a standard reversible Turing machine that is backward deterministic.

Currently, there are no effective vaccines against BVDV. Melatonin (MT) has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties, and the use of MF59 in vaccines significantly enhances vaccine efficiency. Here, MT and MF59 were added into the E(rns)-LTB vaccine. Subsequently, their inhibitory activity on the NF-B signaling pathway in Mardin-Darby Bovine Kidney cells and the hippocampus was assessed using western blot and quantitative reverse transcription PCR. The findings revealed that MT in the E(rns)-LTB vaccine decreases the phosphorylation of p65 proteins caused by BVDV infection. In addition, MT decreased the mRNA levels of IL-1 and IL-6 in vitro, but increased the production of IFN-, IFN-, Mx1 in vitro, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, cyclic amp response element-binding protein, and the stem cell factor in vivo. Furthermore, treatment with E(rns)-LTB + MF59 + MT stimulated the production of T lymphocytes, alleviated pathological damage, decreased expressions of BVDV antigen, and tight junction proteins in mice. These findings imply that MT has potential for use in the E(rns)-LTB vaccine to inhibit BVDV infection and regulate the immune responses of T-cells by inhibiting the NF-B signaling pathway.","output":"Melatonin as Immune Potentiator for Enhancing Subunit Vaccine Efficacy against Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To prospectively assess the early changes in the quadriceps and patellar tendons before and after total knee arthroplasty using ultrasound, shear wave elastography, and X-rays. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiographs, ultrasound, and shear wave elastography were performed on 23 patients (16 women; aged 51-85, mean 66  9 years) before and after surgery at 6 weeks and on 11 patients at 3 months. Patellar position and patellar tendon lengths were evaluated by radiography; joint effusion or synovitis, quadriceps and patellar tendon lengths, and thicknesses, echogenicity, vascularity, and stiffness were assessed with ultrasound and shear wave elastography. RESULTS: In the early postoperative period, 87% of the patients had joint effusion, and 43% had signs of synovitis. There was a significant thickening of the quadriceps tendon in 51.5% (p < .0001) and of the patellar tendon in 93.8% (p < .0001) of patients with a significant shortening of the patellar tendon in 7.8% (p < .0001). A hypoechoic defect on the medial aspect of the quadriceps tendon was found in 87% of the patients. There was a significant increase in Young's modulus in the quadriceps tendon (p = .0006) but not in the patellar tendon. CONCLUSION: The following should not be considered to be pathological findings at early postoperative imaging: joint effusion, synovitis, increasing of stiffness and thickening of quadriceps tendons by more than 50%, thickening of patellar tendon by more than 90%, focal defect through the medial aspect of the quadriceps tendon, and shortening of the patellar tendon by 8%.","output":"Sonographic and radiographic evaluation of the extensor tendons in early postoperative period after total knee arthroplasty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Loneliness and social isolation have been identified as important predictors of various health outcomes, but little research has investigated their influence on falls. This study aimed to investigate the longitudinal association between loneliness, social isolation and falls amongst older adults in England, looking at both self-reported falls and falls that require hospital admissions. This study drew on large scale, nationally representative data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing linked with Hospital Episode Statistics. Data were analysed using survival analysis, with self-reported falls (total sample = 4013) and falls require hospital admission being modelled separately (total sample = 9285). There was a 5% increase in the hazard of self-reported falls relative to one point increase in loneliness independent of socio-demographic factors (HR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02C1.08), but the association was explained away by individual differences in health and life-style measures (HR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.00C1.07). Both living alone (HR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.07C1.32) and low social contact (HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01C1.07) were associated with a greater hazard of self-reported falls even after controlling for socio-demographic, health and life-style differences.

However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no theoretical study of epidemic synchronization. In fact, in many cases, synchronization and epidemic behavior can arise simultaneously and interplay adaptively. In this paper, we first construct mathematical models of epidemic synchronization, based on traditional dynamical models on complex networks, by applying the adaptive mechanisms observed in real networks. Then, we study the relationship between the epidemic rate and synchronization stability of these models and, in particular, obtain the conditions of local and global stability for epidemic synchronization. Finally, we perform numerical analysis to verify our theoretical results. This work is the first to draw a theoretical bridge between epidemic transmission and synchronization dynamics and will be beneficial to the study of control and the analysis of the epidemics on complex networks.","output":"Adaptive mechanism between dynamical synchronization and epidemic behavior on complex networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Secreted phospholipases A(2) (sPLA(2)s) participate in a very broad spectrum of biological processes through their enzymatic activity and as ligands for membrane and soluble receptors.

Since the last overview of sPLA(2)-binding proteins (sPLA(2)-BPs) 10 years ago, several important discoveries have occurred in this area.

Three areas of physiological engagement of sPLA(2)-BPs have appeared most clearly: cellular transport and signalling, and regulation of the enzymatic activity of sPLA(2)s. Due to the multifunctionality of sPLA(2)s, they appear to be exceptional pharmacological targets.

This paper aims to present some of the challenges associated with the implementation of the sulfur cap and investigates its possible side effects as regard the drive of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Even though it would appear that the two issues (desulfurization and decarbonization) are unrelated, it turns out that there are important cross-linkages between them, which have not been examined, at least by the regulators. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review and a qualitative risk assessment of possible CO2 contributors are presented first. A cost-benefit analysis is then conducted on a specific case study, so as to assess the financial, as well as the environmental impact of two main compliance choices, in terms of CO2 and sulfur oxide. Findings: From a financial perspective, the choice of a scrubber ranks better comparing to a marine gas oil (MGO) choice because of the price difference between MGO and heavy fuel oil. However, and under different price scenarios, the scrubber choice remains sustainable only for big vessels. It is noticed that small containerships cannot outweigh the capital cost of a scrubber investment and are more sensitive in different fuel price scenarios. From an environmental perspective, scrubber ranks better than MGO in the assessment of overall emissions. Research limitations/implications: Fuel price data in this paper was based on 2019 data. As this paper was being written, the COVID-19 pandemic created a significant upheaval in global trade flows, cargo demand and fuel prices. This made any attempt to perform even a rudimentary ex-post evaluation of the 2020 sulfur cap virtually impossible. Due to limited data, such an evaluation would be extremely difficult even under normal circumstances. This paper nevertheless made a brief analysis to investigate possible COVID-19 impacts. Practical implications: The main implication is that the global sulfur cap will increase CO2 emissions. In that sense, this should be factored in the IMO greenhouse gas discussion.

In this study, we quantified changes to air quality across the United Kingdom from 30/03/2020 to 03/05/2020 (weeks 14-18), the period of most stringent travel restrictions. Daily pollutant measurements of NO2, O3 and PM2.5 from the national network of monitoring sites during this period were compared with measurements over the same period during 2017-19. Comparisons were also made with predicted concentrations for the 2020 period from business-as-usual (BAU) modelling, where the contributions of normal anthropogenic activities were estimated under the observed meteorological conditions. During the lockdown study period there was a 69% reduction in traffic overall (74% reduction in light and 35% in heavy vehicles). Measurements from 129 monitoring stations, identified mean reductions in NO2 of 38.3% (-8.8 g/m3) and PM2.5 of 16.5% (-2.2 g/m3). Improvements in NO2 and PM2.5 were largest at urban traffic sites and more modest at background locations where a large proportion of the population live. In contrast, O3 concentrations on average increased by 7.6% (+4.8 g/m3) with the largest increases at roadside sites due to reductions in local emissions of NO. A lack of VOC monitoring limited our capacity to interpret changes in O3 at urban background locations. BAU models predicted comparable NO2 reductions and O3 gains, although PM2.5 episodes would have been more prominent without lockdown. Results demonstrate the relatively modest contribution of traffic to air quality, suggesting that sustained improvements in air quality require actions across various sectors, including working with international and European initiatives on long-range transport air pollutants, especially PM2.5 and O3.","output":"Changes in air quality during COVID-19 'lockdown' in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We conducted a formative evaluation to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the safety net integrated primary care setting and to identify (and respond to) new implementation barriers prior to a hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation trial of a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment.

It recognizes several pathogens of important public health concern. In particular, a highly polymorphic variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) at the neck-region of CLEC4M had been associated with genetic predisposition to some infectious diseases. To gain insight into the origin and evolution of this VNTR in CLEC4M, we studied 21 Africans, 20 Middle Easterns, 35 Europeans, 38 Asians, 13 Oceania, and 18 Americans (a total of 290 chromosomes) from the (Human Genome Diversity Panel) HGDP-CEPH panel; these samples covered most of alleles of this VNTR locus present in human populations. We identified a limited number of haplotypes among the basic repeat subunits that is 69 base pairs in length. Only 8 haplotypes were found. Their sequence identities were determined in the 290 chromosomes. VNTR alleles of different repeat length (from 4 to 9 repeats) were analyzed for composition and orientation of these subunits. Our results showed that the subunit configuration of the same repeat number of VNTR locus from different populations were, in fact, virtually identical. It implies that most of the VNTR alleles existed before dispersion of modern humans outside Africa. Further analyses indicate that the present diversity profile of this locus in worldwide populations is generated from the effect of migration of different tribes and neutral evolution. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that the origin of the VNTR alleles were arisen by independent (separate) mutation events and caused by differential allele advantage and natural selection as suggested by previous report based on SNP data.","output":"The Origin and Evolution of Variable Number Tandem Repeat of CLEC4M Gene in the Global Human Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The rapid and accurate identification of individuals who are at high risk of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection remains a major challenge for the medical and scientific communities. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a risk prediction model for the screening of suspected cases of MERS-CoV infection in patients who have developed pneumonia. METHODS: A two-center, retrospective caseCcontrol study was performed. A total of 360 patients with confirmed pneumonia who were evaluated for MERS-CoV infection by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) between September 1, 2012 and June 1, 2016 at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh and King Fahad General Hospital in Jeddah, were included. According to the rRT-PCR results, 135 patients were positive for MERS-CoV and 225 were negative. Demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, and radiological and laboratory findings were collected for each subject. RESULTS: A risk prediction model to identify pneumonia patients at increased risk of MERS-CoV was developed. The model included male sex, contact with a sick patient or camel, diabetes, severe illness, low white blood cell (WBC) count, low alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and high aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The model performed well in predicting MERS-CoV infection (area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC) 0.8162), on internal validation (AUC 0.8037), and on a goodness-of-fit test (p = 0.592). The risk prediction model, which produced an optimal probability cut-off of 0.33, had a sensitivity of 0.716 and specificity of 0.783. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a simple, practical, and valid algorithm to identify pneumonia patients at increased risk of MERS-CoV infection. This risk prediction model could be useful for the early identification of patients at the highest risk of MERS-CoV infection. Further validation of the prediction model on a large prospective cohort of representative patients with pneumonia is necessary.","output":"Early identification of pneumonia patients at increased risk of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To identify whether COVID-19-related changes to how long pregnant women planned to work in pregnancy were associated with depression. Methods: : An online convenience sample of pregnant women in the U.S. were recruited in April-May 2020 (N = 1,970) through social media and dissemination to U.S.-based maternal health contacts. We used multivariate logistic regression to evaluate whether COVID-19-related changes to pregnant womens work-plans were associated with clinically-significant prenatal depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Survey score >=15), adjusting for covariates. Results: : Of the 1,600 eligible participants without missing data, 29.6% of participants (N = 473) reported that they experienced a COVID-19-related work-plan change, while 22.1% (N = 350) of participants had a clinically-significant EPDS score. Women were more likely to report a work-plan change if they were younger (t(1598) = 2.90, p<0.004), had a lower household income (? 2 (2) = 29.63, p<0.001), were less educated (? 2 (2) = 27.48, p<0.001), were farther along in pregnancy (t(1598) = -4.96, p<0.001), and worked outside the home during COVID-19 (? 2 (2) = 59.27, p<0.001).

METHODS We used administrative claims data to identify residents in a single Japanese prefecture who were enrolled in National Health Insurance and Elderly Health Insurance from April 2012 to March 2017 and experienced Achilles tendon rupture after receiving an antibiotic prescription. Antibiotics were categorized into 3 groups: first- and second-generation fluoroquinolones, third-generation fluoroquinolones, and nonfluoroquinolones. We used a conditional Poisson regression model to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of Achilles tendon rupture during the antibiotic exposure period relative to the nonexposure period for each patient. An exposure period was defined as 30 days from start of the prescription. RESULTS Analyses were based on 504 patients with Achilles tendon rupture who had received antibiotic prescriptions. Risk of rupture was not significantly elevated during exposure to third-generation fluoroquinolones (IRR = 1.05; 95% CI, 0.33-3.37) and nonfluoroquinolones (IRR = 1.08; 95% CI, 0.80-1.47). In contrast, risk was significantly elevated during exposure to first- and second-generation fluoroquinolones (IRR = 2.94; 95% CI, 1.90-4.54). Findings were similar across subgroups stratified by sex and by recent corticosteroid use.

At this time, diagnosis is based on the positivity of specific RT-PCR and/or chest computed tomography scan, which are time-consuming and may delay diagnosis. Complete blood count (CBC) can potentially contribute to the diagnosis of COVID-19. We studied whether the analysis of cellular population data (CPD), provided as part of CBC-Diff analysis by the DxH 800 analyzers (Beckman Coulter), can help to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Cellular population data of the different leukocyte subpopulations were analyzed in 137 controls, 322 patients with proven COVID-19 (COVID+), and 285 patients for whom investigations were negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-). When CPD of COVID+ were different from controls and COVID- patients, we used receiver operating characteristic analysis to test the discriminating capacity of the individual parameters. Using a random forest classifier, we developed the algorithm based on the combination of 4 monocyte CPD to discriminate COVID+ from COVID- patients. This algorithm was tested prospectively in a series of 222 patients referred to the emergency unit. RESULTS: Among the 222 patients, 86 were diagnosed as COVID-19 and 60.5% were correctly identified using the discriminating protocol. Among the 136 COVID- patients, 10.3% were misclassified (specificity 89.7%, sensitivity 60.5%).

The analysis focuses on the first wave of the pandemic, until the end of 2020, and the more recent wave. Overall, the results suggest that when the two recent waves of the pandemic are compared, different spatial patterns in the distribution of deaths across the country by sex and by age emerge. While the distribution of deaths is found to be concentrated at older ages, we also observe in the more recent period some areas of the country with a concentration of deaths among younger adults. The analysis further indicates that even in areas with a younger population age structure, which could act as a protective factor against complications, the age pattern of mortality is very heterogeneous, and we do not find a clearly defined age and spatial pattern.

Hybridoma cells between HeLa and 293T cells were as susceptible as 293T cells, suggesting that cellular factors enhance the mNDK infection in 293T cells. By screening a cDNA expression library in HeLa cells, cystatin C was isolated as an enhancer of the mNDK infection. Because cathepsin B protease, a natural ligand of cystatin C, was upregulated in HeLa cells, we speculated that the high levels of cathepsin B activities were inhibitory to the CD4-independent infection and that cystatin C enhanced the infection by impairing the excessive cathepsin B activity. Consistent with this idea, pretreatment of HeLa cells with 125 M of CA-074Me, a cathepsin B inhibitor, resulted in an 8-fold enhancement of the mNDK infectivity. Because cathepsin B is activated by low pH in acidic endosomes, we further examined the potential roles of endosomes in the CD4-independent infection. Suppression of endosome acidification or endocytosis by inhibitors or by an Eps15 dominant negative mutant reduced the infectivity of mNDK in which CD4-dependent infections were not significantly impaired.

In this study we introduce layer-by-layer deposition of silicon-titanium layered oxide (Si-Ti LO) thin films using combined MLD-ALD methodology (M/ALD). The Si-Ti LO film deposition is achieved by acid-base catalysis establishing an overall catalytic tandem M/ALD super cycle (CT-M/ALD). The catalytic nature of the process allows relatively fast deposition cycles under mild conditions compared with the typical cycle time and conditions required for ALD processes with silane precursors. The Si-Ti LO thin films exhibit tuneable refractive index and electrical conductivities. The refractive index is set by the stoichiometry of Si- to Ti-oxide phases simply by selecting the MLD to ALD proportion in the CT-M/ALD super cycle, with low and high refractive index, respectively. Thermal treatment of Si-Ti LO thin films resulted in conductive thin films with both graphitic and Magnli oxide phases. Enhanced conductivity and reduced onset temperature for Magnli phase formation were obtained owing to the unique Si-Ti layer structure and stoichiometry attained by the CT-M/ALD process and facilitated by breaking of Si-C bonds and Red-Ox reactions between the Si sub-oxide and TiO2 phases leading to the conductive Magnli phase. Hence, the embedded amine silane functions not only for catalysing Si-Ti LO deposition but also to further promote subsequent transformations during thermal processing. This work demonstrates the concept of embedding a meta-stable organic motif by the MLD step to facilitate transformation of an oxide phase by taking advantage of precise layer-by-layer deposition of alternating phases enabled by M/ALD.","output":"Layered Si-Ti oxide thin films with tailored electrical and optical properties by catalytic tandem MLD-ALD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus is an enveloped, non-segmented, positive-polarity and single-stranded RNA virus.

Prior history of pandemic vaccine coverage was as low as 40% among children in the United States during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Purpose To investigate predictors associated with global caregivers intent to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, when the vaccine becomes available. Method An international cross sectional survey of 1541 caregivers arriving with their children to 16 pediatric Emergency Departments (ED) across six countries from March 26 to May 31, 2020. Results 65% (n = 1005) of caregivers reported that they intend to vaccinate their child against COVID-19, once a vaccine is available. A univariate and subsequent multivariate analysis found that increased intended uptake was associated with children that were older, children with no chronic illness, when fathers completed the survey, children up-to-date on their vaccination schedule, recent history of vaccination against influenza, and caregivers concerned their child had COVID-19 at the time of survey completion in the ED. The most common reason reported by caregivers intending to vaccinate was to protect their child (62%), and the most common reason reported by caregivers refusing vaccination was the vaccines novelty (52%). Conclusions The majority of caregivers intend to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, though uptake will likely be associated with specific factors such as child and caregiver demographics and vaccination history.

The aim of this study was to audit the outcomes of the management of AA in a district general hospital during the pandemic. METHOD: The prospective data was collected for all patients treated for AA from 12/03/2020 to 18/05/2020. The primary objective was the failure rate of conservative management requiring surgical intervention. Statistical analysis was performed using JASP software. RESULTS: There were 22 patients included. 19 (86%) were managed conservatively of which 4 (21%) patients failed and progressed to surgery and 3 (14%) patients had appendicectomy on admission. 3 patients (20%) treated non-operatively were readmitted within median 4 days (4-6); 2 (13%) of them developed appendix mass. None of the patients had positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Median length of stay (LOS) was 3.5 (1-8) days; 4 (3-8) days in the immediate appendicectomy group, 3 (1-7) in the group managed conservatively. CONCLUSIONS: The sample size was small hence it is difficult to draw any solid conclusions. We feel that appendicectomy should remain standard treatment for AA. However, antibiotics should be considered as the first line during the pandemic.","output":"110 The Results of Treatment of Acute Appendicitis During COVID-19 Pandemic in A District General Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To review the current best surgical practice and detail a multi-disciplinary approach that could further reduce joint replacement infection.

We find that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa endonuclease YbeY is required for rRNA processing and the bacterial virulence in a murine acute pneumonia model. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that knocking out the ybeY gene results in downregulation of oxidative stress response genes, including the catalase genes katA and katB Consistently, the ybeY mutant is more susceptible to H2O2 and neutrophil-mediated killing. Overexpression of katA restores the bacterial tolerance to H2O2 and neutrophil killing as well as virulence. We further find that the downregulation of the oxidative stress response genes is due to defective expression of the stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS. We demonstrate an autoregulatory mechanism of RpoS and find that ybeY mutation increases the level of a small RNA, ReaL, which directly represses the translation of rpoS through the 5' UTR of its mRNA and subsequently reduces the expression of the oxidative stress response genes. In vitro assays demonstrate direct degradation of ReaL by YbeY. Deletion of reaL or overexpression of rpoS in the ybeY mutant restores the bacterial tolerance to oxidative stress and the virulence. We also demonstrate that YbeZ binds to YbeY and is involved in the 16S rRNA processing and regulation of reaL and rpoS as well as the bacterial virulence. Overall, our results reveal pleiotropic roles of YbeY and the YbeY-mediated regulation of rpoS through ReaL.IMPORTANCE The increasing bacterial antibiotic resistance imposes a severe threat to human health. For the development of effective treatment and prevention strategies, it is critical to understand the mechanisms employed by bacteria to grow in the human body. Posttranscriptional regulation plays an important role in bacterial adaptation to environmental changes. RNases and small RNAs are key players in this regulation. In this study, we demonstrate critical roles of the RNase YbeY in the virulence of the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa We further identify the small RNA ReaL as the direct target of YbeY and elucidate the YbeY-regulated pathway on the expression of bacterial virulence factors. Our results shed light on the complex regulatory network of P. aeruginosa and indicate that inference with the YbeY-mediated regulatory pathway might be a valid strategy for the development of a novel treatment strategy.","output":"Endoribonuclease YbeY Is Essential for RNA Processing and Virulence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has transformed almost every facet of human society throughout the world.

Relying on liberal political theorys account of the importance of decisional autonomy for adults, and given the scalar nature of the capacities needed to exercise decisional autonomy, I argue that mature minors with the requisite capacities and commitments have a right to decisional autonomy though they are not yet 18. I argue for this right using a balancing of interest account of rights: the interest mature minors have in decisional autonomy outweighs their parents interest in shaping their children as a means of creative self-extension. But I propose two limitations on this right: requests for waivers of the rule that one must be at least 18 to decide cannot be so numerous as to make adjudication impractical; and though a competent adults voluntary decision to refuse medical treatment should generally be respected, the state may reject a mature minors decision upon review by an indifferent judge of the minors capacities and reasons. The judge reviews not the substantive merits or prudence of the decision, but whether the decision promotes the interest in decisional autonomy, by asking among other things whether the decision is the minors own, is tethered to core commitments rather than based on arbitrary preferences, and could be regarded as reasonable to the minors future self.","output":"State Authority, Parental Authority, and the Rights of Mature Minors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread to more than 200 countries. Thus far, reports regarding multi-center data from throughout gestation in women with COVID-19 and newborn outcomes are scarce. Methods: : We retrospectively reviewed data from 92 pregnant women with COVID-19 (PW-COVID-19) and their 78 newborns from 27 hospitals in 12 regions of Hubei, China. The demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic data and pregnancy, perinatal, and neonatal outcomes were analyzed. Follow-up was censored until April 7, 2020. Findings: Median maternal age was 31.0 years (IQR 280-330), with nine patients in the first trimester, five in the second trimester, and 78 in the third trimester. None of the patients died, and most (924%) recovered and were discharged. Seventy-five deliveries (including three sets of twins) comprised 66 cesarean sections and nine vaginal deliveries, with 21 preterm and 57 full-term infants. Seventeen live births had radiological findings of pulmonary infection. One newborn tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, and three newborns were viral antibody-positive: two IgG (+) and IgM (-), and one IgG (+) and IgM (+). The median suspected duration of virus exposure was 7 days (IQR 0 to 27). Interpretation: Compared to the pregnant women with other viral infections, such as SARS, MERS, and Zika virus infection, PW-COVID-19 had similar manifestations and relatively better outcomes. The termination time and delivery mode in PW-COVID-19 should be evaluated based on both the maternal and fetal situations.

We argue that the migrational and sociocultural background influences general attitudes toward health and political/public institutions. The effects of these general attitudes on vaccination intentions are mediated by fears of infection. Additionally, we analyze a migrant-only model including acculturation variables (years since migration, foreign and host country media consumption) and region of origin (European vs. Non-European). Design: The data (n = 1027) stem from an online access panel collected between March 15 and March 25, 2021. Quotas for gender and age were set according the online population of Germany. The use of an oversampling framework for first generation migrants resulted in a sample with 50% first generation migrants and 50% native Germans without migration background. Models were calculated using a Structural Equation Modeling approach. RESULTS: Migration background both increases and decreases antecedents of vaccination intentions. Being a migrant increases positive antecedents like religiosity, which in turn positively influence general attitudes and thus fears of infection and vaccination intentions. But being a migrant has also a significant direct negative association with vaccination intentions, implying missing mediators. Increasing years since migration increase host country (German) media consumption and decrease consumption of media from the country of origin. Both media variables are positively associated with political trust and health consciousness. Additionally, European compared to Non-European migrants have less political trust, fear of personal infection and lower vaccination intentions on the whole. CONCLUSIONS: The study found that vaccination intentions can be understood by applying the proposed hypothetical structure. We found complex associations of the migration and sociocultural background and COVID-19 vaccination intentions, where antecedents of vaccination intentions are both increased and decreased by migration background and migration specific factors.","output":"How Does Migration Background Affect COVID-19 Vaccination Intentions?

Healthcare professionals have been particularly vulnerable because of the unprecedented shortage of Facepiece Respirators (FPRs), which act as fundamental tools to protect the medical staff treating the coronavirus patients. In addition, many FPRs are designed to be disposable single-use devices, creating an issue related to the generation of large quantities of non-biodegradable waste. In this contribution, we describe a plasma-based decontamination technique designed to circumvent the shortages of FPRs and alleviate the environmental problems posed by waste generation. The system utilizes a Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) to generate ozone and feed it through the fibers of the FPRs. The flow-through configuration is different than canonical ozone-based sterilization methods, in which the equipment is placed in a sealed ozone-containing enclosure without any flow through the mask polymer fibers. We demonstrate the rapid decontamination of surgical masks using Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) as model pathogens, with the flow-through configuration providing a drastic reduction in sterilization time compared to the canonical approach. We also demonstrate that there is no deterioration in mask structure or filtration efficiency resulting from sterilization. Finally, we show that this decontamination approach can be implemented using readily available tools, such as a plastic box, a glass tube, few 3D printed components, and the high-voltage power supply from a plasma globe toy. The prototype assembled for this study is portable and affordable, with effectiveness comparable to that of larger and more expensive equipment.","output":"Efficient facemask decontamination via forced ozone convection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is a highly infectious and fatal pneumonia-type disease that poses a great threat to the public safety of society.

In Ghana, education of pharmacists started in the 1880s with the training of dispensers in a government hospital. Over the years, the curriculum and institutional arrangements changed and currently pharmacists are trained in universities. In this study we explored how and why education of pharmacists evolved in Ghana. METHODS: We used a case study design to systematically describe education of pharmacists reforms. Data was collected from October 2018 and December 2019 through document review and in-depth interviews. The data was analysed based on institutional arrangements and contextual factors influencing reforms from the 1880s through 2012, when the Doctor of pharmacy programme was initiated in Ghana. RESULTS: Reforms occurred around four main periods when institutional arrangements including the certificate awarded and expected roles were modified by educators and government. These are: (1) the Certificate of dispensing with dispenser-in-training and nurse-dispenser schemes (1880s to 1942), when dispensers were trained to assist doctors in dispensing or directly diagnosing and treating specific disease conditions. (2) the Diploma and Certificate of competency with the dispenser-in-training and pupil pharmacist schemes (1943 to 1960), where in addition to existing roles, pharmacists operated village dispensers. (3) the Bachelor of pharmacy degree (1961 to 2017), when pharmacists were trained mainly as medicines experts with a strong science base on all aspects of medicines from production, distribution and use; and over time with a gradual move to patient-oriented practice. (4) the Doctor of pharmacy degree (2012 to date), where in addition to existing roles, trainees are exposed to advance professional practice experiences. Important factors influencing the reforms included, health systems demands for village dispensaries and clinically oriented pharmacists, and harmonization with regional and international training and practice. CONCLUSION: Reasons influencing education of pharmacists reforms are context specific and are driven by historical experiences, national and international expectations as well as educators and regulators abilities to influence change. These reforms call for direct corresponding change in professional practice laws and regulation to enable pharmacists contribute fully to health care delivery in Ghana.","output":"Education of pharmacists in Ghana: evolving curriculum, context and practice in the journey from dispensing certificate to doctor of pharmacy certificate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced leaders to reconsider the various factors that attribute to work-life balance, a healthy work environment, and resilience among nurses.

Children were diagnosed with pneumococcal empyema if the pleural fluid tested positive for quantitative pneumococcal (lytA) detection by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Pneumococcal empyema cases were further divided into 4 groups according to necrosis severity: (0) nonnecrosis, (1) mild necrosis, (2) cavitation and (3) bronchopleural fistula. Nasopharyngeal and pleural pneumococcal load, as well as levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8), Th1-(IL-2, IFN-), Th2-(IL-4, IL-10) and Th17-cytokines (IL-17), in the pleural fluid was measured. RESULTS Serotypes 19A and 3 accounted for 69.4% and 12.5%, respectively, of 72 cases of pneumococcal empyema. Pleural pneumococcal load was significantly higher in serotypes 19A and 3 infection than in the other strains causing infection (P = 0.006). There was a correlation between nasopharyngeal and pleural pneumococcal load ( = 0.35; P = 0.05).

Factors significantly associated with poor mental wellbeing in the sample were: type of disability, nationality, peer relationships, connection to others during the pandemic, knowledge about COVID-19, worry about the long-term impact of COVID-19, and the types of self-isolating. Conclusion The results show that participants who self-reported low levels of COVID-19 health literacy also scored low on the mental wellbeing self-assessment. Yet, despite undoubted limited resources, these CYP are doing well in identifying their needs and maintaining hope in the face of the problems associated with COVID-19 in countries where stigma persists around mental ill-health.","output":"Mental Health and Wellbeing Implications of the COVID-19 Quarantine for Disabled and Disadvantaged Children and Young People: Evidence from a Cross-cultural Study in Zambia and Sierra Leone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 virus spread over the world, governments restricted mobility to slow transmission. Public health measures had different intensities across European countries but all had significant impact on peoples daily lives and economic activities, causing a drop of CO2 emissions of about 10% for the whole year 2020. Here, we analyze changes in natural gas use in the industry and built environment sectors during the first half of year 2020 with daily gas flows data from pipeline and storage facilities in Europe. We find that reductions of industrial gas use reflect decreases in industrial production across most countries. Surprisingly, natural gas use in buildings also decreased despite most people being confined at home and cold spells in March 2020. Those reductions that we attribute to the impacts of COVID-19 remain of comparable magnitude to previous variations induced by cold or warm climate anomalies in the cold season.

In particular, Mezirows concept of disorienting dilemmas was used to engage with the dilemmas the ECCE teachers were confronted with during the pandemic. Further, his concept of perspective transformations was used to analyze how the ECCE teachers engaged with these dilemmas to transform their teaching. Findings show that while ECCE teachers faced disorienting dilemmas of digital inequity and of childrens interactive play, they also adopted alternative roles and actions as they engaged in dialogue and shared negotiations, ensuring that the functioning of the ECCE centre would continue in solidarity with the children and parents.

A particularly severe diffusion of the virus has affected Italy and in particular its northern regions. This is resulting in a high demand of hospitalization with a particular attention on the intensive care units (ICUs). Hospitals are suffering the high degree of patients to be treated for respiratory diseases and the majority of the structures located in the north of Italy are or are going to be saturated. This has led the actual and past national and regional governments to be heavily criticized for reducing in the past years the number of beds, in particular those located in the ICUs across the country. Aim of this study is to analyse the availability of hospital beds across the country as well as to determine their management in terms of complexity and performance of cases treated at regional level. The results of this study underlines that, despite the reduction of beds for the majority of the hospital wards, ICUs availabilities did not change between 2010 and 2017. Moreover, this study confirms that the majority of the Italian regions efficiently manage these structural facilities allowing hospitals to treat patients without the risk of having an overabundance of patients and a scarcity of beds.

Understanding the predictors of severe disease and mortality in COVID-19 patients will help to risk stratify patients and improve clinical decision making. US data to inform this understanding are, however, scarce. We studied predictors of COVID-19 mortality in a cohort of 1,116 hospitalized patients in Southern California in the United States. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients admitted at two hospitals in Southern California United States between March 2020 and March 2021. Bivariate and multivariate analyses of the relationship between mortality and other variables such as demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory values were performed, with a p-value of 0.05 considered as significant. Results The analysis involved 1,116 COVID-19 patients, of which 51.5% were males and 48.5% were females. Of the 1,116 patients, 81.6% were whites, 7.2% were blacks, and 11.2% were other races. After adjusting for co-variables, age (p<0.001), admission to intensive care unit (p< 0.001), use of remdesivir (p=0.018), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (p<0.001), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (p=0.039) were independently associated with mortality in our study. Gender, race, body mass index, presence of co-morbidities such as diabetes and hypertension, and use of steroid, statin, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers were not associated with mortality in the multivariate analysis.

We present a strategy to evaluate surveillance of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) using simulated testing of bulk milk in an infectious disease spread model. MAP is a globally distributed, chronic infectious disease with substantial animal health impact. Designing surveillance for this disease poses specific challenges because methods for surveillance evaluation have focused on estimating surveillance system sensitivity and probability of freedom from disease and do not account for spread of disease or complex and changing population structure over long periods. The aims of the study were to 1. define a model that describes the spread of MAP within and between Swedish herds; 2. define a method for simulation of imperfect diagnostic testing in this framework; 3. to compare surveillance strategies to support surveillance design choices. The results illustrate how this approach can be used to identify differences between the probability of detecting disease in the population based on choices of the number of herds sampled and the use of risk-based or random selection of these herds. The approach was also used to assess surveillance to detect introduction of disease and to detect a very low prevalence endemic state. The use of bulk milk sampling was determined to be an effective method to detect MAP in the population with as few as 500 herds tested per year if the herd-level prevalence was 0.2%. However, detection of point introductions in the population was unlikely in the 13-year simulation period even if as many as 2000 herds were tested per year. Interestingly, the use of a risk-based selection strategy was found to be a disadvantage to detect MAP given the modelled disease dynamics.","output":"Modelling spread and surveillance of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis in the Swedish cattle trade network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current, rapidly diversifying pandemic has accelerated the need for efficient and effective identification of potential drug candidates for COVID-19.

RECENT FINDINGS: The COVID-19 literature has rapidly expanded and includes 17a998 publications through May of 2020, 1543 of which also address rheumatic disease-related topics. Specific obstacles to acquiring high-quality information have arisen, including 'pandemic research exceptionalism' and a 'parallel pandemic' of misinformation. Unique challenges to rheumatologists include specific interest in antirheumatic disease therapies and a paucity of rheumatology-specific information. Patients with rheumatic diseases have faced shortages of critical medications and a lack of information tailored to their health conditions and medications.

The strategy to use the immune system as an approach for treating cancer has recently gained momentum. Messenger RNA (mRNA) has been assessed as an up-and-coming resource for the evolution of advanced cancer immunotherapies over the past decades. However, degradation in extracellular compartments and during endosomal escape remain obstacles for efficient mRNA delivery and limit the therapeutic applications of this approach. AREA COVERED: Lipid-based nanocarriers are gaining significant attention as non-viral mRNA vectors. Various lipid-based nanocarrier types have been developed to enhance the stability of mRNA molecules, facilitate their transfection, and ensure delivery to an intracellular compartment suitable for further processing. This review discusses the development of novel mRNA delivery systems using lipids for effective cancer immunotherapy. EXPERT OPINION: mRNAs are superior to other biomolecules for developing therapeutic drugs and vaccines with multiple medical applications that are currently being explored by researchers in various biomedical fields. Lipid-based mRNA nanoparticles can improve the potency of the mRNA by enhancing its stability, enabling its cellular uptake, and facilitating its endosomal escape. Targetability of these therapeutics can be increased by conjugating their surface with the desired ligands or targeting agents. LipidCmRNA nanoparticles are increasingly being incorporated in cancer immunotherapy applications, including vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell treatment, and several such nanoparticles are being assessed in clinical trials.

Nevertheless, the challenges associated with the use of observational data can undermine the results of the studies. ObjectiveTo assess the feasibility of using observational data for vaccine effectiveness studies by examining granular weekly effectiveness. Design, Settings and ParticipantsIn this retrospective cohort study, we used Columbia University Medical Center data linked to State and City Immunization Registries to assess the weekly effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. We conducted manual chart review of cases in week one in both groups along with a set of sensitivity analyses for Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen vaccines. Main Outcomes and MeasuresWe used propensity score matching with up to 54,987 covariates and fitted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios and constructed Kaplan-Meier plots for two main outcomes (COVID-19 infection and COVID-19-associated hospitalization). ResultsThe study included 179,666 patients. We observed increasing effectiveness after the first dose of mRNA vaccines with week 6 effectiveness approximating 84% (95% CI 72-91%) for COVID-19 infection and 86% (95% CI 69-95) for COVID-19-associated hospitalization. When analyzing unexpectedly high effectiveness in week one, chart review revealed that vaccinated patients are less likely to seek care after vaccination and are more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 during the encounters for other conditions. Sensitivity analyses showed potential outcome misclassification for COVID-19 ICD10-CM diagnosis and the influence of excluding patients with prior COVID-19 infection and anchoring in the unexposed group. Overall vaccine effectiveness analysis in fully vaccinated patients matched the results of the randomized trials. Conclusions and RelevanceObservational data can be used to ascertain vaccine effectiveness if potential biases are accounted for. The data need to be scrutinized to ensure that compared groups exhibit similar health seeking behavior and are equally likely to be captured in the data.

Knockdown efficacy of IL-4 siRNA molecules was analyzed in the human HEK293T cell line by cotransfection of six different siRNAs with a plasmid carrying mouse IL-4. The most potent siRNA was then used in a mouse model of RSV-induced asthma exacerbation. BALB/c mice were sensitized intraperitoneally with ovalbumin (OVA) and then infected 12 days later intranasally with RSV Long strain (110(6) TCID50/mouse), followed 1 day later by intranasal challenge with OVA for 3 days. Mice were pretreated intranasally three times with either siRNA to IL-4 or GFP control, 2 days before, and on the first two OVA challenge days. siRNAs to RSV or rhinovirus control were inoculated intranasally once, 3 hr before RSV infection. Combined anti-IL-4 and anti-RSV siRNAs were able to significantly reduce total cell counts and eosinophilia in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, development of airway hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation and to downregulate IL-4 mRNA expression and RSV viral RNA, but to upregulate IFN- levels in lung tissues.

The biopsy showed a squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva, and imaging studies showed orbital invasion cT4bN0cM0, so surgery was indicated. The surgery was done with macroscopic margins of 5 mm. After resection, a radial free flap reconstruction was performed. Adjuvant treatment with radiotherapy was performed without complications. After six months, the patient manifested an improvement in his quality of life, and there is no evidence of relapse. DISCUSSION: The prevalence of squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva is low. The most important risk factor is exposure to UV rays. Most are derived from conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasms. There are topical management protocols with chemotherapeutic agents and in patients with ocular or orbital invasion, enucleation and exanteration are the treatments of choice.

Identifying causal risk factors is critical to inform preventive strategies aimed at modifying disease risk. Objective: We sought to evaluate the causal associations of cardiometabolic conditions with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Design: Two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) Study. Setting: Population-based cohorts that contributed to the genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Participants: Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 diagnosed by RNA PCR, serologic testing, or clinician diagnosis. Population controls defined as anyone who was not a case in the cohorts. Exposures: Selected genetic variants associated with 17 cardiometabolic diseases, including diabetes, coronary artery disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, and BMI, at p<5 x 10-8 from published largescale GWAS. Main outcomes: We performed an inverse-variance weighted averages of variant-specific causal estimates for susceptibility, defined as people who tested positive for COVID-19 vs. population controls, and severity, defined as patients hospitalized with COVID-19 vs. population controls, and repeated the analysis for BMI using effect estimates from UKBB. To estimate direct and indirect causal effects of BMI through obesity-related cardiometabolic diseases, we performed pairwise multivariable MR. We used p<0.05/17 exposure/2 outcomes=0.0015 to declare statistical significance. Results: Genetically increased BMI was causally associated with testing positive for COVID-19 [6,696 cases / 1,073,072 controls; p=6.7 x 10-4, odds ratio and 95% confidence interval 1.08 (1.03, 1.13) per kg/m2] and a higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization [3,199 cases/897,488 controls; p=8.7 x 10-4, 1.12 (1.04, 1.21) per kg/m2]. In the multivariable MR, the direct effect of BMI was abolished upon conditioning on the effect on type 2 diabetes but persisted when conditioning on the effects on coronary artery disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, and c-reactive protein. No other cardiometabolic exposures tested were associated with a higher risk of poorer COVID-19 outcomes.

Call data from poison centers are uploaded in near real-time to NPDS. During January-March 2020, poison centers received 45,550 exposure calls related to cleaners (28,158) and disinfectants (17,392), representing overall increases of 20.4% and 16.4% from January-March 2019 (37,822) and January-March 2018 (39,122), respectively. Although NPDS data do not provide information showing a definite link between exposures and COVID-19 cleaning efforts, there appears to be a clear temporal association with increased use of these products.","output":"Cleaning and Disinfectant Chemical Exposures and Temporal Associations with COVID-19 - National Poison Data System, United States, January 1, 2020-March 31, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study evaluated for the first time the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 2115 blood donors from Romania.

Bioaerosol exposure has a significant impact on human health. Therefore, this research focused on systematical investigation of Staphylococcus aureus bioaerosol emission characteristics in an indoor toilet after flushing with time. Then, annual probability of infection and disease burden with time under various ventilation scenarios were determined using a Monte Carlo simulation-based quantitative microbial risk assessment. The results showed that at the initial phase, the highest and lowest bioaerosol concentrations were found in poor and combined ventilation scenarios, respectively. The bioaerosol concentration in natural ventilation scenario was 1.1 times higher than that in mechanical ventilation scenario. However, a decreasing trend was observed after flushing. The adult male's health risks were consistently higher than those of all other exposed persons. However, the maximum and minimum health risks were observed in the poor and combined ventilation scenario, respectively. The health risks in the mechanical ventilation scenario were lower than those in the natural ventilation scenario. However, the health infection risk varied with time: it was unbearable to the U.S. Envi-ronmental Protection Agency benchmark at 0 min-15 min after flushing, but it was tolerable after flushing 35 min. Moreover, the disease health burdens were below the World Health Organization benchmark after flushing 20 min to 35 min.

Cheaper and faster alternatives, such as antigen and paper-strip tests, have been proposed. They return results rapidly, but have lower sensitivity thresholds for detecting virus. To quantify the effects of the tradeoffs between sensitivity, cost, testing frequency, and delay in test return on the overall course of an outbreak, we built a multi-scale immuno-epidemiological model that connects the virus profile of infected individuals with transmission and testing at the population level. We investigated various randomized testing strategies and found that, for fixed testing capacity, lower sensitivity tests with shorter return delays slightly flatten the daily incidence curve and delay the time to the peak daily incidence. However, compared with RT-PCR testing, they do not always reduce the cumulative case count at half a year into the outbreak. When testing frequency is increased to account for the lower cost of less sensitive tests, we observe a large reduction in cumulative case counts, from 55.4% to as low as 1.22% half a year into the outbreak. The improvement is preserved even when the testing budget is reduced by one half or one third.

Patients with COVID-19 are at high risk for thrombotic occlusions of the arteries and veins. There are many ways that explain the high risk of thrombosis in COVID-19, they are conditionally divided into two main categories: mechanisms in which the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is involved and mechanisms that affect the regulation of the immune response. It is assumed that the uncom-plicated course of the disease is characterized by endothelial dysfunction, but if the process progresses with a pronounced immune response, plasma coagulation factors may also be involved, which significantly increases the risks of thromboembolic complications. The use of combined hormonal contraception (CHC) in the current conditions raises a number of concerns. According to some researchers, disorders of the hemostasis system observed in patients with COVID-19 may worsen while taking CHC and increase the risk of thromboembolic complications, which is especially important in severe disease with prolonged immobilization. However, with the use of CHC, the increase in thrombotic risks is explained primarily by changes in the plasma component of the hemostasis sys-tem. At first glance, the recommendations to stop hormone therapy with confirmed COVID-19 seem logical, but they are based only on the procoagulant activity of estrogens, and not on real evidence. In patients with COVID-19, the increase in coagulation is associated with massive damage to the vascular endothelium (the so-called ?external? coagulation pathway) and the immune response, and not with a primary increase in the level of coagulation factors per se. At the same time, stopping the intake of estrogens deprives the patient of their important protective effect. Thus, it became necessary to develop clinical guidelines for the management of women using contraception in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. ? 2021, Remedium Group Ltd.

It will still take several years for full maturation of databases required for robust epidemiological studies. Therefore, this review on the implications for neuro-ophthalmology draws on resources presently available including reported adverse reactions to vaccination. Illustrative clinical cases are presented.The spectrum of pathology following infection with SARS-CoV-2 falls into 4 main categories: autoimmune, vascular, sequelae of brain damage, and miscellaneous. This review is exhaustive, but the most common conditions discussed relate to headaches and associated symptoms; vertigo, diplopia, and nystagmus; vascular complications of the eye and brain; cranial nerve (mono-)neuropathies; photophobia, ocular discomfort, and optic neuritis. Of the 36 main adverse reactions reviewed, vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia is a novel complication requiring specific hematological management.

However, only 44% of infants aged 0-6 months are exclusively breastfed worldwide and, in the United States, only 26% of infants are exclusively breastfed for 6 months. The restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic may have reduced these rates even further. RESEARCH AIM: To examine the differences in breastfeeding exclusivity and satisfaction before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional, two-group survey design was used. Parents (N = 110) of infants born April 1 to December 31, 2019 (pre-pandemic; n = 69), or April 1 to December 31, 2020 (during the pandemic; n = 41), who received lactation support services from an urban academic breastfeeding clinic were surveyed. RESULTS: Respondents who gave birth in 2020 (pandemic year) were no less likely to exclusively breastfeed for the first 6 months of their infant's life compared to respondents who gave birth in 2019 (pre-pandemic year). After multivariable logistic regression, the odds of high breastfeeding satisfaction were 73% lower in respondents with infants born in 2020 than in respondents with infants born in 2019 (OR = 0.27, 95% CI [0.08, 0.89]). The strongest contributor to high breastfeeding satisfaction was a prenatal breastfeeding visit with an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant.

Therefore, the study aims to investigate the creative approaches that art and design educators adopted to transition to remote teaching. The study involved conducting an online focus group with eleven art and design educators at The University of Bahrain to investigate the experiences, perceptions, and the challenges they faced while teaching art and design remotely during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The focus group engaged the educators in a semi-structured discussion in order to gather qualitative data that would allow for a descriptive analysis of their online teaching experiences and the most effective approaches they implemented. Thus, the study is undertaken to determine the most effective practices that can be employed by educators to engage students and enhance the distance learning process in an art and design online environment.

We aimed to evaluate the changes of frequency of CD14(+)HLA-DR(lo/neg) MDSCs, a population of cells with potent immunosuppressive capacity, in COVID-19 patients. Methods: The levels of CD14(+)HLA-DR(lo/neg) MDSCs were determined by flow cytometry in 27 COVID-19 patients, and their association with clinical characteristics and laboratory data were analyzed. Results: The frequency of CD14(+)HLA-DR(lo/neg) MDSCs was elevated in COVID-19 patients, particularly severe patients. A follow-up comparison revealed a decline of CD14(+)HLA-DR(lo/neg) MDSCs percentages in most patients 1 day after testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, but the levels of CD14(+)HLA-DR(lo/neg) MDSCs were still greater than 50.0% in 3 ICU patients 4-10 days after negative SARS-CoV-2 results.

Patients and methods We conducted a retrospective, descriptive, observational, multicentre study of patients with symptoms compatible with encephalitis or encephalopathy, entered in the Spanish Society of Neurology's COVID-19 Registry from 17 March to 6 June 2020. Results A total of 232 patients with neurological symptoms were registered, including 51 cases of encephalopathy or encephalitis (21.9%). None of these patients were healthcare professionals. The most frequent syndromes were mild or moderate confusion (33%) and severe encephalopathy or coma (9.8%). The mean time between onset of infection and onset of neurological symptoms was 8.02 days. Lumbar puncture was performed in 60.8% of patients, with positive PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 in only one case. Brain MRI studies were performed in 47% of patients, with alterations detected in 7.8% of these. EEG studies were performed in 41.3% of cases, detecting alterations in 61.9%. Conclusions Encephalopathy and encephalitis are among the complications most frequently reported in the registry. More than one-third of patients presented mild or moderate confusional syndrome. The mean time from onset of infection to onset of neurological symptoms was 8 days (up to 24hours earlier in women than in men).

We investigated whether between-person (BP) differences and within-person (WP) changes in loneliness, anxiety, and worry about COVID-19 were related to cognitive function and abilities in a longitudinal cohort of middle-aged and older United States (US) adults over a nine-month period during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data were from bimonthly questionnaires in the nationwide COVID-19 Coping Study from August/September 2020 through April/May 2021 (N = 2262 adults aged 55). Loneliness was assessed with the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale, anxiety with the 5-item Beck Anxiety Inventory, and COVID-19 worry on a 5-point Likert-type scale. Cognitive outcomes were assessed with the 6-item Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS?) Cognitive Function and Abilities scales. Marginal structural models incorporating inverse probability of treatment and attrition weights as well as sampling weights estimated the BP and WP relationships between the mental health predictors and PROMIS? cognitive scores over time. RESULTS: In any given month, experiencing a loneliness, anxiety symptom, or COVID-19 worry score higher than the sample mean (BP difference) or higher than one's personal mean across the nine-month period (WP change) was negatively associated with cognitive function and abilities in that month. The observed magnitudes of associations were stronger for BP differences than for WP changes and were the strongest for anxiety symptom scale scores. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated loneliness, anxiety symptoms, and worry about COVID-19, both relative to other adults and to one's usual levels, were acutely associated with worse perceived cognitive function and abilities over a nine-month period during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

Control group: participants receive placebo in the same dosage as the Intervention group - 9 tablets 2 times per day for 8 weeks. Placebo tablets are identical in appearance and package to HET. Taste of placebo is different from that of HET. The Ohsugi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Osaka, Japan manufactured the placebo and HET. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary outcome: Number of patients with a SARS-CoV-2 RNA by ploymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive result with at least one symptom (fever, cough, sputum, malaise, shortness of breath) during the 12-week study period (including the 4-week observation period after oral administration). Secondary outcomes: 1. Period from infection to onset 2. Period from the appearance of symptoms to the disappearance of PCR positive 3. Number of days until the appearance or improvement of symptoms 4. Severe stage: presence of hospitalization 5. Shock stage: ICU management required for mechanical ventilation, shock vitals or failure of organ(s) other than lungs Safety endpoints include numbness in the hands and/or feet, edema, skin rash or other allergic symptoms, and gastric discomfort.

We show that NVP was readily taken up by dendritic cells (DCs) and promoted DC maturation and antigen presentation. NVP loaded with BG505.SOSIP.664 (SOSIP) or SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) was readily recognized by neutralizing antibodies, indicating the conformational display of antigens on the surfaces of NVP. Rabbits immunized with SOSIP-NVP elicited strong neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1. Furthermore, mice immunized with RBD-NVP induced robust and long-lasting antibody responses against RBD from SARS-CoV-2.

In this article, current advances in pharmacological treatments for patients with COVID-19 are discussed. Data obtained from recent studies indicate a mortality benefit with the administration of dexamethasone or adjunctive tocilizumab and potential clinical benefits with remdesivir (with or without baricitinib). Several monoclonal antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have been developed. The US Food and Drug Administration issued two emergency use authorizations: one for bamlanivimab/etesevimab and another for casirivimab/imdevimab for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, at high risk of progression to severe disease and/or hospitalization. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 indicates that antiviral treatments would be most beneficial in the early phase of the infection that is primarily driven by replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, whereas immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory therapies are likely to be more beneficial during the late phase of the infection, when the disease is driven by an exaggerated immune/inflammatory response to the virus that causes tissue damage.","output":"Current advances in pharmacological treatments for patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"J H Beigel et al conduct a study to examine the clinical efficacy and safety of remdesivir in hospitalized adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and with evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement The double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial took place between Feb 21, 2020 and Apr 19, 2020 at 60 trial sites and 13 subsites in the US, Denmark, the UK, Greece, Germany, Korea, Mexico, Spain, Japan, and Singapore Participants had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection at the time of enrolment The study found that remdesivir, compared to placebo, significantly shortened time to recovery in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection","output":"Remdesivir Reduces Time to Recovery in Adults Hospitalized With COVID-19: A Meaningful Step in Therapeutic Discovery: JCOM"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The enhancement of water efficiency requires controlling the high demand for irrigated agriculture which depends on improving the capabilities to accurately simulate the water cycle and its components. Among these, evapotranspiration is widely studied to estimate reference evapotranspiration (ET0) but the performance and accuracy of the estimates vary. Moreover, these estimates require some hardly available or misrepresentative meteorological data which lead, mainly in arid and semi-arid areas, to errors and inaccuracies. Here, ET0 of five empirical temperature-based estimates are compared to the standard FAO PenmanCMonteith estimate (ET0-PM) under the representative and wide-ranging settings of 22 weather stations of Morocco. We found a significant positive correlation between ET0-PM and solar radiation, average and maximum air temperatures. We have determined that the Dorji estimate shows relatively better precision and stability while it requires advanced calibration to accommodate arid and semi-arid conditions. After hundreds of calibration repetitions, we concluded a new estimate (ET0-Hadria) which demonstrates an overall improvement in the quality and precision of ET0 assessment, mainly in flat areas. This estimate improved the precision and enhanced the precision in almost 68% of the stations. This simple calibrated estimate is an accurate, improved, and transferable tool achieved through a precise methodical process of selection and configuration.","output":"Comparative assessment of different reference evapotranspiration models towards a fit calibration for arid and semi-arid areas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a new infectious disease, for which there is currently no treatment.

METHODS: Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were selected at the Fever Unit in two regions of Guizhou, China. On admission CRP levels were collected, and the diameter of the largest lung lesion was measured in the most severe lung lesion by lung CT scan. Differences in the diameter and CRP levels were compared in the following groups of patients: mild group, moderate group, severe group, and critical group. RESULT: CRP levels and the diameter of the largest lung lesion in the moderate group were higher than those in the mild group (Mann-Whitney test = ?2.647, ?2.171, P ? 0.05), those in the severe group were higher than those in the moderate group (Mann-Whitney test = 0.693, ?2.177, P ? 0.05), and those in the critical group were higher than those in the severe group (Mann-Whitney test = ?0.068, ?1.549, P ? 0.05). The difference was statistically significant. CRP levels were positively correlated with the diameter of lung lesion and severe presentation (correlation coefficient = 0.873, 0.734, P ? 0.001).

However, the mutations of S protein in variants may change the infectivity and antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2, leading to the immune escape from those neutralizing antibodies. To characterize the mutations of S protein in newly emerging variants, the proteolytic property and binding affinity with receptor were assessed, and the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudovirus system was used to assess the infectivity and immune escape. We found that some SARS-CoV-2 variants have changed significantly in viral infectivity; especially, B.1.617.2 is more likely to infect less susceptible cells than D614G, and the virus infection process can be completed in a shorter time. In addition, neutralizing mAbs and vaccinated sera partially or completely failed to inhibit host cell entry mediated by the S protein of certain SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, SARS-CoV-2 variant S protein-mediated viral infection can still be blocked by protease inhibitors and endocytosis inhibitors.

AIM To evaluate the adherence to guideline-directed anticoagulation and its impact on clinical outcomes in a high-risk cohort of elderly Chinese patients. METHODS The Optimal Thromboprophylaxis in Elderly Chinese Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (ChiOTEAF) registry is a prospective, multicenter study conducted from October 2014 to December 2018. Endpoints of interest were all-cause death, thromboembolic (TE) events and major bleedings in patients with a guideline-directed indication for OACs (CHA2DS2VASc 1 if male or 2 if female). RESULTS The eligible cohort consisted of 5742 patients, of whom 2567 (44.7%) patients were treated with an OAC. Seven independent predictors of OAC undertreatment were identified: age (OR: 1.04; 95%CI 1.03-1.05, P < 0.001), first diagnosed AF (OR: 1.71; 95%CI 1.44-2.03, P < 0.001), chronic kidney disease (OR: 1.67; 95%CI 1.36-2.06, P < 0.001), liver disease (OR: 1.69; 95%CI 1.19-2.41, P = 0.003), dementia (OR: 1.67; 95%CI 1.06-2.64, P = 0.026), prior extracranial bleeding (OR: 1.89; 95%CI 1.35-2.64, P < 0.001), and the use of antiplatelet drug (OR: 6.97; 95%CI 5.89-8.23, P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, OAC undertreatment was significantly associated with a higher risk all-cause death (OR: 3.79; 95%CI: 2.61-5.53; P < 0.001) and TE events (OR: 2.28; 95%CI: 1.39-3.72; P = 0.001), and a similar risk of major bleeding as compared to guideline-directed OAC therapy. CONCLUSIONS Only 44.7% of all eligible patients were prescribed OAC in accordance with guideline recommendations. The independent predictors for OAC undertreatment were age, first diagnosed AF, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, prior extracranial bleeding, and the use of the antiplatelet drugs.

It is well known that COVID-19 patients are at an increased risk of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) development; however, the associated demographic, medical, and clinical factors for developing PTE remain unknown. The current study aimed to assess the characteristics of patients with PTE. METHODS: This case-control study was derived from an ongoing population-based investigation of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The case group included 99 patients with PTE confirmed by computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), and the controls (N=132) were age-matched patients selected from the PTE-suspected patients with a negative CTPA. The demographic, medical, and clinical characteristics of the study population were entered into the study checklist and compared. A logistic regression test was used to determine the factors associated with PTE development. RESULTS: Among the 13,099 admitted patients, 690 (5.26%) were suspected of having PTE according to their clinical manifestations. CTPA was performed for suspected cases, and PTE was confirmed in 132 patients (19.13%). Logistic regression assessments revealed that male gender (OR, 2.39; 95%CI, 1.38?4.13), decreased oxygen saturation (OR, 2.33; 95%CI, 1.27?4.26), and lower hemoglobin (OR, 0.83, 0.95), and albumin (OR, 0.31; 95%CI, 0.18?0.53) levels were associated with PTE development. CONCLUSION: PTE was confirmed in one-fifth of suspected patients who underwent CTPA imaging.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Single-center U.K. ICU. PATIENTS: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation that received a transthoracic echocardiogram between March and December 2020. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Right ventricular dilation was defined as right ventricular:left ventricular end-diastolic area greater than 0.6, right ventricular systolic impairment as fractional area change less than 35%, or tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion less than 17 mm. One hundred seventy-two patients were included, 59 years old (interquartile range, 49-67), with mostly moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 101; 59%). Ninety-day mortality was 41% (n = 70): 49% in patients with right ventricular dilation, 53% in right ventricular systolic impairment, and 72% in right ventricular dilation with systolic impairment. The right ventricular dilation with systolic impairment phenotype was independently associated with mortality (odds ratio, 3.11 [95% CI, 1.15-7.60]), but either disease state alone was not. Right ventricular fractional area change correlated with PaO2:FIO2 ratio, PaCO2, chest radiograph opacification, and dynamic compliance, whereas right ventricular:left ventricle end-diastolic area correlated negatively with urine output. CONCLUSIONS: Right ventricular systolic impairment correlated with pulmonary pathophysiology, whereas right ventricular dilation correlated with renal dysfunction.

Methods: : We conducted a cross-sectional online survey between 22 February and 5 March, 2020. We approached to urban residents aged over 18 years through snowball sampling method using the Chinese social media. The Health Belief Model was adopted to guide the analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine impacts of modifying factors (including demographic and socio-economic characteristics) and individual beliefs on individual health behavior. Results: : of 5675 valid questionnaires, 95.8% of the respondents well understood the preventive measures from COVID-19 transmission, while 79.9% of the respondents adopted the behavior advised. 45.7% of the respondents perceived severity of the disease, 75.6% of the respondents perceived benefits of social constraints measures and 62.7% reported anxiety during the epidemic. After adjusting for modifying factors and individual beliefs, those who were female, had better income and good knowledge on preventive measures, perceived benefits on social constraint measures and did not feel anxiety were more likely to adopt behaviors advised. Conclusions: : The Chinese public highly accepted and adopted behaviors advised to slow down the COVID-19 epidemic. People with low income or feeling anxiety were less likely to adopt the behavior advised. The policy support should target on the social vulnerable groups.

This global pandemic galvanized the scientific community to study the causative virus (SARS-CoV2) pathogenesis, transmission, and clinical symptoms. Remarkably, the most common complication associated with this disease is the cytokine storm which is responsible for COVID-19 mortality. Thus, targeting the cytokine storm with new medications is needed to hamper COVID-19 complications where the most prominent strategy for the treatment is drug repurposing. Through this strategy, several steps are skipped especially those required for testing drug safety and thus may help in reducing the dissemination of this pandemic.

Evidence is lacking regarding the mortality rate of patients with hip fracture admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our aim was to investigate the mortality rate among patients with a proximal femoral fracture who were admitted to our hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients with a proximal femoral fracture admitted to Southend University Hospital in the U.K. from March to April 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic). Data collected included demographics (patient age, body mass index, sex), comorbidities, and blood test values along with COVID-19 diagnosis (based on positive microbiological sample and clinical and radiographic findings) and operative characteristics (time to operation, length of stay, American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] classification, Nottingham Hip Fracture Score). The primary outcome was the 30-day mortality rate for patients with a hip fracture who were COVID-19 positive or negative. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted along with Mann-Whitney U tests and Fisher exact tests. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were included in the study, of whom 37 had an available SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2) swab test result. The overall 30-day mortality was 22%. Eleven patients tested positive for COVID-19.

METHODS: Using data from 96 out of 167 health facilities offering ART services, we compared four ART program indicators: (1) count of HIV visits; (2) proportion of ART dispenses in community-based settings (DAC); (3) proportion of multi-month dispensing of ART medications > 6 months (> 6 m MMD); and (4) proportion of timely ART refills. We used uncontrolled interrupted time series (ITS) models to estimate slope and level changes in each indicator with the arrival of COVID-19. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: From week 1 to week 16, the average number of HIV visits fell from 121.5 to 92.5 visits, the proportion of DAC rose from 22.7% to 36.7%, the proportion of > 6 m MMD rose from 29.4% to 48.4%, and the proportion of timely ART refills fell from 51.9% to 43.8%.

However, the potential role of proteases in the infection process remains unclear. In order to explore this, we used two different approaches: we infected either Vero cells in the presence of trypsin or Vero cells that constitutively express the membrane-associated protease TMPRSS2 (Vero/TMPRSS2 cells). We found that PEDV infection was enhanced, and viruses were efficiently released into the culture fluid, from Vero cells infected in the presence of protease, while in cells without protease, the virus grew, but its release into the culture fluid was strongly hampered. Cell-to-cell fusion of PEDV-infected cells and cleavage of the spike (S) protein were observed in cells with protease. When infected Vero cells were cultured for 3 days in the absence of trypsin but were then treated transiently with trypsin, infectious viruses were immediately released from infected cells. In addition, treatment of infected Vero/TMPRSS2 cells with the protease inhibitor leupeptin strongly blocked the release of virus into the culture fluid. Under electron microscopy, PEDV-infected Vero cells, as well as PEDV-infected Vero/TMPRSS2 cells treated with leupeptin, retained huge clusters of virions on their surfaces, while such clusters were rarely seen in the presence of trypsin and the absence of leupeptin in Vero and Vero/TMPRSS2 cells, respectively. Thus, the present study indicates that proteases play an important role in the release of PEDV virions clustered on cells after replication occurs. This unique observation in coronavirus infection suggests that the actions of proteases are reminiscent of that of the influenza virus neuraminidase protein.","output":"Role of proteases in the release of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus from infected cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current global emergency due to SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, passive immunotherapy emerges as a promising treatment for COVID-19.

Therefore, drawing upon decades of experience in manufacturing snake antivenom, we developed and preclinically evaluated two anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal equine formulations as potential alternative therapy for COVID-19. We immunized two groups of horses with either S1 (anti-S1) or a mixture of S1, N, and SEM mosaic (anti-Mix) viral recombinant proteins. Horses reached a maximum anti-viral antibody level at 7 weeks following priming, and showed no major adverse acute or chronic clinical alterations. Two whole-IgG formulations were prepared via hyperimmune plasma precipitation with caprylic acid and then formulated for parenteral use. Both preparations had similar physicochemical and microbiological quality and showed ELISA immunoreactivity towards S1 protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD). The anti-Mix formulation also presented immunoreactivity against N protein. Due to high anti-S1 and anti-RBD antibody content, final products exhibited high in vitro neutralizing capacity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 80 times higher than a pool of human convalescent plasma. Pre-clinical quality profiles were similar among both products, but clinical efficacy and safety must be tested in clinical trials.

Infection of nGD mice with SVNI had no influence on nGD severity. However, nGD mice were more resistant to SVNI infection. Significantly different inflammatory responses were seen in nGD brains when compared with SVNI brains: the inflammatory response in the nGD brains consisted of reactive astrocytes and microglia with no infiltrating macrophages, but the inflammatory response in the brains of SVNI-infected mice was characterized by infiltration of macrophages and altered activation of microglia and astrocytes.

This disease presents itself as proximal, ascending and symmetric weakness and typical dermatosis with findings such as elevated muscle enzymes, altered electromyography and typical changes in muscle biopsy; as of today, the etiology of the disease in unknown. The COVID-19 vaccine has been a fundamental tactic to achieve control of the coronavirus (SARS CoV2), and its clear that the benefits of getting the vaccine overweight the risks that might come along with it. Although rare, all adverse effects should be reported, this could help us to understand the elusive pathophysiology of inflammatory idiopathic myopathy. CASE PRESENTATION: In this text we will describe the case of a patient with dermatomyositis who was vaccinated against SARS CoV2 with BNT162b2 mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech), showing a temporal relation between the vaccination and the beginning of her symptoms. We realized all the diagnostic approach to the suspected disease including electromyography, muscle biopsy and laboratory findings, corroborating the diagnosis. The patient received standard treatment for this disease (steroid therapy) and have a classic slow improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Although its not possible to confirm a direct correlation between the vaccine and the onset of the disease, we considered that there are enough data to suspect that this could be a trigger event and therefore should always be considered a possible cause for a case of inflammatory idiopathic myopathy.","output":"Dermatomyositis post vaccine against SARS-COV2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Paraganglioma (PGL) is a rare type of tumor that arises from the extra-adrenal paraganglia. A PGL tumor hypersecretes catecholamines and causes symptoms identical to those in patients with hyper-functioning adrenal pheochromocytoma (PCC). In this study, we compared the surgical outcome of laparoscopic surgery, including laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery, in patients with PCC and patients with retroperitoneal solitary PGL. METHODS The records of 49 patients with PCC and 9 patients with unilateral retroperitoneal PGL at our institution from January 2001 to March 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Multiple tumors, tumors suspected of being malignant preoperatively, and tumors operated on using a retroperitoneal approach were excluded from the study. RESULTS Each group was equivalent with respect to patient background, hemodynamic variables, and preoperative biochemical assessments, including plasma catecholamine levels and catecholamine levels in 24-hour urine samples. The mean operative time was significantly longer in the PGL group (149.4  56.5 minutes v 189.8  44.9 minutes, P=0.019). In univariate and multivariate analyses, tumor size  50 mm and PGL were statistically significant factors that predicted prolonged operative time. Intraoperative hypotension occurred in 15 patients in the PCC group and in 8 patients in the PGL group, and the difference was statistically significant (P=0.002). One postoperative complication in the PCC group and two postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade II or higher) in the PGL group were observed, and the difference was statistically significant (P=0.012). Twenty-two patients in this series underwent LESS surgery (PCC: n=19; PGL: n=3), and there was no statistically significant difference in the perioperative outcomes between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS The present results demonstrate that the operation for solitary extraperitoneal PGL required a longer operative time and had more hypotensive episodes and higher postoperative morbidity than the PCC group. Though the perioperative outcome of LESS surgery for PGL is comparable to that of PCC, we should treat the patients with PGL accordingly.","output":"Surgical outcome of laparoscopic surgery, including laparoendoscopic single-site surgery, for retroperitoneal paraganglioma compared with adrenal pheochromocytoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study seeks to estimate how global supply chain relocates emissions of tropospheric ozone precursors and its impacts in shaping ozone formation.

The sicker the patient, the higher the threat to the nutritional and micronutrient status will be. In addition many patients start the ICU stay with an altered nutritional status, which requires assessment upon admission. The nutritional needs vary among patients as well as during hospitalization, as the metabolic response changes over time. The shock and acute organ failure result in a metabolic shift towards intense catabolism: the endogenous glucose production aiming at ensuring the basal ATP production starts immediately, and occurs at the expense of the lean body mass using amino acids for neoglucogenesis. Later, the stabilization and recovery phases are characterized by higher energy and substrate needs. Indirect calorimetry is the only tool enabling determination of the metabolic level.

As micronutrients are an integral part of metabolism and antioxidant defenses, their delivery must be ensured: while needs are well defined for healthy subjects, needs in illness remain poorly defined. Parenteral nutrition, that contains only macro-substrates, requires the daily prescription of multi-micronutrient complements to qualify as total PN. Achievement of goals requires a minimal monitoring, consisting in the daily verification of energy and protein goal delivery achievement, and daily follow up of blood glucose and phosphate levels determination and insulin requirements.

Of these 20 cases diagnosed with COVID-19 and TB, five presented extrapulmonary involvement due to TB (25%). The median age was 30 years (CI25-75, 28-31), three (60%) of them were female. The most frequently associated infection was due to human immunodeficiency virus, (n = 3), underweight (n = 2), COPD (n = 1) and drug addiction (n = 1). Three presented exclusive extrapulmonary involvement of the central nervous system, two pulmonary and pericardial. Four patients (80%) had a favorable evolution.","output":"[Coinfection of COVID-19 and extrapulmonary tuberculosis]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the time of writing, the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused severe impacts on society, economy and people's daily lives. People constantly express their opinions on various aspects of the pandemic on social media, making user-generated content an important source for understanding public emotions and concerns. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis on the affective trajectories of the American people and the Chinese people based on Twitter and Weibo posts between January 20th, 2020 and May 11th 2020. Specifically, by identifying people's sentiments, emotions (i.e., anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise) and the emotional triggers (e.g., what a user is angry/sad about) we are able to depict the dynamics of public affect in the time of COVID-19. By contrasting two very different countries, China and the Unites States, we reveal sharp differences in people's views on COVID-19 in different cultures. Our study provides a computational approach to unveiling public emotions and concerns on the pandemic in real-time, which would potentially help policy-makers better understand people's need and thus make optimal policy.","output":"Analyzing COVID-19 on Online Social Media: Trends, Sentiments and Emotions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Design Special report.Study population This paper presented a report about the experience of the oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMS) of Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, during the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.Data analysis The experience of that department formed the content of the report.Results In this study, the authors presented an informative description of experience of treating patients under a pandemic condition.

We then conducted a detailed case analysis of the flaming of a female journalist and those who targeted her on Twitter. Based on our analysis, we observed that there were three layers of users who targeted the journalist: influencers, users who responded to the instigation by influencers, and trolls.

Safe and effective treatments will need to be both affordable and widely available globally to be used alongside vaccination programs. This analysis will estimate and compare potential generic minimum costs of a selection of approved COVID-19 drug candidates with available international list prices. METHODS: We searched for repurposed drugs that have been approved by at least one of the World Health Organization, US Food and Drug Administration, or the United Kingdom National Institute of Health and Care Excellence organizations or at least given emergency use authorization or recommended for off-label prescription. Drug prices were searched for dexamethasone, budesonide, baricitinib, tocilizumab, casirivimab, and imdevimab, and sarilumab, using active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) data extracted from global shipping records. This was compared with national pricing data from a range of low-, medium-, and high-income countries. Annual API export volumes from India were used to estimate the current availability of each drug. RESULTS: Repurposed therapies can be generically manufactured for some treatments at very low per-course costs, ranging from US $2.58 for intravenous (IV) dexamethasone (or US $0.19 orally) and US $4.34 for inhaled budesonide. No export price data were available for baricitinib, tocilizumab, casirivimab, and imdevimab, or sarilumab, but courses of these treatments have higher prices, ranging from US $6.67 for baricitinib to US $875.5 for sarilumab. When comparing international list prices, we found wide variations between countries. CONCLUSIONS: Successful management of COVID-19 will require equitable access to treatment for all populations, not just those able to pay high prices. Dexamethasone and budesonide are widely available and affordable, whereas monoclonal antibodies and IV treatment courses are more expensive.","output":"Minimum Manufacturing Costs, National Prices, and Estimated Global Availability of New Repurposed Therapies for Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background It is critical to monitor changes in vaccine effectiveness against COVID 19 outcomes for various vaccine products in different population subgroups. Methods We conducted a retrospective study in patients []12 years who underwent testing for the SARS CoV 2 virus from April 1 to October 25, 2021 at urgent care centers in the New York City metropolitan area. Patients self reported vaccination status at the time of testing. We used a test negative design to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) by comparing odds of a positive test for SARS CoV 2 infection among vaccinated (n=484,468), partially vaccinated (n=107,573), and unvaccinated (n=466,452) patients, adjusted for demographic factors and calendar time. Results VE against symptomatic infection after 2 doses of mRNA vaccines was 96% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 95%, 97%) in the pre-delta period and reduced to 79% (95% CI: 77%, 81%) in the delta period. In the delta period, VE for 12 to 15 year olds (85%; [95% CI: 81%, 89%]) was higher compared to older age groups (<65% for all other age groups). VE estimates did not differ by sex, race/ethnicity, and comorbidity. VE against symptomatic infection was the highest for individuals with a prior infection followed by full vaccination. VE against symptomatic infection after the mRNA1273 vaccine (83% [95% CI: 81%, 84%]) was higher compared to the BNT162b2 vaccine (76% [95% CI: 74%, 78%]) in the delta period. VE after the single-dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was the lowest compared to other vaccines (29% [95% CI: 26%, 32%]) in the delta period . Conclusions VE against infection after two doses of the mRNA vaccine was high initially, but significantly reduced against the delta variant for all three FDA approved vaccines.","output":"Effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines against symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in an urgent care setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The obesity paradox has been recently demonstrated in trauma patients, where improved survival was associated with overweight and obese patients compared to patients with normal weight, despite increased morbidity. Little is known whether this effect is mediated by lower injury severity. We aim to explore the association between body mass index (BMI) and renal trauma injury grade, morbidity, and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of adults with renal trauma was conducted using 2013C2016 National Trauma Data Bank. Multiple regression analyses were used to assess outcomes of interest across BMI categories with normal weight as reference, while adjusting for relevant covariates including kidney injury grade. RESULTS: We analyzed 15181 renal injuries. Increasing BMI above normal progressively decreased the risk of high-grade renal trauma (HGRT). Subgroup analysis showed that this relationship was maintained in blunt injury, but there was no association in penetrating injury. Overweight (OR 1.02, CI 0.83C1.25, p = 0.841), class I (OR 0.92, CI 0.71C1.19, p = 0.524), and class II (OR 1.38, CI 0.99C1.91, p = 0.053) obesity were not protective against mortality, whereas class III obesity (OR 1.46, CI 1.03C2.06, p = 0.034) increased mortality odds. Increasing BMI by category was associated with a stepwise increase in odds of acute kidney injury, cardiovascular events, total hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit LOS, and ventilator days. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing BMI was associated with decreased risk of HGRT in blunt trauma. Overweight and obesity were associated with increased morbidity but not with a protective effect on mortality. The obesity paradox does not exist in kidney trauma when injury grade is accounted for.","output":"The Impact of Obesity on Renal Trauma Outcome: An Analysis of the National Trauma Data Bank from 2013 to 2016"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Help researchers track the global effects of covid-19 plastic litter on wildlife, says Layal Liverpool","output":"Fight the plastic pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined the pandemic measures taken by nursing leaders to cope with COVID-19 at a nursing home in Singapore.

The cost-benefit trade-offs that shape contact behavior, and hence the course of epidemics, are often only implicitly incorporated in epidemiological models. This approach creates difficulty in parsing out the effects of adaptive behavior. We use an epidemiological-economic model of disease dynamics to explicitly model the trade-offs that drive person-to-person contact decisions.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) re-emerged globally in 2013 in many important swine-producing countries in Asia and the Americas. Several studies have identified the risk factors for the spread of PEDV in acute outbreaks. However, limited information is available on the risk factors for the transmission of PEDV in endemic regions. We hypothesized that poor biosecurity, location, and some social or cultural practices are the main risk factors for PEDV transmission in the Vietnamese pig population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential risk factors for the transmission of PEDV in an endemic area in Vietnam. In this caseCcontrol study, questionnaires containing 51 questions were completed for 92 PEDV-positive and 95 PEDV-negative farms. A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the risk factors associated with PEDV infection. Province and the total number of pigs were included as random effects to determine their influence on the risk of PEDV infection. Twenty-nine variables of interest that have been associated with PEDV status were analyzed in a univariate analysis (P <0.20), with backward stepwise selection. Only three of these 29 variables in four models remained significant PEDV risk factors in the final model: farrow-to-wean production type, distance from the farm to the slaughterhouse (<1,000 m), and the presence of chickens on site (P <0.05). This is the first study to identify the main risk factors for PEDV infection in an endemic area.

OBJECTIVE: To synthesize results of studies investigating outcomes of music interventions in terms of HRQOL, as assessed by the 36- and 12-Item Health Survey Short Forms (SF-36 and SF-12). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (searched July 30, 2021, with no restrictions). STUDY SELECTION: Inclusion criteria were randomized and single-group studies of music interventions reporting SF-36 data at time points before and after the intervention. Observational studies were excluded. Studies were reviewed independently by 2 authors. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were independently extracted and appraised using GRADE criteria (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) by multiple authors. Inverse-variance random-effects meta-analyses quantified changes in SF-36 mental and physical component summary (respectively, MCS and PCS) scores from preintervention to postintervention and vs common control groups. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: SF-36 or SF-12 MCS and PCS scores, defined a priori. RESULTS: Analyses included 779 participants from 26 studies (mean [SD] age, 60 [11] years). Music interventions (music listening, 10 studies; music therapy, 7 studies; singing, 8 studies; gospel music, 1 study) were associated with significant improvements in MCS scores (total mean difference, 2.95 points; 95% CI, 1.39-4.51 points; P < .001) and PCS scores (total mean difference, 1.09 points; 95% CI, 0.15-2.03 points; P = .02).

OBJECTIVE: The study examined the impact of livelihood components of an economic development program on outcomes related to poultry/crop production, consumption, and income generation among the ultra-poor throughout quarterly follow-ups. METHODS: This secondary data analysis used the monitoring records of 2960 poor or ultra-poor households receiving assets of (1) 9C26 ducks (n = 2125), (2) 11 chickens (n = 872), and/or (3) vegetable seeds (n = 2407). Data measuring the production of assets, income generation, and consumption of assets were collected quarterly throughout 2019. To examine a one-year-long trend in participation, production, income generation, and consumption of assets, a one-way analysis of variance was conducted across the follow-ups. Additional analyses of annual income and consumption comparing duck and chicken groups were performed using linear regression models. RESULTS: The number of poultry assets per household decreased between the AprilC June and JulyCSep follow-ups, while consumption of poultry and vegetable assets increased during the monsoon season (p < 0.001 for all). The vegetable production reflected seasonal fluctuations, where the lowest production and income were reported during the monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons. We observed increasing voluntary adoption of poultry farming among the non-asset group for both duck and chicken over the follow-ups (p < 0.001 for all).

Therefore, it is imperative to develop viral inactivation procedures that permit samples to be transferred and manipulated at lower containment levels (i.e., BSL2), and maintain the fidelity of downstream assays to expedite the development of medical countermeasures (MCMs). We demonstrate optimal conditions for complete viral inactivation following fixation of infected cells with paraformaldehyde solution or other commonly-used branded reagents for flow cytometry, UVC inactivation in sera and respiratory secretions for protein and antibody detection assays, heat inactivation following cDNA amplification of single-cell emulsions for droplet-based single-cell mRNA sequencing applications, and extraction with an organic solvent for metabolomic studies. Thus, we provide a suite of protocols for viral inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 patient samples for downstream contemporary immunology assays that facilitate sample transfer to BSL2, providing a conceptual framework for rapid initiation of high-fidelity research as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.","output":"Inactivation of SARS Coronavirus 2 and COVID-19 patient samples for contemporary immunology and metabolomics studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the possible association between serum micronutrients (vitamin D, retinol, zinc), C-reactive protein (CRP), and obesity among children and adolescents.

Here, we report that the highly lethal 1918 virus is susceptible to immune protection by a preventive vaccine, and we define its mechanism of action. Immunization with plasmid expression vectors encoding hemagglutinin (HA) elicited potent CD4 and CD8 cellular responses as well as neutralizing antibodies. Antibody specificity and titer were defined by a microneutralization and a pseudotype assay that could assess antibody specificity without the need for high-level biocontainment. This pseudotype inhibition assay can define evolving serotypes of influenza viruses and facilitate the development of immune sera and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that may help contain pandemic influenza. Notably, mice vaccinated with 1918 HA plasmid DNAs showed complete protection to lethal challenge. T cell depletion had no effect on immunity, but passive transfer of purified IgG from anti-H1(1918) immunized mice provided protective immunity for na?ve mice challenged with infectious 1918 virus.

Enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans of his chest showed a remarkable progressive enlargement of bilateral cervical, supraclavicular, hilar, and mediastinal lymph nodes within 2 weeks. Bronchofibroscopy manifested obvious luminal stenosis with swelling, thick pale mucosa, and disappearing of structures of trachea cricoid cartilage, followed by a 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomographyCcomputed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) with intense symmetric FDG uptake in larynx, tracheobronchial tree, and hilar, mediastinal, and axillary lymph nodes being demonstrated. DIAGNOSIS: A diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis (RP) was finally reached. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received methylprednisolone 40 mg daily with a gradual tapering in a 4-month follow-up. OUTCOMES: The patient experienced no relapse of fever and lymph nodes enlargement in the 4-month follow-up. LESSONS: Even though long-term fever with multiple lymphadenectasis usually lead to a diagnosis of lymphoma, the bronchoscopic features and evidence from 18F-FDG PET/CT in this case were much more approximate to RP, indicating an importance of a sensible differential diagnosis of RP in patients who present with nonspecific features such as FUO and lymph nodes enlargement. Keeping a high index of clinical suspicion in these patients can help recognize uncommon of RP and promote diagnosis and treatment. Our case highlights the significance of 18F-FDG PET/CT in helping reaching the diagnosis of RP in this condition.

This puts healthcare professionals from specialties with close patient contact at high risk of nosocomial infections with SARS-CoV-2. In this context, preprocedural mouthrinses with hydrogen peroxide have been recommended before conducting intraoral procedures. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a 1% hydrogen peroxide mouthrinse on reducing the intraoral SARS-CoV-2 load. METHODS: Twelve out of 98 initially screened hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were included in this study. Intraoral viral load was determined by RT-PCR at baseline, whereupon patients had to gargle mouth and throat with 20 mL of 1% hydrogen peroxide for 30 s. After 30 min, a second examination of intraoral viral load was performed by RT-PCR. Furthermore, virus culture was performed for specimens exhibiting viral load of at least 10(3) RNA copies/mL at baseline. RESULTS: Ten out of the 12 initially included SARS-CoV-2-positive patients completed the study. The hydrogen peroxide mouthrinse led to no significant reduction of intraoral viral load. Replicating virus could only be determined from one baseline specimen. CONCLUSION: A 1% hydrogen peroxide mouthrinse does not reduce the intraoral viral load in SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects. However, virus culture did not yield any indication on the effects of the mouthrinse on the infectivity of the detected RNA copies. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The recommendation of a preprocedural mouthrinse with hydrogen peroxide before intraoral procedures is questionable and thus should not be supported any longer, but strict infection prevention regimens are of paramount importance.

In 2017 Hurricane Maria intensified to a Category 5 storm within 24 h, devastating Puerto Rico. In 2019 Hurricane Dorian, predicted to remain tropical storm, unexpectedly intensified into a Category 5 storm and destroyed the Bahamas. The official forecast and computer models were unable to predict rapid intensification of these storms. One possible reason for this is that key physics, including microscale processes at the air-sea interface, are poorly understood and parameterized in existing forecast models. Here we show that surfactants significantly affect the generation of sea spray, which provides some of the fuel for tropical cyclones and their intensification, but also provides some of the drag that limits intensity and intensification. Using a numerical model verified with a laboratory experiment, which predicts spray radii distribution starting from a 100 m radius, we show that surfactants increase spray generation by 20C34%. We anticipate that bio-surfactants affect heat, energy, and momentum exchange through altered size distribution and concentration of sea spray, with consequences for tropical cyclone intensification or decline, particularly in areas of algal blooms and near coral reefs, as well as in areas affected by oil spills and dispersants.","output":"Potential effect of bio-surfactants on sea spray generation in tropical cyclone conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reports suggested an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and GBS, but subsequent studies produced conflicting results regarding the incidence of GBS during the pandemic.

We examine changes in adult mental health in the UK population before and during the lockdown. METHODS: In this secondary analysis of a national, longitudinal cohort study, households that took part in Waves 8 or 9 of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) panel, including all members aged 16 or older in April, 2020, were invited to complete the COVID-19 web survey on April 23C30, 2020. Participants who were unable to make an informed decision as a result of incapacity, or who had unknown postal addresses or addresses abroad were excluded. Mental health was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Repeated cross-sectional analyses were done to examine temporal trends. Fixed-effects regression models were fitted to identify within-person change compared with preceding trends. FINDINGS: Waves 6C9 of the UKHLS had 53 351 participants. Eligible participants for the COVID-19 web survey were from households that took part in Waves 8 or 9, and 17 452 (412%) of 42 330 eligible people participated in the web survey. Population prevalence of clinically significant levels of mental distress rose from 189% (95% CI 178C200) in 2018C19 to 273% (263C282) in April, 2020, one month into UK lockdown. Mean GHQ-12 score also increased over this time, from 115 (95% CI 113C116) in 2018C19, to 126 (125C128) in April, 2020. This was 048 (95% CI 007C090) points higher than expected when accounting for previous upward trends between 2014 and 2018. Comparing GHQ-12 scores within individuals, adjusting for time trends and significant predictors of change, increases were greatest in 18C24-year-olds (269 points, 95% CI 189C348), 25C34-year-olds (157, 096C218), women (092, 050C135), and people living with young children (145, 079C212). People employed before the pandemic also averaged a notable increase in GHQ-12 score (063, 95% CI 020C106). INTERPRETATION: By late April, 2020, mental health in the UK had deteriorated compared with pre-COVID-19 trends. Policies emphasising the needs of women, young people, and those with preschool aged children are likely to play an important part in preventing future mental illness.

We aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors for delirium in older patients hospitalized with COVID-19, as well as its association with length of stay and mortality. METHODS: Retrospective study of patients aged &#8805; 65 years hospitalized with COVID-19. Data were collected from computerized medical records and all patients had delirium assessment at admission. Risk factors for delirium as well as the outcomes mentioned above were studied by two-group comparison, logistic regression and Cox proportional-hazard models. RESULTS: Of a total of 235 Caucasian patients, 48 (20.4%) presented with delirium, which was hypoactive in 41.6% of cases, hyperactive and mixed in 35.4% and 23.0%, respectively. Patients with cognitive impairment had a nearly four times higher risk of developing delirium compared to patients that were cognitively normal before SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR 3.7; 1.7-7.9 95% CI, p=0.001). The presence of delirium did not modify the time from symptoms' onset to hospitalization nor the length of stay in acute care, but it was associated with an increased risk of dying (HR 2.1; 1.2-3.7 95%CI; p=0.0113). CONCLUSION: Delirium was a prevalent condition in older people admitted with COVID-19 and pre-existing cognitive impairment was its main risk factor.

They are instead the result of the social construction of perceived risks and resulting community norms. In populations in which disease is unlikely to spread throughout all communities simultaneously, community-driven perception of risk can drastically alter collective outcomes. A community could respond to a few infections by becoming fearful and adopting anticipatory behaviors that protect them from disease spread. Similarly, there could be false reassurance, in which low disease incidence over time leads to community consensus that protective actions are unnecessary (even if they are the reason cases remains rare). We therefore model COVID-19 spread with three synergistic dynamics governing individual behavioral choices: (1) Social construction of concern, (2) Awareness of disease incidence, and (3) Reassurance by lack of disease. We use a multiplex network approach that captures social communication and epidemiological spread. We find that effective protective policies enacted too early may backfire by allowing a community to become reassured and therefore unwilling to adopt or maintain further protective behaviors. Based on these insights, we propose that public health policies for which success relies on collective action should be designed to exploit the behaviourally receptive phase; the period between the generation of sufficient concern as to foster adoption of novel protective behaviors and the relaxation of adherence driven by reassurance fostered by avoidance of negative outcomes over time.","output":"Improving pandemic mitigation policies across communities through coupled dynamics of risk perception and infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinician-led memory interventions have been shown to increase knowledge, reduce anxiety, promote memory-strategy use, and increase brain-healthy lifestyle behaviours in older adults with normal age-related memory changes. A self-guided, e-learning version of the Baycrest Memory and Aging Program? was recently developed to increase accessibility to memory interventions. The objectives of the current study were to assess program feasibility (retention rate), acceptability (satisfaction), and participant-reported impact (memory concerns, behaviour change, goal attainment). As part of a larger study, participants were 139 healthy older adults (mean age: 737, 73% female). Ninety-two individuals completed the program (retention rate=66%). Anonymous feedback data indicated a high level of satisfaction with the program overall (98%), the pace and clarity of the learning modules (100%), and the organization and navigation of the interface (92%). Suggested improvements included offering more interaction with others and addressing minor platform glitches. There was a decrease in the level of concern about memory change, with 64% expressing concern at a level consistent with the Jessen et al. (2014) criteria for Subjective Cognitive Decline at baseline, and 23% expressing the same at post-test. The majority of participants reported increases in using memory-strategies (63-97%) and lifestyle-promoting behaviours (40-72%). All participants reported moderate to high satisfaction with personal goal attainment.

There have been few reports to date to discuss the impact of progression cell death-1 blockers (PD-1B) on immune or vaccine-related outcomes, and what risk factors that contribute to the serological status remains to be elucidated. The study aims to find the impact of PD-1B on vaccination outcome and investigate other potential risk factors associated with the risk of seroconversion failure. METHODS: Patients with active cancer treatment were retrospectively enrolled to investigate the interaction effects between PD-1B and vaccination. Through propensity score matching of demographic and clinical features, the seroconversion rates and immune/vaccination-related adverse events (irAE and vrAE) were compared in a head-to-head manner. Then, a nomogram predicting the failure risk was developed with variables significant in multivariate regression analysis and validated in an independent cohort. RESULTS: Patients (n=454) receiving either PD-1B or COVID-19 vaccination, or both, were matched into three cohorts (vac+/PD-1B+, vac+/PD-1B-, and vac-/PD-1B+, respectively), with a non-concer control group of 206 participants. 68.1% (94/138), 71.3% (117/164), and 80.5% (166/206) were seropositive in vac+/PD-1B+cohort, vac+/PD-1B- cohort, and non-cancer control group, respectively. None of irAE or vrAE was observed to be escalated in PD-1B treatment except for low-grade rash. The vaccinated patients with cancer had a significantly lower rate of seroconversion rates than healthy control. A nomogram was thus built that encompassed age, pathology, and chemotherapy status to predict the seroconversion failure risk, which was validated in an independent cancer cohort of 196 patients. CONCLUSION: Although patients with cancer had a generally decreased rate of seroconversion as compared with the healthy population, the COVID-19 vaccine was generally well tolerated, and seroconversion was not affected in patients receiving PD-1B. A nomogram predicting failure risk was developed, including age, chemotherapy status, pathology types, and rheumatic comorbidity.","output":"Immune checkpoint blocking impact and nomogram prediction of COVID-19 inactivated vaccine seroconversion in patients with cancer: a propensity-score matched analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination is the most effective medical intervention ever introduced and, together with clean water and sanitation, it has eliminated a large part of the infectious diseases that once killed millions of people.

Uptake and scale-up of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among them has been slow. We used data from Princess PrEP, Thailand's largest KP-led PrEP programme, to operationalize PrEP service cascades. We identified gaps and pointed out where additional data are needed to inform a larger HIV prevention cascade. METHODS Numbers of people tested for HIV, tested HIV negative, eligible for PrEP (defined as any of the following in the past three months: condomless sex with partners of unknown/uncertain HIV status or antiretroviral treatment or viral load status, multiple partners, engaging in sex work, sexually transmitted infections, injecting drugs, using amphetamine-type stimulants, or repeated use of post-exposure prophylaxis), offered PrEP and accepted PrEP during January to November 2019 were retrieved from Princess PrEP database to inform PrEP service cascades for MSM and TGW. Reasons for not accepting PrEP were documented. RESULTS Of 6287 MSM who received HIV testing in Princess PrEP, 92.3% were HIV negative and 70.2% of them were eligible for PrEP. PrEP was offered to 94.7% of those eligible and 48.0% of those offered accepted it. Among 900 TGW who had HIV testing, 95.3% tested HIV negative and 64.8% of them met PrEP eligibility criteria. Of these, 95.0% were offered PrEP and 43.9% of them accepted it. Among MSM and TGW who met PrEP eligibility criteria, no or low-HIV-risk perception was the most common reason provided (46.7% of 2007 MSM and 41.9% of 296 TGW) for not accepting PrEP. CONCLUSIONS PrEP service cascades from the Princess PrEP programme identified no or low-risk perception as key barrier to PrEP acceptance among MSM and TGW who met PrEP eligibility criteria. More implementation research studies are needed to explore PrEP motivation and access in larger communities outside of clinical services. This is to identify gaps and strategies to address them within motivation, access and effective use domains of the HIV prevention cascade.","output":"Evaluation of a pre-exposure prophylaxis programme for men who have sex with men and transgender women in Thailand: learning through the HIV prevention cascade lens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to gain a better understanding of what happens during the COVID-19 pandemic to those who were previously traumatized, this study investigated perceived stress and severity of PTSD symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in people who experienced the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was also examined how reminders of past trauma and loneliness instigated by the COVID-19 crisis relate to current stress and PTSD symptoms. The sample consisted of 123 participants (74.8% women). Participants responded to assessments of sociodemographic characteristics, exposure to COVID-related information, concerns over disease, severity of exposure to war, frequency and intensity of war trauma reminders, loneliness, stress, and severity of PTSD symptoms. Data was collected as part of [edited out for blind review] Global Survey. Results showed that in a population previously exposed to the effects of war, severity of PTSD symptoms was positively related to perceived stress, and loneliness during the pandemic significantly mediated this relationship. Intensity of exposure to war trauma reminders was associated with higher levels of PTSD symptom severity. Higher severity of PTSD symptoms was related to forced displacement during the war. Moreover, higher stress was related to increased concerns over disease. To conclude, those exposed to war may be more affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic and preventive measures that accompany it, while loneliness mediates the effects of PTSD and perceived stress in this population.","output":"Connection between the COVID-19 pandemic, war trauma reminders, perceived stress, loneliness, and PTSD in Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: An effective Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) vaccine is likely to include components that can induce specific cytotoxic T\\\\lymphocyte (CTL) responses.

Cape Town has many vulnerable communities because of poverty, overcrowding and comorbidities, although it has a relatively small elderly population. Amongst the unique and early responses to the pandemic in South Africa has been the strategy of community screening and testing (CST). This process has been drawn from health departments prior adoption of a community-orientated primary care (COPC) approach, which relies on teams of community health workers working in delineated communities to prevent disease and provide early interventions for those at higher risk. The COPC principles were applied in the CST programme, which involved collaboration between facility and community-based teams, linking public health and primary care approaches, careful mapping of cases in highly vulnerable communities, targeted screening around cases, testing of those that screened positive, health education and linkage to primary care. The overall aim was to slow down transmission through early identification and isolation of diagnosed cases. Key challenges involved the designing of a screening tool with appropriate sensitivity and specificity as well as the logistics of staffing, transport, consumables, data collection and capture, security, ablutions and personal protective equipment. Key opportunities included synergies between CST and evolving commitment to COPC in the health system.

These restrictions were eased and reapplied multiple times between March 2020 and May 2021.The change in restaurant access and prolonged restriction of activity may have an impact on body weight. Aim The aim of this study was to examine the impact of multiple lockdowns on Body Mass Index (BMI) change from pre-pandemic till during the third lockdown and on the use of different types of food outlets and their association with BMI change. Materials and method Surveys of usage of different types of food outlets were distributed online before the lockdown between 06th January and 12th December 2019 and during the third national lockdown between 29th March and 25th April 2021. The food outlet usage surveys were filled out for seven consecutive days. Self-reported BMI was reported before the pandemic and during the third phase of the lockdown. The total number of individuals who started the study before the pandemic was 681, and 60 participants completed the surveys during the third phase of lockdown. Results For the sixty participants in both surveys mean BMI was significantly higher during the third lockdown (28.6  5.9 kg.m2) in comparison with the mean BMI before the pandemic 2019 (28.0  5.5 kg.m2) (paired T = 3.09, P < 0.003). There was a significant positive association between BMI change, total number of days spent in lockdown (?= 0.05, P < 0.01, R2= 9.99), and age (?= 0.06, P < 0.007, R2= 11.8). There was no significant association between change in BMI and change in the frequency of using Fast Food Restaurants (FFRs), Full-Service Restaurants (FSRs), delivery and takeaways. Conclusion BMI was increased significantly during the lockdown in comparison with prior to the pandemic. Individuals gained more weight the longer they stayed at home during lockdowns, and physical activity was reduced to approximately half. However, the BMI change was not related to the change in use of different types of food outlets. This pattern does not support the widespread belief that visiting restaurants or using delivery and takeaway services has a significant impact on body weight. This article is protected by copyright.

Eligible studies were conducted in high-income countries and used multivariate analyses. PARTICIPANTS: After piloting, screening, data extraction and quality appraisal were performed by a single experienced reviewer. Of 3740 unique records identified, 34 were included that reported on median 596 (range 44-418 794) participants, aged 42-84 years. 19/34 (56%) were good quality. OUTCOMES: Hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission, length of stay in hospital or intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, severe disease, mortality. RESULTS: Authors synthesised findings narratively and appraised the certainty of the evidence for each risk factor-outcome association. There was low or moderate certainty evidence for a large (&#8805;2-fold) magnitude of association between hospitalisation in people with COVID-19, and: obesity class III, heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, dementia, age >45 years, male gender, black race/ethnicity (vs non-Hispanic white), homelessness and low income. Age >60 and >70 years may be associated with large increases in mechanical ventilation and severe disease, respectively. For mortality, a large magnitude of association may exist with liver disease, Bangladeshi ethnicity (vs British white), age >45 years, age >80 years (vs 65-69 years) and male gender among 20-64 years (but not older). Associations with hospitalisation and mortality may be very large (&#8805;5-fold) for those aged &#8805;60 years.

Racial/ethnic disparities in drowning death rates did not significantly decline for most groups, and the disparity in rates among Black persons compared with White persons increased significantly from 2005-2019. Drowning death rates are associated with persistent and concerning racial/ethnic disparities. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to drowning disparities is needed. Implementing and evaluating community-based interventions, including those promoting basic swimming and water safety skills, among disproportionately affected racial/ethnic groups could help reduce drowning disparities.","output":"Persistent Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Fatal Unintentional Drowning Rates Among Persons Aged 29 Years - United States, 1999-2019."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the time of writing of this article, there have been over 110 million cases and 2.4 million deaths worldwide since the start of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, postponing millions of non-urgent surgeries. Existing literature explores the complexities of rationing medical care. However, implications of non-urgent surgery postponement during the COVID-19 pandemic have not yet been analyzed within the context of the four pillars of medical ethics. The objective of this review is to discuss the ethics of elective surgery cancellation during the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and autonomy. This review hypothesizes that a more equitable decision-making algorithm can be formulated by analyzing the ethical dilemmas of elective surgical care during the pandemic through the lens of these four pillars. This paper's analysis shows that non-urgent surgeries treat conditions that can become urgent if left untreated. Postponement of these surgeries can cause cumulative harm downstream. An improved algorithm can address these issues of beneficence by weighing local pandemic stressors within predictive algorithms to appropriately increase surgeries. Additionally, the potential harms of performing non-urgent surgeries extend beyond the patient. Non-maleficence is maintained through using enhanced screening protocols and modifying surgical techniques to reduce risks to patients and clinicians. This model proposes a system to transfer patients from areas of high to low burden, addressing the challenge of justice by considering facility burden rather than value judgments concerning the nature of a particular surgery, such as cosmetic surgeries. Autonomy can be respected by giving patients the option to cancel or postpone non-urgent surgeries. However, in the context of limited resources in a global pandemic, autonomy is not absolute. Non-urgent surgeries can ethically be postponed in opposition to the patient's preference. The proposed algorithm attempts to uphold the four principles of medical ethics in rationing non-urgent surgical care by building upon existing decision models, using additional measures of resource burden and surgical safety to increase health care access and decrease long-term harm as much as possible. The next global health crisis will undoubtedly present its own unique challenges. This model may serve as a comprehensive starting point in determining future guidelines for non-urgent surgical care.","output":"Ethical considerations and patient safety concerns for cancelling non-urgent surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic: a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has changed the operations of many industries.

Excessive information and misinformation can lead to belief in false information as well as reduce the accurate interpretation of true information. Such incorrect beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic might lead to behavior that puts people at risk of both contracting and spreading the virus. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was two-fold. First, we attempted to gain insight into public beliefs about the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 in one of the worst hit countries: the United States. Second, we aimed to test whether a short intervention could improve peoples belief accuracy by empowering them to consider scientific consensus when evaluating claims related to the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a 4-week longitudinal study among US citizens, starting on April 27, 2020, just after daily COVID-19 deaths in the United States had peaked. Each week, we measured participants belief accuracy related to the coronavirus and COVID-19 by asking them to indicate to what extent they believed a number of true and false statements (split 50/50). Furthermore, each new survey wave included both the original statements and four new statements: two false and two true statements. Half of the participants were exposed to an intervention aimed at increasing belief accuracy. The intervention consisted of a short infographic that set out three steps to verify information by searching for and verifying a scientific consensus. RESULTS: A total of 1202 US citizens, balanced regarding age, gender, and ethnicity to approximate the US general public, completed the baseline (T0) wave survey. Retention rate for the follow-up waves first follow-up wave (T1), second follow-up wave (T2), and final wave (T3)was high (85%). Mean scores of belief accuracy were high for all waves, with scores reflecting low belief in false statements and high belief in true statements; the belief accuracy scale ranged from C1, indicating completely inaccurate beliefs, to 1, indicating completely accurate beliefs (T0 mean 0.75, T1 mean 0.78, T2 mean 0.77, and T3 mean 0.75). Accurate beliefs were correlated with self-reported behavior aimed at preventing the coronavirus from spreading (eg, social distancing) (r at all waves was between 0.26 and 0.29 and all P values were less than .001) and were associated with trust in scientists (ie, higher trust was associated with more accurate beliefs), political orientation (ie, liberal, Democratic participants held more accurate beliefs than conservative, Republican participants), and the primary news source (ie, participants reporting CNN or Fox News as the main news source held less accurate beliefs than others). The intervention did not significantly improve belief accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: The supposed infodemic was not reflected in US citizens beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic. Most people were quite able to figure out the facts in these relatively early days of the crisis, calling into question the prevalence of misinformation and the publics susceptibility to misinformation.","output":"Investigating and Improving the Accuracy of US Citizens Beliefs About the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Children and adolescents are exposed to medicines and supplements, but only a few studies have evaluated the actual intake in routine care. Thus, we performed a pharmacoepidemiological evaluation of a longitudinal population-based pediatric cohort study (LIFE Child) conducted at the University Hospital of Leipzig between 2014 and 2019. We analyzed all visits of the participants of the LIFE Child cohort between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2019. Participants were asked to bring their medicines and supplements to their appointments at the study center. If they had not brought the preparations with them, attempts were made to obtain the relevant information during a telephone call after the visit to the study center. Furthermore, the participants and their parents were interviewed on medicine and supplement use and on sociodemographic and socioeconomic data during their visit to the study center. Associations of medicine and supplement use with age, sex, and socioeconomic status were analyzed using multivariate binary logistic regressions to obtain adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Furthermore, the number of the respective visit was included as possible confounder in the multivariate model. We included 3602 participants who visited the study center 11,906 times. The intake of 9759 medicines and supplements was recorded. Based on the evaluation of all study visits, 49% of the children and adolescents took at least one medicine or supplement. Self-medication accounted for 28% of the medicines and supplements. The prevalence of overall intake increased from 45% in 2014 to 53% in 2019 (aOR 2.63, 95% CI 2.23, 3.09). The prevalence was the highest (77%) in children aged 0C < 3 years, owing mainly to vitamin D. The prevalence of medicine use was higher in females (40%; aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.10, 1.28) than in males (35%), owing mainly to the intake of ibuprofen and hormonal contraceptives in adolescent females. A high socioeconomic status was a predictor of lower medicine (aOR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68, 0.95) and higher supplement (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.09, 1.98) use. Conclusion: Half of all children and adolescents took at least one medicine or supplement. The intake varied depending on age and sex.

Methods: Publicly available data as of August 26, 2021, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were used to calculate presumed population immunity by state. Seroprevalence data were used to estimate the percentage of the population previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, with adjustments for underreporting. Vaccination coverage data for both fully and partially vaccinated persons were used to calculate presumed immunity from vaccination. Finally, we estimated the percentage of the total population in each state with presumed immunity to SARS-CoV-2, with a sensitivity analysis to account for waning immunity, and compared these estimates to a range of population immunity thresholds. Results: Presumed population immunity varied among states (43.1% to 70.6%), with 19 states with 60% or less of their population having been infected or vaccinated. Four states have presumed immunity greater than thresholds estimated to be sufficient to disrupt transmission of less infectious variants (67%), and none were greater than the threshold estimated for more infectious variants (78% or higher). Conclusions: The US remains a distance below the threshold sufficient to disrupt viral transmission, with some states remarkably low. As more infectious variants emerge, it is critical that vaccination efforts intensify across all states and ages for which the vaccines are approved.","output":"Estimates of presumed population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 by state in the United States, August 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar efeitos de tratamentos medicamentosos para infeces por coronavrus.

Quota sampling was utilized to ensure the sample would consist of approximately one-third of cancer patients currently in treatment, one-third of cancer survivors not currently in treatment, and one-third of individuals without a history of cancer. Survey items collected information on socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, race, and education attainment) and COVID-19-related preventive behaviors in the past week. Eight items focused on handwashing, avoiding contact with sick people, staying home when feeling sick, respiratory hygiene, avoiding touching face, social distancing, avoiding large gatherings, and wearing a mask were reported on a 4-point Likert scale (never to frequently). Differences between groups were assessed using one-way ANOVAs with Tukey post hoc tests. Results: Respondents were 49.6 years (SD=17.3) on average, 51.6% female, and 48.9% had a Bachelor's degree or higher education attainment.

Methods: Multivariable logistic and exponential regression models using electronic health records data from the Cerner COVID-19 De-Identified Data Cohort from January through June 2020. Findings: Out of 52,312 patients with COVID-19, 1.9% (n=1,013) had an OUD.

As the pandemic enters the next phase with new diversity, there are various concerns regarding pregnant women, its transmission to the unborn child, and the safe and secure method of childbirth. Both the method of vaginal delivery and the delivery phase are equally appropriate. The mode of birth a woman should go through must be personal and based entirely on the severity of the disease and obstetric indications. Methods: This was a 1-year retrospective study from April 2020 to April 2021 in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Postgraduate Institute Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital, Pimpri, Pune. All pregnant women admitted irrespective of their gestational age or whether they were in labor or not were universally screened for COVID-19. All the delivered women were segregated based on the mode of delivery, vaginal or cesarean, and the information was then classified according to Robsons policy. Results: The rate of cesarean section in COVID-19 patients during this 1-year period was 31.59%. Also, it was noted that the maternal mortality was more in the cases of cesarean section (1.4%) compared to vaginal delivery (0.00%). The percentage of neonates affected by COVID-19 in cesarean delivery (0.46%) was more than in vaginal delivery (0.22%). Conclusion: We conclude that there is insufficient evidence to support that the outcome of lower-segment cesarean section (LSCS) was better than vaginal delivery to prevent direct transmission from a COVID-19 pregnant mother to the neonate. The mode of delivery should be individualized and based on the severity of the disease and obstetrical indications. Therefore, in mild cases, it is advisable to continue with vaginal delivery and LSCS should be reserved for women with severe respiratory problems, where termination of pregnancy will allow for better ventilation of the newborn.","output":"Cesarean section rate among COVID-19 mothers and its classification through robsons criteria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevalence of adrenal insufficiency at the onset of neonatal septic shock was estimated.

The 15 participants have gone on to train more than 50 project-level staff in MITS sample collection. CONCLUSIONS: Lessons learned include an appreciation for using an iterative process for establishing standardized procedures, creating opportunities for all stakeholders to deliver critical feedback, and highlighting the importance of complementing in-person trainings with ongoing technical assistance.","output":"Building Global Capacity to Conduct Pathology-Based Postmortem Examination: Establishing a New Training Hub for Minimally Invasive Tissue Sampling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As social distancing policies and recommendations went into effect in response to COVID-19, people made rapid changes to the places they visit. These changes are clearly seen in mobility data, which records foot traffic using location trackers in cell phones. While mobility data is often used to extract the number of customers that visit a particular business or business type, it is the frequency and duration of concurrent occupancy at those sites that governs transmission. Understanding the way people interact at different locations can help target policies and inform contact tracing and prevention strategies. This paper outlines methods to extract interactions from mobility data and build networks that can be used in epidemiological models. Several measures of interaction are extracted: interactions between people, the cumulative interactions for a single person, and cumulative interactions that occur at particular businesses. Network metrics are computed to identify structural trends which show clear changes based on the timing of stay-at-home orders. Measures of interaction and structural trends in the resulting networks can be used to better understand potential spreading events, the percent of interactions that can be classified as close contacts, and the impact of policy choices to control transmission.","output":"Analysis of mobility data to build contact networks for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inefficiency, high cost, and complex operation have emerged as shackles for large-scale separate oil-in-water emulsion. Herein, a low-cost and eco-friendly separation layer with a rough structure and rich anionic groups was fabricated from rice straw (RS) via a simple acid-base treatment and slight squeeze process. The separation layer's morphology, composition, and wettability were investigated. It was then employed to separate oil-in-water emulsion. The RS after acid and alkali treatment (A1A2-RS) exhibited a clear fiber structure and abundant humps, which made the separation layer superwettable and highly electronegative (-26.55 mV). The overlapped and intertwined A1A2-RS layer structure owned a superior performance for hexadecyl-trimethyl-ammonium-bromide (CTAB) adsorption and tiny oil interception. As a result, the separation layer had stable fluxes (>500 LMH) for multiple CTAB-stabilized emulsions and the obtained filtrates performed low total organic carbon (TOC) contents (<30 mg/L). In addition, the A1A2-RS layer had excellent renewability (10 cycles/ 200 mL) and the flux could be substantially recovered merely by aqueous wash. Moreover, filtrate analysis showed that the A1A2-RS layer had a good effect on actual emulsion treatment with a TOC removal rate of 89.56%.","output":"Preparation of a rice straw-based green separation layer for efficient and persistent oil-in-water emulsion separation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a recession in the global economy.

In order to curb its ripple effects on households, the Japanese government distributed a one-time cash payment of JPY 100,000 to every registered resident at the beginning of the pandemic. We utilized Hiroshima University's Household Behavioral and Financial Survey in 2020 and 2021, and found that only 20% of the observations were satisfied with the one-time payment they received. We performed probit regression and found that those who were male, older, had a higher education level, and had anxiety about the future were less likely to be satisfied with this policy. Having a spouse, being a public official, and having higher household assets or better subjective health enhanced satisfaction with the policy. Our subsample analyses showed heterogeneity in satisfaction among various socioeconomic groups and in associations between their socioeconomic characteristics and policy satisfaction.

However, given the growing popularity and presence of new information and communication technologies and related algorithms (algorithmic automation), it is worth considering the area of overlapping dynamic relationships between the technological dimension and leisure time/activities. Hence, this chapter aims to signal (initiate) the impact of new technologies on the daily practices of leisure time in developed capitalist societies in the context of the UN Sustainable Development Goal 3. To this end, a social welfare perspective has been used, combining sociological studies of welfare with welfare economics, and a psychological approach emphasizing the subjective dimension of the phenomenon (positive psychology).

The main aims of this study was to investigate the association among the socio-demographic factors with traveling history of COVID-19 Patients in Ethiopia during stay at home state of emergency. Methods: A total of 162 respondents with COVID-19 during March 13, 2020 to May 6, 2020 in Ethiopia were used. Two sided chi-square test was used to test the association between the socio demographic factors among COVID-19 Patients. A log-complement logistic regression model was used to compute the health ratios (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to measure the effect of those factors. Results: : The data was analyzed using 162 patients of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2. An association was found between traveling history of COVID-19 infected patients and Gender (male vs female) [B =5.410, p<0.020] and Age group [a=13.082, p<0.004]. Log-complement logistic regression model showed that Gender and Age were significant factors associated to traveling history of COVID-19 Patients.

Because telehealth alters the way clinicians and patients interact with one another, this investigation examined patients perceptions of their communication with clinicians during the pandemic. METHOD: Patients were recruited from the Cancer Support Community, Fight Colorectal Cancer, and a market research firm to participate in an online survey. In addition to demographic and health-related information, respondents completed measures of patient-centered communication and evaluated how their communication in telehealth sessions compared with in-person visits. RESULTS: From October to December 2020, 227 respondents (65.6% female, 64.6% Non-Hispanic White, 33.5% had 6 or more telehealth sessions, 55% were 50 or older) reported having some of their cancer care provided via telehealth. Respondents who were of racial/ethnic minorities, male, had more telehealth sessions, or had poorer mental health reported less patient-centered communication with clinicians. Most patients thought communication in telehealth sessions was about the same as in-person visits with respect to good communication (59%). However, patients thinking communication in telehealth sessions was better than in-person visits were more likely to be Hispanic (49%), Non-Hispanic Black (41%), under 50 years of age (32%), male (40%), and had more telehealth sessions (34%). CONCLUSION: Respondents reporting less patient-centered communication during the pandemice.g., persons of racial/ethnic minorities and maleswere also more likely to evaluate communication in telehealth sessions as better than in-person visits. Further research is needed to understand reasons underlying this finding. Cancer care clinicians should take into account patient preferences regarding telehealth care, which may be particularly important for racial and ethnic minority patients.","output":"Oncology patients communication experiences during COVID-19: comparing telehealth consultations to in-person visits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused a crisis worldwide, due to both its public health impact and socio-economic consequences. Mental health was consistently affected by the pandemic, with the emergence of newly diagnosed psychiatric disorders and the exacerbation of pre-existing ones. Urban areas were particularly affected by the virus spread. In this review, we analyze how the urban environment may influence mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, considering two factors that profoundly characterize urbanization: air pollution and migration. Air pollution serves as a possibly risk factor for higher viral spread and infection severity in the context of urban areas and it has also been demonstrated to play a role in the development of serious mental illnesses and their relapses. The urban environment also represents a complex social context where minorities such as migrants may live in poor hygienic conditions and lack access to adequate mental health care. A global rethinking of the urban environment is thus required to reduce the impact of these factors on mental health. This should include actions aimed at reducing air pollution and combating climate change, promoting at the same time a more inclusive society in a sustainable development perspective.","output":"The Influence of the Urban Environment on Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Focus on Air Pollution and Migration-A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From December 2019, a new pandemic named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019) has become a key topic of discussion across the world The reason behind this discussion is the rapid increase in human death due to COVID-19 which has stunned the world The pathogen of COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is similar to SARS CoV SARS-CoV-2 infects mainly the respiratory system which causes the death because there is no effective vaccines or therapeutics against COVID-19 Homoeopathic drugs like Lachesis and Gripp Heel may play an effective role to cure corona patients","output":"Role of Lachesis and Gripp Heel in the Treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Evidence establishes that COVID-19 patients with DM2 are at increased risk for severe disease and worse outcomes Peer reviewed data is sparse comparing glycemic control and clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients with vs without DM2, and thus we sought to address this gap Methods: We selected patients at least 18 years old who expired or were discharged between March 16, 2020 through September 15, 2020 Principal analysis compared glycemic patterns among patients with DM2 vs non-DM2 Median, coefficient of variation (CV), maximum and minimum glucose parameters were computed to characterize longitudinal glycemic patterns Logistic regression modeling identified significant (p&amp;lt; 05) associations between composite outcome vs glycemic parameters and putative risks for progression to severe COVID-19 Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve identified cut points for glycemic parameters Cox regression models were employed to control for significant confounders Continuous data summarized as median was compared using Kruskal-Wallis test Discrete data were compared with Pearsons chi-square test Two-tailed p&amp;lt; 05 was significant Results: Among 494 patients, 157 (32%) had DM2 with no intergroup differences in age (68 [56C79]), sex (52% male, 48% female), or race (68% Caucasian, 19% Other, 13% African American) Insulin was administered to DM2 (93%) and non-DM2 (54%) patients (p&amp;lt; 0001) Comorbidities were more prevalent in DM2, including cardiovascular (68% vs 54%, p= 003), renal (72% vs 52%, p&amp;lt; 0001) and obesity (51% vs 38%, p&amp;lt; 0001) Markers including D-dimer (0 98 [0 61C1 95] mg/L), lactate dehydrogenase (308 [230C392] U/L), ferritin (436 [174C856] ng/mL), and triglycerides (172 [109C239] mg/dL), were not different in DM2 vs non-DM2 (p&amp;gt; 05) CRP was greater in patients with (8 6 [3 6C14 6]) vs without (6 1 [2 0C12 6]) DM2 (p= 005) Baseline glucose in DM2 (163 [121C253] mg/dL) vs non-DM2 (107 [96C124] mg/dL) was significantly greater, with former an independent predictor of composite outcome (p= 0005) Cox modeling of other glucose parameters in DM2 vs non-DM2 demonstrated various impact regarding risk for composite outcome including median (155 [128C209], p= 46) vs (103 [94C118], p= 09);coefficient of variation (28 [19C38], p= 08) vs (15 [9C20], p= 002);maximum (252 [187C362], p= 0005) vs (129 [110C156], p= 002);and minimum (99 [79C128], p= 95) vs (89 [81C98], p= 02) The unified baseline glucose cut point for composite outcome risk controlled for significant covariates was 138 gm/dL (p&amp;lt; 0001), which included respectively 20% and 10% of patients with and without DM2 Conclusion: Glycemic dysregulation in COVID-19 patients is independently associated with ICU admission and/or hospital mortality Presence of DM2 amplifies glycemic dysregulation, but risk stratification appears warranted in all COVID-19 patients","output":"In-Hospital Glycemic Dysregulation Associated With Worse Outcomes in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyzed the number of cumulative positive cases of COVID-19 as a function of time in countries around the World.

We also detected scale-free properties in the majority of sub-regions in Australia, Canada, China, and the United States (US). We developed an allometric model that was capable of fitting the initial phase of the pandemic and was the best predictor for the propagation of the illness for up to 100 days. We then determined that the power-law COVID-19 exponent correlated with measurements of human mobility. The COVID-19 exponent correlated with the magnitude of air passengers per country. This correlation persisted when we analyzed the number of air passengers per US states, and even per US metropolitan areas. Furthermore, the COVID-19 exponent correlated with the number of vehicle miles traveled in the US. Together, air and vehicular travel explained 70% of the variability of the COVID-19 exponent. Taken together, our results suggest that the scale-free propagation of the virus is present at multiple geographical scales and is correlated with human mobility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients (31 males and 28 females ranging from 25 to 70 years old) with confirmed COVID-19 infection performed follow-up thin-section thorax CT. After 31.57.9 days (range, 24 to 39 days) of hospital admission, the results of CT were analyzed for parenchymal abnormality (ground-glass opacification, interstitial thickening, and consolidation) and evidence of fibrosis (parenchymal band, traction bronchiectasis, and irregular interfaces). Patients were analyzed based on the evidence of fibrosis and divided into two groups namely, groups A and B (with and without CT evidence of fibrosis), respectively. Patient demographics, length of stay (LOS), rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, peak C-reactive protein level, and CT score were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Among the 59 patients, 89.8% (53/59) had a typical transition from early phase to advanced phase and advanced phase to dissipating phase. Also, 39% (23/59) patients developed fibrosis (group A), whereas 61% (36/59) patients did not show definite fibrosis (group B). Patients in group A were older (mean age, 45.416.9 vs. 33.810.2 years) (P = 0.001), with longer LOS (19.15.2 vs. 15.02.5 days) (P = 0.001), higher rate of ICU admission (21.7% (5/23) vs. 5.6% (2/36)) (P = 0.061), higher peak C-reactive protein level (30.726.4 vs. 18.117.9 mg/L) (P = 0.041), and higher maximal CT score (5.24.3 vs. 4.02.2) (P = 0.06) than those in group B.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of paediatric solid tumour patients who underwent HDCT and autologous HSCT between 1997 and 2012. ILD was diagnosed using clinical symptoms and radiography after excluding cardiac, renal and infectious causes. Risk factors were analysed using a Cox proportional hazard regression model. RESULTS: Three hundred and forty patients were enrolled, and the median age was 3 years (interquartile range 1C7). Eight patients (2.4%) were diagnosed with noninfectious ILD.

Most participants believed that the use of antibiotics was the best solution for unhealthy pigs, and this was associated with a low level of knowledge about antibiotics. Increasing the probability of recovery after treatment increased support for treating pigs with antibiotics. However, the majority of participants rejected the consumption of meat from animals housed in hospital pens. After price, concern with food safety was the second main factor that influenced participants choice when buying meat. Support for the use of antibiotics to deal with unhealthy pigs in hospital pens, as well as for consumption of the meat from these animals, was higher among participants involved in agriculture. This shows that consumers are unaware of the potential negative repercussions for animal welfare associated with banning or reducing the use of antibiotics in livestock production, which is an important concern for the industry.","output":"Meat Consumers Opinion Regarding Unhealthy Pigs: Should They Be Treated with Antibiotics or Euthanized on Farm?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Infections are one of the most common reasons for patients attending primary care. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is perhaps one of the biggest threats to modern medicine; data show that 81% of antibiotics in the UK are prescribed in primary care. AIM: To identify where the perceived gaps in knowledge, skills, guidance and research around infections and antibiotic use lie from the general practitioner (GP) viewpoint. DESIGN AND SETTING: An online questionnaire survey. METHOD: The survey, based on questions asked of Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) members in 1999, and covering letter were electronically sent to GPs between May and August 2017 via various primary care dissemination routes. RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty-eight GPs responded. Suspected Infection in the elderly, recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), surveillance of AMR in the community, leg ulcers, persistent cough and cellulitis all fell into the top six conditions ranked in order of importance that require further research, evidence and guidance. Acute sore throat, otitis media and sinusitis were of lower importance than in 1999. CONCLUSION: This survey will help the NHS, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and researchers to prioritise for the development of guidance and research for chronic conditions highlighted for which there is little evidence base for diagnostic and management guidelines in primary care. In contrast, 20 years of investment into research, guidance and resources for acute respiratory infections have successfully reduced these as priority areas for GPs.","output":"Infectious Disease and Primary Care Research-What English General Practitioners Say They Need"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Activatable contrast agents are of ongoing research interest because they offer low background and high specificity to the imaging target. Engineered sensitivity to protease activity is particularly desirable because proteases are critical biomarkers in cancer, infectious disease, inflammatory disorders, and so forth. Herein, we developed and characterized a set of peptide-linked cyanine conjugates for dual-modal detection of protease activity via photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence imaging. The peptide-dye conjugates were designed to undergo contact quenching via intramolecular dimerization and contained n dyes (n = 2, 3, or 4) with n - 1 cleavable peptide substrates. The absorption peaks of the conjugates were blue-shifted 50 nm relative to the free dye and had quenched fluorescence. This effect was sensitive to solvent polarity and could be reversed by solvent switching from water to dimethyl sulfoxide. Employing trypsin as a model protease, we observed a 2.5-fold recovery of the peak absorbance, 330-4600-fold fluorescent enhancement, and picomolar detection limits following proteolysis. The dimer probe was further characterized for PA activation. Proteolysis released single dye-peptide fragments that produced a 5-fold PA enhancement through the increased absorption at 680 nm with nanomolar sensitivity to trypsin. The peptide substrate could also be tuned for protease selectivity; as a proof-of-concept, we detected the main protease (Mpro) associated with the viral replication in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Last, the activated probe was imaged subcutaneously in mice and signal was linearly correlated to the cleaved probe. Overall, these results demonstrate a tunable scaffold for the PA molecular imaging of protease activity with potential value in areas such as disease monitoring, tumor imaging, intraoperative imaging, in vitro diagnostics, and point-of-care sensing.","output":"Activatable Carbocyanine Dimers for Photoacoustic and Fluorescent Detection of Protease Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 impact on the global economy combined with partial lockdown measures in Ethiopia represents a large, unprecedented shock to the country's economy.

Assumptions about the presence and relative importance of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission are based on case reports, the failing of quarantine measures aimed at sequestering ill patients, viral dynamic studies suggesting SARS-CoV-2 production peaks before symptoms appear, and modeling evidence that calculates serial interval between successive generations of infection. In aggregate, these data offer compelling evidence of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, but individually these studies have notable shortcomings that undermine their conclusions. The purpose of this review is to discuss the literature of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, highlight limitations of recent studies, and propose experiments that, if conducted, would provide a more definitive analysis of the relative role of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission in the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of literature on PubMed using search filters that relate to asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission as well as serial interval and viral dynamics. We focused on studies that provided primary clinical data. RESULTS: 34 studies were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review: 11 case reports pertaining to asymptomatic transmission, 9 viral kinetic studies, 13 serial interval studies, and 1 study with viral kinetics and serial interval. CONCLUSION: Different approaches to determining the presence and prevalence of asymptomatic and presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission have notable shortcomings, which were highlighted in this review and limit our ability to draw definitive conclusions.

We distributed an online survey assessing perceptions of inland fishery pressures in June and July 2020 to basin-level inland fishery experts (i.e., identified by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations across the global North and South); 437 respondents from 79 countries addressed 93 unique hydrological basins, accounting for 82.1% of global inland fish catch. Based on the responses analyzed against extrinsic fish catch and human development index data, pandemic impacts on inland fisheries 1) add gradation to the largely positive environmental narrative of the global pandemic and 2) identify that basins of higher provisioning value are perceived to experience greater fishery pressures but may have limited compensatory capacity to mitigate COVID-19 impacts along with negative pressures already present.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic impacts on global inland fisheries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many educational institutions have partially or fully closed all operations to cope with the challenges of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we explore strategies that such institutions can adopt to conduct safe reopening and resume operations during the pandemic. The research is motivated by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's (UIUC's) SHIELD program, which is a set of policies and strategies, including rapid saliva-based COVID-19 screening, for ensuring safety of students, faculty and staff to conduct in-person operations, at least partially. Specifically, we study how rapid bulk testing, contact tracing and preventative measures such as mask wearing, sanitization, and enforcement of social distancing can allow institutions to manage the epidemic spread. This work combines the power of analytical epidemic modeling, data analysis and agent-based simulations to derive policy insights. We develop an analytical model that takes into account the asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19, the effect of isolation via testing (both in bulk and through contact tracing) and the rate of contacts among people within and outside the institution. Next, we use data from the UIUC SHIELD program and 85 other universities to estimate parameters that describe the analytical model. Using the estimated parameters, we finally conduct agent-based simulations with various model parameters to evaluate testing and reopening strategies. The parameter estimates from UIUC and other universities show similar trends. For example, infection rates at various institutions grow rapidly in certain months and this growth correlates positively with infection rates in counties where the universities are located. Infection rates are also shown to be negatively correlated with testing rates at the institutions. Through agent-based simulations, we demonstrate that the key to designing an effective reopening strategy is a combination of rapid bulk testing and effective preventative measures such as mask wearing and social distancing. Multiple other factors help to reduce infection load, such as efficient contact tracing, reduced delay between testing and result revelation, tests with less false negatives and targeted testing of high-risk class among others. This paper contributes to the nascent literature on combating the COVID-19 pandemic and is especially relevant for educational institutions and similarly large organizations. We contribute by providing an analytical model that can be used to estimate key parameters from data, which in turn can be used to simulate the effect of different strategies for reopening. We quantify the relative effect of different strategies such as bulk testing, contact tracing, reduced infectivity and contact rates in the context of educational institutions. Specifically, we show that for the estimated average base infectivity of 0.025 ([Formula: see text]), a daily number of tests to population ratio T/N of 0.2, i.e., once a week testing for all individuals, is a good indicative threshold. However, this test to population ratio is sensitive to external infectivities, internal and external mobilities, delay in getting results after testing, and measures related to mask wearing and sanitization, which affect the base infection rate.","output":"Evaluation of reopening strategies for educational institutions during COVID-19 through agent based simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background- Diverse socio-economic and cultural issues contribute to adverse health outcomes and increased mortality rates among rural Indian women across different age categories. The present study aims to comprehensively assess age-specific mortality rates and their temporal trends using a composite measure at the sub-national level for rural Indian females to capture cross-state differences. Methods- A total of 19 states were included in the study to construct a composite age-specific mortality index for 2011 (base year) and 2018 (reference year) and examine the incremental changes in the index values across these years at the sub-national level in India. Sub-index values were calculated for each component age group and were subsequently used to compute the composite ASMR index using the geometric mean method. Based on the incremental changes, the performance of states was categorized into four different typologies. Results- Improvement in mortality index scores in the 0-4 years age group was documented for all states. The mortality rates for the 60+ age group were recorded to be high for all states. Kerela emerged as the overall top performer in terms of mortality index scores, while Bihar and Jharkhand were at the bottom of the mortality index table. The overall mortality composite score has shown minor improvement from base year to reference year at all India level. Conclusions- An overall reduction in the mortality rates of rural Indian women has been observed over the years in India. The success of public health interventions to reduce the under-five mortality rate is evident as the female rural mortality rates have reduced sizably for all states. Nevertheless, there is still sizable scope for reducing mortality rates for other component age groups. Additionally, there is a need to divert attention toward the female geriatric (60+ years) population as the mortality rates are still high.","output":"Comprehensive assessment of Age-Specific Mortality Rate and its incremental changes using a composite measure: A sub-national analysis of rural Indian women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE(S) Our hypothesis was that our devised transesophageal echocardiography probe cover with the capacity for pinpoint suction would improve image quality.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 respiratory infections are frequently worsened by secondary bacterial infections and co-infections due to prolonged hospitalizations;resulting in irreversible lung damage, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest and death. The high mortality rate of Coronavirus Disease 2019 patients is primarily due to multi drug resistant microbial (viral/bacterial) infections, unrestrained inflammatory response and delayed antibody production. The superfluous use of broad spectrum antimicrobial drugs as the last resort has further aggravated the Coronavirus Disease 2019 crisis by contributing to the global antimicrobial resistance. To overcome these hurdles for effective treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 and associated bacterial infections, phage therapy seems to be promising due to a lack of effective antiviral drugs and antimicrobial-resistant superadded bacterial infections. Prior studies suggest that when phages, their cocktails and endolysins are administered alone or in synergism with antibiotics through nebulization or through intravenous and intraperitoneal injections have exhibited greater antibacterial potential to combat even Multidrug-Resistant pulmonary bacterial infections. Bacteriophages and phagicin have also shown potent antiviral activity by triggering the production of antiviral cytokines.

OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of this paper was to use global research on coronaviruses to identify critical elements that can help inform public health policy decisions. We present a data science framework to assist policy makers in implementing cutting-edge data science techniques for the purpose of developing evidence-based public health policies. METHODS: We used the EpiBibR (epidemiology-based bibliography for R) package to gain access to coronavirus research documents worldwide (N=121,231) and their associated metadata. To analyze these data, we first employed a theoretical framework to group the findings into three categories: conceptual, intellectual, and social. Second, we mapped the results of our analysis in these three dimensions using machine learning techniques (ie, natural language processing) and social network analysis. RESULTS: Our findings, firstly, were methodological in nature. They demonstrated the potential for the proposed data science framework to be applied to public health policies. Additionally, our findings indicated that the United States and China were the primary contributors to global coronavirus research during the study period. They also demonstrated that India and Europe were significant contributors, albeit in a secondary position.

Colloidal silver has particularly benefited from this rush given its empirically and scientifically documented anti-bacterial and anti-viral actions. The lack of standards in the unregulated supplements industry remains a major roadblock in evaluating the quality and consistency of marketed products or assessing the accuracy of the information provided by manufacturers. This study is the first scientifically rigorous attempt to evaluate commercial silver colloidal products offered for sale on the internet. Methods: Fourteen of the most popular colloidal silver products purchased from Amazon (www.amazon.com) were evaluated using state-of-the-art analytical techniques widely accepted as gold standards for investigating the properties (size, shape) and the dispersion of silver nanoparticles. Results: Commercial samples were analysed using UV-Vis, FE-SEM and AAS techniques. In general, the Ag concentration was very close to those claimed by the manufacturer. The colorless product shows no absorbance in the UV-Vis analysis. The FESEM and STEM images confirmed the conclusions of the UV-Vis analysis. Conclusion: The results of this evaluation show clearly that 70% of the commercial products evaluated contain only ionic silver. Despite the evidence showing that silver nanoparticles are not present, eight of these products are promoted by the manufacturers as 'colloidal silver'. Considering the extensive scientific research showing major differences between silver ionic and silver nanoparticles in terms of mechanisms of action, efficacy and safety, it is clear that this misrepresentation impacts the consumers and must be addressed.

IgA-mediated cross-linking clumps bacteria in the gut lumen and is critical for protection against infection by non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium). However, classical agglutination, which was thought to drive this process, is efficient only at high pathogen densities (108 non-motile bacteria per gram). In typical infections, much lower densities (100-107 colony-forming units per gram) of rapidly dividing bacteria are present in the gut lumen. Here we show that a different physical process drives formation of clumps in vivo: IgA-mediated cross-linking enchains daughter cells, preventing their separation after division, and clumping is therefore dependent on growth. Enchained growth is effective at all realistic pathogen densities, and accelerates pathogen clearance from the gut lumen. Furthermore, IgA enchains plasmid-donor and -recipient clones into separate clumps, impeding conjugative plasmid transfer in vivo. Enchained growth is therefore a mechanism by which IgA can disarm and clear potentially invasive species from the intestinal lumen without requiring high pathogen densities, inflammation or bacterial killing. Furthermore, our results reveal an untapped potential for oral vaccines in combating the spread of antimicrobial resistance.","output":"High-avidity IgA protects the intestine by enchaining growing bacteria."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current outbreak of COVID-19 is leading an unprecedented scientific effort focusing on targeting SARS-CoV-2 proteins critical for its viral replication.

The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 quarantine on the preparedness of dental graduates and to explore the efficacy and limitations of online education from students perspectives. Methods: the questionnaire distributed to dental students comprised of two main sections;first part covered the online education experience and the second part measured the level of preparedness for a range of cognitive, communication and professional skills. Results: : the survey yielded a response rate of 72%. The majority of students (77%) agreed that they missed educational experiences as a result of the lockdown. More than half of them felt less motivated in following-up with distant e-learning and believed that online assessment is not a good method for evaluation. A high percentage of the students (66%) thought that online group discussions has a positive value whilst 67% preferred online lectures compared to theatre lectures. Majority of students particularly 5th year (78.7%) (p<0.001) stated that the quarantine increased their collaboration with their colleagues. According to 87% of students, the experience most negatively affected was their clinical training.In general, students showed satisfactory preparedness related to a range of attributes and professional skills, however, nearly two-thirds of them prefer to be mentored and favor a structured year of residence.

OBJECTIVE: To understand the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on rural communities in Tennessee, investigate differences in rural-urban mortality rates after controlling for confounding variables, and inform state pandemic response policy. DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis of cumulative COVID-19 morality rates. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Tennessee county-level COVID-19 mortality data from March 1, 2020, to January 31, 2021, were matched with county-level sociodemographic and health data from public datasets: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Social Determinants of Health, PLACES: Local Data for Better Health County Data, and the US Census Bureau. County status was defined using the 2013 National Center for Health Statistics Urban-Rural Classification. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A negative binomial regression model estimated adjusted incidence rate ratio and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for rural compared with urban mortality. Unadjusted rate ratios and rate differences for COVID-19 mortality in rural versus urban counties were compared with those for influenza and pneumonia and all-cause mortality over the past 5 years. RESULTS: During the study period, 9650 COVID-19 deaths occurred across 42 urban and 53 rural counties. Controlling for county-level sociodemographic characteristics, health care access, and comorbidities, incidence rate ratio was 1.13 (95% CI, 1.00-1.28, P < .05) for rural as compared with urban deaths. Unadjusted COVID-19 mortality risk difference between rural and urban counties was greater (61.85, 95% CI, 54.31-69.31) than 5-year influenza and pneumonia rural-urban risk difference (12.57, 95% CI, 11.16-13.00) during 2015-2019.

Two important determinants of variant spread are how frequently they arise within individuals and how likely they are to be transmitted. To characterize within-host diversity and transmission, we deep-sequenced 1313 clinical samples from the United Kingdom. SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by low levels of within-host diversity when viral loads are high and by a narrow bottleneck at transmission. Most variants are either lost or occasionally fixed at the point of transmission, with minimal persistence of shared diversity, patterns that are readily observable on the phylogenetic tree. Our results suggest that transmission-enhancing and/or immune-escape SARS-CoV-2 variants are likely to arise infrequently but could spread rapidly if successfully transmitted.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 within-host diversity and transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has become one of the most immediate and widely-studied systems since its identification and subsequent global outbreak from 2019-2020. In an effort to understand the biophysical changes as a result of mutations, the mechanics of multiple different proteins within the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been studied and compared with SARS-CoV-1. Focusing on the main protease (mPro), we first explored the long range dynamic-relationship, particularly in cross-chain dynamics, using the Dynamic Coupling Index (DCI) to investigate the dynamic coupling between the catalytic site residues and the rest of the protein, both inter and intra chain for the CoV-1 and CoV-2 mPro. We found that there is significant cross-chain coupling between these active sites and distal residues in the CoV-2 mPro but it was missing in CoV-1. The enhanced long distance interactions, particularly between the two chains, suggest subsequently enhanced cooperativity for CoV-2. A further comparative analysis of the dynamic flexibility using the Dynamic Flexibility Index (DFI) between the CoV-1 and CoV-2 mPros shows that the inhibitor binding near active sites induces change in flexibility to a distal region of the protein, opposite in behavior between the two systems; this region becomes more flexible upon inhibitor binding in CoV-1 while it becomes less flexible in the CoV-2 mPro. Upon inspection, we show that, on average, the dynamic flexibility of the sites substituted from CoV-1 to CoV-2 changes significantly less than the average calculated across all residues within the structure, indicating that the differences in behaviors between the two systems is likely the result of allosteric influence, where the new substitutions in COV-2 induce flexibility and dynamical changes elsewhere in the structure. SIGNIFICANCE Here we have conducted a comparative analysis between the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 mPro systems to shed mechanistic insight on the biophysical changes associated with the mutations between these two enzymes. Our work shows that the CoV-2 mPro system exhibits enhanced cross-chain communication between catalytic site residues and the rest of the structure. Further, both dynamic coupling and dynamic flexibility analyses indicates that, largely, the dynamic changes as evaluated by DCI and DFI occur at sites other than the mutation sites themselves, indicating that the functional differences between these two proteins are a result of dynamic allostery","output":"Dynamic Allostery Highlights the Evolutionary Differences between the CoV-1 and CoV-2 Main Proteases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human exposure to infectious aerosols results a transmission of diseases, such as influenza, tuberculosis, and COVID-19. Most dental procedures generate a significant number of aerosolized particles, increasing transmission risk in dental settings. Since the generation of aerosols in dentistry is unavoidable, many clinics started using intervention strategies such as area-filtration units and extraoral evacuation equipment, especially under the relatively recent constraints of the pandemics. However, the effectiveness of these devices in dental operatories has not been studied. Therefore, the dental personnel's ability to position and operate such instruments efficiently is also limited. To address these challenges, we utilized a real-time sensor network for assessment of aerosol dynamics during dental restoration and cleaning producers with and without intervention. The strategies tested during the procedures were (i) local area high-efficiency particle air (HEPA) filters and (ii) extra-oral suction device (EOSD). The study was conducted at the University of Washington School of Dentistry using a network of thirteen fixed sensors positioned within the operatory and one wearable sensor worn by the dental operator. The sensor network provides time and space-resolved particulate matter (PM) data. Three-dimensional (3D) visualization informs aerosol persistence in the operatory. It was found that area filters did not improve the overall aerosol concentration in dental offices significantly. An average of 16% decrease in PM concentration was observed when EOSD equipment was used during the procedures. The combination of real-time sensors and 3D visualization can provide dental personnel and facility mangers with actionable feedback to effectively assess aerosol transmission in medical settings and develop evidence-based intervention strategies.","output":"Methodology for Addressing Infectious Aerosol Persistence in Real-Time Using Sensor Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused significant delays in oncological care worldwide due to restriction of elective surgery and intensive care unit capacity. It has been hypothesized that COVID-free oncological hubs can provide safer elective cancer surgery compared to COVID hospitals. The primary aim of the present study was to analyze the outcomes of minimally invasive esophagectomy for cancer performed in both hospital settings by the same surgical staff. METHODS: All esophagectomies for cancer performed during the pandemic by a single team were reviewed and data were compared with control patients operated during the preceding year. Screening for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was performed prior to surgery, and special precautions were taken to mitigate hospital-related transmission of COVID-19 among patients and healthcare workers. RESULTS: Compared to the prepandemic period, the esophagectomy volume decreased by 64%. Comorbidities, time from onset of symptoms to first visit, waiting time between diagnosis and surgery, operative approach and technique, and the pathological staging were similar. None of the patients tested positive for COVID-19 during in-hospital stay, and esophagectomy was associated with similar outcomes compared to control patients.

RESEARCH DESIGN: This was a longitudinal study with pre-COVID-19 and six mid-COVID-19 interviews, spanning from March 1, 2020, to October 31, 2020. STUDY SAMPLE: The study enrolled 12 participants with hearing aids and 12 with cochlear implants aged 55-80 years that were compared to 18 age-matched adults with hearing within normal limits. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Surveys were completed to evaluate the impact of time alone and loneliness, social contact, depression, and the impact of masks on hearing. A mixed-effects statistical model was used to analyze each question. RESULTS: Participants commonly reported stress and anxiety during monthly video calls. Adults with varying degrees of hearing loss reported decreased social interaction and increased stress during the pandemic, similar to the rates observed by participants with healthy hearing. Face coverings were commonly reported to affect the intelligibility of conversational speech. Participants with hearing loss found satisfactory methods for maintaining social connection during the pandemic that they hope will continue once restrictions ease fully.

Child health experts have stated that school closures may have profound psychosocial consequences for students and need further study. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: To identify how COVID-19 related school closures and sport cancellations impacted the health of adolescent athletes. METHODS: Adolescent athletes in Wisconsin were recruited via social media to complete an online survey in May 2020 while schools were closed to in-person teaching and interscholastic and club sports were cancelled. Assessments included the: General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-7) for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) for depression, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for quality of life. PHQ-9, PFABS and PedsQL scores were compared with historical data (HD) of Wisconsin adolescent athletes (N = 5,231) collected during normal school and sport operations in the years 2016C2018. RESULTS: A total of 3,243 (58% female, Age = 16.1+1.2 yrs., grades 9 C 12) participated in the study. May 2020 participants reported higher (worse) PHQ-9 scores than the HD participants (mean: 8.0 (95%CI: 7.8, 8.2) vs 3.3 (3.1, 3.5), p < 0.001) as well as a higher prevalence of moderate to severe levels of depression (32.9% vs 9.7%, p < 0.001). May 2020 Participants also reported lower (worse) PFABS scores (mean: 12.2 (95%CI: 11.9, 12.5) vs 24.7 (24.5, 24.9) p < 0.001) and lower (worse) PedsQL total scores compared to athletes in the HD group (78.4 (78.0, 78.8) vs. 90.9 (90.5, 91.3) p < 0.001). Females in May 2020 reported increased moderate and severe anxiety percentages than the males in May 2020 (27.7% vs 22.3%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 related school closures and sport cancellations in Wisconsin were associated with increased anxiety and depression as well as decreased physical activity and quality of life in adolescent athletes. The potential negative health impacts of prolonged school closures and sport cancellations should be taken into account when evaluating steps to limit the spread of COVID-19.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 Related School Closures and SPORT CANCELLATIONS on the Health of Adolescent Athletes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a worldwide health issue.

It contains Cathinone, which is an amphetamineslike chemical and causes various adverse outcomes for pregnant women and babies when it is consumed during pregnancy. Decisive estimates of the prevalence of khat chewing and related risk factors which may increase this practice have not been determined. Aim: To determine the pooled prevalence and associated factors of khat chewing among pregnant women in the Horn Africa and the Arabian Peninsula countries with a view to informing targeted interventions for the region. Method: The study protocol was prepared and registered on PROSPERO, ID CRD42021190837. A database search including Gray literature and Google scholar was explored to identify 667 studies. Finally, 14 studies were considered relevant for meta analysis, after removing 259 duplicates, 388 unrelated topics and 6 studies with full text examination. The Newcastle Ottawa Scale quality assessment tool was used to assess the quality of the studies. The pooled prevalence was determined by using the random effect model and the p values of < 0.05 were considered stastically significant to examine associations. Statistical heterogeneity amongst the studies was assessed by Cochrane chisquare and the I2 statistical test. Main Findings: From the metaanalysis of 14 studies with 15,343 study participants, the pooled prevalence of khat chewing among pregnant women was 21.42%, 95% CI (14.49, 29.29); (I 2 = 99.05% (p<0.0001). The results of the meta-analysis demonstrated that pregnant women who had a khat chewing partner [OR 6.50 (95% CI 5.01, 8.43)]; low educational status [OR 2.53 (95% CI 2.24, 2.85)], lived in rural area [OR 1.69 (95% CI 1.52, 1.88)] or had a low level of income [OR 1.70 (95% CI 1.55, 1.87)] were significantly more likely to chew khat during pregnancy. Conclusion: The prevalence of khat chewing amongst pregnant women in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula has never been measured before and was found to be high. Partners khat chewing status, maternal low educational and economic status were the main factors associated with the problem.

Demographic inference based on coalescent theory has been used to reconstruct the population dynamics and evolutionary history of several species, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), an important human pathogen causing tuberculosis. One key assumption of the Kingman coalescent is that the number of descendants of different individuals does not vary strongly, and violating this assumption could lead to severe biases caused by model misspecification. Individual lineages of MTB are expected to vary strongly in reproductive success because 1) MTB is potentially under constant selection due to the pressure of the host immune system and of antibiotic treatment, 2) MTB undergoes repeated population bottlenecks when it transmits from one host to the next, and 3) some hosts show much higher transmission rates compared to the average (super-spreaders). Here we used an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach to test whether multiple merger coalescents (MMC), a class of models that allow for large variation in reproductive success among lineages, are more appropriate models to study MTB populations. We considered eleven publicly available whole genome sequence data sets sampled from local MTB populations and outbreaks, and found that MMC had a better fit compared to the Kingman coalescent for ten of the eleven data sets. These results indicate that the null model for analyzing MTB outbreaks should be reassessed, and that past findings based on the Kingman coalescent need to be revisited.","output":"Multiple merger genealogies in outbreaks of Mycobacterium tuberculosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Port State Control (PSC) is a vital element of sustainable maritime transportation. Inspections of PSC regimes have been ensuring the continuity of the global supply chain as they enforce shipping to implement the maritime regulations to be safe, secure, and environmentally friendly. OBJECTIVE: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the number of onboard ship inspections has decreased inherently for protecting PSC officersand seafarers, while PSC regimes have developed a policy to focus on a high-risk ship based on historical inspection records. In this context, planning for a new normal in maritime transportation, it is essential to realize the change in ship inspection numbers and the trend of deficiency - detention factors for the maritime sector to provide current standards. This study aims to present the difference in ship inspection trends between 2017-2020 by focusing on COVID-19 pandemic outbreak data. METHODS: Comparative analysis with Paris MOU ship inspection & detention figures and entropy-based Grey Relevance Analysis has been used as a methodology to reveal the change in inspection trends after COVID-19. RESULTS: After the pandemic outbreak caused by COVID-19, the number of ship inspections under Paris MOU fell dramatically, however, inspection and detention rate remained the same, also entropy-based Grey Relevance Analysis indicates that detention remarks have also changed compared to last year deficiencies. Detention caused by nautical publication and cleanliness in the engine room has an increasing trend on detentions. CONCLUSION: Inspection statistics indicate consistent figures even during the pandemic outbreak, which indicates the current sample group for Paris MOU inspection is healthy. At the same time, entropy-based Grey Relevance Analysis presents a broader insight that the inspection trend on detention deficiencies has varied. Familiarization with the changing trends in inspections will cause fewer detentions of the ships.

In the present study, the existence of 39 non-antimicrobial PACs and six of their metabolites in wastewater from hospitals and adjacent surface waters in Sri Lanka was investigated from 2016-2018. The highest amount of the measured chemicals, including the highest concentrations of atorvastatin (14,620 ng/L) and two metabolites, mefenamic acid (12,120 ng/L) and o-desmethyl tramadol (8,700 ng/L), were detected in wastewater from the largest facility. Mefenamic acid, gemfibrozil, losartan, cetirizine, carbamazepine, and phenytoin were detected in all the samples. The removal rates in wastewater treatment were 100% for zolpidem, norsertaline, quetiapine, chlorpromazine, and alprazolam. There was substantial variation in removal rates of PACs among facilities, and the overall data suggest that treatment processes in facilities were ineffective and that some PAC concentrations in the effluents were increased. The estimated risk quotients revealed that 14 PACs detected in water samples could pose low to high ecological risk to various aquatic organisms. Compounds such as ibuprofen, tramadol, and chlorpromazine detected in untreated and treated wastewater at these facilities pose a high risk to several aquatic organisms.

In our health-system located in New York City, the provision of care in the ambulatory care setting moved to a remote model virtually overnight. We describe interventions made during the pandemic to transform ambulatory care pharmacy through expansion of telehealth services. Summary: In March of 2020, the closure of primary care clinics and provider appointment cancellations due to inpatient redeployment created a void. Collaboration with other health care providers and development of standardized telehealth workflows served as a conduit for creating new roles and opportunities for pharmacy team members. Three main interventions where the pharmacy team filled gaps include; (1) Expansion of pharmacist telemedicine visits for high-risk patients to improve access to primary care visits, (2) Partnership with nursing to create a centralized refill call center workflow, (3) Integration of pharmacy extenders into the prior authorization process to prevent medication access issues. Existing collaborative practice agreements for chronic disease management were utilized. A virtual pharmacist model for patient care contributed to an increase in telehealth visits from 51 in 2019 to 2997 total visits in 2020. In addition, the health-system refill call center expanded its services through collaboration with our pharmacy team.

Disruption in financial intermediation and associated deflationary pressures caused by the global financial crisis of 2007-2009 and European financial crisis of 2010-2015 pushed central banks (CBs) in major currency areas towards adoption of unconventional monetary policy measures, including large-scale purchase of government bonds (quantitative easing). The same approach has been taken by CBs in response to the COVID-19 crisis in 2020 even if the characteristics of this crisis differ from the previous one. As a result of both crises, CBs have become major holders of government bonds and de facto - main creditors of governments. Against rapidly deteriorating fiscal balances, CBs have become hostages of fiscal policies, which compromises their independence.

Study Design: Prospective observational study. Place and Duration of Study: Pak-Emirates Military Hospital, Rawalpindi Pakistan, from Apr to Jul 2020. Methodology: A total of 94 COVID-19 positive cases admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of this hospital, placed on ventilatory support and who ultimately underwent tracheostomy (whether percutaneous or surgical) were included in the study. Patients were included irrespective of any age group or gender. Results: Out of 94 patients placed on ventilator, tracheostomy was performed only in 17 patients. Male predominance was 13 (76%), with mean age of patients as 55.59  12.93 in 12 patients, surgical tracheostomy was performed (70.58%) whereas in 5 (29.4%) cases percutaneous tracheostomy was done. On post-operative follow-up 8 out of 17 (47%) patients recovered and were successfully decannulated whereas 9 (52.9%) patients could not survive. Tracheostomy was successfully performed as early as 8th day of mechanical ventilator support. Health Care Workers (HCWs) involved were subjected to RT-PCR and remained negative for SARS-CoV-2. There was statistically significant association between the type and indication of tracheostomy, p=0.002. Conclusion: Tracheostomy, in COVID-19 positive patients, being aerosol-generating procedure remains a medical hazard for the HCWs. By following strict safety protocols according to the medical resources available and training of the HCWs, it can be performed with complete safety. It can be done as early as 8th day of ventilator support. ? 2021, Army Medical College.

Increased travel and trade, growing population density, changes in urbanization, and climate have a critical impact on infectious disease spread. Currently, the world is confronted with the emergence of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, responsible for yet more than 800 000 deaths globally. Outbreaks caused by viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, HIV, Ebola, influenza, and Zika, have increased over the past decade, underlining the need for a rapid development of diagnostics and vaccines. Hence, the rational identification of biomarkers for diagnostic measures on the one hand, and antigenic targets for vaccine development on the other, are of utmost importance. Peptide microarrays can display large numbers of putative target proteins translated into overlapping linear (and cyclic) peptides for a multiplexed, high-throughput antibody analysis. This enabled for example the identification of discriminant/diagnostic epitopes in Zika or influenza and mapping epitope evolution in natural infections versus vaccinations. In this review, we highlight synthesis platforms that facilitate fast and flexible generation of high-density peptide microarrays.

This, in turn, has led to a need to understand better the evidence underpinning such moves. Based on a review of existing reviews, this paper critically analyses the relevant literature related to intervention with children with communication disabilities drawing on the COM-B model. METHODS & PROCEDURES: Ten reviews were identified following a systematic searching of electronic databases. These were then coded according to both PRISMA criteria and the components of the COM-B model. Based on these findings, a critical analysis of the state of the tele-practice intervention literature is discussed and fed into evidence-based advice for practitioners transitioning to this mode of service delivery. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: The COM-B mapping suggests that the existing literature has provided primary evidence for physical opportunity and reflective motivation (e.g., participants have the time to take part and the necessary materials, as well as a desire to do it). It has also focused on elements of social opportunity (e.g., having support and prompts from others to take part). However, there are significant gaps in the description and analysis of both physical and psychological capability components. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: Whilst the evidence for tele-practice interventions for children and young people with communication disabilities is growing, it is also lacking a comprehensive framework to support its implementation. In times of rapid transitions, researchers and practitioners alike need to understand how to evaluate comprehensively the impact of changing the mode of intervention delivery. The COM-B model provides a powerful tool to reflect on the key elements for the successful design and implementation of tele-practice interventions. What this paper adds What is already known on this subject Tele-practice has been a feature of service delivery for speech and language therapists working with children and young people with speech and language disorders for many years, as it has in other areas of practice. This came into sharp focus during 2020 during the 'lock-down' following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic when most practice went online. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This study set out to provide a framework for understanding service delivery, drawing on the COM-B behaviour change model. This is applied using a rapid review methodology to 10 systematic and narrative reviews of the existing literature published since 2005. The findings suggest that while most studies demonstrated efficacy, there was a lack of information regarding specific aspects of the model which would affect their implementation. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? It is anticipated that the paper has the potential to have a direct bearing on how tele-practice services for children and young people with speech and language disorders will be delivered in the future. The paper concludes with a series of recommendations for practice and research in terms of the application of the COM-B model to tele-practice in speech and language therapy.","output":"Tele-practice for children and young people with communication disabilities: Employing the COM-B model to review the intervention literature and inform guidance for practitioners"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A COVID-19 outbreak started in Wuhan, China, last December and now has become a global pandemic. The clinical information in caring of critically ill patients with COVID-19 needs to be shared timely, especially under the situations that there is still a largely ongoing spread of COVID-19 in many countries. METHODS: A multicenter prospective observational study investigated all the COVID-19 patients received in 19 ICUs of 16 hospitals in Wuhan, China, over 24 h between 8 AM February 2h and 8 AM February 27, 2020. The demographic information, clinical characteristics, vital signs, complications, laboratory values, and clinical managements of the patients were studied. RESULTS: A total of 226 patients were included. Their median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 64 (57C70) years, and 139 (61.5%) patients were male. The duration from the date of ICU admission to the study date was 11 (5C17) days, and the duration from onset of symptoms to the study date was 31 (24C36) days. Among all the patients, 155 (68.6%) had at least one coexisting disease, and their sequential organ failure assessment score was 4 (2C8). Organ function damages were found in most of the patients: ARDS in 161 (71.2%) patients, septic shock in 34 (15.0%) patients, acute kidney injury occurred in 57 (25.2%) patients, cardiac injury in 61 (27.0%) patients, and lymphocytopenia in 160 (70.8%) patients. Of all the studied patients, 85 (37.6%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, including 14 (6.2%) treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at the same time, 20 (8.8%) received noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and 24 (10.6%) received continuous renal replacement therapy. By April 9, 2020, 87 (38.5%) patients were deceased and 15 (6.7%) were still in the hospital.

OBJECTIVE: To draw a portrait of e-services as a digital approach to support digital health literacy in vulnerable populations amid the COVID-19 infodemic, and identify the barriers and facilitators for their implementation. METHODS: A scoping review was performed to gather published literature with a broad range of study designs and grey literature without exclusions based on country of publication. A search was created in Medline (Ovid) in March 2021 and translated to Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus and CINAHL with Full Text (EBSCOhost). The combined literature search generated 819 manuscripts. To be included, manuscripts had to be written in English, and present information on digital intervention(s) (e.g. social media) used to enable or increase digital health literacy among vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. older adults, Indigenous people living on reserve). RESULTS: Five articles were included in the study. Various digital health literacy-enabling e-services have been implemented in different vulnerable populations. Identified e-services aimed to increase disease knowledge, digital health literacy and social media usage, help in coping with changes in routines and practices, decrease fear and anxiety, increase digital knowledge and skills, decrease health literacy barriers and increase technology acceptance in specific groups. Many facilitators of digital health literacy-enabling e-services implementation were identified in expectant mothers and their families, older adults and people with low-income. Barriers such as low literacy limited to no knowledge about the viruses, medium of contamination, treatment options played an important role in distracting and believing in misinformation and disinformation. Poor health literacy was the only barrier found, which may hinder the understanding of individual health needs, illness processes and treatments for people with HIV/AIDS. CONCLUSIONS: The literature on the topic is scarce, sparse and immature. We did not find any literature on digital health literacy in Indigenous people, though we targeted this vulnerable population. Although only a few papers were included, two types of health conditions were covered by the literature on digital health literacy-enabling e-services, namely chronic conditions and conditions that are new to the patients. Digital health literacy can help improve prevention and adherence to a healthy lifestyle, improve capacity building and enable users to take the best advantage of the options available, thus strengthening the patients involvement in health decisions and empowerment, and finally improving health outcomes.

We therefore explored the relationship between thrombus imaging characteristics on noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with clot length and pial collaterals on baseline computed tomography angiography (CTA). METHODS Prospective study of acute ischemic stroke patients (2005-2009) from Keimyung University. Patients with known stroke symptom onset time, baseline CTA, MRI, and with M1-Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA)intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusions were included. Clot length and pial collaterals were measured on baseline CTA. RESULTS A total of 104 patients (mean age 65.112.28 years, 56.7% male, median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 13) with intracranial ICA + MCA (n=50) or isolated M1-MCA (n=54) occlusions were included. Hyperdense sign on NCCT had a median clot length of 42.3 mm versus 29.5 mm when hyperdense negative (p=0.02). Clots showing blooming artifact on gradient recall echo MRI had a median length of 39.1 mm versus 24.5 mm without blooming (p=0.005). Patients with poor baseline collaterals on CTA had longer clots than those with intermediate/good collaterals (median clot length 49.4 mm vs 34.9 mm vs 20.5 mm respectively, p<0.001). In censored logistic regression modeling, clot length was an independent predictor of hyperdense sign (p=0.05) and of the presence of blooming artifact (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS Clot length and baseline collateral status are independent predictors of clot hyperdensity on NCCT and blooming artifact on gradient recall echo. Longer clots are more likely to be hyperdense and to bloom more, probably because portions of these clots are freshly formed locally due to of stasis of blood around the original clot.

We developed an automated search engine to screen a total of 59,000 articles in a few seconds. Filtering of the articles was then undertaken using keywords and questions, e.g. \\"Effects of diabetes on COVID/normal coronavirus/SARS-CoV-2/nCoV/COVID-19 disease severity, mortality?\\".

BACKGROUND: Regulatory resources help employees manage their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours on a daily basis. On days when these resources are low, employees may engage in maladaptive self-regulation: more self-undermining (i.e. creating additional obstacles) and less job crafting (i.e. optimizing job demands and resources), which debilitates their work performance. We expected that self-regulation is impaired especially when individuals exhibit low motivation and low ability to regulate their behaviour, that is, when they experience elevated burnout. DESIGN: This research used a daily diary design. Nurses responded to a general survey and then completed daily diary surveys in three different moments: before, during and after work for 10 consecutive workdays (total reports N = 732). METHOD: A sample of 81 nurses from Polish hospitals and primary healthcare centres completed self-reported questionnaires between January and March 2018. Hypotheses were tested using multilevel modelling in Mplus. RESULTS: Momentary self-regulatory capacity before work was negatively related to self-undermining and positively related to job crafting, and it indirectly predicted daily job performance. As hypothesized, these indirect relationships were moderated by general, chronic burnout. We found that only for employees with low levels of burnout, daily self-regulation was linked with better functioning via increased job crafting and decreased self-undermining. CONCLUSION: Chronic burnout disturbs day-to-day behaviour regulation. Individuals with elevated burnout symptoms have difficulty to translate momentary boosts in regulatory resources into adaptive strategies that are linked with higher performance. IMPACT: Our findings call for better recovery programmes, strategic Human Resource Management practices aimed at reducing factors that deplete daily self-regulatory resources, and finally top-down interventions preventing burnout among employees in the healthcare system.","output":"Burnout and self-regulation failure: A diary study of self-undermining and job crafting among nurses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY DESIGN A laboratory investigation using porcine model. OBJECTIVE To clarify the effectiveness of the soft coagulation system for stopping bleeding from the epidural vein using different outputs and the safety in terms of tissue damage including spinal cord injury. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Problems associated with coagulation using an electrosurgical device, such as carbonization of tissue or adhesion to the electrode, have been highlighted. So called \\"soft coagulation\\" has been developed to solve these problems. Its' utility as well as the safety of the neural structure in spine surgery has never been reported. METHODS A total of 3 animals and 45 spinal segments were used. Total laminectomy was performed to expose the dural tube and epidural venous plexus. Stable bleeding was induced by a 22 G needle puncture. Soft coagulation monopolar output (SCM), soft coagulation bipolar output (SCB), and conventional bipolar output (CB) were used as the coagulators. Valid hemostasis was defined as macroscopically complete bleeding stoppage by coagulation within 3 minutes. The neurological assessment was evaluated by somatosensory evoked potential. Histologic analysis was performed to determine the area of thermal damage. RESULTS Valid hemostasis ratio was 75.0% of SCM group, 68.8% of SCB group, and 30.8% of CB group. Somatosensory evoked potential monitoring revealed that spinal cord injury was observed in 4 lesions (25%) of the SCM group. Neither bipolar groups (SCB and CB) showed any changes in waveform pattern. Histologic analysis revealed that severe thermal damages were observed in the epidural space of the SCM group. CONCLUSIONS The usefulness of soft coagulation is revealed in terms of bleeding stoppage from epidural vessels and reduced soft-tissue damage compared with the conventional electric device.

The paper addresses our preparedness for the management of such acute health emergencies and the need to enhance awareness, about public health and healthcare mechanisms. In view of this unprecedented health crisis, distributed ledger and AI technology can be seen as one of the promising alternatives for fighting against such epidemics at the early stages, and with the higher efficacy. At the implementation level, blockchain integration, early detection and avoidance of an outbreak, identity protection and safety, and a secure drug supply chain can be realized. At the opposite end of the continuum, artificial intelligence methods are used to detect corona effects until they become too serious, avoiding costly drug processing. The paper explores the application of blockchain and artificial intelligence in order to fight with COVID-19 epidemic scenarios.

Conducting population based sero-surveys during the epidemic has moreover been extremely challenging, driving our group and others to study blood donor samples. METHODS: We collected regional epidemiological COVID-19 surveillance data, and simultaneously monitored anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalences monthly throughout the epidemic in 5 major Region-associated Blood Transfusion Centres of Madagascar over a period of 9 months.

On the one hand, efficient transportation plays a pivotal role in enabling the movement of essential workers and keeping the economy moving. On the other hand, public transit can be a vector for disease propagation due to travelers' proximity within shared and enclosed spaces. Without strategic preparedness, mass transit facilities are potential hotbeds for spreading infectious diseases. Thus, transportation agencies face a complex trade-off when developing context-specific operating strategies for public transit. This work provides a network-based analysis framework for understanding this trade-off, as well as tools for calculating targeted commute restrictions under different policy constraints, e.g., regarding public health considerations (limiting infection levels) and economic activity (limiting the reduction in travel). The resulting plans ensure that the traffic flow restrictions imposed on each route are adaptive to the time-varying epidemic dynamics. A case study based on the COVID-19 pandemic reveals that a well-planned subway system in New York City can sustain 88\\\\% of transit flow while reducing the risk of disease transmission by 50 \\\\% relative to fully-loaded public transit systems. Transport policy-makers can exploit this optimization-based framework to address health-and-economic trade-offs and make proactive transit management plans during an epidemic outbreak.","output":"Managing Public Transit during a Pandemic: The Trade-Off between Safety and Mobility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Vaccination is an important strategy for the eradication of infectious diseases. CadF protein of Campylobacter jejuni is one of the important factors in the pathogenesis of this bacterium. The purpose of this work was to perform a bioinformatics study to identify an epitope-based CadF vaccine, as a subunit vaccine. Full protein sequences of CadF were extracted from the NCBI and UniProt databases and subjected to in silico evaluations, including sequence analysis, allergenicity, antigenicity, epitope conservancy, and molecular docking assessments done by different servers. RESULTS: The results showed that CadF was a highly conserved protein belonging to the outer member proteins superfamily. Among the evaluated epitopes, LSDSLALRL was identified as an antigenic and non-allergenic peptide with a suitable structure for vaccine development. It was also able to stimulate both T and B cells. This 9-mer peptide was located in 136C144 segment of CadF protein and interacted with both HLA-A 0101 and HLA-DRB1 0101 alleles.

While increases in stress-related symptomatology and other adverse psycho-social outcomes as well as their most important risk factors have been described, hardly anything is known about potential protective factors. Resilience refers to the maintenance of mental health despite adversity. In order to gain mechanistic insights about the relationship between described psycho-social resilience factors and resilience specifically in the current crisis, we assessed resilience factors, exposure to Corona crisis-specific and general stressors, as well as internalizing symptoms in a cross-sectional online survey conducted in 24 languages during the most intense phase of the lockdown in Europe (March 22nd to April 19th) in a convenience sample of N=15,970 adults. Resilience, as an outcome, was conceptualized as good mental health despite stressor exposure and measured as the inverse residual between actual and predicted symptom total score. Preregistered hypotheses (osf.io/r6btn) were tested with multiple regression models and mediation analyses. Results confirmed our primary hypothesis that positive appraisal style (PAS) is positively associated with resilience (p<0.0001). The resilience factor PAS also partly mediated the positive association between perceived social support and resilience, and its association with resilience was in turn partly mediated by the ability to easily recover from stress (both p<0.0001). In comparison with other resilience factors, good stress response recovery and positive appraisal specifically of the consequences of the Corona crisis were the strongest factors.

However, the disease burden has sharply declined and epidemic areas have shrunk after the implementation of an integrated malaria control and elimination strategy, especially since 2000. In this review, the lessons were distilled from the Chinese national malaria elimination programme and further efforts to mitigate the challenges of malaria resurgence are being discussed. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation was performed to assess the changes in malaria epidemic patterns from 1950 to 2017 at national level. The malaria data before 2004 were collected from paper-based annual reports. After 2004, each of the different cases from the Infectious Diseases Information Reporting Management System (IDIRMS) was closely examined and scrutinized. An additional documenting system, the National Information Management System for Malaria, established in 2012 to document the interventions of three parasitic diseases, was also examined to complete the missing data from IDIRMS. RESULTS: From 1950 to 2017, the occurrence of indigenous malaria has been steeply reduced, and malaria-epidemic regions have substantially shrunk, especially after the launch of the national malaria elimination programme. There were approximately 30 million malaria cases annually before 1949 with a mortality rate of 1%. A total of 5999 indigenous cases were documented from 2010 to 2016, with a drastic reduction of 99% over the 6 years (2010, n = 4262; 2016, n = 3). There were indigenous cases reported in 303 counties from 18 provinces in 2010, but only 3 indigenous cases were reported in 2 provinces nationwide in 2016. While in 2017, for the first time, zero indigenous case was reported in China, and only 7 of imported cases were in individuals who died of Plasmodium falciparum infection. CONCLUSION: Malaria elimination in China is a country-led and country-owned endeavour. The country-own efforts were a clear national elimination strategy, supported by two systems, namely a case-based surveillance and response system and reference laboratory system. The country-led efforts were regional and inter-sectoral collaboration as well as sustained monitoring and evaluation. However, there are still some challenges, such as the maintenance of non-transmission status, the implementation of a qualified verification and assessment system, and the management of imported cases in border areas, through regional cooperation. The findings from this review can probably help improving malaria surveillance systems in China, but also in other elimination countries.

Diagnostic gold standard is currently reverse transcription of the (+)RNA genome and subgenomic RNAs and subsequent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavages. In order to further improve the diagnostic accuracy, particularly for the reliable discrimination between negative and false-negative specimens, we propose the combination of the RT-qPCR workflow with subsequent pyrosequencing of a S-gene amplicon. This extension might add important value mainly in cases with low SARS-CoV-2 load, where RT-qPCR alone can deliver conflicting results. Results: We successfully established a combined RT-qPCR and S-gene pyrosequencing method. This method can be optionally exploited after routine diagnostics or for epidemiologic studies allowing a more reliable interpretation of conflicting RT-qPCR results. This may occur in specimens with relatively low viral loads and close to the detection limits of qPCR, practically for CT values >30. After laboratory implementation and characterization of a best practice protocol we tested the combined method in a field study on a large pediatric cohort from two German medical centers (n=769). Pyrosequencing after RT-qPCR enabled us to uncover previously unrecognized cases of pediatric COVID-19 spectrum diseases, partially exhibiting unusual and heterogeneous presentation. Moreover, it is notable that in the course of RT-qPCR/pyrosequencing method establishment when routinely confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens were used we did not observe any case of false-positive diagnosis. Conclusions: The proposed protocol allows a specific and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 close to the detection limits of RT-qPCR. Combined RT-qPCR/pyrosequencing does not negatively affect preceding RT-qPCR pipeline in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and can be optionally applied in routine to inspect conflicting RT-qPCR results.","output":"Combined RT-qPCR and Pyrosequencing of a SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein Polybasic Cleavage Motif Uncovers Rare Pediatric COVID-19 Spectrum Diseases of Unusual Presentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Host genomic information, specifically genomic variations, may characterize susceptibility to disease and identify people with a higher risk of harm, leading to better targeting of care and vaccination.

Our aim was therefore to evaluate the anti-HIV-1 activity of a new set of antivirals, dipeptides (WG-am or VQ-am) combined with a single-stranded oligonucleotide (ssON). The dipeptides were identified as naturally occurring and enriched in feces and systemic circulation in HIV-1-infected elite controllers and were proposed to act as entry inhibitors by binding to HIV-1 gp120. The ssON is DNA 35-mer, stabilized by phosphorothioate modifications, which acts on the endocytic step by binding to cell host receptors and inhibiting viruses through interference with binding to nucleolin. METHODS: ChouCTalalays Combination Index method for quantifying synergism was used to evaluate the drug combinations. Patient-derived chimeric viruses encoding the gp120 (env region) were produced by transient transfection and used to evaluate the antiviral profile of the combinations by drug susceptibility assays. RESULTS: We found that the combination WG-am:ssON or VQ-am:ssON had low combination index values, suggesting strong antiviral synergism. Of the two combinations, WG-am:ssON (1 mM:1 M) had high efficacy against all prototype or patient-derived HIV-1 isolates tested, independent of subtype including the HIV-1-A6 sub-subtype. In addition, the antiviral effect was independent of co-receptor usage in patient-derived strains.

A group of eight healthy 28-41-year-old right-handed male medical students were subjected to an extensive interactive self-report inventory (ISI) evaluating perceptions of their psychosocial interactions. Quantitative EEG (qEEG) was performed with eyes closed. Computations of fAA and related parameters were based on measurements in the alpha bandwidth (8-13 Hz) at the left frontal F7 and right frontal F8 scalp electrodes. fAA was the percent difference between mean voltages at F8 minus that at F7. Significance of associations between fAA and the ISI scores was determined by Pearsons product-moment correlation coefficient, at P0.05. Depressed scores were positively correlated with right-sided fAA (P=0.01). Relaxed (P=0.05), regulated (P=0.02), cooperative (P=0.05) and dependent scores (P=0.004) were negatively correlated with right-sided fAA. These findings imply that right-sided fAA may be associated with more perceptions of depressed psychosocial interactions involving negative thoughts about oneself, as well as, more reliance on others (dependence score), less sharing (cooperative ISI score), less trust (regulated ISI score) and less initiative (relaxed ISI score).

This study aimed to determine potential major shedding sources based on literature data of C(RNA), along with the COVID-19 prevalence in the catchment area through a systematic literature review. Theoretical C(RNA) under a certain prevalence was estimated using Monte Carlo simulations, with eight scenarios accommodating feces alone, and both feces and sputum as shedding sources.

With both sputum and feces, 91% of the WBE data were below the simulated maximum C(RNA) in wastewater. The inclusion of sputum as a major shedding source led to more comparable theoretical C(RNA) to the literature WBE data.

However, information on longer-term clinical sequelae following acute COVID-19 is emerging. We followed a group of persons with COVID-19 in Zambia at two months to assess persistent symptoms. METHODS: in September 2020, we re-contacted participants from SARS-CoV-2 prevalence studies conducted in Zambia in July 2020 whose polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were positive. Participants with valid contact information were interviewed using a structured questionnaire that captured demographics, pre-existing conditions, and types and duration of symptoms. We describe the frequency and duration of reported symptoms and used chi-square tests to explore variability of symptoms by age group, gender, and underlying conditions. RESULTS: of 302 participants, 155 (51%) reported one or more acute COVID-19-related symptoms in July 2020. Cough (50%), rhinorrhoea (36%) and headache (34%) were the most frequently reported symptoms proximal to diagnosis. The median symptom duration was 7 days (IQR: 3-9 days). At a median follow up of 54 days (IQR: 46-59 day), 27 (17%) symptomatic participants had not yet returned to their pre-COVID-19 health status.

An increase in the age of patients with coronary artery disease has been related to in-hospital mortality, which has seen an upsurge over a short period of time. However, there is no consensus about the percutaneous coronary angioplasty strategy to follow for older patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (MVCAD). Complete revascularisation (CR) or incomplete revascularisation (ICR) strategy depends on prognosis but this has not yet been accurately described because of geriatric conditions and comorbidities. The aim of this study is to evaluate changes of clinical and biochemical parameters in older patients with MVCAD undergoing revascularisation and to establish a prognostic stratification model for CR and ICR. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This observational, longitudinal, prospective study will include 150 patients with MVCAD and subsequent revascularisation who attend the Hospital Universitario Virgen de la Victoria (Mlaga, Spain). Because of the dropout rates, 180 patients will be recruited at the beginning. Sociodemographic characteristics, clinical and angiographic parameters, and biochemical variables, such as cardiovascular, metabolic, inflammatory, stress oxidative biomarkers, will be collected in the admission for coronary revascularisation and three follow-ups at 6, 12 and 18 months. Statistical analyses will be conducted with these data using CR and ICR as the primary exposure variable. Relevant explanatory variables will be selected from a predictive model for their inclusion in a prognostic stratification model. The primary outcome measures will be major adverse cardiovascular events. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Protocols and patient information have been approved by the regional research ethics committee (CEIm Provincial de Mlaga-PEIBA (PI0131/2020). The results will be disseminated in international peer-reviewed journals, presented at conferences in Cardiology and Gerontology, and sent to participants, medical and health service managers, clinicians and other researchers.","output":"Prognostic stratification of older patients with multivessel coronary artery disease treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty based on clinical and biochemical measures: protocol for a prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"REVASCAT is a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial seeking to establish whether subjects meeting following main inclusion criteria: age 18-80, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 6, evidence of intracranial internal carotid artery or proximal (M1 segment) middle cerebral artery occlusion, Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography score of >7 on non-contrast CT or >6 on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging , ineligible for or with persistent occlusion after intravenous alteplase and procedure start within 8 hours from symptom onset, have higher rates of favorable outcome when treated with the Solitaire FR embolectomy device compared to standard medical therapy alone The primary end-point, based on intention-to-treat criteria is the distribution of modified Rankin Scale scores at 90 days.

Powered by the natural diversity of immune response, hpAbs are effective in treating diseases caused by complex or quickly-evolving antigens such as viruses. We previously showed that transchromosomic (Tc) cattle carrying a human artificial chromosome (HAC) comprising the entire unrearranged human immunoglobulin heavy-chain (hIGH) and kappa-chain (hIGK) germline loci (named as HAC) are capable of producing functional hpAbs when both of the bovine immunoglobulin mu heavy-chains, bIGHM and bIGHML1, are homozygously inactivated (double knockouts or DKO). However, B lymphocyte development in these Tc cattle is compromised, and the overall production of hpAbs is low. Here, we report the construction of an improved HAC, designated as cKSL-HAC, by incorporating all of the human immunoglobulin germline loci into the HAC. Furthermore, for avoiding the possible human-bovine interspecies incompatibility between the human immunoglobulin mu chain protein (hIgM) and bovine transmembrane  and  immunoglobulins (bIg and bIg) in the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) complex, we partially replaced (bovinized) the hIgM constant domain with the counterpart of bovine IgM (bIgM) that is involved in the interaction between bIgM and bIg/Ig; human IgM bovinization would also improve the functionality of hIgM in supporting B cell activation and proliferation. We also report the successful production of DKO Tc cattle carrying the cKSL-HAC (cKSL-HAC/DKO), the dramatic improvement of B cell development in these cattle and the high level production of hpAbs (as measured for the human IgG isotype) in the plasma.

In this study, a Chinese PDCoV strain, designated CHN-HN-1601, was isolated from the faeces of a diarrhoeic piglet. After plaque purification, the genome was determined which shared 97.5%-99.5% nucleotide identities with 71 representative PDCoV strains available in the GenBank. The pathogenic properties of CHN-HN-1601 were evaluated using 5-day-old piglets. All inoculated piglets developed severe diarrhoea from 2 days post-infection (dpi) onwards. To our surprise, two periods of diarrhoea starting from 2 to 7 dpi and from 13 to 19 dpi were observed in affected piglets during the experiment. Faecal viral shedding of the inoculated piglets was detected by real-time RT-PCR, with viral shedding peaked at 4 and 16 dpi, respectively. At necropsy at 5 dpi, the main gross lesions included transparent, thin-walled and gas-distended intestines containing yellow watery contents. Further histopathological examinations, including haematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemistry and RNAscope in situ hybridization, revealed that the virus infection caused severe villous atrophy of the small intestines, with PDCoV antigen and RNA mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of the villous epithelial cells of jejunum and ileum in piglets. The dynamic production of PDCoV-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies in serum of the affected piglets was also assessed using a whole virus-based ELISA and an immunofluorescence assay-based neutralization test, respectively. Furthermore, a full-length cDNA infectious clone of CHN-HN-1601 was constructed using a bacterial artificial chromosome system. The rescued virus exhibited in vitro growth and pathogenic properties similar to the parental virus.

The goal of this study was to analyze the vitamin D status of a cancer patient cohort from our clinic in the Franconian region, Germany. METHODS: 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were available for 116 patients included in prospective trials in our clinic. Associations of vitamin D with anthropometric and blood parameters were investigated using Kendall's &#964; correlation coefficients and linear regression. RESULTS: A total of 57 patients (49.1%) were vitamin D deficient (<20 ng/mL), and 92.2% did not meet the recommended vitamin D level of 40 ng/mL. There was a strong negative association between vitamin D and leukocyte count (&#964; = -0.173, p = 0.007) and C-reactive protein concentration (&#964; = -0.172, p = 0.007). In linear regression, the most important variables for predicting vitamin D levels were (in order of decreasing importance) season, fat mass index, platelet, and leukocyte count. CONCLUSIONS: Despite appeals towards medical societies to target widespread vitamin D deficiency in Germany more than 10 years ago, our data indicate that these have been without avail.

BACKGROUND At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we created a same-day discharge (SDD) pathway after conscious sedation, transfemoral (minimalist) TAVR to help minimize risk of viral transmission and conserve hospital resources. Studies support that next-day discharge (NDD) for carefully selected patients following minimalist TAVR is safe and feasible. There is a paucity of data regarding the safety of SDD after TAVR. METHODS In-hospital and 30 day outcomes of consecutive patients meeting pre-specified criteria for SDD after minimalist TAVR at our institution between March and July of 2020 were reviewed. Outcomes were compared to a NDD cohort from July 2018 through July 2020 that would have met SDD criteria. Primary endpoints were mortality, delayed pacemaker placement, stroke and cardiovascular readmission at 30 days. RESULTS Twenty nine patients were discharged via the SDD pathway after TAVR. 128 prior NDD patients were identified who met all criteria for SDD. The STS scores were similar between the two groups (SDD 2.6% 1.5 vs. NDD 2.3%  1.2). There were no deaths at 30 days in either group. There was no significant difference in delayed pacemaker placement (SDD 0% vs. NDD 0.8%, p > .99) or cardiovascular readmission (SDD 0% vs. NDD 5.5%, p = .35) at 30 days.

AIM: To assess the frequency of hepatic steatosis in the chest CT of COVID-19 patients and its association with the PSS. METHODS: The chest CT images of 485 patients who were admitted to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19 were retrospectively evaluated. The patients were divided into two groups as COVID-19-positive [CT- and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive] and controls (CT- and RT-PCR-negative). The CT images of both groups were evaluated for PSS as the ratio of the volume of involved lung parenchyma to the total lung volume. Hepatic steatosis was defined as a liver attenuation value of  40 Hounsfield units (HU). RESULTS: Of the 485 patients, 56.5% (n = 274) were defined as the COVID-19-positive group and 43.5% (n = 211) as the control group. The average age of the COVID-19-positive group was significantly higher than that of the control group (50.9  10.9 years vs 40.4  12.3 years, P < 0.001). The frequency of hepatic steatosis in the positive group was significantly higher compared with the control group (40.9% vs 19.4%, P < 0.001).

Thromboelastography (TEG) has been suggested as a tool for identifying patients at increased risk of VTE. This study aims to determine if serial TEG evaluation predicts the development of VTE in patients with COVID-19 and respiratory failure admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 and respiratory failure without a prior diagnosis of acute VTE. Patients underwent TEG on days 1, 4, and 6 of ICU admission. The number of hypercoagulable days, defined as elevated TEG maximum amplitude, were recorded. The outcome was time from ICU admission to VTE during the hospital admission. Patients were censored at death and discharge. A Cox proportional hazards model was fit for time to first VTE controlling for patient age, sex, and exposure to antiplatelet agents. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were enrolled in the study (11 females/45 males);41.1% had a hypercoagulable TEG (MA above the upper limit of normal) on ICU day 1, 55.4% on day 4, and 48.2% on day 6. The primary outcome of VTE occurred in 17 patients (30.4%). The median time from ICU admission to VTE was 7 days (IQR 3-12). Of the 14 patients with hypercoagulable MA on all 3 measured days, 1 patient (7.1%) developed a VTE compared to 15.4% of those with hypercoagulable MA for 2 days (N=13), 30.8% of those hypercoagulable for 1 day (N=13), and 62.5% of patients not hypercoagulable any of the 3 days (N=16). Multivariable Cox-proportional hazards model found that increasing number of hypercoagulable days by MA was associated with a decreased risk of VTE (OR 0.48, CI 0.27-0.85, p=0.01). A Cox proportional hazards regression curve for the number of hypercoagulable days by MA holding all other covariates at their medians is shown in Figure 1. CONCLUSION: In this study, more hypercoagulable days on TEG MA measurement was counterintuitively associated with a decreased risk of VTE in patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure. The normal response to inflammation and infection is upregulation of pro-coagulant acute phase reactants suggesting that increased TEG MA may be physiologic. TEG MA measures below the upper limit of normal are associated with an increased risk of VTE and may mark the development of a consumptive coagulopathy.","output":"Maximum amplitude measurement on thromboelastography is inversely associated with development of venous thromboembolism in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The amount of data, manpower and capital required to understand, evaluate and agree on a group of symptoms for the elementary prognosis of pandemic diseases is enormous.

However, the patient was continuously treated with the extracorporeal multi-organ- ADVanced Organ Support (ADVOS) device (ADVITOS GmbH, Munich, Germany). During eight 24h-treatment-sessions blood flow (100C300 mL/min), dialysate flow (160C320 mL/min) and dialysate pH (7.6C9.0) were adapted to optimize arterial PaCO(2) and pH. Effective CO(2) removal and correction of acidosis could be demonstrated by mean arterial- versus post-dialyzer values of pCO(2) (68.7  13.8 vs. 26.9  11.6 mmHg; p < 0.001). The CO(2)-elimination rate was 48  23mL/min. The initial vasopressor requirement could be reduced in parallel to pH-normalization. Interruptions of ADVOS-treatment repeatedly resulted in reversible deteriorations of p(a)CO(2) and pH. After 95 h of continuous extracorporeal decarboxylating therapy the patient had markedly improved circulatory parameters compared to baseline. In the context of secondary pulmonary infection and progressive liver failure, the patient had a sudden cardiac arrest. In accordance with the presumed patient will, we decided against mechanical resuscitation.

However, currently, there is a lack of systematic study and quantitative information of the aerosol generation during these instruments, which is crucial for offering risk assessment and the corresponding mitigation strategies for the reopening of these activities. Collaborating with 15 musicians from the Minnesota Orchestra, we conduct a systematic study of the aerosol generation from a large variety of wind instruments under different music dynamic levels and articulation patterns. We find that the aerosol concentration from different brass and woodwinds exhibits two orders of magnitude variation. Accordingly, we categorize the instruments into low (tuba), intermediate (bassoon, piccolo, flute, bass clarinet, French horn, and clarinet) and high risk (trumpet, bass trombone, and oboe) levels based on a comparison of their aerosol generation with those from normal breathing and speaking. In addition, we observe that the aerosol generation can be affected by the changing dynamic level, articulation pattern, the normal respiratory behaviors of individuals, and even the usage of some special techniques during the instrument play. However, such effects vary substantially for different types of instrument, depending on specific breathing techniques as well as the tube structure and inlet design of the instrument.

The biological function of -syn remains elusive; however, increasing evidence suggests that the protein is involved in the regulation of synaptic vesicle fusion, signifying the importance of -syn-lipid interactions. We show that -syn preferentially binds to GM1-rich, liquid-ordered lipid domains on cytoplasmic membranes by using unroofed cells, which encapsulates lipid complexity and cellular topology. Moreover, proteins (Rab3a, syntaxin-1A, and VAMP2) involved in exocytosis also localize with -syn, supporting its proposed functional role in exocytosis. To investigate how these lipid/protein interactions influence -syn at the residue level, -syn was derivatized with an environmentally sensitive fluorophore (7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl [NBD]) at different N- and C-terminal sites. Measurements of NBD fluorescence lifetime distributions reveal that -syn adopts a multitude of membrane-bound conformations, which were not recapitulated in simple micelle or vesicle models, indicating an exquisite sensitivity of the protein to the complex lipid environment. Interestingly, these data also suggest the participation of the C terminus in membrane localization, which is generally overlooked and thus emphasize the need to use cellularly derived and biologically relevant membranes for biophysical characterization. Collectively, our results demonstrate that -syn is more conformationally dynamic at the membrane interface than previously appreciated, which may be important for both its physiological and pathological functions.","output":"Unroofing site-specific -synuclein-lipid interactions at the plasma membrane."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Limited data can be found about surgical outcome of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) arising in non-diseased liver. The study aim was to compare short- and long-term outcomes among HCC patients with normal and diseased liver parenchyma, undergoing potentially curative liver resection in a developing country. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 2001 until January 2017, 228 patients with HCC underwent curative-intent hepatectomy at the University Clinic for Digestive Surgery. From that number, 190 patients were eligible for analysis. Diseased liver (DL) was present in 112 patients while 78 patients had HCC in non-diseased liver (NDL). RESULTS: Median age, sex, ASA score, the presence of extrahepatic disease and lobar distribution of tumors were similar in both groups. The number of tumors was higher in DL group, while tumor diameter was higher in NDL group. Anatomic liver resection and major liver resections were performed more commonly in NDL than in DL group (66.7 vs 47.4%, p = 0.008; 33.3 vs. 15.2%, p = 0.003). Postoperative morbidity was significantly higher in DL group (p = 0.004). Overall survival was statistically longer in NDL group (p = 0.024). By univariate analysis potential prognostic factors for long-term survival were identified: presence of chronic HCV infection, presence of cirrhosis, Child-Pugh score B and operative time longer than 240 min. The last two were confirmed by multivariate analysis as independent negative prognostic factors for overall survival.

An eNose is cheap and noninvasive and yields results within minutes. In a single-center prospective cohort study, we included patients who were treated with chemotherapy expected to result in PCIN. Based on standardized indications, a full diagnostic workup was performed to confirm invasive aspergillosis or to rule it out. Patients with no aspergillosis were considered controls, and patients with probable or proven aspergillosis were considered index cases. Exhaled breath was examined with a Cyranose 320 (Smith Detections, Pasadena, CA). The resulting data were analyzed using principal component reduction. The primary endpoint was cross-validated diagnostic accuracy, defined as the percentage of patients correctly classified using the leave-one-out method.

Adolescents are vulnerable to the stress of the pandemic, and may experience indicators of psychological distress, such as depression. This study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19-related stressors on depression and the mediating role of life history strategies. METHODS: A two-wave longitudinal study was conducted with 1123 adolescents (51.20% girls, M(age) = 14.30) recruited from three junior high schools in the Northeastern province of China. Adolescents' life history strategies, depressive symptoms, and demographic variables were assessed at Time 1 (November 2019) and Time 2 (August 2020), and adolescents' experience of COVID-19-related stressors was assessed at Time 2. None of participants was infected by COVID-19 virus. RESULTS: COVID-19-related stressors were positively associated with depressive symptoms at Time 2 ( = 0.08, p < 0.01), after controlling for gender, age, SES and depressive symptoms at Time 1. And life history strategies partially mediated the relation of pandemic stress to depression (indirect effect = 0.02, p < 0.05, 95% CI [0.004, 0.034]).

METHOD: Questionnaires were completed by 116 reserve Israeli Home Front Command medical staff (71% males). Background variables (e.g., gender), personality variables (self-efficacy and sense of coherence - SOC), situational variables (state-anxiety, self-rated health and sense of threat) and organizational variables (satisfaction with militarys and governments handling of the COVID-19 crisis) were measured as predictors of burnout. RESULTS: Females had higher levels of state anxiety and burnout compared to males. Females also reported a lower level of satisfaction with the militarys handling of the COVID-19 crisis than males. SOC and state anxiety were the only statistically significant predictors of burnout after controlling for sociodemographic variables. The entire model explained 59.4% of the burnout variance. CONCLUSION: In accordance with salutogenic theory, SOC is associated with active adaptation through use of generalized and specific resistance resources to avoid burnout in a stressful milieu. Psychological support, psychoeducation and simulation training are offered to increase manageability in crisis situations.

METHODS: In fall 2020, we conducted an online survey of all 103 OTPs licensed by the Pennsylvania Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs, including clinical directors. Survey domains included changes to methadone take-home and telehealth practices;overdose and diversion prevention tactics;perceptions regarding how such changes influence patient well-being;and financial/operational concerns related to the new policies and practices. We calculated descriptive statistics and conducted Chi-square test to test for differences between not-for-profit versus for-profit and large versus small OTPs. RESULTS: Forty-seven percent (46%) OTPs responded to the survey. 10% and 25%, respectively, endorsed offering telephone and video-based telemedicine buprenorphine induction. Sixty-six percent endorsed extending take-home supplies of methadone, but most indicated that these extensions applied to a minority of their patients. Most respondents agreed that provision of buprenorphine via telehealth and extended take-home methadone reduced patient burden in accessing medications and prevented exposure to COVID-19, while not significantly increasing risk of overdose. We did not find major differences in COVID-19 practice modifications by nonprofit status or size of OTP. CONCLUSIONS: In Pennsylvania, the COVID-19 pandemic led to rapid changes in provision of opioid treatment services. Findings on relatively low uptake of longer methadone take-home regimens and virtual buprenorphine initiation despite general support for these practices imply a need to further develop guidelines for best clinical practices and understand/address barriers to their implementation.","output":"Shifting Medication Treatment Practices in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Statewide Survey of Pennsylvania Opioid Treatment Programs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic poses a challenge to the management of non-COVID pathologies such as lymphatic diseases and lipoedema.

The fecal samples from the sambar deer, the waterbuck, and the white-tailed deer were collected during winter dysentery outbreaks and sporadic diarrhea cases in 1993 and 1994 (H. Tsunemitsu, Z. R. el-Kanawati, D. R. Smith, H. H. Reed, and L. J. Saif, J. Clin. Microbiol. 33:3264-3269, 1995). A fecal sample from a sable antelope was collected in 2003 from an Ohio wild-animal habitat during the same outbreak when a bovine-like CoV from a giraffe (GiCoV) was isolated (M. Hasoksuz, K.

High nucleotide identities (99.4 to 99.6%) among the wild-ruminant strains and recent BCoV strains (BCoV-LUN and BCoV-ENT, isolated in 1998) further confirm the close relatedness. Comparative genetic analysis of CoVs of captive wild ruminants with BCoV strains suggests that no specific genomic markers are present that allow discrimination between the bovine strains and bovine-like CoVs from captive wild ruminants; furthermore, no specific genetic markers were identified that defined cell cultured or calf-passaged strains or the host origin of strains.

Although the global response to the pandemic since 2020 certainly epitomized the sudden infatuation with states of emergency (SOE), they have a longer history of becoming a new model of government (Ferejohn & Pasquino, ICON, 2004) that has come to saturate our contemporary political horizon as every crisis (terrorism, pandemic, climate) seems to call for its own SOE. This paper critically analyzes the unprecedented permanence of SOEs in contemporary paradigms of government. It first situates the contemporary practice of SOEs in the longer historical and theoretical frame of states of exception, and argues that as these were largely challenged by the 20th century rise and rise of the rule of law paradigm and its corresponding ambition of taming the exception, they fail to provide with a relevant lens for analyzing contemporary SOEs. Through an in-depth study of recent French experiences of the SOE, it shows that rather than derogate to or suspend the legal order, contemporary SOEs are intensely juridical and indeed claim their full compatibility with rule of law standards. In that, they generate a dangerous trap: as they borrow the forms and language of the rule of law, contemporary SOEs threaten to subvert the models meaning and sense from the inside.","output":"Democracies Trapped by States of Emergency: Lessons from France (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIM: Recent studies have shown that inflammation plays a role in morphine analgesia and tolerance development. Anakinra is a competitive inhibitor of IL-1 receptors and an antiinflammatory protein regulating IL-1¡s biological activity by avoiding signal transduction. In this study, we aimed to examine the effects of anakinra on morphine analgesia and tolerance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 36 Wistar Albino (230C250 g) male rats were used. Animals were divided into 6 groups: saline (S), 100 mg/kg anakinra (A), 5mg/kg morphine (M), M+A, morphine tolerance (MT), and MT+A. The resulting analgesic effect was measured with hot plate and tail-flick analgesia tests. After the analgesia tests, the dorsal root ganglions (DRG) tissues were removed. Oxidative stress parameters [total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS)], endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and apoptosis proteins [E74-like factor 2 (elF-2), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF-4), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), caspase-3, and bcl-2-associated X protein (bax)] were measured in DRG tissues. RESULTS: Anakinra showed an antinociceptive effect when given alone (P < 0.001). In addition, anakinra increased the analgesic effect of morphine (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001), and also decreased the tolerance to morphine at a significant level (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001). Moreover, it decreased oxidative stress and ER-stress when given as a single-dose morphine and tolerance induction (P < 0.01 to P < 0.001). Furthermore, anakinra decreased apoptosis proteins after tolerance development (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Anakinra has antinociceptive properties, and it increases the analgesic effect of morphine and also prevents tolerance development. These effects probably occur by the modulation of oxidative stress and ER-stress pathways.","output":"Anakinra, an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, increases the morphine analgesic effect and decreases morphine tolerance development by modulating oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress in rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nitrification is a major challenge in chloraminated drinking water systems, resulting in undesirable loss of disinfectant residual. Consequently, heterotrophic bacteria growth is increased, which adversely affects the water quality, causing taste, odour, and health issues. Regular monitoring of various water quality parameters at susceptible areas of the water distribution system (WDS) helps to detect nitrification at an earlier stage and allows sufficient time to take corrective actions to control it. Strategies to monitor nitrification in a WDS require conducting various microbiological tests or assessing surrogate parameters that are affected by microbiological activities. Additionally, microbial decay factor (Fm) is used by water utilities to monitor the status of nitrification. In contrast, approaches to manage nitrification in a WDS include controlling various factors that affect monochloramine decay rate and ammonium substrate availability, and that can inhibit nitrification. However, some of these control strategies may increase the regulated disinfection-by-products level, which may be a potential health concern. In this paper, various strategies to monitor and control nitrification in a WDS are critically examined. The key findings are: (i) the applicability of some methods require further validation using real WDS, as the original studies were conducted on laboratory or pilot systems; (ii) there is no linkage/formula found to relate the surrogate parameters to the concentration of nitrifying bacteria, which possibly improve nitrification monitoring performance; (iii) improved methods/monitoring tools are required to detect nitrification at an earlier stage; (iv) further studies are required to understand the effect of soluble microbial products on the change of surrogate parameters. Based on the current review, we recommend that the successful outcome using many of these methods is often site-specific, hence, water utilities should decide based on their regular experiences when considering economic and sustainability aspects.","output":"Review of Nitrification Monitoring and Control Strategies in Drinking Water System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-protocolized fluid administration in critically ill patients, especially those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is associated with poor outcomes. Therefore, fluid administration in patients with Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) should be properly guided. Choice of an index to guide fluid management during a pandemic with mass patient admissions carries an additional challenge due to the relatively limited resources. An ideal test for assessment of fluid responsiveness during this pandemic should be accurate in ARDS patients, economic, easy to interpret by junior staff, valid in patients in the prone position and performed with minimal contact with the patient to avoid spread of infection. Patients with COVID-19 ARDS are divided into two phenotypes (L phenotype and H phenotype) according to their lung compliance. Selection of the proper index for fluid responsiveness varies according to the patient phenotype. Heart-lung interaction methods can be used only in patients with L phenotype ARDS. Real-time measures, such a pulse pressure variation, are more appropriate for use during this pandemic compared to ultrasound-derived measures, because contamination of the ultrasound machine can spread infection. Preload challenge tests are suitable for use in all COVID-19 patients. Passive leg raising test is relatively better than mini-fluid challenge test, because it can be repeated without overloading the patient with fluids. Trendelenburg maneuver is a suitable alternative to the passive leg raising test in patients with prone position. If a cardiac output monitor was not available, the response to the passive leg raising test could be traced by measurement of the pulse pressure or the perfusion index. Preload modifying maneuvers, such as tidal volume challenge, can also be used in COVID-19 patients, especially if the patient was in the gray zone of other dynamic tests. However, the preload modifying maneuvers were not extensively evaluated outside the operating room. Selection of the proper test would vary according to the level of healthcare in the country and the load of admissions which might be overwhelming.

Here, we performed a next-generation sequencing retrospective study from pre-ART era clinical trials in Nairobi, Kenya (between 2003C2006 before cART was standard of care) that tested the effects of ART regimens to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission. Kenyan women living with HIV were randomized to receive either no ART during breastfeeding (n = 24) or cART (zidovudine, nevirapine, lamivudine; n = 25) postpartum. Using linear mixed-effects models, we found that alpha diversity and beta diversity of the breast milk bacterial microbiome changed significantly over time during the first 4 weeks postpartum (alpha diversity P < 0.0007; beta diversity P = 0.005). There was no statistically significant difference in diversity, richness, and composition of the bacterial microbiome between cART-exposed and cART-unexposed women. In contrast, antibiotic use influenced the change of beta diversity of the bacterial microbiome over time. Our results indicate that while early postpartum time predicts breast milk microbiome composition, cART does not substantially alter the breast milk microbiota in women living with HIV. Hence, cART has minimal impact on the breast milk microbiome compared to antibiotics use. IMPORTANCE Breastfeeding has important benefits for long-term infant health, particularly in establishing and shaping the infant gut microbiome. However, the impact of combination antiretroviral therapy exposure and antibiotics on the breast milk microbiome in women living with HIV is not known. Here, in a longitudinal retrospective study of Kenyan women living with HIV from the pre-antiretroviral therapy era, we found that antibiotic use significantly influenced breast milk microbiome beta diversity, but antiretrovirals exposure did not substantially alter the microbiome. Given the protective role of breastfeeding in maternal-infant health, these findings fill an important knowledge gap of the impact of combination antiretroviral therapy on the microbiome of women living with HIV.","output":"Dynamic Changes in Breast Milk Microbiome in the Early Postpartum Period of Kenyan Women Living with HIV Are Influenced by Antibiotics but Not Antiretrovirals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lockdown measures taken to prevent a rapid spreading of the coronavirus in Europe in spring 2020 led to large emission reductions, particularly in road traffic and aviation. Atmospheric concentrations of NO2 and PM2.5 were mostly reduced when compared to observations taken for the same time period in previous years;however, concentration reductions may not only be caused by emission reductions but also by specific weather situations.In order to identify the role of emission reductions and the meteorological situation for air quality improvements in central Europe, the meteorology chemistry transport model system COSMO-CLM/CMAQ was applied to Europe for the period 1 January to 30 June 2020. Emission data for 2020 were extrapolated from most recent reported emission data, and lockdown adjustment factors were computed from reported activity data changes, e.g. Google mobility reports. Meteorological factors were investigated through additional simulations with meteorological data from previous years.The results showed that lockdown effects varied significantly among countries and were most prominent for NO2 concentrations in urban areas with 2-week-average reductions up to 55 % in the second half of March. Ozone concentrations were less strongly influenced (up to 15 %) and showed both increasing and decreasing concentrations due to lockdown measures. This depended strongly on the meteorological situation and on the NOx / VOC emission ratio. PM2.5 revealed 2 %C12 % reductions of 2-week-average concentrations in March and April, which is much less than a different weather situation could cause. Unusually low PM2.5 concentrations as observed in northern central Europe were only marginally caused by lockdown effects.The lockdown can be seen as a big experiment about air quality improvements that can be achieved through drastic traffic emission reductions. From this investigation, it can be concluded that NO2 concentrations can be largely reduced, but effects on annual average values are small when the measures last only a few weeks. Secondary pollutants like ozone and PM2.5 depend more strongly on weather conditions and show a limited response to emission changes in single sectors.","output":"The role of emission reductions and the meteorological situation for air quality improvements during the COVID-19 lockdown period in central Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To report a case of bilateral panuveitis and occlusive vasculitis following COVID-19 vaccination.

Epigenetic abnormalities are a new type of molecular marker, and DNA methylation is an important part of epigenetics. OBJECTIVE This study used weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to analyse key methylation-driven genes in breast cancer. METHODS The RNA-seq transcriptome data, DNA methylation data, and clinical information data of breast cancer patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and the MethylMix R package was used to screen methylation-driven genes in breast cancer. The ClusterProfiler package and enrichplot package in R software were used to further analyse the function and signalling pathway of methylation-driven genes. Through univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, methylation-driver genes related to prognostic were obtained, a prognostic model was constructed and prognostic characteristics were analysed. RESULTS The 17 methylation-driven genes related to prognosis were obtained by the WGCNA method in breast cancer, and the prognostic significance of these methylation-driven genes was determined by transcriptome and methylation combined survival analysis. Analysis of functions and signalling pathways showed that these genes were mainly enriched in biological processes and signalling pathway. Through univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, a prognostic model of 5 methylation-driven genes was constructed. CONCLUSIONS The AUC of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of this model was 0.784, showing that the model had a good prediction effect. Based on WGCNA screening, it was found that only CDO1 was the key methylation-driven gene for prognosis in breast cancer, indicating that CDO1 may be an important indicator of the prognosis of breast cancer patients.","output":"Screening of key methylation-driven genes CDO1 in breast cancer based on WGCNA."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Food supply and demand chains are highly sensitive to global shocks.

Cardiology OBJECTIVE: Unusual clinical course BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and mostly affects the respiratory system but can also affect other organs, including the cardiovascular system. Furthermore, the most common cardiac complications include severe left ventricular dysfunction, acute myocardial injury, and arrhythmias. Life-threatening cardiac tamponade and large pericardial effusion are exceedingly rare complications in patients recovered from COVID-19. Previously, this condition was treated with pericardiocentesis, colchicine, and corticosteroids. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 54-year-old man who recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection 7 days before presentation and describe a complicated pericardial effusion with life-threatening cardiac tamponade. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade that was successfully treated with single port or uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with an excellent outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Life-threatening cardiac tamponade with pericardial effusion is an exceedingly rare complication in patients recovered from COVID-19. Generally, patients diagnosed with pericardial effusion undergo a pericardiocentesis procedure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present systematic study, using AND and OR operators, we searched for the keywords benefits, simulation, and hospital emergency department in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar as well as Persian language databases such SID, Magiran, Irandoc, and Iran Medex. Then, a three-step screening process was used to select studies relevant to simulation and hospital emergency from 2005 to 2021 using the PRISMA checklist, and finally, the obtained data were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of three main groups, each with several subgroups, were extracted and identified as the benefits of using simulation in hospital emergency departments. They included improving the diagnosis of the disease (rapid prediction of the disease, rapid diagnosis, and patient triage), improving the treatment process (improvement of treatment results, anticipation of admission and discharge of patients, acceleration of interventions, and reduction of medical errors), and improving knowledge and skills (improvement of the speed of decision-making, staff's acquisition of knowledge and skills, simple, convenient, and low-cost training, improvement of staff's preparedness in crisis). CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the present study, it is suggested to develop some training programs in order to help staff upgrade their knowledge and performance as well as acquire practical skills and also to improve the diagnosis and treatment process in hospital emergency departments.

UV-C-based disinfection products for mobile phones, food packaging, face masks and personal protective equipment (PPE), and other everyday objects are available in popular electronic-commerce platforms as consumer products. Product designers from multinational to startup companies began to design UV-C disinfection products but had no prior-art reference, user feedback, or validation of product efficacy, which are important stages in product design. A UV-C disinfection product cannot be assessed by most consumers for its viricidal efficacy. Many firms entered the domain of UV-C products and were unaware of the necessary validation requirements. Lack of availability and access to virology laboratories, due to lockdowns in countries, and lack of standards and certification for UV-C disinfection products limited product designers and firms in benchmarking their UV-C-based devices before market release. This work evaluates two UV-C disinfection devices for viricidal efficacy on PPE fabric and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified N95 respirators through controlled experiments using the H1N1 virus, which is enveloped and is transmitted via the respiratory route similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19. The experiment also evaluated the effectiveness of chemical disinfectants along with and versus UV-C disinfection. Experiments for material selection, UV dose calculation, and UV endurance of PPE samples to be disinfected are also discussed.

This crisis is unlikely contained in the absence of effective therapeutics or vaccine. The papain-like protease (PLpro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) plays essential roles in virus replication and immune evasion, presenting a charming drug target. Given the PLpro proteases of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share significant homology, inhibitor developed for SARS-CoV PLpro is a promising starting point of therapeutic development. In this study, we sought to provide structural frameworks for PLpro inhibitor design. We determined the unliganded structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro mutant C111S, which shares many structural features of SARS-CoV PLpro. This crystal form has unique packing, high solvent content and reasonable resolution 2.5 ?, hence provides a good possibility for fragment-based screening using crystallographic approach. We characterized the protease activity of PLpro in cleaving synthetic peptide harboring nsp2/nsp3 juncture. We demonstrate that a potent SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitor GRL0617 is highly effective in inhibiting protease activity of SARS-CoV-2 with the IC(50) of 2.20.3 mol/L. We then determined the structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro complex by GRL0617 to 2.6 ?, showing the inhibitor accommodates the S3CS4 pockets of the substrate binding cleft. The binding of GRL0617 induces closure of the BL2 loop and narrows the substrate binding cleft, whereas the binding of a tetrapeptide substrate enlarges the cleft. Hence, our results suggest a mechanism of GRL0617 inhibition, that GRL0617 not only occupies the substrate pockets, but also seals the entrance to the substrate binding cleft hence prevents the binding of the LXGG motif of the substrate.","output":"Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evidence suggests that pregnant women who test positive for COVID-19 may develop more severe illness than non-pregnant women and may be at greater risk for psychological distress.

Potential risk factors were also assessed to apply preventive measures accordingly. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was employed among pneumonia suspected patients from February to April 2020 at Dessie Referral Hospital. Sociodemographic characteristics and associated risk factors were collected using a pretested questionnaire, and clinical data were extracted by reviewing medical records. Sputum specimens were collected and inoculated into chocolate agar, blood agar, mannitol salt agar, and MacConkey agar which are then incubated at 35C or 37C for 24C48 hours. Bacterial species were identified based on Gram stain, colony characteristics, and biochemical techniques. The data were entered in to Epi-Info version 7.1.5 and analyzed with SPSS software version 20. p value <0.05 at 95% CI was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 406 sputum specimens were collected and cultured, among which 157 (38.7%) were positive for different bacterial pathogens. The predominant pathogens were Klebsiella pneumoniae (28.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (24.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (18.5%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.0%). Majority of the isolates exhibited resistance to ampicillin with 81.5% followed by penicillin with 75.9% and amoxicillin-clavulanate with 61.2%. Multivariable logistic regression showed a significant association of culture positivity with older age (AOR = 2.43, CI: 1.12C5.28, p value = 0.025), cigarette smoking (AOR = 4.67, CI: 2.39C9.20, p value <0.001), and alcohol use (AOR = 5.58, CI: 3.14C9.92, p value <0.001).

To address this, marker-assisted intercross (IC) breeding involving multiple donors was used to combine three BB resistance genes-xa5, xa13 and Xa21, two blast resistance genes-Pi9 and Pi54, two BPH resistance genes-Bph20 and Bph21, and four drought tolerant quantitative trait loci (QTL)-qDTY1.1, qDTY2.1, qDTY3.1 and qDTY12.1-in the genetic background of the elite Indian rice cultivar 'Krishna Hamsa'. Three cycles of selective intercrossing followed by selfing coupled with foreground selection and phenotyping for the target traits resulted in the development of 196 introgression lines (ILs) with a myriad of gene/QTL combinations. Based on the phenotypic reaction, the ILs were classified into seven phenotypic classes of resistance/tolerance to the following: (1) BB, blast and drought-5 ILs; (2) BB and blast-10 ILs; (3) BB and drought-9 ILs; (4) blast and drought-42 ILs; (5) BB-3 ILs; (6) blast-84 ILs; and (7) drought-43 ILs; none of the ILs were resistant to BPH. Positive phenotypic response (resistance) was observed to both BB and blast in 2 ILs, BB in 9 ILs and blast in 64 ILs despite the absence of corresponding R genes. Inheritance of resistance to BB and/or blast in such ILs could be due to the unknown genes from other parents used in the breeding scheme. Negative phenotypic response (susceptibility) was observed in 67 ILs possessing BB-R genes, 9 ILs with blast-R genes and 9 ILs harboring QTLs for drought tolerance. Complex genic interactions and recombination events due to the involvement of multiple donors explain susceptibility in some of the marker positive ILs. The present investigation successfully demonstrates the possibility of rapid development of multiple stress-tolerant/resistant ILs in the elite cultivar background involving multiple donors through selective intercrossing and stringent phenotyping.

However, health promotion strategies often motivate the rejection of health messages, a phenomenon known as reactance. In this study, we examine whether the child narrator of a SAS video (perceived as nonthreatening, with low social authority) minimizes reactance to a health message about the consumption of added sugars. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether our SAS intervention video attenuates reactance to the sugar message when compared with a content placebo video (a health message about sunscreen) and a placebo video (a nonhealth message about earthquakes) and determine if the child narrator is more effective at reducing reactance to the sugar message when compared with the mother narrator (equivalent social authority to target audience) or family physician narrator (high social authority) of the same SAS video. METHODS: This is a web-based randomized controlled trial comparing an intervention video about sugar reduction narrated by a child, the childs mother, or the family physician with a content placebo video about sunscreen use and a placebo video about earthquakes. The primary end points are differences in the antecedents to reactance (proneness to reactance, threat level of the message), its components (anger and negative cognition), and outcomes (source appraisal and attitude). We performed analysis of variance on data collected (N=4013) from participants aged 18 to 59 years who speak English and reside in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Between December 9 and December 11, 2020, we recruited 38.62% (1550/4013) men, 60.85% (2442/4013) women, and 0.52% (21/4013) others for our study. We found a strong causal relationship between the persuasiveness of the content promoted by the videos and the components of reactance. Compared with the placebo (mean 1.56, SD 0.63) and content placebo (mean 1.76, SD 0.69) videos, the intervention videos (mean 1.99, SD 0.83) aroused higher levels of reactance to the message content (P<.001). We found no evidence that the child narrator (mean 1.99, SD 0.87) attenuated reactance to the sugar reduction message when compared with the physician (mean 1.95, SD 0.79; P=.77) and mother (mean 2.03, SD 0.83; P=.93). In addition, the physician was perceived as more qualified, reliable, and having more expertise than the child (P<.001) and mother (P<.001) narrators. CONCLUSIONS: Although children may be perceived as nonthreatening messengers, we found no evidence that a child narrator attenuated reactance to a SAS video about sugar consumption when compared with a physician. Furthermore, our intervention videos, with well-intended goals toward audience health awareness, aroused higher levels of reactance when compared with the placebo videos. Our results highlight the challenges in developing effective interventions to promote persuasive health messages.

The present study aimed to investigate the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 and its related risk factors in unvaccinated patients after TJA within one month post-discharge in two large cities of our country. METHODS: The present prospective study included all the patients admitted to three hospitals, located in two high-populated cities of our country from April 1st, 2020, to April 1st, 2021, for elective TJA. Urgent TJA (traumatic fractures) were excluded. The primary outcome was symptomatic COVID-19 within one-month after discharge that was diagnosed using the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test. Afterward, the incidence of the COVID-19 in the study population was compared with the general population to estimate the safety of elective TJA during the pandemic. RESULTS: From the 1007 patients undergoing TJA, 755 patients met the inclusion criteria. None of the patients was vaccinated against COVID-19. Among them, 18 patients (2.4%) developed symptomatic COVID-19 within one-month after discharge. In the same time interval, the incidence of COVID-19 was 2.2% in the general population of these two cities, which was similar to the incidence reported in the study population. Of the patients who were positive for COVID-19, four patients were hospitalized, and 3 of them were ICU-admitted; however, no mortality was reported.

Results: Although the PTSD networks of Hubei and non-Hubei undergraduates were similarly connected and shared some symptoms with high centrality (e.g. flashbacks, irritability and anger), there were differences across the networks. Distorted cognition and no positive emotion only exhibited high centrality in the Hubei network. Physiological responses and exaggerated startle only exhibited high centrality in the non-Hubei network.

However, we lack insights into local communities experiences in coping with the current COVID-19 pandemic. This study explored both the impact of, and response to, COVID-19 within the Orthodox Jewish communities of Antwerp (Belgium) during the first lockdown period (March 2020 C May 2020). Methods: : We conducted an explorative qualitative study using a participatory approach. First, we performed a community mapping to identify relevant stakeholders. Through the active involvement of a community advisory board and based on qualitative interviews with key-informants and community members, we elicited lived experiences, attitudes, and perceptions towards COVID-19. Interviews were conducted both face-to-face and using online web conferencing technology. Data were analyzed inductively according to the principles of thematic analysis. Results: : Government-issued outbreak control measures presented context-specific challenges to the Orthodox Jewish communities in Antwerp. They related mainly to the remote organization of religious life, and practicing physical distancing in socially and culturally strongly connected communities. Key informants described how existing community resources were rapidly mobilized to adapt to the outbreak and to self-organize response initiatives within communities. This included the active involvement of community and religious leaders in risk communication, which proved to be of great importance to facilitate coverage and uptake of pandemic control measures while protecting essential community values and traditions. Creating bottom-up and community-adapted communication strategies, including addressing language barriers and involving Rabbis in the dissemination of prevention messages, fostered a feeling of trust in governments response measures. However, unmet information and prevention needs were also identified, such as the need for inclusive communication by public authorities and the need to mitigate the negative effects of stigmatization. Conclusion: The experiences of Orthodox Jewish communities in Antwerp demonstrate a valuable example of a feasible community-centered approach to health emergencies.

Activation of nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate-protein kinase G signaling by sildenafil improves cardiac mal-remodeling during pressure-overload-induced heart failure. Transcriptome analysis was conducted in failing hearts with or without sildenafil treatment. Protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase (PERK) downstream signaling pathways, EIF2 and NRF2, were significantly altered. Although EIF2 signaling was suppressed, NRF2 signaling was upregulated, inhibiting the maturation of miR 24-3p through EGFR-mediated Ago2 phosphorylation. To study the effect of sildenafil on these pathways, we generated cardiac-specific PERK knockout mice. In these mice, sildenafil could not inhibit the maturations, the nuclear translocation of NRF2 was suppressed, and mitochondrial dysfunction advanced. Altogether, these results show that PERK-mediated suppression of miRNAs by sildenafil is vital for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis through NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response.","output":"PERK-Mediated Suppression of microRNAs by Sildenafil Improves Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Heart Failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article deals with the way in which, because of the pandemic caused by COVID-19, the National Library of Peru found ways to continue creating spaces, physical, virtual or remote, of access to information and culture The article understands this right as a fundamental right of people, which must not be diminished and which, on the contrary, must be promoted even in times of emergency or pandemic","output":"Public libraries in times of Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen El neumomediastino espontneo es la presencia de aire libre en el mediastino sin el antecedente de alguna causa como trauma de trax.

In addition, we showed that the obtained mAbs decreased infection rate of human cells by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles in in vitro experiments. Finally, we determined the amino acid sequence of light and heavy chains of the mAbs. This information will allow to use the corresponding peptides to establish genetically engineered therapeutic antibodies. To date multiple mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been established, however due to the restrictions caused by pandemic, it is imperative to have a local source of the antibodies suitable for researches and diagnostics of COVID-19.

However, effective treatments are limited, and although there is growing evidence that exercise may improve pain sensitisation, the amount and type of exercise remains unclear. This systematic review examines the evidence for an effect of aerobic exercise on pain sensitisation in musculoskeletal conditions. METHODS Systematic searches of six electronic databases were conducted. Studies were included if they examined the relationship between aerobic physical activity and pain sensitisation in individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain, but excluding specific patient subgroups such as fibromyalgia. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane methods and a qualitative analysis was conducted. RESULTS Eleven studies (seven repeated measures studies and four clinical trials) of 590 participants were included. Eight studies had low to moderate risk of bias. All 11 studies found that aerobic exercise increased pressure pain thresholds or decreased pain ratings in those with musculoskeletal pain [median (minimum, maximum) improvement in pain sensitisation: 10.6% (2.2%, 24.1%)]. In these studies, the aerobic exercise involved walking or cycling, performed at a submaximal intensity but with incremental increases, for a 4-60 min duration. Improvement in pain sensitisation occurred after one session in the observational studies and after 2-12 weeks in the clinical trials.

METHODS: Retrospective data collection of incidents and complaints reported through Datix&lt;sup&gt; R&lt;/sup&gt;, and the Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS), respectively. The setting was the Family Health division in a University teaching hospital in the UK. Primary and secondary outcome measures included: the proportion of incidents reported on Datix&lt;sup&gt; R&lt;/sup&gt; from 23 March 2020 to 29 May 2020, compared to the period from 23 March 2019 to 29 May 2019. COVID-19 related incidents and complaints and association with newly published guidelines or pathways from 23 March 2020 to 29 May 2020 were investigated. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the proportion of overall patient activity resulting in incidents reported on Datix in 2020 (2.08%) compared to 2019 (2.09%), with 98% resulting in no/low harm in 2020. Three incident categories had increases in relative proportions of incidents including the terms \\"COVID\\" or \\"Corona\\" compared to incidents that did not: \\"Child death\\", \\"delay/failure to treatment and procedure\\" and \\"information governance\\". One of the child deaths was a miscarriage and we were unable to link the second child death to a change in clinical policy at this stage. We were only able to link two COVID-19 associated incidents with a pathway or procedural change (one to the Children's Emergency Department admission pathway and the second to the introduction of virtual antenatal clinics). Eighteen complaints related to COVID-19 were logged. However, at this stage, we are unable to link any of these to a published change in clinical policy. CONCLUSIONS: New policies introduced in the division, during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with similar rates of clinical incidents, when compared with the previous year. There were only two COVID-19-related incidents clearly related to a change in pathways and procedures. Continued surveillance and improved metrics for monitoring the impact of changes to pathways and procedures should be sought with the sustained presence of COVID-19 in clinical areas.","output":"Impact of New Clinical Policies during the COVID-19 Pandemic on Clinical Incidents and Complaints at a UK Teaching Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Flavins are ubiquitous molecules in life as they serve as important enzyme cofactors. In the Gram-positive, soil-dwelling bacterium Bacillus subtilis, four well-characterized gene products (the enzymes RibDG, RibE, RibAB, and RibH) catalyze the biosynthesis of riboflavin (RF) from guanosine-triphosphate (GTP) and ribulose-5-phosphate (R5P). The corresponding genes form an operon together with the gene ribT (ribDG-E-AB-H-T), wherein the function of this terminal gene remained enigmatic. RibT has been structurally characterized as a GCN5-like acetyltransferase (GNAT), however, with unidentified target molecules. Bacterial two-hybrid system revealed interactions between RibT, RibH, and RibE, forming the heavy RF synthase complex. Applying single particle tracking (SPT), we found that confined (sub)diffusion of RibT is largely dependent on interacting RibE and, to a lesser degree, on interacting RibH. By induced expression of otherwise low-expressed ribT from an ectopic locus, we observed a decrease in the subpopulation considered to represent capsids of the heavy RF synthase and an increase in the subpopulation thought to represent pentamers of RibH, pointing to a putative role for RibT in capsid disassembly. Complementarily, either deletion of ribT or mutation of a key residue from RibH (K29) suspected to be the substrate of RibT for acetylation leads to increased levels of subpopulations considered as capsids of RibH-mVenus (RibH-mV) in comparison to wild-type (wt)-like cells. Thus, we provide evidence for an indirect involvement of RibT in RF biosynthesis by a putative capsid disassembling mechanism considered to involve acetylation of RibH residue K29 at the three-fold symmetry axis of 60-mer capsids.","output":"The Acetyltransferase RibT From Bacillus subtilis Affects in vivo Dynamics of the Multimeric Heavy Riboflavin Synthase Complex"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has highlighted the dynamic relationship between pandemic threats and global food systems Despite important connections, research and policy-making on food systems and pandemics largely operate in silos We propose a framework that integrates food systems and pandemic planning and response, exploring the role of the food system in shaping pandemics and, consequently, the role of pandemics in disrupting a now global food system This framework highlights important connections between food production, distribution, and consumption at each stage of the pandemic cycle: prevention, response, and recovery We use recent experiences with COVID-19 to illustrate vulnerabilities in systems interaction during the prevention and response phases Over the long term, in the recovery phase, food systems must transform, adopting an enhanced level of functioning to improve resilience To reduce population health risks and promote sustainable food systems, we call for implementation of surveillance systems for both emerging infections and food systems functioning in order to strengthen global food supply chains, create stakeholder resource coordination mechanisms, and address underlying socioeconomic vulnerabilities Multidisciplinary global actors should draw on lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent the inevitable next one","output":"A global food systems framework for pandemic prevention, response, and recovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This communication describes a recursive mathematical model of the spreading COVID-19 infection, which allows estimating the effectiveness of quarantine measures.

This severe acute respiratory syndrome is currently a global health emergency and needs much effort to generate an urgent practical treatment to reduce COVID-19 complications and mortality in humans. Viral infection activates various cellular responses in infected cells, including cellular stress responses such as unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, following the inhibition of mTOR. Both UPR and autophagy mechanisms are involved in cellular and tissue homeostasis, apoptosis, innate immunity modulation, and clearance of pathogens such as viral particles. However, during an evolutionary arms race, viruses gain the ability to subvert autophagy and UPR for their benefit. SARS-CoV-2 can enter host cells through binding to cell surface receptors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and neuropilin-1 (NRP1). ACE2 blockage increases autophagy through mTOR inhibition, leading to gastrointestinal complications during SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. NRP1 is also regulated by the mTOR pathway. An increased NRP1 can enhance the susceptibility of immune system dendritic cells (DCs) to SARS-CoV-2 and induce cytokine storm, which is related to high COVID-19 mortality. Therefore, signaling pathways such as mTOR, UPR, and autophagy may be potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19. Hence, extensive investigations are required to confirm these potentials. Since there is currently no specific treatment for COVID-19 infection, we sought to review and discuss the important roles of autophagy, UPR, and mTOR mechanisms in the regulation of cellular responses to coronavirus infection to help identify new antiviral modalities against SARS-CoV-2 virus.","output":"Autophagy, Unfolded Protein Response, and Neuropilin-1 Cross-Talk in SARS-CoV-2 Infection: What Can Be Learned from Other Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 epidemic is influencing global population.

Widely reported U.S. excess death estimates have not accounted for recent population changes, especially increases in the population older than 65 years. OBJECTIVE: To estimate excess deaths in the United States in 2020, after accounting for population changes. DESIGN: Surveillance study. SETTING: United States, March to August 2020. PARTICIPANTS: All decedents. MEASUREMENTS: Age-specific excess deaths in the United States from 1 March to 31 August 2020 compared with 2015 to 2019 were estimated, after changes in population size and age were taken into account, by using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provisional death data and U.S. Census Bureau population estimates. Cause-specific excess deaths were estimated by month and age. RESULTS: From March through August 2020, 1 671 400 deaths were registered in the United States, including 173 300 COVID-19 deaths. An average of 1 370 000 deaths were reported over the same months during 2015 to 2019, for a crude excess of 301 400 deaths (128 100 non-COVID-19 deaths). However, the 2020 U.S. population includes 5.04 million more persons aged 65 years and older than the average population in 2015 to 2019 (a 10% increase). After population changes were taken into account, an estimated 217 900 excess deaths occurred from March through August 2020 (173 300 COVID-19 and 44 600 non-COVID-19 deaths). Most excess non-COVID-19 deaths occurred in April, July, and August, and 34 900 (78%) were in persons aged 25 to 64 years. Diabetes, Alzheimer disease, and heart disease caused the most non-COVID-19 excess deaths. LIMITATION: Provisional death data are underestimated because of reporting delays. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an estimated 218 000 excess deaths in the United States between March and August 2020, and 80% of those deaths had COVID-19 as the underlying cause. Accounting for population changes substantially reduced the excess non-COVID-19 death estimates, providing important information for guiding future clinical and public health interventions.

Supporting this view, several studies have shown that oral care can improve health outcomes for hospitalized older adults. However, despite oral care being an essential nursing intervention that restores oral function and promotes patient wellness, it is one of the most neglected nursing interventions.

PQR is sweet, slightly bitter and cool in nature, and enter the heart, lung and kidney meridian exerts the remedial and hygienical effect. At present, active components such as saponins, flavonoids, fatty acids, polyalkynes, volatile oils and other nutrients such as amino acids, carbohydrates, vitamins and trace elements have been isolated from PQR. Modern pharmacological studies have shown that PQR has the effects of hypoglycemic, antihypertensive, anti fatigue, anti-oxidation, anti-tumor, immunomodulatory, neuroprotective and so on. In addition, PQR is recognized as a health care product to strengthen the body and dispel diseases. It is not only the raw material of Traditional Chinese medicine preparations, but also the treasure of dietary therapy and herbal cuisine. This study not only reviewed the botany, phytochemistry and pharmacology of PQR, but also summarized its quality control, toxicity and industrial applications for the first time. This paper not only summarizes the development status of PQR, but also analyzes the shortcomings of the current research on PQR, and puts forward the corresponding solutions, in order to provide reference for future scholars to study PQR.","output":"Panacis Quinquefolii Radix: A Review of the Botany, Phytochemistry, Quality Control, Pharmacology, Toxicology and Industrial Applications Research Progress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on epidemiological and animal studies, the rationale for using polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) as a treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) seems promising. Here, the objective was to systematically identify and critically assess the evidence from clinical trials. The primary outcome was ADHD core symptoms. The secondary outcomes were behavioral difficulties, quality of life, and side effects. We performed a systematic search in Medline, Embase, Cinahl, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane Library up to June 2020. The overall certainty of evidence was evaluated using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). We identified 31 relevant randomized controlled trials including 1755 patients. The results showed no effect on ADHD core symptoms rated by parents (k = 23; SMD: -0.17; 95% CI: -0.32, -0.02) or teachers (k = 10; SMD: -0.06; 95% CI: -0.31, 0.19).

This study examined the feasibility, acceptability, adherence, and preliminary efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention for OACs and their caregivers. METHOD Patients with active cancer age 65 years and older and their caregivers were randomized to Managing Anxiety from Cancer (MAC), a seven-session CBT-based psychotherapy intervention delivered over the telephone or usual care. Patients and caregivers completed the intervention separately with licensed social workers. Self-report measures of anxiety, depression, and quality of life were administered after randomization and following intervention completion. Analyses were conducted separately for patients and caregivers and at the dyad level. Hierarchical Linear Modeling accounted for the within-dyad intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) by random intercepts associated with the dyads. RESULTS Twenty-nine dyads were randomized; 28 (96.6%) patients and 26 (89.7%) caregivers completed all study procedures. Of dyads randomized to MAC, 85.7% (n = 12) of patients and caregivers completed all seven sessions. Most patients (50%) and over 80% of caregivers rated the overall intervention and intervention components as \\"moderately\\" to \\"very\\" helpful. MAC was associated with a greater reduction in anxiety among dyads than usual care, the effect of MAC was greater in caregivers than in patients, and improvement in patient anxiety was associated with the reduction in caregiver anxiety. However, these results did not reach statistical significance. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of MAC and suggests strategies for improving acceptability, with a focus on adherence. Furthermore, these results indicate that MAC is promising for the reduction of anxiety in OAC-caregiver dyads and may be particularly beneficial for OAC caregivers.

One way to assess the relationship between signals from different brain regions is to measure their phase synchronization (PS) across time. There are several ways to perform such analyses, and here we compare methods that utilize a PS metric together with a sliding window, referred to here as windowed phase synchronization (WPS), with those that directly measure the instantaneous phase synchronization (IPS). In particular, IPS has recently gained popularity as it offers single time-point resolution of time-resolved fMRI connectivity. In this paper, we discuss the underlying assumptions required for performing PS analyses and emphasize the necessity of band-pass filtering the data to obtain valid results. We review various methods for evaluating PS and introduce a new approach within the IPS framework denoted the cosine of the relative phase (CRP). We contrast methods through a series of simulations and application to rs-fMRI data. Our results indicate that CRP outperforms other tested methods and overcomes issues related to undetected temporal transitions from positive to negative associations common in IPS analysis. Further, in contrast to phase coherence, CRP unfolds the distribution of PS measures, which benefits subsequent clustering of PS matrices into recurring brain states.","output":"Evaluating phase synchronization methods in fMRI: a comparison study and new approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The physicalCchemical properties of the surface of DNA microarrays and biosensors play a fundamental role in their performance, affecting the signals amplitude and the strength and kinetics of binding. We studied how the interaction parameters vary for hybridization of complementary 23-mer DNA, when the probe strands are immobilized on different copolymers, which coat the surface of an optical, label-free biosensor. Copolymers of N, N-dimethylacrylamide bringing either a different type or density of sites for covalent immobilization of DNA probes, or different backbone charges, were used to functionalize the surface of a Reflective Phantom Interface multispot biosensor made of a glass prism with a silicon dioxide antireflective layer. By analyzing the kinetic hybridization curves at different probe surface densities and target concentrations in solution, we found that all the tested coatings displayed a common association kinetics of about 9  10(4) M(?1)s(?1) at small probe density, decreasing by one order of magnitude close to the surface saturation of probes. In contrast, both the yield of hybridization and the dissociation kinetics, and hence the equilibrium constant, depend on the type of copolymer coating. Nearly doubled signal amplitudes, although equilibrium dissociation constant was as large as 4 nM, were obtained by immobilizing the probe via click chemistry, whereas amine-based immobilization combined with passivation with diamine carrying positive charges granted much slower dissociation kinetics, yielding an equilibrium dissociation constant as low as 0.5 nM.

To address the disadvantages of OLV with respect to difficulties in intubation and induction, as well as the risk of respiratory complications, two-lung ventilation (TLV) with artificial pneumothorax has been introduced for use in VATS-e. However, no studies have yet compared TLV and OLV with postoperative infection and inflammation in the prone position over time postoperatively. Here, we investigated the efficacy of TLV in patients undergoing VATS-e in the prone position. METHODS Between April 2010 and December 2016, 119 patients underwent VATS-e under OLV or TLV with carbon dioxide insufflation. Clinical characteristics, surgical outcomes, and postoperative outcomes, including oxygenation and systemic inflammatory responses, were compared between patients who underwent OLV and those who underwent TLV. RESULTS Clinical characteristics other than pT stage were comparable between groups. The TLV group had shorter thoracic operation time than the OLV group. No patients underwent conversion to open thoracotomy. The PaO2/FiO2 ratios of the TLV group on postoperative day (POD) 5 and on POD7 were significantly higher than those of the OLV group. C-reactive protein levels on POD7 were lower in the TLV group than in the OLV group. There were no significant differences with respect to postoperative complications between the OLV and TLV groups. In the TLV group, the white blood cell count on POD7 was significantly lower than that in the OLV group; body temperature showed a similar trend immediately after surgery and on POD1. CONCLUSIONS In this study, we demonstrated that, compared with OLV, TLV in the prone position provides better oxygenation and reduced inflammation in the postoperative course. Accordingly, TLV might be more useful than OLV for ventilation during esophageal cancer surgery.","output":"Efficacy of artificial pneumothorax under two-lung ventilation in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for esophageal cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An interview with scientist Taukondjo Sem Shikongo is presented.

In India, the outbreak, starts on 2 nd March, 2020 and after that the cases are increasing exponentially. Very high population density, the unavailability of specific medicines or vaccines, insufficient evidences regarding the transmission mechanism of the disease also make it more difficult to fight against the disease properly in India. Mathematical models have been used to predict the disease dynamics and also to assess the efficiency of the intervention strategies in reducing the disease burden. In this work, we propose a mathematical model to describe the disease transmission mechanism between the individuals. Our proposed model is fitted to the daily new reported cases in India during the period 2 nd March, 2020 to 12 th November, 2020. We estimate the basic reproduction number, effective reproduction number and epidemic doubling time from the incidence data for the above-mentioned period.

METHODS NIR fluorescence imaging for the robotic platform was obtained at our institution in 12/2011. We identified all cases planned for SLN mapping using fluorescence imaging from 12/2011-4/2013. Intracervical ICG was the fluorophobe in all cases. Four cc (1.25mg/mL) of ICG was injected into the cervix alone divided into the 3- and 9-o'clock positions, with 1 cc deep into the stroma and 1 cc submucosally before initiating laparoscopic entry. Blue dye was concurrently injected in some cases. RESULTS Two hundred twenty-seven cases were performed. Median age was 60 years (range, 28-90 years). Median BMI was 30.2 kg/m(2) (range, 18-60 kg/m(2)). The median SLN count was 3 (range, 1-23). An SLN was identified in 216 cases (95%), with bilateral pelvic mapping in 179 (79%). An aortic SLN was identified in 21 (10%) of the 216 mapped cases. When ICG alone was used to map cases, 188/197 patients mapped, for a 95% detection rate compared to 93% (28/30) in cases in which both dyes were used (P=NS). Bilateral mapping was seen in 156/197 (79%) ICG-only cases and 23/30 (77%) ICG and blue dye cases (P=NS). CONCLUSIONS NIR fluorescence imaging with intracervical ICG injection using the robotic platform has a high bilateral SLN detection rate and appears favorable to using blue dye alone and/or other modalities.

However, the data sets were harvested early, as many countries began implementing ERT in response to the pandemic in March 2020. Many recent studies have failed to distinguish between the challenges faced by students enrolled in the laboratory and non-laboratory courses. There is still a dearth of literature on the difficulties encountered by students enrolled in non-laboratory courses following the first year of ERT implementation. The purpose of this paper was to examine the various challenges faced by tertiary students enrolled in non-laboratory courses following the conclusion of the first year of ERT implementation. Contextualized in two state-owned higher education institutions in northern Luzon, this study employed a fundamental qualitative approach, with focus group discussions (FGDs) serving as the primary data collection technique. Five major themes emerged from the FGDs with 42 purposively selected tertiary students. These themes presented in the spider web illustration include (1) student-focused challenges, (2) instructional material-related challenges, (3) instructor-emanating challenges, (4) technology-related challenges, and (5) student support-related challenges. This article concludes that these issues must be dealt with immediately to facilitate the implementation of ERT in non-laboratory courses. These difficulties may also be dimensions of concerns about distance education, particularly in non-urban areas of the Philippines. The themes also provide some actual pictures of the student challenges in the initial year of ERT in college.

We aimed to describe it using the BioFire(?) FilmArray(?) Pneumonia plus (PNplus) Panel. METHODS: In a sub-study of the PROGRESS trial, sputum samples of 90 patients with sepsis and LRTI were retrospectively studied. The primary endpoint was the comparative detection rate of pathogens between conventional microbiology and PNplus Panel; secondary endpoints were microbiology and the association with the inflammatory host response. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients with community-acquired pneumonia without risk factors for multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens and another 34 patients with risk factors for MDR were studied; median pneumonia severity index (PSI) was 113 (88C135). PNplus detection rate was 72.2% compared to 10% by conventional microbiology (p < 0.001); Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen. PSI and procalcitonin were greater among patients with bacterial pathogens than viral pathogens. Median procalcitonin was 0.49 ng/ml and 0.18 ng/ml among patients with  10(5) and < 10(5) copies/ml of detected bacteria, respectively (p = 0.004). Resistance reached 14.4%.

Results: We find that the growth rate of cases and deaths is significantly lower during the policy period when the percentage of the population that stays at home is highest. The crucial question is whether the policy has a causal impact on the sheltering percentages. The fact that some counties in Texas adopted local restrictive policies well before the state-wide policy helps us address this question. We do not find evidence that this top-down restrictive policy increased the percentage of the population that exercised social distancing.

Results: In total, 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (6930 patients) and 16 observational studies (183,546 patients) were included. Analysis of RCTs showed that there were no significant differences in the incidences of MACEs (risk ratio [RR] = 0.89 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.75C1.05]), MI (RR = 0.93 [95% CI = 0.76C1.15]), and all-cause mortality (RR = 0.79 [95% CI = 0.50C1.23]) in the PPI groups vs. the non-PPI groups. Pooled data from observational studies revealed an inconsistent association between the use of each PPI subtype and the increased risks of MACEs during clopidogrel treatment. There was no increased risk of MACEs or all-cause mortality associated with the use of PPIs (as a class) and other P2Y(12) inhibitors. Both the RCTs and observational studies revealed that the use of PPIs significantly reduced the risks of GI bleeding.

Multilevel spline growth models estimated changes in three segments: (a) from pre-pandemic to April/May 2020, (b) from April/May 2020 to September 2020, and (c) from September 2020 to August 2021. Depression symptoms and loneliness increased significantly in the first segment, plateaued slightly, then decreased significantly across the final segment. Anxiety symptoms were unchanged across the first two segments, but significantly decreased in the final segment. Satisfaction with life decreased significantly across the first two segments, and then increased significantly in the final segment. Direct comparisons of pre-pandemic scores (January 2020) to the last follow-up (July or August 2021) showed a return to pre-pandemic levels of depression symptoms, loneliness, and satisfaction with life, as indicated by non-significant differences, and significantly lower anxiety symptoms, relative to pre-pandemic. Findings support concerns for young adults mental health and well-being in the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also indicate that young adults emotional well-being, on average, may be returning to pre-pandemic levels.

Type 1 interferon (IFN-I) production and signaling has been reported to be causal in cytokine storm-associated pathology in several respiratory viral infections, however, the mechanisms by which IFN-I promotes disease pathogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, using Usp18-deficient, USP18 enzymatic-inactive and Isg15-deficient mouse models, we report that lack of deISGylation during persistent viral infection leads to severe immune pathology characterized by hematological disruptions, cytokine amplification, lung vascular leakage and death. This pathology requires T cells but not T cell-intrinsic deletion of Usp18. However, lack of Usp18 in myeloid cells mimicked the pathological manifestations observed in Usp18-/- or Usp18C61A mice which were dependent on Isg15. We further mechanistically demonstrate that interrupting the ISGylation/deISGylation circuit increases extracellular levels of ISG15 which is accompanied by inflammatory neutrophil accumulation to the lung. Importantly, neutrophil depletion reversed morbidity and mortality in Usp18C61A mice. In summary, we reveal that the enzymatic function of Usp18 is crucial for regulating extracellular release of ISG15. This is accompanied by altered neutrophil differentiation, cytokine amplification and mortality following persistent viral infection. Moreover, our results suggest that extracellular ISG15 may drive the inflammatory pathology observed and could be both a prospective predictor of disease outcome and a therapeutic target during severe respiratory viral infections.","output":"ISG15 drives immune pathology and respiratory failure during viral infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility and safety of ultrasound-guided minimally invasive autopsy in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: 60 patients who expired between 04/22/2020C05/06/2020 due to COVID-19 were considered for inclusion in the study, based on availability of study staff. Minimally invasive ultrasound-guided autopsy was performed with 14G core biopsies through a 13G coaxial needle. The protocol required 20 cores of the liver, 30 of lung, 12 of spleen, 20 of heart, 20 of kidney, 4 of breast, 4 of testis, 2 of skeletal muscle, and 4 of fat with total of 112 cores per patient. Quality of the samples was evaluated by number, size, histology, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization for COVID-19 and PCR-measured viral loads for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Five (5/60, 8%) patients were included. All approached families gave their consent for the minimally invasive autopsy. All organs for biopsy were successfully targeted with ultrasound guidance obtaining all required samples, apart from 2 patients where renal samples were not obtained due to atrophic kidneys. The number, size, and weight of the tissue cores met expectation of the research group and tissue histology quality was excellent. Pathology findings were concordant with previously reported autopsy findings for COVID-19. Highest SARS-CoV-2 viral load was detected in the lung, liver, and spleen that had small to moderate amount, and low viral load in was detected in the heart in 2/5 (40%). No virus was detected in the kidney (0/3, 0%). CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-guided percutaneous post-mortem core biopsies can safely provide adequate tissue.

PCT levels were sequentially assessed at the time of inclusion, 6 h after and at day 1, using a sensitive immunoassay. The patients were classified according to the presence of a documented bacterial infection (including bacterial and viral coinfection) (BAC + group), or the absence of a documented bacterial infection (i.e., a documented viral infection alone or absence of a documented pathogen) (BAC- group). The accuracy of PCT levels in predicting bacterial infection (BAC + group) vs no bacterial infection (BAC- group) at different time points was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Regarding the entire cohort (n = 375), at any time, the PCT levels significantly differed between groups (KruskalCWallis test, p < 0.001). A pairwise comparison showed that PCT levels were significantly higher in patients with bacterial infection (n = 94) than in patients without documented pathogens (n = 218) (p < 0.001). No significant difference was observed between patients with bacterial and viral infection (n = 63). For example, the median PCT-H(0) levels were 0.64 ng/ml [0.22C0.87] in the bacterial group vs 0.24 ng/ml [0.15C0.37] in the viral group and 0.16 ng/mL [0.11C0.22] in the group without documented pathogens.

Uganda is an ideal study site, because both malaria and KSHV are endemic and widespread, even among young children. METHODS ENDKU is a longitudinal cohort study of infants enrolled at six months of age and followed until three years of age. The main study, and one smaller sub-study, is nested within the General Population Cohort (GPC), a long-standing population cohort in rural Uganda. The ENDKU study was created to test the hypothesis that P. falciparum malaria increases an infant's susceptibility to KSHV infection. A sub-study to evaluate the effects of P. falciparum on KSHV reactivation involves an additional cohort of 5-10-year-old children with and without acute malaria who presented to the GPC study clinic. For each study, participants provided demographic and behavioral data through administered questionnaires and blood and saliva samples. RESULTS Despite barriers presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the study team was able to leverage the long-standing relationship of the UK Medical Research Council and the Uganda Virus Research Institute (MRC/UVRI) with the community, a strong commitment to research, and a multi-disciplinary team of experts to successfully implement the ENDKU study. CONCLUSION The results of this multi-pronged approach will answer important questions about the etiology and transmission of KSHV in sub-Saharan Africa and the data and samples collected will be an important future resource for scientific research in the region.","output":"Environmental determinants of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) transmission in rural Uganda (ENDKU study): Contributions to research on KSHV infection and reactivation in African children; A longitudinal cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a few coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases were first reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China. Soon after, increasing numbers of cases were detected in other parts of China, eventually leading to a disease outbreak in China. As this dreadful disease spreads rapidly, the mass media has been active in community education on COVID-19 by delivering health information about this novel coronavirus, such as its pathogenesis, spread, prevention, and containment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to collect media reports on COVID-19 and investigate the patterns of media-directed health communications as well as the role of the media in this ongoing COVID-19 crisis in China. METHODS: We adopted the WiseSearch database to extract related news articles about the coronavirus from major press media between January 1, 2020, and February 20, 2020. We then sorted and analyzed the data using Python software and Python package Jieba. We sought a suitable topic number with evidence of the coherence number. We operated latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling with a suitable topic number and generated corresponding keywords and topic names. We then divided these topics into different themes by plotting them into a 2D plane via multidimensional scaling. RESULTS: After removing duplications and irrelevant reports, our search identified 7791 relevant news reports. We listed the number of articles published per day. According to the coherence value, we chose 20 as the number of topics and generated the topics' themes and keywords. These topics were categorized into nine main primary themes based on the topic visualization figure. The top three most popular themes were prevention and control procedures, medical treatment and research, and global or local social and economic influences, accounting for 32.57% (n=2538), 16.08% (n=1258), and 11.79% (n=919) of the collected reports, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Topic modeling of news articles can produce useful information about the significance of mass media for early health communication. Comparing the number of articles for each day and the outbreak development, we noted that mass media news reports in China lagged behind the development of COVID-19. The major themes accounted for around half the content and tended to focus on the larger society rather than on individuals. The COVID-19 crisis has become a worldwide issue, and society has become concerned about donations and support as well as mental health among others. We recommend that future work addresses the mass media's actual impact on readers during the COVID-19 crisis through sentiment analysis of news data.","output":"Health Communication Through News Media During the Early Stage of the COVID-19 Outbreak in China: Digital Topic Modeling Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To analyse the rate of occurrence and the clinical variables associated with readmission of patients who had previously been discharged after admission for COVID-19.

Yet, opportunities to perform both functions concurrently for the same population are scarce. Residents must also master the art of preventive medicine, but they often lack an established community of practice that provides a continuous forum to do so. This project explored Population Health Rounds as a novel vehicle to optimize preventive medicine residency training. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Modeled after traditional medical rounds, Population Health Rounds consist of a 1-hour weekly meeting engaging preventive medicine residents and supervising attendings at Stony Brook Medicine in both population medicine and clinical preventive medicine concurrently, including patient case discussions and targeted population health analytics. EVALUATION AND RESULTS: Because of the pandemic, the rounds have predominantly focused on COVID-19 and its effects on the hospital employee population. In addition to providing direct patient care to COVID-19-positive and exposed employees, residents have analyzed data on this population and made recommendations to hospital leadership based on COVID-19's institutional epidemiology, including incidence, prevalence, and predictive factors. A formative qualitative survey of resident perceptions offers insights on the value and learning outcomes of this new model. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Factors that may impact the implementation, sustainability, and feasibility of this model are discussed. The preventive medicine residency program is commissioned to address gaps in clinical preventive services for the patient-centered medical home tied to the sponsoring institution's family medicine practice.

However, approximately 5% of them were critically ill and require intensive care unit admission for advanced life supports. Patients in the intensive care unit were high risk for venous thromboembolism and hemorrhage due to the immobility and anticoagulants used during advanced life supports. The aim of the study was to report the incidence and treatments of the two complications in such patients. METHOD: Patients with COVID-19 (Group 1) and patients with community-acquired pneumonia (Group 2) that required intensive care unit admission were enrolled in this retrospective study. Their demographics, laboratory results, ultrasound findings and complications such as venous thromboembolism and hemorrhage were collected and compared. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with COVID-19 and 51 patients with community-acquired pneumonia were included. The mean ages were 66 and 63 years in Groups 1 and 2, respectively. Venous thromboembolism was detected in 6 (18%) patients with COVID-19 and 18 (35%) patients with community-acquired pneumonia (P = 0.09). The major type was distal deep venous thrombosis.

Understanding HCPs risk for burnout is critical to supporting HCPs and maintaining the quality of healthcare during the pandemic. METHODS: To assess exposure, perceptions, workload, and possible burnout of HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic we conducted a cross-sectional survey. The main outcomes and measures were HCPs self-assessment of burnout, indicated by a single item measure of emotional exhaustion, and other experiences and attitudes associated with working during the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: A total of 2,707 HCPs from 60 countries participated in this study. Fifty-one percent of HCPs reported burnout. Burnout was associated with work impacting household activities (RR = 157, 95% CI = 139C178, P<0001), feeling pushed beyond training (RR = 132, 95% CI = 120C147, P<0001), exposure to COVID-19 patients (RR = 118, 95% CI = 105C132, P = 0005), and making life prioritizing decisions (RR = 116, 95% CI = 102C131, P = 003).

INTERPRETATION: Burnout is present at higher than previously reported rates among HCPs working during the COVID-19 pandemic and is related to high workload, job stress, and time pressure, and limited organizational support. Current and future burnout among HCPs could be mitigated by actions from healthcare institutions and other governmental and non-governmental stakeholders aimed at potentially modifiable factors, including providing additional training, organizational support, and support for family, PPE, and mental health resources.","output":"Factors contributing to healthcare professional burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic: A rapid turnaround global survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT The present study was aimed to test the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility using disc diffusion assay and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, as well as the production of beta-lactamase of 42 strains of Staphylococcus sp. isolated from subclinical mastitis in goats in the semi-arid region of Paraiba state, in Brazil. To this end, 14 samples of negative Staphylococcus chromogenes, 10 S. waneri, 6 S. saprophyticus, 5 S. aureus, 3 S. epidermidis, 2 S. intermedius and 2 Staphylococcus were used. Regarding the in vitro susceptibility, the highest levels of resistance observed concerned penicillin (66.67%) and ampicillin (63.89%), and the greatest sensitivity observed concerned Cefoxitin (97.22%). Multiple resistance to 3 or more antimicrobial drugs was observed in 42.86% of the isolates. Of the total Staphylococcus isolated, 73.81% were positive for the beta-lactamase production test. The minimum inhibitory concentration showed 100% of the samples susceptible to norfloxacin, and the maximum resistance values to the other antimicrobial drugs were 30%. According to the results obtained, it is concluded that, in order to select the most appropriate drug to treat mastitis in goats caused by strains of Staphylococcus, the antimicrobial sensitivity profile of the strain must be known and routine laboratory tests for detecting beta-lactamase should be performed because these enzymes are disseminated both in human and veterinary medicine. The high resistance to penicillin and ampicillin demonstrates the limitation in the use of antibiotics in the treatment of mastitis in goats. Although in the present study the cephalosporines demonstrated a considerable degree of sensitivity, the use of these antimicrobial agents in veterinary medicine becomes a matter of concern due to the incidence of strains that produce betalactamase.","output":"Suscetibilidade a antimicrobianos e produo de betalactamase em amostras de Staphylococcus isolados de mastite caprina no semirido paraibano"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A Spanish version of the article is provided (see section before references).

Possible illness' stages were proposed within the context of medical knowledge as of January 2021. The parameters chosen in this data set were customized to fit the population data of the Valencia region (Spain) with approximately 2.5 million inhabitants. They were based on the evolution of the pandemic between September 2020 and March 2021, a period that included two complete waves of the pandemic. Contrary to expectation and despite the European and national transparency laws (BOE-A2013-12887, 2013;European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2019), the actual COVID-19 pandemic-related data, at least in Spain, took considerable time to be updated and made available (usually a week or more). Moreover, some relevant data necessary to develop and validate hospital bed management models were not publicly accessible. This was either because these data were not collected, because public agencies failed to make them public (despite having them indexed in their databases), the data were processed within indicators and not shown as raw data, or they simply published the data in a format that was difficult to process (e.g., PDF image documents versus CSV tables). Despite the potential of hospital information systems, there were still data that were not adequately captured within these systems. Moreover, the data collected in a hospital depends on the strategies and practices specific to that hospital or health system. This limits the generalization of \\"real\\" data, and it encourages working with \\"realistic\\" or plausible data that are clean of interactions with local variables or decisions (Gunal, 2012;Marin-Garcia et al., 2020). Besides, one can parameterize the model and define the data structure that would be necessary to run the model without delaying till the real data become available. Conversely, plausible data sets can be generated from publicly available information and, later, when real data become available, the accuracy of the model can be evaluated (Garcia-Sabater and Maheut, 2021). This work opens lines of future research, both theoretical and practical. From a theoretical point of view, it would be interesting to develop machine learning tools that, by analyzing specific data samples in real hospitals, can identify the parameters necessary for the automatic prototyping of generators adapted to each hospital. Regarding the lines of research applied, it is evident that the formalism proposed for the generation of sound patients is not limited to patients affected by SARS-CoV- 2 infection. The generation of heterogeneous patients can represent the needs of a specific population and serve as a basis for studying complex health service delivery systems.","output":"A data generator for covid-19 patients' care requirements inside hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mouse photoreceptors are electrically coupled via gap junctions, but the relative importance of rod/rod, cone/cone, or rod/cone coupling is unknown.

We report that FACS-sorted rods and cones both express Cx36 but no other connexins. We created rod- and cone-specific Cx36 knockout mice to dissect the photoreceptor network. In the wild type, Cx36 plaques at rod/cone contacts accounted for more than 95% of photoreceptor labeling and paired recordings showed the transjunctional conductance between rods and cones was ~300 pS. When Cx36 was eliminated on one side of the gap junction, in either conditional knockout, Cx36 labeling and rod/cone coupling were almost abolished. We could not detect direct rod/rod coupling, and cone/cone coupling was minor.

However, ICU occupancy thresholds at which action should be taken are often selected arbitrarily. We propose a quantitative approach using mathematical modeling to identify ICU occupancy thresholds at which mitigation should be triggered to avoid exceeding the ICU capacity available for COVID-19 patients. We used a stochastic compartmental model to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression, including critical cases that would require intensive care. We calibrated the model for the United States city of Chicago using daily COVID-19 ICU and hospital census data between March and August 2020. We projected ICU occupancies from September to May 2021 under two possible levels of transmission increase. The effect of combined mitigation measures was modeled as a decrease in the transmission rate that took effect when projected ICU occupancy reached a specified threshold. We found that mitigation did not immediately eliminate the risk of exceeding ICU capacity. Delaying action by 7 days increased the probability of exceeding ICU capacity by 10-60% and this increase could not be counteracted by stronger mitigation. Even under modest transmission increase, a threshold occupancy no higher than 60% was required when mitigation reduced the reproductive number Rt to just below 1. At higher transmission increase, a threshold of at most 40% was required with mitigation that reduced Rt below 0.75 within the first two weeks after mitigation. Our analysis demonstrates a quantitative approach for the selection of ICU occupancy thresholds that considers parameter uncertainty and compares relevant mitigation and transmission scenarios. An appropriate threshold will depend on the location, number of ICU beds available for COVID-19, available mitigation options, feasible mitigation strengths, and tolerated durations of intensified mitigation.","output":"Modeling robust COVID-19 intensive care unit occupancy thresholds for imposing mitigation to prevent exceeding capacities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current Coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 pandemic has infected over two million people and resulted in the death of over one hundred thousand people at the time of writing this review.

SARS-COV-2 is an enveloped virus that is surrounded by a lipid bilayer. Lipids are fundamental cell components that play various biological roles ranging from being a structural building block to a signaling molecule as well as a central energy store. The role lipids play in viral infection involves the fusion of the viral membrane to the host cell, viral replication, and viral endocytosis and exocytosis. Since lipids play a crucial function in the viral life cycle, we asked whether drugs targeting lipid metabolism, such as statins, can be utilized against SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses.

An important question that still needs to be answered is whether any of the common mutations affect the viral properties, and therefore the disease characteristics. Therefore, we sought to understand the effects of mutations in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), particularly the common 14408C>T mutation, on mutation rate and viral spread. By focusing on mutations in the slowly evolving M or E genes, we aimed to minimize the effects of selective pressure. Our results indicate that 14408C>T mutation increases the mutation rate, while the third-most common RdRp mutation, 15324C>T, has the opposite effect.

COVID-19 vaccination programme success will rely on public willingness to be vaccinated. METHODS: We used a multi-methods approach - involving an online cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interviews - to investigate parents' and guardians' views on the acceptability of a future COVID-19 vaccine. 1252 parents and guardians (aged 16 + years) who reported living in England with a child aged 18 months or under completed the survey. Nineteen survey participants were interviewed. FINDINGS: Most survey participants reported they would likely accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves (Definitely 55.8%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 34.3%) and their child/children (Definitely 48.2%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 40.9%). Less than 4% of survey participants reported that they would definitely not accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Survey participants were more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves than their child/children. Participants that self-reported as Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity were almost 3 times more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children than White British, White Irish and White Other participants. Survey participants from lower-income households were also more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine. In open-text survey responses and interviews, self-protection from COVID-19 was reported as the main reason for vaccine acceptance. Common concerns identified in open-text responses and interviews were around COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness, mostly prompted by the newness and rapid development of the vaccine. CONCLUSION: Information on how COVID-19 vaccines are developed and tested, including their safety and efficacy, must be communicated clearly to the public.

This study analyzed uniquely comprehensive datasets in order to examine the relationship between mobility and transmission of COVID- 19 in the country of Andorra. The data consisted of spatio-temporal telecoms data for all mobile subscribers in the country, serology screening results for 91% of the population, and COVID-19 case reports. A comprehensive set of mobility metrics was developed using the telecoms data to indicate entrances to the country, contact with tourists, stay-at-home rates, trip-making and levels of crowding. Mobility metrics were compared to infection rates across communities and transmission rate over time. All metrics dropped sharply at the start of the countrys lockdown and gradually rose again as the restrictions were gradually lifted. Several of these metrics were highly correlated with lagged transmission rate. There was a stronger correlation for measures of indoor crowding and inter-community trip-making, and a weaker correlation for total trips (including intra-community trips) and stay-at- homes rates.

However, current screening methods are either hampered by invasiveness or suboptimal performance, limiting their effectiveness as primary screening methods. To aid in the development of a non-invasive screening test with improved sensitivity and specificity, we have initiated a prospective biomarker study (CRCbiome), nested within a large randomized CRC screening trial in Norway. We aim to develop a microbiome-based classification algorithm to identify advanced colorectal lesions in screening participants testing positive for an immunochemical fecal occult blood test (FIT). We will also examine interactions with host factors, diet, lifestyle and prescription drugs. The prospective nature of the study also enables the analysis of changes in the gut microbiome following the removal of precancerous lesions. Methods: The CRCbiome study recruits participants enrolled in the Bowel Cancer Screening in Norway (BCSN) study, a randomized trial initiated in 2012 comparing once-only sigmoidoscopy to repeated biennial FIT, where women and men aged 50-74 years at study entry are invited to participate. Since 2017, participants randomized to FIT screening with a positive test result have been invited to join the CRCbiome study. Self-reported diet, lifestyle and demographic data are collected prior to colonoscopy after the positive FIT-test (baseline). Screening data, including colonoscopy findings are obtained from the BCSN database. Fecal samples for gut microbiome analyses are collected both before and 2 and 12 months after colonoscopy. Samples are analyzed using metagenome sequencing, with taxonomy profiles, and gene and pathway content as primary measures. CRCbiome data will also be linked to national registries to obtain information on prescription histories and cancer relevant outcomes occurring during the 10 year follow-up period. Discussion: The CRCbiome study will increase our understanding of how the gut microbiome, in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, influences the early stages of colorectal carcinogenesis.

However, recently it was discovered that IFITs could directly recognize viral RNA bearing a 5-triphosphate group (PPP-RNA), which is a molecular signature that distinguishes it from host RNA. Here, we report crystal structures of human IFIT5, its complex with PPP-RNAs, and an N-terminal fragment of IFIT1. The structures reveal a new helical domain that houses a positively charged cavity designed to specifically engage only single stranded PPP-RNA, thus distinguishing it from the canonical cytosolic sensor of double stranded viral PPP-RNA, RIG-I. Mutational analysis, proteolysis and gel-shift assays reveal that PPP-RNA is bound in a non-sequence specific manner and requires approximately a 3-nucleotide 5-overhang. Abrogation of PPP-RNA binding in IFIT1 and IFIT5 were found to cause a defect in the anti-viral response by HEK cells. These results demonstrate the mechanism by which IFIT proteins selectively recognize viral RNA and lend insight into their downstream effector function.","output":"Structural basis for viral 5-PPP-RNA recognition by human IFIT proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We deploy territorial system dynamics as a methodology to analyze stock and flow diagrams (SFD), identify the circularity in the value chain management of bioeconomy, the strengths and limits of circular economy incorporating symbiotic links between multi-products supply chain.

The twelve ICU patients studied had been diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) nucleic acid positive. Patient clinical symptoms were relieved or disappeared, and basic clinical information and laboratory test results were collected. The study focused on the most recent CT imaging characteristics. RESULTS: The average age of the 12 patients was 58.8  16.2 years. The most prevalent symptoms were fever (100%), dyspnea (100%), and cough (83.3%). All patients experienced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), of which 9 were moderate to severe. Six patients used noninvasive ventilators, and 4 patients used mechanical ventilation. One patient was treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The lymphocyte count decreased to 0.67  0.3 ( 10 9/L). The average day from illness onset to the last follow-up CT was 56.1  7.7 d. The CT results showed a decrease in ground glass opacities (GGO), whereas fibrosis gradually increased. The common CT features included GGO (10/12, 83.3%), subpleural line (10/12, 83.3%), fibrous stripes (12/12, 100%), and traction bronchiectasis (10/12, 83.3%).

Comparatively in mammalian cells, the type I interferon (IFN) pathway is the cornerstone of the innate antiviral response. Although the cellular machinery for RNAi functions in mammalian cells, its role in the antiviral response remains controversial. Here we show that IFN competent mammalian cells engage in dsRNA-mediated RNAi. We found that pre-soaking mammalian cells with concentrations of sequence-specific dsRNA too low to induce IFN production could significantly inhibit viral replication, including SARS-CoV-2. This phenomenon was dependent on dsRNA length, was comparable in effect to transfected siRNAs, and could knockdown multiple sequences at once. Additionally, Dicer-knockout cell lines were incapable of this inhibition, confirming use of RNAi. This represents the first evidence that soaking with gene-specific dsRNA can generate viral knockdown in mammalian cells. Furthermore, demonstrating RNAi below the threshold of IFN induction has uses as a novel therapeutic platform.","output":"Long dsRNA mediated RNA interference (dsRNAi) is antiviral in interferon competent mammalian cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Examining CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell responses after primary Yellow Fever vaccination in a cohort of 210 volunteers, we have identified and tetramer-validated 92 CD8(+) and 50 CD4(+) T cell epitopes, many inducing strong and prevalent (i.e., immunodominant) T cell responses. Restricted by 40 and 14 HLA-class I and II allotypes, respectively, these responses have wide population coverage and might be of considerable academic, diagnostic and therapeutic interest. The broad coverage of epitopes and HLA overcame the otherwise confounding effects of HLA diversity and non-HLA background providing the first evidence of T cell immunodomination in humans. Also, double-staining of CD4(+) T cells with tetramers representing the same HLA-binding core, albeit with different flanking regions, demonstrated an extensive diversification of the specificities of many CD4(+) T cell responses. We suggest that this could reduce the risk of pathogen escape, and that multi-tetramer staining is required to reveal the true magnitude and diversity of CD4(+) T cell responses. Our T cell epitope discovery approach uses a combination of (1) overlapping peptides representing the entire Yellow Fever virus proteome to search for peptides containing CD4(+) and/or CD8(+) T cell epitopes, (2) predictors of peptide-HLA binding to suggest epitopes and their restricting HLA allotypes, (3) generation of peptide-HLA tetramers to identify T cell epitopes, and (4) analysis of ex vivo T cell responses to validate the same. This approach is systematic, exhaustive, and can be done in any individual of any HLA haplotype. It is all-inclusive in the sense that it includes all protein antigens and peptide epitopes, and encompasses both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell epitopes. It is efficient and, importantly, reduces the false discovery rate. The unbiased nature of the T cell epitope discovery approach presented here should support the refinement of future peptide-HLA class I and II predictors and tetramer technologies, which eventually should cover all HLA class I and II isotypes.

Additionally, we explain our strategic plan aimed at minimizing the impact on clinical trial research activities, which included SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and IgG serological tests to all participants and personnel. The outcomes of the plan are described in terms of observed safety events and drop-outs during the study period. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients were participating in 16 active clinical trials in Fundaci ACE when the lockdown was established. During the confinement, we performed 1018 calls to the participants, which led to identify adverse events in 26 and COVID-19 symptoms in 6. A total of 83 patients (64%) could restart on-site visits as early as May 11, 2020. All SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR diagnostic tests performed before on-site visits were negative and only three IgG serological tests were positive. Throughout the study period, we only observed one drop-out, due to an adverse event unrelated to COVID-19.

METHODS: Using a large-scale multicenter inpatient claims data in Japan, we identified individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 in 2020 or influenza in 2017C2020. We compared patient characteristics, supportive care, and in-hospital mortality, with multivariable logistic regression analyses for in-hospital mortality overall, by age group, and among patients with mechanical ventilation. FINDINGS: We identified 16,790 COVID-19 patients and 27,870 influenza patients, with the different age distribution (peak at 70C89 years in COVID-19 vs. bimodal peaks at 0C9 and 80C89 years in influenza). On admission, the use of mechanical ventilation was similar in both groups (14% vs. 14%) but higher in the COVID-19 group (33% vs. 25%; p<00001) during the entire hospitalisation. The crude in-hospital mortality was 51% (856/16,790) for COVID-19 and 28% (791/27,870) for influenza. Adjusted for potential confounders, the in-hospital mortality was higher for COVID-19 than for influenza (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 183, 95% confidence interval [CI] 164C204). In age-stratified analyses, the aOR (95%CI) were 078 (056C108) and 205 (183C230) in patients aged 20C69 years and 70 years, respectively (p-for-interaction<00001). Among patients with mechanical ventilation, the aOR was 079 (059C105). INTERPRETATION: Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in Japan were more likely to die than those with influenza.

We conducted an online survey of active clinician members of the Parkinson Study Group (PSG) to evaluate the adoption of various non-face-to-face methods in clinical practice and research in PD during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a survey using the open-access online SurveyMonkey tool (http://www.surveymonkey.com). The survey had 27 items and was designed to elucidate clinical/research care before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was sent to 414 active PSG members with weekly reminders and it remained accessible for 30 days from May 2020. RESULTS: We received 142 responses, of which 133 (93.7%) provided demographic data. The clinical use of virtual visits via synchronous video conferencing increased from 39.5% pre-COVID-19 to 94.6% during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lack of access for patients (68.2%) and patient resistance (51.4%) were the top barriers for its use.

The duplicates in the data were removed and were analyzed on the basis of age, gender, and seriousness of adverse events at the System Organ Classification (SOC) level and the individual Preferred Term (PT) level. Results: A total 103954 adverse events reported from 32044 subjects were taken for analysis. Of 32044 subjects, majority were females (80%). Also, a total of 28799 (27.7%) SAEs were reported from the 8007 individuals. Most of the SAEs were reported from Europe (83%), amongst females (79.4%) and between 18 to 64 years (80.74%) of age. Majority of SAEs (74%) were reported for BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine. On system wise classification, general disorders (30%) were the commonest followed by nervous system (19.1%) and musculoskeletal (11.2%) disorders. In individual category, headache (8.1%) was the commonest, followed by pyrexia (7%) and fatigue (5.1%). The number of SAEs were reported with various vaccines were comparatively lesser as compared to the non-serious ones and incidence of death was low with all the vaccines candidates. Elderly (> 65 years) people reported more serious SAEs as compared to other age groups. Conclusion: The reported SAEs from the COVID 19 vaccines were in line with the data published in clinical trials. To link these SAEs to vaccines will need causality analysis and review of individual reports.","output":"Serious adverse events reported from the COVID-19 vaccines: A descriptive study based on WHO database"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Asymptomatic patients, together with those with mild symptoms of COVID-19, may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, the dynamics of viral shedding during the various phases of the clinical course of COVID-19 remains unclear at this stage. METHODS: A total of 18 patients found positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay, and admitted to Chongqing University Central Hospital between Jan 29 and Feb 5 were enrolled in this study. Medical data, pulmonary CT scan images, and RT-PCR results were periodically collected during the patients hospital stay. All participants were actively followed-up for 2 weeks after discharge. RESULTS: A total of nine (50%) asymptomatic patients and nine 9 (50%) mildly mild symptom COVID-19 patients were identified on admission. Six (66.7%) asymptomatic patients on admission developed subjective symptoms during hospitalization were recategorized as pre-symptomatic. The median duration of viral shedding was 11.5, 28 and 31 days for pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic and mild symptomatic patients, separately. Seven (38.9%) patients continued to shed virus after hospital discharge. During the convalescent phase, detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and RNA were simultaneously observed in five (27.8%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term viral shedding was presented in patients with mild symptoms and asymptomatic cases, and specific antibody production to SARS-CoV-2 may not guarantee viral clearance after discharge. These observations should be considered when making decisions regarding clinical and public health and strategies for prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Viral shedding dynamics in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Crystallization test is based on the principle that, when a salt crystallizes out of an aqueous solution, the crystal growth is influenced by the presence of other substances in the solution, such as blood or plant extracts. If a mixture of copper chloride solution with a small amount of whole blood is allowed to crystallize under controlled experimental conditions, an aggregate of crystals forms. Crystallization method can be used as a diagnostic aid to provide information about the systemic conditions and general health of the patient. Aim: This study aims to study the patterns of crystallization and to further determine the efficacy of crystallization test as a screening modality in premalignant lesions and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Materials and Methods: Fifty patients of OSCC, 50 patients of premalignant lesions, and 50 healthy individuals were selected. One drop of blood was collected from the study groups to perform crystallization using cupric chloride. Statistical Analysis Used: Statistical analysis was performed using Chi-square test, Student's t-test (two-tailed), and analysis of variance. Results: The different patterns of crystals formed were studied and statistically analyzed.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the mucocutaneous involvement in pediatric patients with COVID-19 admitted to a pediatric institution in Madrid (Spain), located in a zone reporting among the highest prevalence of COVID-19 in Europe. METHODS: A descriptive, analytical study was conducted on a series of 50 children hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and November 30, 2020. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients presented with mucocutaneous symptoms: 18 patients with macular and/or papular exanthem, 17 with conjunctival hyperemia, and 9 with red cracked lips or strawberry tongue. Eighteen patients fulfilled criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Patients with mucocutaneous involvement tended to be older and presented to the emergency department with poor general status and extreme tachycardia, higher C-reactive protein and D-dimer levels, and lower lymphocyte counts than patients without skin signs. Mucocutaneous manifestations pose a higher risk of admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (odds ratio, 10.24; 95% confidence interval, 2.23-46.88; P = .003).

Recruitment strategies included snowball sampling via website and social media, and paper surveys. Descriptive analysis of the data is presented to give a basic overview of the impact of COVID-19 in MC. A total of 883 participants in MC responded to the survey. Approximately one-third reported that they or family members experienced reduced work hours or lost their job because of COVID-19. In all questions related to paying for essential living needs, the percentage of participants who expected to have future problems was higher than the percentage who reported having current problems. Of those preparing for the fall 2020 school semester, expected challenges included lack of funds to purchase school supplies, lack of face coverings, and language barriers. Most participants in MC perceived the severity of COVID-19 to be moderate to very high, and there was a moderate level of knowledge about which groups are more at risk for contracting severe COVID-19. Less than half would know how to provide care for someone in their family with COVID-19. Several resource barriers for caring for a family member with COVID-19 were identified. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a more severe impact on Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander groups compared to others in the county.

This study measured depressive symptoms in ED HCW in Brooklyn, New York, at the peak 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An email-distributed survey of ED HCW at Maimonides Medical Center was conducted September 8CDecember 31, 2020, with reference period March-May 2020. Depressive symptoms were measured by the 10- item depressive symptom scale, Centers for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D). CES-D items were summed, with a possible total score of 0-30. A CES-D score >10 was deemed clinically relevant. Our main predictor was HCW status, which was dichotomized as clinical (MD/DO, nurses, ED technicians) vs non-clinical. Covariates included sex, age, race, SARS-CoV-2 testing status (not tested vs +test vs -test), social support (range: 0->=4 people to talk to), number of COVID-related home problems (range: 0-9), mental health care disruption during COVID-19 (yes/no), 3-item Loneliness Brief Survey (LBF) score (range: 3-9), and survey date. General linear regression and logistic regression analysis were used to predict CES-D score (- coefficient, p-value) and clinically relevant depressive symptoms (Odds Ratio (OR), 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI)), respectively. A p-value<0.05 was considered significant. Results: Among 222 HCW respondents, the mean age was 38.210.8y;and 59.4% were White, 52.5% were male, 80.1% were clinical HCW (38.5% MD/DO, 29.7% nurses, 31.8% ED technicians), and 61.6% tested for SARS-CoV-2. The mean CES-D score was 11.88.2. A clinically relevant depressive symptom burden was reported by 51.6% of HCW-55.4% of clinical HCW vs 36.4% of non-clinical HCW (p=0.024). There was no difference in the odds of clinically relevant depressive symptoms by type of clinical HCW (MD/DO, nurses, ED technicians) compared to non-clinical HCW;and no difference in mean CES-D score by clinical vs non-clinical HCW status. Increasing CES-D scores were also observed with increasing age (=0.12, p=0.01), number of COVID-19-related home problems (=0.99, p=0.035), and LBF score (= 2.17, p<0.0001). A clinically-relevant depressive symptom burden was also observed with increasing age (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03-1.11), among those who reported increasing COVID-19-related home problems (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01-2.11), and LBF score (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.63-2.65). Conclusions: Over half of clinical HCW experienced a clinically relevant depressive symptom burden during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Age, number of COVID-19-related home problems, and loneliness were also associated with higher depressive symptom burden.

Sepsis survivors and non-survivors oftentimes have similar clinical phenotypes or sepsis biomarker expression upon diagnosis, suggesting that the dynamics of sepsis in the critical early stage may have an impact on these opposite outcomes. To investigate this, we designed a within-subject study of patients with systemic gram-negative bacterial sepsis with surviving and fatal outcomes and performed single-cell transcriptomic analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected during the critical period between sepsis recognition and 6 hours. We observed that the largest sepsis-induced expression changes over time in surviving versus fatal sepsis were in CD14+ monocytes, including gene signatures previously reported for sepsis outcomes. We further identify changes in the metabolic pathways of both monocytes and platelets, the emergence of erythroid precursors, and T cell exhaustion signatures, with the most extreme differences occurring between the non-sepsis control and the sepsis non-survivor. Our single-cell observations are consistent with trends from public datasets but also reveal specific effects in individual immune cell populations, which change within hours. In conclusion, this pilot study provides the first single-cell results with a repeated measures design in sepsis to analyze the temporal changes in the immune cell population behavior in surviving or fatal sepsis. These findings indicate that tracking temporal expression changes in specific cell-types could lead to more accurate predictions of sepsis outcomes.

This study prospectively observed the efficacy and safety of decitabine with a modified cisplatin, cytarabine, and dexamethasone (DHAP) regimen in R/R-DLBCL patients who failed second-line treatment. METHODS: Twenty-one R/R-DLBCL patients were enrolled and treated with decitabine and a modified DHAP regimen. The primary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR) and safety. The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: ORR reached 50% (complete response rate, 35%), five patients (25%) had stable disease (SD) with disease control rate (DCR) of 75%. Subgroup analysis revealed patients over fifty years old had a higher complete response rate compared to younger patients (P = 0.005), and relapsed patients had a better complete response rate than refractory patients (P = 0.031). Median PFS was 7 months (95% confidence interval, 5.1-8.9 months). Median OS was not achieved. One-year OS was 59.0% (95% CI, 35.5%-82.5%), and two-year OS was 51.6% (95% confidence interval, 26.9%-76.3%). The main adverse events (AEs) were grade 3/4 hematologic toxicities such as neutropenia (90%), anemia (50%), and thrombocytopenia (70%). Other main non-hematologic AEs were grade 1/2 nausea/vomiting (40%) and infection (50%). No renal toxicity or treatment-related death occurred.

The primary end-point was all-cause mortality and COVID-19 severity, defined as admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and/or mechanical ventilation and/or death, was one of the secondary end-points. RESULTS: From April 4 to 11th June 2020, 1289 patients were analysed. The most frequent cancers were digestive and thoracic. Altogether, 424 (33%) patients had a severe form of COVID-19 and 370 (29%) patients died.

CONCLUSIONS: Mortality and COVID-19 severity in cancer patients are high and are associated with general characteristics of patients. We found no deleterious effects of recent anticancer treatments, except for cytotoxic chemotherapy in the RT-PCR-confirmed subgroup of patients. In almost 40% of patients, the systemic anticancer therapy was interrupted or stopped after COVID-19 diagnosis.","output":"Risk factors for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and mortality among solid cancer patients and impact of the disease on anticancer treatment: A French nationwide cohort study (GCO-002 CACOVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: : Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious public health issue that became rapidly pandemic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study on the SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-confirmed cases, clinical and laboratory data were collected from 156 hospitalized patients during August to October, 2020. Baseline chest CT was assessed, and the CT severity score was then calculated. Data were compared between the two groups of patients with moderate and severe/critical conditions. RESULTS: Of the 156 participants with the age range of 25C95 years (56.8716.88), 70 and 86 patients were in the moderate and severe/critical groups, respectively. Most patients had typical imaging features on chest CT. Compared to the moderate group, the severe/critical group were older and were mainly suffering from underlying comorbidities. The rate of confusion on admission (P=0.008) and pulse rate100 (p=0.04) were significantly higher in the severe/critical group. According to the CT manifestations, consolidation, central and diffuse peripheral and central distribution, patchy/segmental morphology, crazy paving pattern, pleural effusion, aorta, and coronary artery calcification were more likely to emerge in the severe/critical group (p<0.05). In contrast, round/nodular morphology mainly appeared in the moderate group (p= 0.002). The chest CT severity scores were 10.247.91 and 6.134.42 in the severe/critical and moderate groups, respectively, indicating statistically significant values.

Care retention is influenced by several socioeconomic, socio-cultural, and government policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we aim to explore barriers and facilitators to adherence to ART among PLWH in Pakistan in general and COVID-19 pandemic related in particular. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted among 25 PLWH from December 2020 to April 2021 in the local language (Urdu) at the ART centre of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan. Interviews were audio-recorded in the local Urdu language, and bilingual expert (English, Urdu) transcribed verbatim, coded for themes and sub-themes, and analyzed using a phenomenological approach for thematic content analysis. Results: Stigma and discrimination, fear of HIV disclosure, economic constraints, forgetfulness, religion (Ramadan, spiritual healing), adverse drug reactions, lack of social support, alternative therapies, and COVID-19-related lock-down and fear of lesser COVID-19 care due to HIV associated stigma were identified as barriers affecting the retention in HIV care. At the same time, positive social support, family responsibilities, use of reminders, the beneficial impact of ART, and initiation of telephone consultations, courier delivery, and long-term delivery of antiretrovirals during COVID-19 were identified as facilitators of HIV retention. Conclusion: Improving adherence and retention is even more challenging due to COVID-19; therefore, it requires the integration of enhanced access to treatment with improved employment and social support. HIV care providers must understand these reported factors comprehensively and treat patients accordingly to ensure the continuum of HIV care.

Even systems with universal access to healthcare (such as the UK's NHS) can only mitigate some consequences of health inequalities. Instead substantial societal measures are required both to reduce harmful exposures and to improve standards of housing, education, work, nutrition and exercise. The case for such measures is widely accepted among healthcare professionals but, in wider discourse, scepticism has remained about the role of government and society in improving life chances along with the belief that responsibility for health and wellbeing should rest with individuals themselves. The stark inequalities exposed by the coronavirus pandemic could be an opportunity to challenge this thinking. This paper argues that doctors should do more to persuade others of the need to address health inequalities and that to achieve this, it is important to understand the ethical and philosophical perspectives that are sceptical of such measures.

Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the role of behavioral changes to prevent COVID-19 infection and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The present cross-sectional study was conducted for 10 days during July 2020 among the general public of Karachi after the imposition of lockdown amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with a sample size of 331 participants. The questionnaire consisted of three parts i.e., (i) socio-demographics, (ii) perception and preventive behaviors towards COVID-19, and (iii) anxiety-related questions using the Urdu Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7). The data was analyzed using logistic regression to investigate the association between behavior change and anxiety. RESULTS: Almost half of the participants (i.e., 48.9%) reported being anxious. Although most of the participants were compliant with preventive behavioral changes in their daily lives but no associations between preventive behaviors and anxiety were found. There were significant associations between anxiety and some of the socio-demographic variables (i.e., gender: females were more anxious; age group and marital status single participants were more anxious).

Since the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages have emerged and are circulating all over the world. The assessment of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) in wastewater has recently been proven to be successful. The present research demonstrates a case study utilizing an established approach to perform monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants from 11 distinct wastewater treatment plants across Jaipur (India) during the second peak period of COVID-19 (from 19 February 2021 to 8 June 2021). The sequences obtained were analyzed to detect lineage using the Pangolin tool and SNPs using the mpileup utility of Samtools, which reported high genome coverage. The mutation analyses successfully identified the penetration of the B.1. in the first two weeks of sampling (19C26 February), followed by the B.1.617.2 variant into Jaipur in the first week of March 2021. B.1.617.2 was initially discovered in India in October 2020;however, it was not reported until early April 2021.The present study identified the presence of B.1.617.2 in early March, which correlates well with the clinical patients data (290 cases were reported much later by the government on 10 May 2021). The average total genome coverage of the samples is 94.39% when mapped onto the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1;a complete genome (NC_045512.2) sequence and SNP analysis showed that 37C51 SNPs were identified in each sample. The current study demonstrates that sewage surveillance for variant characterization is a reliable and practical method for tracking the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains in the community that is considerably faster than clinical genomic surveillance. As a result, this method can predict the advent of epidemiologically or clinically important mutations/variants, which can help with public health decision making.","output":"Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 Variants by Wastewater-Based Surveillance as a Sustainable and Pragmatic ApproachA Case Study of Jaipur (India)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the new Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic rapidly spread across the world, South America was reached later in relation to Asia, Europe and the United States of America (USA).

AIMS: To detail the response of the NYU Langone Health in-patient psychiatric services to the COVID-19 outbreak from 1 March to 1 May 2020. METHOD: Process improvement/quality improvement study. RESULTS: Over this time period, our two in-patient psychiatric units (57 total beds) treated 238 patients, including COVID-19-positive and -negative individuals. Testing for COVID-19 was initially limited to symptomatic patients but expanded over the 62-day time frame. In total, 122 SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were performed in 98 patients. We observed an overall rate of COVID-19 infection of 15.6% in the patients who were tested, with an asymptomatic positive rate of 13.7%. Although phased roll-out of testing impaired the ability to fully track on-unit transmission of COVID-19, 3% of cases were clearly identified as results of on-unit transmission.

Emerging literature reveals that fear of acquiring COVID-19 has detrimental psychological ramifications. However, it seems likely that social distancing will have a further negative impact on well-being. The focus of this study was therefore to investigate whether changes in behaviour as a result of social distancing would predict changes in well-being. Participants (n = 95) rated their level of well-being as it was both during social distancing and retrospectively one month before beginning social distancing. Participants also indicated how much time they spent engaged in various activities both during social distancing and one month before social distancing and nominated how important each of these activities was for them. These measures employed scales created specifically for the present study. In addition, participants completed the Big Five Inventory-2 Extra-Short Form and the nine-item version of the Personal Optimism and Self-Efficacy Optimism Scale. We found that affectivity-both positive and negative-decreased with increased engagement in meaningful activities and that affectivity increased with increased activity in general.

As a result, when using sufficiently accurate methods, one can analyze and optimize the milk production process at a herd level from the breeding and economic point-of-view. In this context, it is important to have a possibility to early predict culling reasons for cows, since, in the case of finding an effective method, it would be possible to modify breeding actions and farm management practices without anticipating the end of the animals productive lives. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to verify whether artificial neural networks and a general discriminant analysis may be an effective tool for predicting the culling reasons in cows based on routinely collected first-lactation data. It turned out that they were most effective in predicting culling due to old age and reproductive problems. It is significant because infertility is one of the conditions that are the most difficult to eliminate in dairy herds. ABSTRACT: The aim of the present study was to verify whether artificial neural networks (ANN) may be an effective tool for predicting the culling reasons in cows based on routinely collected first-lactation records. Data on Holstein-Friesian cows culled in Poland between 2017 and 2018 were used in the present study. A general discriminant analysis (GDA) was applied as a reference method for ANN. Considering all predictive performance measures, ANN were the most effective in predicting the culling of cows due to old age (99.76C99.88% of correctly classified cases). In addition, a very high correct classification rate (99.24C99.98%) was obtained for culling the animals due to reproductive problems. It is significant because infertility is one of the conditions that are the most difficult to eliminate in dairy herds. The correct classification rate for individual culling reasons obtained with GDA (0.00C97.63%) was, in general, lower than that for multilayer perceptrons (MLP). The obtained results indicated that, in order to effectively predict the previously mentioned culling reasons, the following first-lactation parameters should be used: calving age, calving difficulty, and the characteristics of the lactation curve based on Woods model parameters.","output":"The Use of Artificial Neural Networks and a General Discriminant Analysis for Predicting Culling Reasons in Holstein-Friesian Cows Based on First-Lactation Performance Records"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 related Acute Respiratory Failure, may be successfully treated with Conventional Oxygen therapy, High Flow Nasal Cannula, Continuous Positive Airway Pressure or Bi-level Positive-Pressure ventilation.

AIM: To explore the severity of perceived stress and potential correlates among the HCPs seeking online mental health services during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted among 34 HCPs to assess levels of psychological distress using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire. The HCPs working in different departments were compared using (2)-test for categorized variables and t-test for continuous ones, followed by the analysis of covariate (ANCOVA) to compare the perceived stress. Linear regression for the PSS-10 score was performed to identify potential correlates of stress. RESULTS: The sample overall (n=34) showed a relatively moderate level of perceived stress (PSS mean=15.714.02) with 38% identified as depressed (PHQ-95) and 24% as suffering from anxiety (GAD-75).

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included a cohort of patients admitted to one of three major hospitals of our healthcare network including, an academic medical center and comprehensive stroke center, which accepts transfers for complex cases from eight community hospitals, during March 1 to May 1, 2020. All patients that received imaging of the neuroaxis and had positive PCR testing for COVID-19 were identified and reviewed by an attending neuroradiologist. Demographics and comorbidities were recorded. Biomarkers were recorded from the day of the hemorrhagic event. Vital signs from the day of the hemorrhagic event mechanical ventilation orders at admission were recorded. Imaging findings were divided into 5 subtypes; acute subdural hematoma (SDH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), multi-compartmental hemorrhage (MCH), multi-focal intracerebral hemorrhage (MFH), and focal intracerebral hemorrhage (fICH). Outcomes were recorded as non-routine discharge and mortality. RESULTS: We found a total of 35 out of 5227 patients with COVID-19 that had hemorrhage of some kind. Mortality for the entire cohort was 45.7% (n = 16). SDH patients had a mortality rate of 35.3% (n = 6), SAH had a mortality of 50% (n = 1), MCH patients had a mortality of 71.4% (n = 5), MFH patients had a mortality of 50% (n = 2), fICH patients had a mortality of 40% (n = 2).

The development of the framework was motivated by the existing low uptake of management accounting and inconsistent use of Management Accounting Practices (MAPs) by SMEs, especially in emerging economies. The model framework advanced in this paper is meant to regularise and systematise the use of MAPs by SMEs. Methodology: The study adopted a qualitative research approach using semi-structured interviews. A total of thirteen focus group meetings, nineteen face-to-face in-depth interviews and twenty-one key informant interviews were conducted in five provinces in Zimbabwe. Data was analysed following a reflexive thematic analysis through content analysis using Atlas. ti. Findings: The paper proposed a six staged systematic implementation method that makes the application of MAPs less cumbersome and easy to implement. The framework can be applied to other similar contexts in the Global South. It is highly recommended that SMEs should apply management accounting as it use promotes competitive advantage and success for an entity.

Patients have been reported with multi-organ dysfunction along with acute respiratory distress syndrome which implies a critical situation for patients and made them difficult to breathe and survive. Moreover, pathology of COVID-19 is also related to cytokine storm which indicates the elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-18 along with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-. Among them, the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 has been reported to be induced via binding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS)-CoV-2 to the host receptors. Methodology: Interleukin-6 blockade has been proposed to constitute novel therapeutics against COVID-19. Thus, in this study, 15 phytocompounds with known antiviral activity have been subjected to test for their inhibitory effect on IL-6. Based on the affinity prediction, top 3 compounds (isoorientin, lupeol, and andrographolide) with best scores were selected for 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation and MMGB/PBSA binding free energy analysis. Results: Three phytocompounds including isoorientin, lupeol, and andrographolide have shown strong interactions with the targeted protein IL-6 with least binding energies (?7.1 to ?7.7 kcal/mol). Drug-likeness and ADMET profiles of prioritized phytocompounds are also very prominsing and can be further tested to be potential IL-6 blockers and thus benficial for COVID-19 treatment. The moelcular dynamics simulation couple with MMGB/PBSA binding free energy estimation validated conformational stability of the ligands and stronger intermolecular binding. The mean RMSD of the complexes is as: IL6-isoorientin complex (3.97 ?  0.77), IL6-lupeol (3.97 ?  0.76), and IL6-andrographolide complex (3.96 ?  0.77). In addition, the stability observation was affirmed by compounds mean RMSD: isoorientin (0.72 ?  0.32), lupeol (mean 0.38 ?  0.08), and andrographolide (1.09 ?  0.49). A similar strong agreement on systems stability was unraveled by MMGB/PBSA that found net binding net ~ ?20 kcal/mol for the complexes dominated by van der Waal interaction energy. Conclusion: It has been predicted that proposing potential IL-6 inhibitors with less side effects can help critical COVID-19 patients because it may control the cytokine storm, a major responsible factor of its pathogenesis. In this study, 3 potential phytocompounds have been proposed to have inhibitory effect on IL-6 that can be tested as potential therapeutic options against SARS-CoV-2.

Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that two commonly cited factors in disease transmission, connectivity among populations and abundant resources, would increase the likelihood of exposure to both pseudorabies virus (PrV) and Brucella spp. (bacterial agent of brucellosis) in wild pigs across the Kissimmee Valley of Florida. Using DNA from 348 wild pigs and sera from 320 individuals at 24 sites, we employed population genetic techniques to infer individual dispersal, and an Akaike information criterion framework to compare candidate logistic regression models that incorporated both dispersal and land cover composition. Our findings suggested that recent dispersal conferred higher odds of exposure to PrV, but not Brucella spp., among wild pigs throughout the Kissimmee Valley region. Odds of exposure also increased in association with agriculture and open canopy pine, prairie, and scrub habitats, likely because of highly localized resources within those land cover types. Because the effect of open canopy on PrV exposure reversed when agricultural cover was available, we suggest that small-scale resource distribution may be more important than overall resource abundance. Our results underscore the importance of studying and managing disease dynamics through multiple processes and spatial scales, particularly for non-native pathogens that threaten wildlife conservation, economy, and public health.","output":"Dispersal and Land Cover Contribute to Pseudorabies Virus Exposure in Invasive Wild Pigs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enveloped viruses represent a significant category of pathogens that cause serious diseases in animals. These viruses express envelope glycoproteins that are singularly important during the infection of host cells by mediating fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membranes. Despite low homology at protein levels, three classes of viral fusion proteins have, as of yet, been identified based on structural similarities. Their incorporation into viral particles is dependent upon their proper sub-cellular localization after being expressed and folded properly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, viral protein expression can cause stress in the ER, and host cells respond to alleviate the ER stress in the form of the unfolded protein response (UPR); the effects of which have been observed to potentiate or inhibit viral infection. One important arm of UPR is to elevate the capacity of the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is comprised of host quality control machinery that ensures proper protein folding. In this review, we provide relevant details regarding viral envelope glycoproteins, UPR, ERAD, and their interactions in host cells.","output":"Arms Race between Enveloped Viruses and the Host ERAD Machinery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has created worldwide emergency with morbidities, mortality and panic. The BCG vaccine, usually given to prevent childhood tuberculosis, surfaced as an option as suggested by some ecological observations. However, some others studies could not establish and explain the protective effects of BCG vaccination against COVID-19 pandemic. India is one country with high BCG vaccination coverage and is among the countries with lowest COVID-19 case fatality rate. Aims and Objectives: We examine the relationship between the BCG coverage and COVID-19 burden in various states/UTs of India. Materials and methods: The information on BCG coverage and morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 was obtained from NFHS and www.covid19India.org respectively. Results: The analysis suggested very weak positive relationship of BCG coverage with cases and deaths due to COVID-19. Moderate positive relationship was observed between BCG coverage and COVID-19 case fatality rate even after adjusting for health system performance. Conclusion: The conclusion of the study is against the role of BCG vaccination in containing the COVID-19 pandemic. The positive correlation which is not significant may be spurious and affected by many confounding factors like co-morbid conditions, testing strategies, population level immunity for other viral infections etc. Hence, the states and UTs should not be complacent by the hypothesized role of BCG vaccine in COVID-19 control. Rather, they should continue with the principles of social distancing, contact tracing, treating and surveillance of COVID-19. ? 2021, Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine.

A novel deep-learning (DL) algorithm, trained on more than 5 million examples of the outcome of ultrasonographic probe movement on image quality, can provide real-time prescriptive guidance for novice operators to obtain limited diagnostic transthoracic echocardiographic images. OBJECTIVE: To test whether novice users could obtain 10-view transthoracic echocardiographic studies of diagnostic quality using this DL-based software. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective, multicenter diagnostic study was conducted in 2 academic hospitals. A cohort of 8 nurses who had not previously conducted echocardiograms was recruited and trained with AI. Each nurse scanned 30 patients aged at least 18 years who were scheduled to undergo a clinically indicated echocardiogram at Northwestern Memorial Hospital or Minneapolis Heart Institute between March and May 2019. These scans were compared with those of sonographers using the same echocardiographic hardware but without AI guidance. INTERVENTIONS: Each patient underwent paired limited echocardiograms: one from a nurse without prior echocardiography experience using the DL algorithm and the other from a sonographer without the DL algorithm. Five level 3Ctrained echocardiographers independently and blindly evaluated each acquisition. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Four primary end points were sequentially assessed: qualitative judgement about left ventricular size and function, right ventricular size, and the presence of a pericardial effusion. Secondary end points included 6 other clinical parameters and comparison of scans by nurses vs sonographers. RESULTS: A total of 240 patients (mean [SD] age, 61 [16] years old; 139 men [57.9%]; 79 [32.9%] with body mass indexes >30) completed the study. Eight nurses each scanned 30 patients using the DL algorithm, producing studies judged to be of diagnostic quality for left ventricular size, function, and pericardial effusion in 237 of 240 cases (98.8%) and right ventricular size in 222 of 240 cases (92.5%). For the secondary end points, nurse and sonographer scans were not significantly different for most parameters. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This DL algorithm allows novices without experience in ultrasonography to obtain diagnostic transthoracic echocardiographic studies for evaluation of left ventricular size and function, right ventricular size, and presence of a nontrivial pericardial effusion, expanding the reach of echocardiography to clinical settings in which immediate interrogation of anatomy and cardiac function is needed and settings with limited resources.","output":"Utility of a Deep-Learning Algorithm to Guide Novices to Acquire Echocardiograms for Limited Diagnostic Use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemic H1N1 influenza is projected to be unprecedented in its scope, causing acute critical illness among thousands of young otherwise healthy adults, who will need advanced life support.

To clarify the mechanism in pumpkin rootstock-induced systemic acquired acclimation in grafted watermelon under chilling stress, we used self-grafted (Cl/Cl) and pumpkin rootstock-grafted (Cl/Cm) watermelon seedlings to study the changes in lipid peroxidation, photosystem II (PSII) activity and antioxidant metabolism, the spatio-temporal response of SA biosynthesis and H2O2 accumulation to chilling, and the role of H2O2 signal in SA-induced chilling tolerance in grafted watermelon. The results showed that pumpkin rootstock grafting promoted SA biosynthesis in the watermelon scions. Chilling induced hydrolysis of conjugated SA into free SA in the roots and accumulation of free SA in the leaves in Cl/Cm plants. Further, pumpkin rootstock grafting induced early response of antioxidant enzyme system in the roots and increased activities of ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase in the leaves, thus maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Exogenous SA improved while the inhibition of SA biosynthesis reduced chilling tolerance in Cl/Cl seedlings. The application of diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, inhibitor of NADPH oxidase) and dimethylthiourea (DMTU, H2O2 scavenger) decreased, while exogenous H2O2 improved the PSII activity in Cl/Cl plants under chilling stress. Additionally, the decrease of the net photosynthetic rate in DMTU- and DPI-pretreated Cl/Cl plants under chilling conditions could be alleviated by subsequent application of H2O2 but not SA.

Artificial intelligence is also gradually changing the landscape of healthcare research (Yu et al. in Biomed Eng 2:719C731, 25). The rule-based approach that relied on the curation of medical knowledge and the construction of robust decision rules had drawn significant attention in diagnosing diseases and clinical decision support since half a century ago. In recent years, machine learning algorithms such as deep learning that can account for complex interactions between features is shown to be promising in predictive modeling in healthcare (Deo in Circulation 132:1920C1930, 26). Although many of these artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms can achieve remarkably high performance, it is often difficult to be completely adopted in practical clinical environments due to the lack of explainability in some of these algorithms. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is emerging to assist in the communication of internal decisions, behavior, and actions to health care professionals. Through explaining the prediction outcomes, XAI gains the trust of the clinicians as they may learn how to apply the predictive modeling in practical situations instead of blindly following the predictions.

AIM: The purpose of this study was to assess the epidemiology and factors associated with acute diarrhoea amongst children less than 5 years of age in Engela district in the Ohangwena region, Namibia. SETTING: The study was conducted in Ohangwena Region in Namibia which extends east to west along the borders of the southern part of Angola. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted. A structured questionnaire was administered through face-to-face interviews. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the socio-demographic and epidemiological data of diarrhoea and logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with the prevalence of diarrhoea. RESULTS: The study found a prevalence of 23.8% for diarrhoea in the 2 weeks period preceding the survey amongst children aged under 5 years. The prevalence of diarrhoea was statistically significantly associated with children (p < 0.05). The strongest predictor of the prevalence of diarrhoea was the residential area informal settlement, with an odds ratio of 36.42.

DATA SOURCES Clinical and experimental studies and current guideline recommendations from the human literature; and original case studies, case reports, and previous reviews in the veterinary literature. SUMMARY Peritoneal dialysis involves the exchange of solutes and fluid between the peritoneal capillary blood and the dialysis solution across the peritoneal membrane. It requires placement of a peritoneal dialysis catheter for repeated dialysate exchange. The ideal catheter provides reliable, rapid dialysate flow rates without leaks or infections. Catheter selection and placement are reviewed along with dialysate selection, exchange prescriptions, and overall patient management. PD does not require specific or complex equipment, and it can achieve effective control of uremia and electrolyte imbalances. CONCLUSIONS Peritoneal dialysis is a potential life-saving measure for patients with acute renal failure. Peritoneal dialysis results in gradual decline in uremic toxins. Previously low success rates have been reported. Improved success rates have been noted in dogs with acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to leptospirosis. Cats also have a good success rate when PD is elected in patients with a potentially reversible underlying disease. Overall, PD remains a viable intervention for patients with AKI unresponsive to medical management.

The COVID-19 pandemic is highlighting and exacerbating global, national, and regional disparities in relation to the benefits and burdens of undertaking critical basic public health mitigation measures such as physical distancing. In the United States, attempts to address the COVID-19 pandemic are complicated by striking racial, economic, and geographic inequities.

Medical professionals, notably junior doctors, are at increased risk of developing poor mental health and burnout. The GMC Barometer Study in 2020 showed that 32% of doctors found the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic detrimental to their wellbeing and mental health. The aim of this quality improvement project was to assess and improve hospital wellbeing support available to foundation doctors within Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (GHNHSFT) by learning and reflecting on the impact of COVID-19. Method After identifying a lack of resources within GHNHSFT, wellbeing information boards were displayed in communal areas and distributed by email. These encompassed trust wide support, practical information including childcare and relaxation resources concentrating on mindfulness, exercise and culture. A survey of foundation doctors was completed to assess doctors focus and approach to wellbeing. Questions assessed influential factors in maintaining wellbeing, access to current hospital resources and future interventions. Result 94% of respondents recognised that their focus on wellbeing increased during COVID-19. One third of foundation doctors found it challenging to maintain their wellbeing, with 40% reporting difficulty accessing hospital support and advice. The most important factors foundation doctors identified in maintaining wellbeing were exercise, cooking and baking, and social networks. Colleagues were a significant source of wellbeing support, followed by notice boards, email resources and social media. Conclusion COVID-19 highlighted the importance and burden on wellbeing of foundation doctors, with a significant number struggling to access support. Future recommendations include the use of a buddy system, regular and accessible exercise classes and improved communication of wellbeing support and resources to staff members. Buddy systems have already shown success amongst teams however it is important these are accessible to all foundation doctors and universally offered within the trust. A weekly yoga class is being reintroduced to be available to all doctors. A particular focus has been the development of a health and wellbeing section to feature in the trusts weekly communications, with the aim to regularly signpost staff to ongoing wellbeing resources and support. Social networking and media were highlighted as important in both maintaining wellbeing and accessing resources. A future goal is to develop an official GHNHSFT Instagram or Twitter account focused on wellbeing. We hope to continue to learn from the impact of COVID-19, improving the availability of wellbeing support at GHNHSFT that will continue into the future.","output":"Wellbeing support for foundation doctors during COVID-19 in GHNHSFT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The measures against the COVID-19 pandemic are challenging for children and parents, and detrimental effects on child health are suggested especially from lock-down measures and school closings. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using a population based longitudinal (birth-) cohort study (SPATZ study) conducted in the South of Germany. Data included all 6 or 7 year old children for whom a questionnaire was completed during first grade of school. Consequently, we were able to analyze children being in first grade before the first lockdown in Germany ( 15th March 2020), as well as children being in first grade during the pandemic (> 15th March 2020). We conducted descriptive statistics and estimated the associations between the two time periods, before and during the pandemic, and various outcomes of child health using multivariable adjusted linear or logistic regression modeling. The analysis was stratified by gender. RESULTS: Results among n = 362 children aged six or seven years showed substantially lower mean scores of health-related quality of life (difference in means: ? 5.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) ? 9.0, ? 2.0), and higher mean scores in total emotional and behavioral difficulties (difference in means: 2.0, 95% CI 0.2, 3.8) in girls during vs. before the COVID-19 pandemic using multivariable linear regression modeling. In addition, weekly screen-time was increased in boys by 3.5 h (95% CI 0.6, 6.4). We did not find substantial differences in sleep quality, physical activity, and time spent with books, neither in boys nor in girls, however, the limited sample size has to be considered. CONCLUSION: Child health (and behavior) of first grade school children is possibly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with adverse consequences possibly differing by gender.

Despite structural similarities, these two systems are quite different. The 895 kDa noncovalent IgG hexamer consists of six IgG subunits hexamerizing in solution due to three specifically engineered mutations in the Fc region, whereas the 935 kDa IgM oligomer results from the covalent assembly of one joining (J) chain and 5 IgM subunits into an asymmetric pentamer stabilized by interchain disulfide bridges. Notwithstanding their size, structural differences, and complexity, we observe that their top-down electron capture dissociation spectra are quite similar and straightforward to interpret, specifically providing informative sequence tags covering the highly variable CDR3s and FR4s of the Ig subunits they contain. Moreover, we show that the electron capture dissociation fragmentation spectra of immunoglobulin oligomers are essentially identical to those obtained for their respective monomers. Demonstrated for recombinantly produced systems, the approach described here opens up new prospects for the characterization and identification of IgMs circulating in plasma, which is important since IgMs play a critical role in the early immune response to pathogens such as viruses and bacteria.","output":"Extending Native Top-Down Electron Capture Dissociation to MDa Immunoglobulin Complexes Provides Useful Sequence Tags Covering Their Critical Variable Complementarity-Determining Regions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate what opinions and perceptions people have about nursing and the role of nursing staff in nursing homes (NHs) on Social Networking Service (SNS) by analyzing large-scale data through social big-data analysis.

Therefore, this study was designed to understand the changes in dietary and lifestyle behaviours that are major determinants of health during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online questionnaire using a convenience sample of 415 adults living in Kuwait (age range 18-73 years). RESULTS: The rate of skipping breakfast remained consistent, with a slight increase during the pandemic. Lunch remained the main reported meal before and during COVID-19. Compared to before COVID-19, people were much more likely have a late-night snack or meal during COVID-19 (OR = 3.57 (95% CI 1.79-7.26), p < 0.001). Moreover, there was a drastic decrease in the frequency of fast-food consumption during COVID-19, up to 82% reported not consuming fast food (p < 0.001). There was a significant increase in the percentage of participants who had their main meal freshly made (OR = 59.18 (95% CI 6.55-1400.76), p = 0.001). Regarding food group patterns, no significant differences were found before and during the pandemic in terms of the weekly frequency of consumption, except in the case of fish and seafood. There were no remarkable changes in beverage consumption habits among participants before and during the pandemic, except for Americano coffee and fresh juice. Furthermore, there was a great reduction in physical activity and an increase in the amount of screen time and sedentary behaviours. A notable increase was detected in day-time sleep and a decrease in night-time sleep among participants. CONCLUSION: In general, this study indicates some changes in daily life, including changes in some eating practices, physical activity and sleeping habits during the pandemic.

METHODS In an open-label trial with blinded assessment of outcomes, we randomly assigned 1900 adults with coma who had had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac or unknown cause to undergo targeted hypothermia at 33C, followed by controlled rewarming, or targeted normothermia with early treatment of fever (body temperature, 37.8C). The primary outcome was death from any cause at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included functional outcome at 6 months as assessed with the modified Rankin scale. Prespecified subgroups were defined according to sex, age, initial cardiac rhythm, time to return of spontaneous circulation, and presence or absence of shock on admission. Prespecified adverse events were pneumonia, sepsis, bleeding, arrhythmia resulting in hemodynamic compromise, and skin complications related to the temperature management device. RESULTS A total of 1850 patients were evaluated for the primary outcome. At 6 months, 465 of 925 patients (50%) in the hypothermia group had died, as compared with 446 of 925 (48%) in the normothermia group (relative risk with hypothermia, 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94 to 1.14; P = 0.37). Of the 1747 patients in whom the functional outcome was assessed, 488 of 881 (55%) in the hypothermia group had moderately severe disability or worse (modified Rankin scale score 4), as compared with 479 of 866 (55%) in the normothermia group (relative risk with hypothermia, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.09). Outcomes were consistent in the prespecified subgroups. Arrhythmia resulting in hemodynamic compromise was more common in the hypothermia group than in the normothermia group (24% vs. 17%, P<0.001).

However, such an initiative can raise concerns across stakeholders about surveillance, intrusiveness and merit. This study examined the perspectives of patients, physicians and other clinical staff, and facility leaders over 3 years at six sites during the implementation of a patient-collected audio quality improvement program designed to improve patient-centered care in a non-threatening manner and with minimal effort required of patients and clinicians. METHODS: Patients were invited during the first and third year to complete exit surveys when they returned their audio recorders following visits, and clinicians to complete surveys annually. Clinicians were invited to participate in focus groups in the first and third years. Facility leaders were interviewed individually during the last 6 months of the study. RESULTS: There were a total of 12 focus groups with 89 participants, and 30 leadership interviews. Two hundred fourteen clinicians and 800 patients completed surveys. In a qualitative analysis of focus group data employing NVivo, clinicians initially expressed concerns that the program could be disruptive and/or burdensome, but these diminished with program exposure and were substantially replaced by an appreciation for the value of low stakes constructive feedback. They were also significantly more confident in the value of the intervention in the final year (p = .008), more likely to agree that leadership supports continuous improvement of patient care and gives feedback on outcomes (p = .02), and at a time that is convenient (p = .04). Patients who volunteered sometimes expressed concerns they were spying on their doctors, but most saw it as an opportunity to improve care. Leaders were supportive of the program but not yet prepared to commit to funding it exclusively with facility resources. CONCLUSIONS: A patient-collected audio program can be implemented when it is perceived as safe, not disruptive or burdensome, and as contributing to better health care.

Evidence suggests chronic hepatitis E may follow a course similar to hepatitis B/C with progression to cirrhosis and possibly hepatocellular carcinoma in immunocompromised patients. SUMMARY: Hepatitis E virus is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis worldwide. A combination of serology and nucleic acid amplification testing is the recommended strategy for suspected patients. Ribavirin therapy for a period of 3 months is the drug of choice for severe acute hepatitis, acute-on chronic liver failure, and chronic infections from hepatitis E virus in immunocompromised patients who are unresponsive to decreased immunosuppression. PEGylated interferon  can be used for ribavirin-resistant liver transplant patients with chronic hepatitis E.

Some athletes have access to facilities and equipment, while others have limited or no access, severely limiting their training practices. A primary concern is that the maintenance of key physical qualities (e. g. strength, power, high-speed running ability, acceleration, deceleration and change of direction), game-specific contact skills (e. g. tackling) and decision-making ability, are challenged, impacting performance and injury risk on resumption of training and competition. In extended periods of reduced training, without targeted intervention, changes in body composition and function can be profound. However, there are strategies that can dramatically mitigate potential losses, including resistance training to failure with lighter loads, plyometric training, exposure to high-speed running to ensure appropriate hamstring conditioning, and nutritional intervention. Athletes may require psychological support given the challenges associated with isolation and a change in regular training routine. While training restrictions may result in a decrease in some physical and psychological qualities, athletes can return in a positive state following an enforced period of rest and recovery. On return to training, the focus should be on progression of all aspects of training, taking into account the status of individual athletes.","output":"Returning to Play after Prolonged Training Restrictions in Professional Collision Sports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) rapidly spread across China and to more than 70 countries, an increasing number of pregnant women were affected.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases up until 2 February 2021. The primary outcome was the poor outcome, a composite of mortality and severity. Severe COVID-19 was defined as COVID-19 that fulfill the criteria for severe pneumonia or patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome/disease progression/need for intensive care unit or mechanical ventilation. The effect estimates were a mean difference between patients with and without a poor outcome in mg/dL and odds ratio (OR) per 1 mg/dL decrease in prealbumin level. The effect estimates were reported with their 95% confidence interval (95% CI). RESULTS Nine studies comprising of 2104 patients were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Patients with poor outcome have lower prealbumin level (mean difference -71.48 mg/dL [95% CI -93.74, -49.22], p<0.001; I2: 85.9%). Every 1 mg/dL decrease in prealbumin level was associated with 1% increase in poor outcome (OR 0.992 [0.987, 0.997], p=0.004, I2: 81.7%).

Associated annual health care costs run into billions. National treatment guidance includes initial lifestyle advice, followed by anti-hypertensive medication if blood pressure (BP) remains high. However, adoption and adherence to recommended exercise guidelines, dietary advice and anti-hypertensive medication is poor. Four short bouts of isometric exercise (IE) performed 3 days per week (d/wk) at home elicits clinically significant reductions in BP in those with normal to high-normal BP. This study will determine the feasibility of delivering personalised IE to patients with stage 1 hypertension for whom lifestyle changes would be recommended before medication within NHS primary care. METHODS: This is a randomised controlled feasibility study. Participants were 18+ years, with stage 1 hypertension, not on anti-hypertensive medication and without significant medical contraindications. Trial arms will be standard lifestyle advice (control) or isometric wall squat exercise and standard lifestyle advice. Primary outcomes include the feasibility of healthcare professionals to deliver isometric exercise prescriptions in a primary care NHS setting and estimation of the variance of change in systolic BP. Secondary outcomes include accuracy of protocol delivery, execution of and adherence to protocol, recruitment rate, attrition, perception of intervention viability, cost, participant experience and accuracy of home BP. The study will last 18 months. Sample size of 100 participants (50 per arm) allows for 20% attrition and 6.5% incomplete data, based upon 74 (37 each arm) participants (two-sided 95% confidence interval, width of 1.33 and standard deviation of 4) completing 4 weeks.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. ACE2 exists as a membrane-bound protein on major viral target pulmonary epithelial cells, and its peptidase domain (PD) interacts SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with higher affinity.

Three different anterior surgical models were constructed according to the anterior approaches involving debridement, bone graft with or without titanium mesh, and internal fixation with different number of screws and rods. The posterior surgical approach involved transforaminal lumbar interbody debridement, bone graft, and internal fixation.

We have sought to identify trends in presentation, diagnosis and management of paediatric septic arthritis, with added focus on ethnicity and access to healthcare. METHODS A ten year retrospective review of all cases < 16 years with presumed septic arthritis presenting to a tertiary referral centre between 2008 and 2018 was performed. RESULTS A total of 103 cases met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 5.9 years (SD +/- 4.17) with a male predominance (64%). Traditional laboratory culture method isolated an organism in 66% of cases: Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen identified (61%). Incidence varied greatly by ethnicity 1:16,000 for NZ European children; 1:8760 for Pacifica and 1:4300 for Mori. Mean distance travelled by patients to reach the nearest emergency department was 38.3 km, ranging from 2 to 188 km.

A prospective descriptive study was performed to demonstrated MRI and MRE techniques of the prostate gland in ten patients with BPH to assess tissue stiffness, features of BPH on MRI and components of BPH in the area of increased stiffness. RESULTS: MRI and MRE examinations in all patients were successful without any complications. The mean tissue stiffness of the whole prostate gland was 4.40  0.71 kPa with good reproducibility (ICC 0.82). Stromal components and mixed glandular-stromal components tended to be associated with the areas of increased stiffness on stiffness images, 50.6% for stromal components and 37.9% for mixed glandular-stromal components.

Among the various available techniques, decentralized contact tracing that uses Bluetooth received signal strength indication (RSSI) to detect proximity is considered less of a privacy risk than approaches that rely on collecting absolute locations via GPS, cellular-tower history, or QR-code scanning. As of October 2020, there have been millions of downloads of such Bluetooth-based contract-tracing apps, as more and more countries officially adopt them. However, the effectiveness of these apps in the real world remains unclear due to a lack of empirical research that includes realistic crowd sizes and densities. This study aims to fill that gap, by empirically investigating the effectiveness of Bluetooth-based contact tracing in crowd environments with a total of 80 participants, emulating classrooms, moving lines, and other types of real-world gatherings. The results confirm that Bluetooth RSSI is unreliable for detecting proximity, and that this inaccuracy worsens in environments that are especially crowded. In other words, this technique may be least useful when it is most in need, and that it is fragile when confronted by low-cost jamming. Moreover, technical problems such as high energy consumption and phone overheating caused by the contact-tracing app were found to negatively influence users' willingness to adopt it. On the bright side, however, Bluetooth RSSI may still be useful for detecting coarse-grained contact events, for example, proximity of up to 20m lasting for an hour. Based on our findings, we recommend that existing contact-tracing apps can be re-purposed to focus on coarse-grained proximity detection, and that future ones calibrate distance estimates and adjust broadcast frequencies based on auxiliary information.","output":"An Empirical Evaluation of Bluetooth-based Decentralized Contact Tracing in Crowds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Few Korean hospitals had experience in pediatric palliative care. Since the beginning of the national palliative care project, interest in pediatric palliative care has gradually increased, but the establishment of professional palliative care is still inadequate due to a lack of indicators. This study aimed to find considerations in the process of initiating palliative care services. The general and clinical characteristics of 181 patients aged less than 24 years who were registered at the pediatric palliative care center from January 2019 to August 2021 were evaluated. Life-limiting condition group 1 had the largest number of patients. The primary need for palliative care was psychological and emotional support, followed by information sharing and help in communication with the medical staff in decision-making processes. Seventy-two patients were technologically dependent, with one to four technical supports for each patient. The registration of patients with cancer increased with time, and the time from disease diagnosis to consultation for pediatric palliative care service was significantly reduced. In conclusion, before starting pediatric palliative care, it is necessary to understand the needs of patients and their families and to cooperate with medical staff.","output":"The First Step to Initiate Pediatric Palliative Care: Identify Patient Needs and Cooperation of Medical Staff"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Scrub typhus can present with atypical signs and symptoms such as those of acute kidney injury, gastroenteritis, pneumonitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Meningitis, encephalitis, and hepatic dysfunction have also been reported, particularly in severe cases with multisystem involvement. Scrub typhus has never been reported in the literature to cause urinary tract infections (UTIs) which includes cystitis and pyelonephritis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year old male presenting to the outpatient unit with fever, right flank pain, and burning micturition for three days was initially treated for UTI. However, he returned to the hospital on the fourth day of illness with persistent symptoms. He was hospitalized, with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone. Computerized tomography scan of his abdomen-pelvis showed features of acute pyelonephritis, so his antibiotics were upgraded to meropenem and teicoplanin. Despite this, the patients condition deteriorated. Laboratory investigations showed multisystem involvement: decreasing platelets, raised creatinine, and deranged liver panel. As Kathmandu was hit by dengue epidemic during the patients hospitalization, on the seventh day of his illness, blood samples were sent for tropical fever investigation. All tests came out negative except for scrub typhusIgM antibodies positive on rapid diagnostic test. The patients symptoms subsided after 48 h of starting doxycycline and he became fully asymptomatic four days later. Fever did not recur even after discontinuing other IV antibiotics, favoring scrub typhus disease rather than systemic bacterial sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Scrub typhus is an emerging infectious disease of Nepal. Therefore, every unexplained fever cases (irrespective of clinical presentation) should be evaluated for potential Rickettsiosis. Moreover, for cases with acute pyelonephritis, atypical causative agents should be investigated, for example scrub typhus in this case.","output":"Scrub typhus as a rare cause of acute pyelonephritis: case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current research work is devoted to address some results related to the existence and stability as well as numerical finding of a novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by using a mathematical model.

The exponentially increasing numbers of infection and mortality have made preventive measures challenging. India being a highly populated nation has so far effectively counteracted the pandemic outbreak with a significantly lower rate of mortality despite the high infection rates. The genetic architecture of the immune response genes in the Indian population, BCG vaccination, the predominantly young age group of people, and their traditional food habits might contribute to the lower rate of mortality. Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) play a vital role in triggering T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells can immediately react to eliminate infected cells. Activation of virus-specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells selectively targets the infected cells and strengthens the immunoregulatory system. The checkpoint for NK cell function is the engagement of killer Ig-like receptors (KIR) molecules with their respective HLA ligands overexpressed or expressed on the compromised virus-infected cells which have shown polymorphism among different ethnic groups. Here, we explore if certain KIR-HLA motifs grant Indians a survival advantage in terms of the low rate of mortality. Additionally, enhanced immunity through BCG vaccination may favor fruitful eradication of SARS-CoV-2 and provide the way out as in therapeutic intervention and vaccination strategies.","output":"Footprint of the COVID-19 Pandemic in India: A Study of Immune Landscape and Other Factors Shielding Mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acute mesenteric ischemia is a common surgical emergency. Restoration of blood flow is a critical objective of treating this pathology. However, many patients suffer from ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injuries at the time of revascularization, requiring prolonged hospitalizations. B-1a cells are a subtype of B lymphocytes with roles in regulating inflammation and tissue injury by spontaneous release of natural IgM and IL-10. We hypothesized that treatment with B-1a cells protects mice from intestinal I/R. METHODS: Mesenteric ischemia was induced in mice by placing a vascular clip on the superior mesenteric artery for 60 minutes. At the time of reperfusion, B-1a cells or PBS control were instilled into the peritoneal cavity (PerC) of mice. PerC lavage, blood, intestine, and lungs were collected 4 h after reperfusion. Serum organ injury and inflammatory markers such as ALT, AST, LDH, lactate, IL-6, as well as lung and gut histology and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were assessed. RESULTS: In intestinal I/R, B-1a cell frequency and number in the PerC were significantly decreased compared to sham-operated mice. There was an increase in the serum levels of ALT, AST, LDH, lactate, and IL-6 when comparing the vehicle group with the sham group. These increases were significantly reduced in the B-1a cell treated group. B-1a cell treatment significantly decreased the intestine and lung injury scores as well as MPO content, compared to vehicle treated mice. B-1a cell treatment resulted in a reduction of apoptotic cells in these tissues. Serum IgM levels were decreased in intestinal I/R, while treatment with B-1a cells significantly increased their levels towards normal levels. CONCLUSIONS: B-1a cell treatment at the time of mesenteric reperfusion ameliorates end organ damage and reduces systemic inflammation through the improvement of serum IgM levels. Preserving B-1a cells pool could serve as a novel therapeutic avenue in intestinal I/R injury.","output":"Therapeutic Potential of B-1a Cells in Intestinal Ischemia-reperfusion Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate full-length sequencing of a purified unknown protein is still challenging nowadays due to the error-prone mass-spectrometry (MS)-based methods. De novo identified peptide sequence largely contain errors, undermining the accuracy of assembly. Bias on the detectability of the peptides also makes low-coverage regions, resulting in gaps. Although recent advances on multi-enzyme hydrolysis and algorithms showed complete assembly of full-length protein sequences in a few examples, the robustness in practical application is still to be improved. Here, inspired by genome assembly strategies, we demonstrate a contig-scaffolding strategy to assemble protein sequences with high robustness and accuracy. This strategy integrates multiple unspecific hydrolysis methods to minimize the bias in the hydrolysis process. After de novo identification of the peptides, our assembly algorithm, named Multiple Contigs & Scaffolding (MuCS), assembles the peptide sequences in a multistep, i.e., contig-scaffold manner, with error correction in each step. MS data from different hydrolysis experiments complement each other for robust contig extension and error correction. We demonstrated that our strategy on three proteins and three replications all reached 100% coverage (except one with 98.85%) and 98.69-100% accuracy. It can also efficiently deal with the membrane protein, although the transmembrane region was missing due to the limitation of the MS. The three replicates reached 88.85-92.57% coverage and 97.57-100% accuracy. In sum, we provided a practical, robust, and accurate solution for full-length protein sequencing.

In the present study, plant-synthesized secondary metabolites (PSMs) have been prioritized to make a review focusing on the efficacy of plant-originated therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19. Plant metabolites are a source of countless medicinal compounds, while the diversity of multidimensional chemical structures has made them superior to treat serious diseases. Some have already been reported as promising alternative medicines and lead compounds for drug repurposing and discovery. The versatility of secondary metabolites may provide novel antibiotics to tackle MDR (Multi-Drug Resistant) microbes too. This review attempted to find out plant metabolites that have the therapeutic potential to treat a wide range of viral pathogens. The study includes the search of remedies belonging to plant families, susceptible viral candidates, antiviral assays, and the mode of therapeutic action; this attempt resulted in the collection of an enormous number of natural therapeutics that might be suggested for the treatment of COVID-19.

The importance of global health diplomacy, especially at WHO, in keeping countries jointly committed to improving health for everyone, has once again been shown. Through a systematic review, this Series paper explores how international relations concepts and theories have been applied to better understand the role of power in shaping positions, negotiations, and outcomes in global health diplomacy. We apply an international relations perspective to reflect on the effect that those concepts and theories have had on global health diplomacy over the past two decades. This Series paper argues that a more central role of international relations concepts and theories in analysing global health diplomacy would help develop a more nuanced understanding of global health policy making.

The change of the average density of the droplet due to water evaporation is determined, up to the instant when the droplet reduces to its nucleus, consisting of salt and dry protein only. The numerical solution of the governing differential equations of droplet's motion gives the trajectories of different-sized droplets ejected at different velocities and angles, and under different relative humidities and rates of evaporation. The evaporation times are compared with the times for droplets to reach the ground after being ejected from a given height.

Substantial heterogeneity in decision making and the timing of those decisions as they relate to key state, national, and global emergency announcements were observed. The WHO pandemic declaration coincided with announcements to move away from on-campus learning. Universities decisions were made largely at the university level and not coordinated by government agencies, leading to staggered announcements and major variations in university timelines between states and within states. The importance of synchronizing university decisions in a national emergency scenario cannot be understated. Dissonant university decisions and announcement dates may potentially lead to mixed messaging and a reduction of the effectiveness of early interventions.

They also have other medical conditions that make them more likely to be immunocompromised and at risk of developing COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 public health emergency, national and provincial regulatory bodies introduced guidance and exemptions to mitigate the spread of the virus. Among them, clinical guidance for prescribers were issued to allow take home opioid medications for opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Take Home for injectable opioid agonist treatment (iOAT) is only considered within a restrictive regulatory structure, specific to the pandemic. Nevertheless, this risk mitigation guidance allowed carries, mostly daily dispensed, to a population that would not have access to it prior to the pandemic.

METHODS In phase 1, lesions were delivered using combinations of: (1) COAG and CUT; (2) active and flat orientation; and (3) polyurethane, silicone, and copolymer insulation. In phase 2, lesions were delivered using combinations of: (1) PlasmaBlade and PhotonBlade, (2) four power output levels, and (3) eight different lead models. Lead damage was scored on an ordinal scale of 0 to 4. RESULTS Phase 1: more leads were damaged using COAG than CUT (48% vs 2%, P < 0.0001). When using COAG, 74% of lesions using active orientation had damage versus 22% of lesions using flat orientation (P = 0.0002). COAG lesions to copolymer (61%) and polyurethane (68%) leads had greater damage than silicone (17%) (P = 0.006 and P = 0.003, respectively). Phase 2: 75% of treatments using PlasmaBlade had damage versus 40% of treatments with PhotonBlade (P < 0.0001). Higher power resulted in more damage.

OBJECTIVE SM is highly toxic to the respiratory system, leading to hacking cough, rhinorrheachest tightness, acute pharyngitis and laryngitis, chronic bronchitis and lung fibrosis. In this review, based on the scientific literature, we provide an updated summary of information on SM exposures and their differences with asthma and COPD. METHOD Information of this review was obtained by searching Medline/PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Google Scholar, ISI Web of Knowledge and Chemical Abstracts. RESULTS SM exposure can decrease pulmonary function tests (PFTs) values. In addition, inflammatory cell accumulation in the respiratory tract and increased expression of some pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor- (TNF), IL-1a, IL-1, and reactive oxygen radicals due to SM exposure have been shown. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) which degrade extracellular matrix proteins, contributing to inflammatory cell recruitment, tissue injury and fibrosis are also up-regulated in the lung after SM exposure. In the lung, SM exposure also can cause serious pathological changes including airway inflammation, parenchymal tissue destruction and airway obstruction which can lead to asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Following SM poisoning, DNA damage, apoptosis and autophagy are observed in the lung along with the increased expression of activated caspases and DNA repair enzymes. CONCLUSION In the present article, respiratory symptoms, changes in PFTs, lung pathology and lung inflammation due to SM exposure and the similarities and differences between them and those observed in asthma and COPD were reviewed.","output":"Respiratory effects of sulfur mustard exposure, similarities and differences with asthma and COPD."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Bangladesh, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have substantial effects on the livelihood of people, but smallholder vegetables growers will be even more affected because of the perishability nature of the product. The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Bangladesh on 8th March, 2020 and consequently the country went into lockdown on 26 March, 2020. This study has made a survey of vegetables farmers through a mobile phone to understand the impact of COVID-19 on vegetables supply chain, gross margin and the future production plan of the growers. In Bangladesh, the lockdown has disrupted the food supply chain and increases the likelihood of food insecurity. Lockdown has impeded vegetable farmers access to markets, thus limiting their productive and sales capacities. The price of yield has dropped by more than half resulting in huge loss for vegetable growers. The loss incurred by the farmers for producing Brinjal, Cucumber, Pointed gourd, Yardlong beans and Bottle gourd are BDT 4900, BDT 10900, BDT 57400, BDT 52500 and BDT 18500 per acre respectively as a result of COVID-19. The decreased income increases farmers likelihood of vulnerability and food insecurity and poses a challenge to continued produce.

To date, although a number of bioinformatics tools have been developed for location discovery of m6A modification, functional understanding is still quite limited. As the focus of RNA epigenetics gradually shifts from site discovery to functional studies, there is an urgent need for user-friendly tools to identify and explore the functional relevance of context-specific m6A methylation to gain insights into the epitranscriptome layer of gene expression regulation. RESULTS: We introduced here Funm6AViewer, a novel platform to identify, prioritize, and visualize the functional gene interaction networks mediated by dynamic m6A RNA methylation unveiled from a case control study. By taking the differential RNA methylation (DM) data and differential gene expression (DE) data, both of which can be inferred from the widely used MeRIP-seq data, as the inputs, Funm6AViewer enables a series of analysis, including: (1) examining the distribution of differential m6A sites, (2) prioritizing the genes mediated by dynamic m6A methylation, and (3) characterizing functionally the gene regulatory networks mediated by condition-specific m6A RNA methylation. Funm6AViewer should effectively facilitate the understanding of the epitranscriptome circuitry mediated by this reversible RNA modification.

METHODS A register-based study from the Swedish National Cataract Register (NCR) during the years 2015-2017 including 358 040 cataract procedures. Patients with other ocular pathology than cataract and DR were omitted from outcome analyses. RESULTS Diabetic retinopathy was reported in 13 724 of all eyes (3.8%). Preoperative BCVA was significantly worse in DR patients than in patients without DR, 0.54  0.33 compared to 0.40  0.27 (logMAR, mean  SD, p < 0.001). The same was evident for postoperative BCVA, 0.15  0.25 for DR patients versus 0.06  0.13 (p < 0.001). The improvement in BCVA was slightly better in DR than in non-DR, -0.40  0.32 (logMAR; mean  SD) versus -0.35  0.27, p < 0.001. The absolute mean biometry prediction error was 0.42  0.50 diopters (D) in DR and 0.43  0.71 D in non-DR patients, p = 0.768. One or more intraoperative difficulties, including mechanical pupil dilation, capsular stain, hooks at capsulorhexis margin or capsular tension ring, had an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.75 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.61-1.90, p < 0.001) in DR versus non-DR cases and the rate of posterior capsular tears (PCR) had an adjusted OR of 1.76 (95% CI 1.40-2.20, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Eyes with DR have inferior pre- and postoperative BCVA compared to non-DR eyes. There is little difference in improvement of BCVA and no difference in absolute mean biometry prediction error. Importantly, intraoperative difficulties and PCRs are almost twice as common in DR patients, strongly indicating that these patients should be managed by experienced surgeons.","output":"Outcome of cataract surgery in eyes with diabetic retinopathy: a Swedish national cataract register report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is essential for physicians and scientists to speak up to counter misinformation about COVID-19 amid a culture of fear.","output":"Courage in a climate of fear."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, many research teams have developed mechanical ventilation devices to overcome the critical situation for the health system In order to verify that a ventilator works properly a test lung is mandatory This paper presents a mechanical test lung solution for ventilator testing with variable elastance Different solutions for the test lung were tested and the one that provided the most accurate behavior of pulmonary mechanics was chosen A matehmatical model was build and the key parameters of the device obtained through simulation were compared with the ones obtained through physical testing The test lung was calibrated using high precision pressure and displacement sensors and it is equipped with a manometer and a volume needle indicator so that it can be used independent of the data acquisition system ?2020 IEEE","output":"Mechanical test lung simulation device"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Various vaccine platforms are geared against COVID-19 vaccine development to produce immunogens in cells.

Neurogenic inflammation was produced in the tracheas of 2 groups of Long-Evans rats by electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve (5 V, 1 ms, 20 Hz for 5 min) or by an injection of capsaicin (15 to 200 micrograms/kg i.v.) or substance P (0.05 to 5.0 micrograms/kg i.v.). Rats of one group were pathogen-free; the others had serologic evidence of naturally occurring airway infections caused by Sendai virus, coronavirus, and Mycoplasma pulmonis. The stimuli produced neurogenic inflammation in both groups of rats, but the magnitude of this inflammation was much greater in the infected rats. The susceptibility of the infected rats to neurogenic inflammation was manifested by a 2.0 to 3.1 times larger increase in vascular permeability to Monastral blue, 5 times larger increase in number of neutrophils adhering to the endothelium of venules, and conspicuous morphologic changes in the tracheal epithelium. When pathogen-free rats acquired respiratory tract infections, they too became susceptible to neurogenic inflammation. Other experiments showed that infection by Sendai virus was essential for the change, although infection by M. pulmonis or coronavirus may also be necessary. The susceptibility to neurogenic inflammation outlasted the transient pathologic changes caused in the airway mucosa by the viral infections and may have been permanent.","output":"Respiratory tract infections increase susceptibility to neurogenic inflammation in the rat trachea."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endothelial injury and microvascular/macrovascular thrombosis are common pathophysiological features of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).

We hypothesized that a dedicated Center for Trauma Survivorship (CTS) improves follow-up and facilitates post-discharge specialty care. METHODS: Retrospective study of \\"CTS eligible\\" trauma patients before (Jan - Dec 2017) and after (Jan - Dec 2019) creation of the CTS. Patients with an ICU stay 2 days or a New Injury Severity Score  16 are CTS eligible. The before (PRE) cohort was followed through Dec 2018 and the after (CTS) cohort through Dec 2020. Primary outcome was follow-up within the hospital system exclusive of mental health and rehabilitative therapy appointments. Secondary outcomes include post-discharge surgical procedures and specialty-specific follow-up. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in demographics or hospital duration in the PRE (n = 177) and CTS (n = 119) cohorts. Of the CTS group, 91% presented for outpatient follow-up within the hospital system, compared to 73% in the Pre group (p < 0.001). In the PRE cohort, only 39% were seen by the trauma service compared to 62% in the CTS cohort (p < 0.001). CTS patients also had increased follow-up with other providers (80% vs 65%; p = 0.006). Notably, 33% of CTS patients had additional surgery compared to only 20% in the PRE group (p = 0.011). CTS patients had over 20% more outpatient visits (1,280 vs 1,006 visits). CONCLUSION: Despite the follow-up period for the CTS cohort occurring during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, limiting availability of outpatient services, our CTS significantly improved follow-up with trauma providers, as well as with other specialties. The CTS patients also underwent significantly more secondary operations. These data demonstrate that creation of a CTS can improve the post-discharge care of severely injured trauma survivors, allowing for care coordination within the healthcare system, retaining patients, generating revenue and providing needed follow-up care.

Primary outcome included assessment of WSL with visual-tactile assessment and/or laser fluorescence measurements. Twenty-four studies with 1117 patients (age: 11-40 years) and 12,809 teeth were included. Overall, 34 different sealants or bonding materials were analysed. Fourteen studies analysed fluoride and 14 studies non-fluoride releasing materials. Meta-analysis for visual tactile assessment revealed that sealants significantly decreased the initiation of WSL compared to untreated control (RR [95%CI] = 0.70 [0.53; 0.93]; very low level of evidence). Materials releasing fluoride did not decrease initiation of WSL compared to those with no fluoride release (RR [95%CI] = 0.84 [0.70; 1.01]; very low level of evidence).

DESIGN: Population-based, cross-sectional household survey. SETTING: Urban, semiurban and rural communities of the Wakiso and Hoima districts in Uganda. PARTICIPANTS: A total of N=2014 males aged 13-80 years participated in the survey. The current study included males who reported having ever been in a sexual union and responded to the IPV questions (N=1314). MEASURES: Data were collected face-to-face from May 2018 to July 2019 using an interviewer-mediated questionnaire. Lifetime IPV perpetration was measured as 'no physical and/or sexual IPV', 'physical' versus 'sexual violence only', and 'physical and sexual violence'. Past-year food insecurity was measured through the Food Insecurity Experience Scale and categorised into 'none', 'low' and 'high'. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine the crude and adjusted relative risk ratios (aRRRs) of IPV perpetration in relation to self-reported food insecurity, adjusting for sociodemographic and health risk behaviours. RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported lifetime IPV perpetration was 14.6% for physical and 6.5% for sexual violence, while 5.3% reported to have perpetrated both physical and sexual IPV. Most (75.7%) males reported no food insecurity, followed by low (20.7%) and high (3.6%) food insecurity.

It has been suggested that correction of a high grade internal rectal prolapse (HIRP) is also worthwhile for patients with faecal incontinence. The aim of the present study is to compare the results of laparoscopic ventral rectopexy (LVR) in patients with faecal incontinence associated with either an ERP or a HIRP. METHOD Consecutive patients suffering from faecal incontinence, who underwent a LVR between June 2010 and October 2012, were identified from a prospective database. All patients underwent preoperative defaecating proctography, anorectal manometry and ultrasound. Symptoms were assessed preoperatively and at 1 year after operation using a standardized questionnaire incorporating the Faecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI; range 0-61) and the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI). RESULTS LVR was performed in 50 incontinent patients with a HIRP, and in 41 patients with an ERP. Preoperatively, the FISI was higher in patients with HIRP (HIRP 42 versus ERP 30, P < 0.01). The recurrence rate at 1 year was similar in both groups (HIRP 6 % versus ERP 2 %, P = 0.156). The FISI scores were significantly reduced in both groups (HIRP 48 % versus ERP 50 %, both P < 0.01). GIQLI was equally improved in both groups (HIRP 17 % versus ERP 18 %, both P < 0.01).

These data could be useful to improve the selection of patients for thrombectomy. METHODS Patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with the Solitaire FR device were retrospectively analyzed from a prospectively collected database. We assessed the effect of selected demographic characteristics, clinical and imaging factors on poor outcome at 3 months (modified Rankin score 3-6), mortality at 3 months, and hemorrhage at day 1 (symptomatic and asymptomatic). RESULTS From May 2010 to April 2012, 59 consecutive patients with an acute ischemic stroke underwent mechanical thrombectomy. At 3 months, 57.6% of the patients were functionally independent (modified Rankin Scale 0-2) and mortality was 20.4%. Multivariate analyses revealed that a thrombus length > 14 mm (p = 0.02; OR 7.55; 95% CI 1.35-42.31) and longer endovascular procedure duration (p = 0.01; OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01-1.07) were independently associated with poor outcome. A higher baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT (ASPECT) score (p = 0.04; OR 0.79 per point; 95% CI 0.63-0.99) and successful recanalization (p = 0.02; OR 0.07; 95% CI 0.01-0.72) were independent predictors of good functional outcome. Baseline ASPECT score (p < 0.01; OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.54-0.78) independently predicted symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage at day 1. CONCLUSION Absolute baseline ASPECT score reflects early symptomatic hemorrhage risk and functional outcome at 3 months. Thrombus length measured on MRI play an important role on functional outcome at 3 months after thrombectomy.

It consists of 12 questions covering domains of overload (4 questions), lack of development (4 questions), and neglect (4 questions). The questionnaire was sent to 500 dental students from the University of Sharjah (UOS) and Ajman University of Science and Technology (AUST). The association between burnout and sociodemographic variables was also investigated. RESULTS The majority of responders were females (74%). Socio-demographic and study characteristics of dental students from both universities were not remarkably different. However, the responses to the BCSQ-12-SS questions were not very different. In this study, there was no significant association between burnout and demographic variables, such as age, gender, relationships, distance from family, residency, year of study, studying hours, and number of failed subjects.

In phase 1, 60 participants received two intramuscular injection of the vaccine following dose-escalation procedure. The primary outcomes were reactogenicity and laboratory tests to evaluate the vaccine safety. In phase 2 which involved in 560 healthy adults, the primary outcomes are vaccine safety; and anti-S IgG antibody response. Secondary outcomes were surrogate virus neutralization, wild-type SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, and T-cell responses by intracellular staining (ICS) for interferon gamma (IFNg). We performed primary analyses at day 35 and day 42. Results For phase 1 study, no serious adverse events (SAE) were observed for all 60 participants. Most adverse events (AE) were grade 1 and disappeared shortly after injection. For phase 2 study, after randomization, 480 participants were assigned to receive the vaccine with adjuvant, and 80 participants were assigned to receive placebo. Reactogenicity was absent or mild in the majority of participants and of short duration (mean, []3 days). Unsolicited adverse events were mild in most participants. There were no serious adverse events related to Nanocovax. Regarding the immunogenicity, Nanocovax induced robust anti-S antibody responses. There was no statistical difference in antibody responses among dose strengths on Day 42, in terms of anti S-IgG level and neutralizing antibody titer. Conclusions Up to 42 days, Nanocovax vaccine was safe, well tolerated and induced robust immune responses. We propose using Nanocovax 25 mcg for Phase 3 to evaluate the vaccine efficacy.

OBJECTIVE To report initial experience with endovascular treatment of these aneurysms using flow-diverting stents (FDS). METHODS Ten patients with FDS treatment of complex vertebrobasilar junction aneurysms were collected from 4 large cerebrovascular centers. Clinical/angiographic presentation and outcome were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS Of 10 aneurysms, 7 presented with brainstem compression, 2 with ischemia, and 1 with subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 3 were recurrent after stent-assisted treatments. Eight were giant. Morphology was fusiform in 5, fusiform dissecting in 1, and multilobulated saccular in 4. Six were partially thrombosed. In addition to FDS (mean number of devices, 3.9; range, 1-9), contralateral vertebral artery sacrifice and adjunctive coiling were performed in 9 and 5 of the 10 patients, respectively. At follow-up, 5 of 10 were completely occluded, 4 showed minimal residual filling, and 1 was retreated with an additional FDS. Postinterventionally, worsening mass effect and ischemic complications were seen in 2 and 4 of 10, respectively. Clinical outcome was good in 6 (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2). Four fatalities were related to sequelae of subarachnoid hemorrhage, late FDS thrombosis, progressive mass effect, and delayed intracranial hemorrhage. CONCLUSION FDS may be used to treat complex vertebrobasilar junction aneurysms with overall good angiographic outcome. A combined reconstructive/deconstructive approach appears useful to avoid endoleaks. FDS strategies, like other endovascular and neurosurgical approaches to these lesions, are associated with significant risk and therefore should be reserved for those cases in which alternative approaches either are deemed unsafe or are likely to be ineffective.

Autopsies are rarely performed in LMICs but minimally invasive tissue sampling is increasingly deployed as a more feasible and acceptable procedure, although protocols have been devoid of intestinal sampling to date. We sought to determine (1) the feasibility of postmortem intestinal sampling, (2) whether autolysis precludes enteric biopsies utility, and (3) histopathologic features among children who died during hospitalization with acute illness or undernutrition. METHODS: Transabdominal needle and endoscopic forceps upper and lower intestinal sampling were conducted among children aged 1 week to 59 months who died while hospitalized in Blantyre, Malawi. Autolysis ratings were determined for each hematoxylin and eosin slide, and upper and lower intestinal scoring systems were adapted to assess histopathologic features and their severity. RESULTS: Endoscopic and transabdominal sampling procedures were attempted in 28 and 14 cases, respectively, with >90% success obtaining targeted tissue. Varying degrees of autolysis were present in all samples and precluded histopathologic scoring of 6% of 122 biopsies. Greater autolysis in duodenal samples was seen with longer postmortem interval (Beta = 0.06, 95% confidence interval, 0.02C0.11).

We aimed to explore HCC risk in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative patients with indeterminate phase and investigated whether the risk could be stratified by serum levels of hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg). METHODS Two retrospective cohorts enrolling HBeAg-negative, treatment-na?ve CHB patients without cirrhosis were constructed (N=2150 in Taiwanese discovery cohort and N=1312 in Japanese validation cohort with a mean follow-up period of 15.88 and 12.07 years, respectively). The primary endpoint was HCC development. RESULTS According to the AASLD guidelines, 990 (46%) HBeAg-negative patients had indeterminate CHB phase at baseline in the Taiwanese cohort. Compared to the patients with inactive CHB and those with immune-active CHB, the indeterminate patients had intermediate but diverse risk of HCC. When HCC risk was stratified by a HBcrAg level of 10,000 U/mL, 10-year HCC cumulative incidence was 0.51% and 5.33% for low- and high-HBcrAg groups, respectively, with hazard ratio of 4.47 (95% confidence interval: 2.62-7.63). This cutoff was validated to stratify HCC risk not only in different subgroup analyses but also in an independent Japanese cohort. Finally, the overall HBeAg-negative CHB patients could be simply re-classified into high- and low-risk groups by combining ALT, HBV DNA, and HBcrAg levels in both cohorts.

This study aimed to identify patients vulnerable to worsening mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective observational study used electronic health records from March 9 to May 31 in 2019 (n = 94,720) and 2020 (n = 94,589) in a large, community-based health care system. Percent change analysis compared variables standardized to the average patient population for the respective time periods. RESULTS: Compared to 2019, psychiatric visits increased significantly (P < .0001) in 2020, with the majority being telephone/video-based (+264%). Psychiatric care volume increased overall (7%), with the greatest increases in addiction (+42%), behavioral health in primary care (+17%), and adult psychiatry (+5%) clinics. While patients seeking care with preexisting psychiatric diagnoses were mainly stable (&#8722;2%), new patients declined (&#8722;42%). Visits for substance use (+51%), adjustment (+15%), anxiety (+12%), bipolar (+9%), and psychotic (+6%) disorder diagnoses, and for patients aged 18-25 years (+4%) and 26-39 years (+4%), increased. Child/adolescent and older adult patient visits decreased (&#8722;22.7% and &#8722;5.5%, respectively), and fewer patients identifying as White (&#8722;3.8%) or male (&#8722;5.0) or with depression (&#8722;3%) or disorders of childhood (&#8722;2%) sought care. CONCLUSIONS: The early COVID-19 pandemic was associated with dramatic changes in psychiatric care facilitated by a rapid telehealth care transition. Patient volume, demographic, and diagnostic changes may reflect comfort with telehealth or navigating the psychiatric care system.

We describe a universal vaccine cell (UVC) rationally designed to mimic the natural physiologic immunity induced post viral infection of host cells. Induced pluripotent stem cells were CRISPR engineered to delete MHC-I expression and simultaneously overexpress a NK Ligand adjuvant to increase rapid cellular apoptosis which was hypothesized to enhance viral antigen presentation in the resulting immune microenvironment leading to a protective immune response. Cells were further engineered to express the parental variant WA1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a representative viral antigen prior to irradiation and cryopreservation. The cellular vaccine was then used to immunize non-human primates in a standard 2-dose, IM injected prime + boost vaccination with 1e8 cells per 1 ml dose resulting in robust neutralizing antibody responses (1e3 nAb titers) with decreasing levels at 6 months duration. Similar titers generated in this established NHP model have translated into protective human neutralizing antibody levels in SARS-Cov-2 vaccinated individuals. Animals vaccinated with WA1/2020 spike antigens were subsequently challenged with 1.0  105 TCID50 infectious Delta (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 in a heterologous challenge which resulted in an approximately 3-log order decrease in viral RNA load in the lungs. These heterologous viral challenge results reflect the ongoing real-world experience of original variant WA1/2020 spike antigen vaccinated populations exposed to rapidly emerging variants like Delta and now Omicron.

Infection, hepatorenal syndrome and complications can further aggravate coagulopathy, resulting in DIC and seriously affecting patient prognosis. 3. Hepatorenal syndrome, which is characterized by renal failure, hemodynamic changes in arterial circulation and abnormalities in the endogenous vascular system, is a common clinical complication of end-stage liver disease, and one of the important indicators for the prognosis of patients with severe hepatitis. 4. Water electrolyte disorder (water retention, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hyperkalaemia) and acid-base imbalance are common in patients with severe hepatitis.

Baricitinib, a janus kinases inhibitor, can potentially suppress inflammatory cascades in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: The objective of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of high dose of baricitinib with its usual dose in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. This prospective cohort study was conducted on 238 adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Eight milligram and 4 mg of baricitinib was given orally to 122 patients in the high dose (HD) group and 116 patients the usual dose (UD) group, respectively daily for 14 days, and clinical outcomes were compared among the groups. RESULTS: Blood oxygen saturation level was stabilized (94% on room air) earlier in the HD group compared to the UD group [5 (IQR: 4C5)/8 (IQR: 6C9), P < 0.05]. Patients in the HD group required intensive care unit (ICU) and intubation supports more in the UD group than that in patients of the HD group [17.2%/9%, P < 0.05; 11.2%/4.1%, P > 0.05; N = 116/122, respectively].

The COVID 19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is mitigated by several non-pharmaceutical interventions, but it is hard to predict which of these regulations are the most effective for a given population. Methods We developed a computationally effective and scalable, agent-based microsimulation framework. This unified framework was fitted to realistic data to enable us to test control measures (closures, quarantining, testing, vaccination) in multiple infection waves caused by the spread of a new virus variant in a city-sized societal environment. Our framework is capable of simulating nine billion agent steps per minute, allowing us to model interactions in populations with up to 90 million individuals. Findings We show that vaccination strategies prioritising occupational risk groups minimise the number of infections but allow higher mortality while prioritising vulnerable groups minimises mortality but implies increased infection rate. We also found that intensive vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions can substantially suppress the spread of the virus, while low levels of vaccination and premature reopening may easily revert the epidemic to an uncontrolled state. Interpretation Our analysis highlights that while vaccination protects the elderly from COVID-19, a large percentage of children will contract and spread the virus, and we also show the benefits and limitations of various quarantine and testing scenarios.

This preliminary study focused only on Y-BOCS to assess clinician-rated severity of OCD. Y-BOCS scores were compared from different time periods correlating to the progression of COVID-19. Pre-pandemic score was taken from JanCDec 2019 or, if not available, from JanC23 March 2020 (prior to UK lockdown). Pandemic score was taken as the most recent rating from April 2020 onwards.Result21 patients were included. All treated as outpatients (although 9 had undergone previous inpatient treatment during the time period above). 81% showed improvement in Y-BOCS score between pre-pandemic and pandemic time periods, with an overall mean decrease in Y-BOCS of 10.3.ConclusionOverall, this study indicates that severity of OCD decreased during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic. It may be that patients found it easier to access remote appointments, or perhaps the pandemic environment of being encouraged to stay at home and limiting unnecessary contact may have allowed limited opportunity for exposure. It might be that the pandemic provided a reason for patients to be avoidant of potential contamination thereby leading to a perceived rather than real improvement in Y-BOCS scores.Identification of specific contributing factors is beyond the scope of this preliminary study, however it will be important to conduct further research with a larger sample size that incorporates post-lockdown and post-pandemic scores to ascertain whether trends seen here are in fact maintained when normal social contact resumes.","output":"A preliminary study into the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores of patients with obsessive compulsive disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Dyslipidemia poses a high risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke in Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). There are no studies on the impact of a validated integrated yoga lifestyle protocol on lipid profiles in a high-risk diabetes population. Methods: Here, we report the results of lipid profile values of 11,254 (yoga 5932 and control 5322) adults (20C70 years) of both genders with high risk (60 on Indian diabetes risk score) for diabetes from a nationwide rural and urban community-based two group (yoga and conventional management) cluster randomized controlled trial.

However, substantial gaps in complete vaccination coverage persist. We aimed to describe caregivers immunisation experiences and identify determinants of vaccine dropout. DESIGN: We used a community-based participatory research approach employing Photovoice, SMS (short messaging service) exchanges and in-depth interviews. A team-based approach was used for thematic analysis. The Increasing Vaccination Model guided the analysis and identification of vaccination facilitators and barriers. SETTING: This study was conducted in Zambzia province, Mozambique, in Namarroi and Gil districts, where roughly 19% of children under 2 start but do not complete the recommended vaccination schedule. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were identified through health facility vaccination records and included caregivers of children aged 25C34 months who were fully vaccinated (n=10) and partially vaccinated (n=22). We also collected data from 12 health workers responsible for delivering immunisations at the selected health facilities. RESULTS: Four main patterns of barriers leading to dropout emerged: (1) social norms and limited family support place the immunisation burden on mothers; (2) perceived poor quality of health services reduces caregivers trust in vaccination services; (3) concern about side effects causes vaccine hesitancy; and (4) caregivers hesitate to seek and advocate for vaccination due to power imbalances with health workers. COVID-19 created additional barriers related to social distancing, mask requirements, supply chain challenges and disrupted outreach services. For most caregivers, dropout becomes increasingly likely with compounding barriers. Caregivers of fully-vaccinated children noted facilitators, including accompaniment to health facilities or assistance caring for other children, which enabled them to complete vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Overcoming immunisation barriers requires strengthening health systems, including improving logistics to avert vaccine stockouts and building health worker capacity, including empathic communication with caregivers. Consistent and reliable immunisation outreach services could address access challenges and improve immunisation uptake, particularly in distant communities.","output":"Determinants of immunisation dropout among children under the age of 2 in Zambzia province, Mozambique: a community-based participatory research study using Photovoice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SOURCE CITATION: WHO Rapid Evidence Appraisal for COVID-19 Therapies (REACT) Working Group; Shankar-Hari M, Vale CL, Godolphin PJ, et al.

Despite well-documented occupational exposure risks, however, there is evidence of lower uptake among some H&SCW groups. METHODS: We used a mixed-methods approachinvolving an online cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interviewsCto gain insight into COVID-19 vaccination beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours amongst H&SCWs in the UK by socio-demographic and employment variables. 1917 people were surveyedC 1656 healthcare workers (HCWs) and 261 social care workers (SCWs). Twenty participants were interviewed. FINDINGS: Workplace factors contributed to vaccination access and uptake. SCWs were more likely to not be offered COVID-19 vaccination than HCWs (OR:1.453, 95%CI: 1.244C1.696). SCWs specifically reported uncertainties around how to access COVID-19 vaccination. Participants who indicated stronger agreement with the statement I would recommend my organisation as a place to work were more likely to have been offered COVID-19 vaccination (OR:1.285, 95%CI: 1.056C1.563). Those who agreed more strongly with the statement I feel/felt under pressure from my employer to get a COVID-19 vaccine were more likely to have declined vaccination (OR:1.751, 95%CI: 1.271C2.413). Interviewees that experienced employer pressure to get vaccinated felt this exacerbated their vaccine concerns and increased distrust. In comparison to White British and White Irish participants, Black African and Mixed Black African participants were more likely to not be offered (OR:2.011, 95%CI: 1.026C3.943) and more likely to have declined COVID-19 vaccination (OR:5.550, 95%CI: 2.294C13.428). Reasons for declining vaccination among Black African participants included distrust in COVID-19 vaccination, healthcare providers, and policymakers. CONCLUSION: H&SCW employers are in a pivotal position to facilitate COVID-19 vaccination access, by ensuring staff are aware of how to get vaccinated and promoting a workplace environment in which vaccination decisions are informed and voluntary.","output":"COVID-19 vaccination beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours among health and social care workers in the UK: A mixed-methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The case of a 51-year-old man with a large temporal mass is presented.

METHODS: We describe a cohort of critically ill patients during the first two months of the pandemic (from March 3, 2020, to May 2, 2020) in HUVH, Barcelona. In this manuscript, we report our previsions, strategies implemented, and the outcomes obtained. RESULTS: Three-thousand and thirty-three patients were admitted to the HUVH Critical Care Units. Throughout the study period, the proportion of patients on IMV or IMV and ECMO remained above 78%. Most patients were men (65%); the most common age group was 60-70 years. Twenty-three patients received ECMO, and eighteen were cannulated at another center and transferred to HUVH. At the end of the study, fourteen patients were successfully decannulated, three patients died, and the rest of the patients were still on ECMO. Eight pregnant women have been treated in the ICU, with a survival rate of 100%. The ICU mortality of patients younger than 60 years was 3.2%. The mean ICU stay of both survivors and nonsurvivors was 14 days.

The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) which served as an important component of cellular signal transduction pathways has been shown to regulate many viral infections. In this report, we show that PCV2 activates ERK1/2 in PCV2-infected PK15 cells dependent on viral replication. The PCV2-induced ERK1/2 leads to phosphorylation of the ternary complex factor Elk-1, which kinetically paralleled ERK1/2 activation. Inhibition of ERK activation with U0126, a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor, significantly reduced viral progeny release. Investigations into the mechanism of ERK1/2 regulation revealed that inhibition of ERK activation leads to decreased viral transcription and lower virus protein expression. These data indicate that the ERK signaling pathway is involved in PCV2 infection and beneficial to PCV2 replication in the cultured cells.","output":"Porcine circovirus type 2 replication is impaired by inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Decision-making in surgery is one of the great unspoken challenges, an important but markedly challenging skill that takes a lifetime to master.

Increased prevalence of myopia and new strategies for myopia management have raised the prospect of various interventions, including contact lenses for therapeutic use as well as for refractive correction. More personnel skilled in contact lens fitting will be needed to address potential worldwide demand for these interventions. This review investigates the current status and future requirements of global contact lens education in light of these developments. The COVD-19 pandemic led educational institutions worldwide to move towards online delivery. An online survey among 546 educators, conducted in May 2020, investigated changes to contact lens education delivery before and after the onset of the pandemic. A total of 214 responses were received from 32 countries. Prior to COVID-19 restrictions, 23% of educators had conducted more than 50% of their total teaching online; however, 69% expected to conduct more than half of their teaching online by the end of 2020 and 12% anticipated 90% or more of their teaching would be online. Some 76% of educators expected to provide more online lectures after the pandemic and 63% anticipated new methods to deliver practical education. Around half were planning to introduce new teaching online platforms (54%) and more online assessment methods (53%). The global need for increasing numbers of skilled personnel points to a crucial role for educators in teaching the contact lens practitioners of the future. Contact lens education delivery was already evolving prior to COVID-19, and changes that are currently occurring may lead to permanent differences in the way contact lenses are taught in future. The International Association of Contact Lens Educators (IACLE) provides educators with a standardised global curriculum, online resources and teaching technology that could also serve as a model for wider ophthalmic education in future.","output":"Contact lens education for the practitioners of the future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the demographic profile and clinical case mix of older adults following calls for an emergency ambulance in rural Victoria, Australia.

The actual crop transpiration rate, which is measured using a load cell, and the weight changes calculated at 10-min intervals, are applied to the development of the transpiration model. The experimental results show that the transpiration rate has no linear relationship with the radiation amount (Rad) or vapor pressure deficit (VPD). The relationship between Rad and VPD with transpiration rate was fitted by the exponential rise to maximum, and gaussian peak curve, respectively. This allowed a transpiration model to be developed by compensating the Rad and VPD based on the existing Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation.

Early case series with the use of ECMO in these patients reported high mortality exceeding 90%. METHODS: Using ICD-10 codes, data of patients with COVID-19 with ARDS, managed with ECMO between April - September 2020 were analyzed using the Vizient clinical database. Outcomes measured included in-hospital mortality, hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS) and direct cost. For comparative purposes, the outcome of a subset of COVID-19 patients aged between 18-64ayears and managed with vs. without ECMO were examined. RESULTS: 1,1182 patients with COVID-19 and ARDS received ECMO. In-hospital mortality was 45.9%, mean LOS was 36.8aa24.9adays and mean ICU stay was 29.1aa17.3adays. In-hospital mortality, according to age group was 25.2% for 1-30ayears; 42.2% for 31-50ayears; 53.2% for 51-64ayears; and 73.7% for &#8805;65ayears.

Our exemplary case study is part of a larger project studying the influence of centralization on the use of medicinal plants. We examined the current and past plant use of two small communities that reside on the border with Russia and speak two dialects of Estonian, namely Seto and V?ro. Our results show that within the lifetime of the people we interviewed, many earlier known uses were abandoned and new uses were strongly influenced by knowledge disseminated through centralized channels. Many such uses have also been recorded in geographically distant regions that once belonged to the Soviet Union. This demonstrates the homogenizing influence of centralized knowledge distribution, which has eroded place-based biocultural diversity. In order to secure the survival of knowledge on how to use locally grown plants, we suggest that more attention on the regional level needs to be given to preserving and supporting the distribution of such place-specific knowledge. ABSTRACT: When studying the evolution of the use of medicinal plants, it is important to identify what role, and to what extent, external factors and local biocultural diversities play in shaping cultural changes. We chose as a case study, which forms part of a larger project, a religiously and linguistically distinct group, the Seto, and compared their current and past plant use with that of the surrounding V?ro. Ethnobotanical fieldwork was conducted in the summers of 2018 and 2019. Current uses of plants constituted 34% of the total registered use reports and 41% of those were used to treat general diseases or used as prophylactics. In total, the medicinal use of 86 taxa was recorded, and of these 48 were prevalent. Strong erosion (the abandonment of 43, mainly wild taxa used historically) and valorisation of the uses shared with neighboring as well as distant regions once part of the Soviet Union, were evident, signalling the potential influence of the centralised distribution of knowledge. The results clearly show that the plant medicine-related biocultural diversities of the two groups have been considerably homogenised, eroded and influenced by the knowledge spread through various means during the Soviet era and over the last 30 years.","output":"Homogenisation of Biocultural Diversity: Plant Ethnomedicine and Its Diachronic Change in Setomaa and V?romaa, Estonia, in the Last Century"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a significant number of cracks in the current vigilance techniques that stand to minimise outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2. There is a serious inadequacy of the testing capacity of healthcare systems worldwide, which can be attributed to the lack of appropriate testing and monitoring methods for a disease such as COVID-19. The current tools in use for COVID-19 surveillance are either expensive, not applicable to large populations or yield results after the outbreak has already occurred. The immense contagiousness in combination with a wealth of asymptomatic carriers means that RT-PCR testing is not feasible on a mass scale. It is evident that new methods are required for the monitoring of COVID-19 and a range of new epidemiological tools must be implemented if public health systems worldwide want to make relevant predictions on the patterns of disease spread and increase the efficacy of their decisions.

METHODS: A total of 337 subjects were recruited via convenience sampling from the oncology departments of five general hospitals in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. They were invited to complete a survey that included demographic characteristics, the Profession Quality of life Scale, the Brief Cope Questionnaire, and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. RESULTS: The findings showed medium levels of compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress among oncology healthcare professionals in China, reaching rates of 78.34%, 63.50% and 75.96%, respectively. Multiple regression analyses suggested that active coping, positive reframing, and strength were the significant factors of compassion satisfaction, explaining 48.6% of the total variance (P ?< ?0.001). Substance use and self-blame were the significant factors of burnout, explaining 45.1% of the total variance (P ?< ?0.001). Venting, denial, substance use, self-blame, and strength were the significant factors of secondary traumatic stress, explaining 37.6% of the total variance (P ?< ?0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of compassion fatigue warrants the attention of the hospitals senior management.

Some studies argue that high-density urban centers are more vulnerable to infectious diseases due to a higher chance of infection in crowded urban environments. Other studies, however, argue that connectivity rather than population density plays a more significant role in the spread of COVID-19. While several studies have examined the role of urban density and connectivity in Europe and the U.S., few studies have been conducted in Asian countries. This study aims to investigate the role of urban spatial structure on COVID-19 by comparing different measures of urban density and connectivity during the first eight months of the outbreak in Korea. Two measures of density were derived from the Korean census, and four measures of connectivity were computed using social network analysis of the Origin-Destination data from the 2020 Korea Transport Database. We fitted both OLS and negative binomial models to the number of confirmed COVID-19 patients and its infection rates at the county level, collected individually from regional government websites in Korea. Results show that both density and connectivity play an important role in the proliferation of the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea. However, we found that the connectivity measure, particularly a measure of network centrality, was a better indicator of COVID-19 proliferation than the density measures. Our findings imply that policies that take into account different types of connectivity between cities might be necessary to contain the outbreak in the early phase.","output":"Density or Connectivity: What Are the Main Causes of the Spatial Proliferation of COVID-19 in Korea?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 3C-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19. Importantly, it has an abundance of structural information solved as a complex with various drug candidate compounds. Collecting these crystal structures (83 Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries) together with those of the highly homologous 3CLpro of SARS-CoV (101 PDB entries), we constructed the crystal structure ensemble of 3CLpro to analyze the dynamic regulation of its catalytic function. The structural dynamics of the 3CLpro dimer observed in the ensemble were characterized by the motions of four separate loops (the C-loop, E-loop, H-loop, and Linker) and the C-terminal domain III on the rigid core of the chymotrypsin fold. Among the four moving loops, the C-loop (also known as the oxyanion binding loop) causes the order (active)-disorder (collapsed) transition, which is regulated cooperatively by five hydrogen bonds made with the surrounding residues. The C-loop, E-loop, and Linker constitute the major ligand binding sites, which consist of a limited variety of binding residues including the substrate binding subsites. Ligand binding causes a ligand size dependent conformational change to the E-loop and Linker, which further stabilize the C-loop via the hydrogen bond between the C-loop and E-loop. The T285A mutation from SARS-CoV 3CLpro to SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro significantly closes the interface of the domain III dimer and allosterically stabilizes the active conformation of the C-loop via hydrogen bonds with Ser1 and Gly2; thus, SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro seems to have increased activity relative to that of SARS-CoV 3CLpro.","output":"Allosteric regulation of 3CL protease of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV observed in the crystal structure ensemble"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE Complications from COVID-19 vaccines have yet to be sufficiently analyzed because they are rapidly approved without long-term data.

PATIENT CONCERNS A 79-year-old woman with pitting edema in both lower legs after administration of a second dose of Pfizer vaccine was referred to our clinic. In the absence of clinical evidence of swelling during the laboratory evaluation, we suspected deep vein thrombosis. However, ultrasonographic findings revealed no evidence of venous thrombosis or varicose veins. DIAGNOSIS On the basis of lymphoscintigraphy, the patient was diagnosed with transient lymphedema with decreased lymphatic transport in both lower extremities. INTERVENTION The patient received intensive physiotherapy, including complex decongestive physiotherapy and pneumatic pump compression, to improve the lymphatic circulation. Furthermore, the patient was trained to apply a multilayer compressive bandage to the lower extremities. OUTCOMES At 2 months follow-up after rehabilitative treatment, the patient's symptoms improved without recurring lymphedema.

As dry air flows over SoCals coastal ranges on its way from the elevated Great Basin down to sea level, all SAWs warm adiabatically. Many but not all SAWs produce coastal heat events. The strongest regionally averaged SAWs tend to be cold. In fact, some of the hottest and coldest observed temperatures in coastal SoCal are linked to SAWs. We show that hot and cold SAWs are produced by distinct synoptic dynamics. High-amplitude anticyclonic flow around a blocking high pressure aloft anchored at the California coast produces hot SAWs. Cold SAWs result from anticyclonic Rossby wave breaking over the northwestern U.S. Hot SAWs are preceded by warming in the Great Basin and dry conditions across the Southwestern U.S. Precipitation over the Southwest, including SoCal, and snow accumulation in the Great Basin usually precede cold SAWs. Both SAW flavors, but especially the hot SAWs, yield low relative humidity at the coast. Although cold SAWs tend to be associated with the strongest winds, hot SAWs tend to last longer and preferentially favor wildfire growth. Historically, out of large (> 100 acres) SAW-spread wildfires, 90% were associated with hot SAWs, accounting for 95% of burned area. As health impacts of SAW-driven coastal fall, winter and spring heat waves and impacts of smoke from wildfires have been recently identified, our results have implications for designing early warning systems.

We evaluated COVID-19 incidence among our hemodialysis patients and investigated the most probable immune mechanisms against COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Baskent University has 21 dialysis centers across Turkey, with 2420 patients on hemodialysis and 30 on peritoneal dialysis. Among these, we retrospectively evaluated 602 patients (257 female/345 male) with chronic renal failure receiving hemodialysis as renal replacement therapy; 7 patients (1.1%) were infected with SARS-CoV-2. We retrospectively collected patient demographic characteristics, clinical data, and immunological factors affecting the clinical course of the disease. We divided patients into groups and included 2 control groups (individuals with normal renal functions): group I included COVID-19-positive patients with normal renal function, group II included COVID-19-positive hemodialysis patients, group III included COVID-19-negative hemodialysis patients, and group IV included COVID-19-negative patients with normal renal function. Lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood and typing of human leukocyte antigens were analyzed in all groups, with killer cell immunoglobulin like receptor genes analyzed only in COVID-19-positive patients and healthy controls. RESULTS: No deaths occurred among the 7 COVID-19-positive hemodialysis patients. Group I patients were significantly older than patients in groups II and III (P = .039, P = .030, respectively) but not significantly different from group IV (P = .060). Absolute counts of natural killer cells in healthy controls were higherthan in other groups (but not significantly). ActivatedT cells were significantly increased in both COVID-19-positive groups versus COVID-19-negative groups. Groups showed significant differences in C and DQ loci with respect to distribution of alleles in both HLA classes.

This is a case of acute hydrogen peroxide induced pneumonitis initially masquerading as Covid-19 pneumonia. An 82-year-old male with a pertinent history of diastolic heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presented with worsening dyspnea and morning hemoptysis. He endorsed a COVID-19 exposure two weeks previously. Upon initial evaluation, he was afebrile and hemodynamically normal, with tachypnea and requiring 6 liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain spo2&gt; 88%. Pulmonary auscultation revealed clear breath sounds and no signs of fluid overload were evident on the remainder of the physical exam. The initial chest x-ray and CT imaging demonstrated multifocal, bilateral, hazy consolidations with increased interstitial markings concerning for COVID-19 pneumonia. Pertinent lab results revealed negative COVID-19 and viral respiratory PCR results, and respiratory cultures with no growth of pathogenic bacteria. An echocardiogram revealed new systolic dysfunction with a reduced ejection fraction of 35-40%. The patient continued to have severe dyspnea and hypoxemia despite treatment for heart failure, COPD, and bacterial pneumonia consisting of diuretics, bronchodilators, and antibiotics. On further interview the patient recounted mixing hydrogen peroxide in his CPAP humidifier for the previous week before admission, based on a friend's advice in preventing COVID-19. The patient was subsequently initiated on systemic glucocorticoid therapy and had significant improvement in hypoxemia and dyspnea and oxygen requirements decreased from 6L to 2L nasal cannula at time of discharge. In light of the recent influential media attention and fear, cleaning products such as bleach have received disproportionate attention in the killing of the COVID-19 virus. Similarly, hydrogen peroxide is used as a disinfectant, which was intentionally inhaled in large amounts and over a one-week duration in this case. Prior case reports describe environmental and occupational exposure over 3-5 years developing into a non-specific interstitial pneumonia pattern.

The only possible way to stop transmission of SARS-COV-2 is to take safety precautions including use of facemask. With the ever-increasing concern on the disease, it is necessary to choose facemask components to achieve the performance as good as commercially available N95 masks in a cost-effective way. This investigation compares the effectiveness of five different 3-layered masks with N95 mask in terms of pressure drop and aerosol filtration capabilities. Different combinations of cotton, polypropylene fabric, tissue and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) were used as mask materials.

The frequency of published news is an indicator of the various levels of a problem. The more attention paid by a newspaper to the community, the more valuable it is in reporting problems. Currently, news related to the COVID-19 outbreak is most popular. The media has been reporting not only on health but also on social and economic issues during the pandemic. The questions of this research are (1) what social issues were reported in the online news media during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) what economic issues were reported in the online news media during the same period. This study aims to identify the content of news when conveying COVID-19 pandemic information based on the frequency of appearance and news content based on social and economic issues in online news. This is a descriptive quantitative study using a content analysis approach to obtain primary data from 6,376 online news articles published by Antara News from 28 February to 8 April 2020. The NVivo 12 tool was used to analyse the data by dividing the types of COVID-19 issues related to social and economic issues in the news (in the form of text, images, videos and graphics) as an analysis unit. The results showed that Antara News used text, photos, videos and graphics 1,847 times for social issues and 2,701 times for economic issues related to COVID-19. The social issues involved 20 themes. Some of the important ones included regulations, social funds and charities, the humanities, the availability of infrastructure facilities, education, instruction and appeal, and culture and religion. Meanwhile, the economic issues involved 52 themes. Some of the important ones included exchange rates; transportation; the oil, natural gas and electricity industries; social funds and charities; regulation and policy; agriculture; and the tourism industry. The topics are related to social distancing, social restrictions, social actions, culture, other problems associated with the social sector (a decline in community purchasing power, consumption and dismissal) and the real and massive impact on economic growth. COVID-19 is not only a global health crisis but also a major labour market and economic crisis that has had a significant impact on society.

The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of helminthes in pig production, as well as factors influencing their prevalence in Menoua, Western Highlands of Cameroon. Thus, 597 fecal samples from 100 farms of three production types (farrower, grower, and farrow-to-finish) were collected together with data on farmer and management characteristics. Samples were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. Eggs of eight helminthes were identified: Hyostrongylus rubidus (81.10%, 50-550 epg), Strongyloides ransomi (34.5%, 50-150 epg), Trichostrongylus sp. (28.1%, 50-650 epg), Ascaris suum (11.6%, 50-200 epg), Metastrongylus sp. (10.4%, 50-250 epg), Oesophagostomum dentatum (5.7%, 50-150 epg), Trichuris suis (4.0%, 50-150 epg), and Macracanthorhynchus hirudinaceus (0.2%, 50-50 epg). The overall prevalence was 89.3% (533 out of 597). Single infestations were 30.2%, while mixed infestations were 59.1%. A. suum, S. ransomi, and strongyles (H. rubidus, Trichostrongylus sp., Metastrongylus sp., and O. dentatum) were found in almost all age groups but the prevalence of A. suum increased with the growing age to drop in older animals. H. rubidus was found in all farm types followed by S. ransomi in farrower and farrow-to-finish farms. The other parasites were present only in farrow-to-finish farms. Coccidia parasites were also found including Isospora suis (26.30%, 50-12500 oocysts per gram of feces (opg)) and Eimeria spp. (1.40%, 100-100 opg). The risk of infestation for some parasites was lower with increasing herd size, high education level of farmers, and in wooden piggeries and semipermanent structures. The infestation risk was higher for all the investigated parasites for pigs escaping the pens. The overall significance of these parasites on growth and reproduction of the naturally infested pigs deserve assessment. Necropsy studies to confirm the worm burden are needed.

This study aimed to evaluate changes in food ordering patterns among youths in China after the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS The data were obtained from a national retrospective survey (COINLICS) conducted in early May 2020 via social media platforms in China among more than 10,000 youth participants at 3 educational levels. Participants reported their basic sociodemographic characteristics, weight status, and lifestyles including food ordering patterns. We described and compared their weight status and food ordering patterns before COVID-19 (January) and under lockdown (February). RESULTS We observed significant changes in youths' weight status and food ordering patterns under lockdown. A significant increase was observed in the prevalence of overweight/obesity (13.5%-17.0%) and obesity (8.7-10.8%), which varied by sex and educational level. Overall, the average weekly frequency of food ordering among the Chinese students had declined, with the largest decrease seen among graduate students, followed by undergraduate and high/vocational school students. Regardless of types of food, the percentage of participating youths who started ordering under lockdown was all lower than that of youths who stopped ordering. Among those who had still ordered foods under lockdown, a larger percentage of female than male high/vocational school students ordered barbecue/grill and cakes/pastries; no significant differences were found across the educational levels. CONCLUSION The participating youths' food ordering patterns had significantly changed during the COVID-19 lockdown, with heterogeneities observed to different extents between sexes and across educational levels. Our findings would inform policy makers and health professionals of these changes in time, for better policy making and public health practice.","output":"Impacts of COVID-19 Lockdown on Food Ordering Patterns among Youths in China: The COVID-19 Impact on Lifestyle Change Survey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Noncompliance with social distancing during the early stage of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a great challenge to the public health system. These noncompliance behaviors partly reflect people's concerns for the inherent costs of social distancing while discounting its public health benefits. We propose that this oversight may be associated with the limitation in one's mental capacity to simultaneously retain multiple pieces of information in working memory (WM) for rational decision making that leads to social-distancing compliance. We tested this hypothesis in 850 United States residents during the first 2 wk following the presidential declaration of national emergency because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that participants' social-distancing compliance at this initial stage could be predicted by individual differences in WM capacity, partly due to increased awareness of benefits over costs of social distancing among higher WM capacity individuals. Critically, the unique contribution of WM capacity to the individual differences in social-distancing compliance could not be explained by other psychological and socioeconomic factors (e.g., moods, personality, education, and income levels). Furthermore, the critical role of WM capacity in social-distancing compliance can be generalized to the compliance with another set of rules for social interactions, namely the fairness norm, in Western cultures. Collectively, our data reveal contributions of a core cognitive process underlying social-distancing compliance during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting a potential cognitive venue for developing strategies to mitigate a public health crisis.","output":"Working memory capacity predicts individual differences in social-distancing compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SMEs are significantly affected by COVID\\\\19 crisis as they overrepresent hardest\\\\hit sectors such as retail, hospitality, food services, entertainment services, and construction.

Effects that go beyond lipid-lowering actions have been suggested to contribute to their beneficial pharmacological properties. Whether and how statins act on macrophages has been a matter of debate. In the present study, we aimed at characterizing the impact of statins on macrophage polarization and comparing these to the effects of bempedoic acid, a recently registered drug for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, which has been suggested to have a similar beneficial profile but fewer side effects. Treatment of primary murine macrophages with two different statins, i.e., simvastatin and cerivastatin, impaired phagocytotic activity and, concurrently, enhanced pro-inflammatory responses upon short-term lipopolysaccharide challenge, as characterized by an induction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL) 1, and IL6. In contrast, no differences were observed under long-term inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) conditions, and neither inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression nor nitric oxide production was altered. Statin treatment led to extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) activation, and the pro-inflammatory statin effects were abolished by ERK inhibition. Bempedoic acid only had a negligible impact on macrophage responses when compared with statins. Taken together, our data point toward an immunomodulatory effect of statins on macrophage polarization, which is absent upon bempedoic acid treatment.","output":"Statins and Bempedoic Acid: Different Actions of Cholesterol Inhibitors on Macrophage Activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Growth factor receptors are known to be involved in the process of viral infection Many viruses not only use growth factor receptors to physically attach to the cell surface and internalize, but also divert receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in order to replicate Thus, repurposing drugs that have initially been developed to target growth factor receptors and their signaling in cancer may prove to be a fast track to effective therapies against emerging new viral infections, including the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)","output":"The role of growth factor receptors in viral infections: An opportunity for drug repurposing against emerging viral diseases such as COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN Objetivo: La infeccin por covid-19 requiere un diagnstico temprano, siendo la PCR la prueba gold estndar.

Objective: Covid-19 infection requires early diagnosis, with PCR being the gold standard test. The protocols advocate the use of rapid antigenic tests that require evaluation in actual clinical practice. The objective was to evaluate the diagnostic test for rapid antigen detection, Panbio Covid rapid test, compared with PCR, in patients with symptoms of 5 or less days of evolution and with a high suspicion of infection by covid-19 in a health center. Materials and Methods: 103 patients over 14 years of age who attended an urban health center located in the Usera District of Madrid, with high suspicion of covid-19 infection, in the first 5 days of evolution from the onset of symptoms during the month of November 2020. Interventions: diagnostic tests for Covid-19 are performed: antigen and PCR. Results: The prevalence of the disease was 24.3% according to the PCR test and 17.5% according to the rapid antigenic test. The sensitivity was 72% (95% CI: 54.3-89.6%). The specificity was 100%.

Our previous studies demonstrated that the deubiquitinase USP5 stabilizes c-Maf and promotes myeloma cell proliferation and survival; therefore, the USP5/c-Maf axis could be a potential target for myeloma therapy. As a concept of principle, the present study established a USP5/c-Maf-based luciferase system that was used to screen an FDA-approved drug library. It was found that mebendazole, a typical anthelmintic drug, preferentially induced apoptosis in c-Maf-expressing myeloma cells. Moreover, oral administration of mebendazole delayed the growth of human myeloma xenografts in nude mice but did not show overt toxicity. Further studies showed that the selective antimyeloma activity of mebendazole was associated with the inhibition of the USP5/c-Maf axis. Mebendazole downregulated USP5 expression and disrupted the interaction between USP5 and c-Maf, thus leading to increased levels of c-Maf ubiquitination and subsequent c-Maf degradation. Mebendazole inhibited c-Maf transcriptional activity, as confirmed by both luciferase assays and expression measurements of c-Maf downstream genes.

But the degree to which this has happened and community and institutional characteristics of hospitals where capacity limits have been reached is largely unknown. Objective: To determine changes in intensive care capacity in US acute care hospitals between September and early December, 2020, and to identify whether hospitals serving more vulnerable populations were more likely to exceed critical levels of ICU occupancy. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective observational cohort of US acute care hospitals reporting to the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from September 4, 2020 to December 3, 2020. Hospitals in this cohort were compared to all US acute care hospitals. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between community socioeconomic factors and hospital-structural features with a hospital reaching critical ICU capacity. Exposure: Community-level socioeconomic status and hospital-structural features Main Outcomes and Measures: Our primary outcome was reaching critical ICU capacity (>90%) for at least two weeks since September 4. Secondary outcomes included the weekly capacity and occupancy tabulated by state and by hospital referral region. Results: 1,791 hospitals had unsuppressed ICU capacity data in the HHS Protect dataset, with 45% of hospitals reaching critical ICU capacity for at least two weeks during the study period. Hospitals in the South (OR = 2.79, p<0.001), Midwest (OR = 1.76, p=0.01) and West (OR = 1.85, p<0.01) were more likely to reach critical capacity than those in the Northeast. For-profit hospitals (OR = 2.15, p<0.001), rural hospitals (OR = 1.40, p<0.05) and hospitals in areas of high uninsurance (OR = 1.94, p<0.001) were more likely to reach critical ICU capacity, while hospitals with more intensivists (OR = 0.92, p=0.044 and higher nurse-bed ratios (OR = 0.95, p=0.013) were less likely to reach critical capacity. Conclusions and Relevance: Nearly half of U.S. hospitals reporting data to HHS Protect have reached critical capacity at some point since September. Those that are better resourced with staff were less likely to do so while for for-profit hospitals and those in poorer communities were more likely to reach capacity. Continued non-pharmacologic interventions are clearly needed to mitigate spread of the disease to ensure ICUs remain open for all patients needing critical care.","output":"Effect of COVID-19 on Critical ICU Capacity in US Acute Care Hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nonconventional luminescence polymers without any aromatic structures have attracted great interest from researchers due to their special structure and excellent biocompatibility. However, these materials mostly emit in the blue or green region, in which preparation of materials with long-wavelength (especially near-infrared) emission is still a great challenge. In this work, it is found that 2-(dimethyl amino) ethyl methacrylate (DMA) and itaconic anhydride (ITA) undergo a ring-opening reaction at room temperature, and subsequently generate zwitterionic compound (IDMA). Based on the clustering-triggered emission (CTE) mechanism, ionic bond can effectively promote the isolated electron-rich chromophores to form new emissive clusters with extended electron delocalization. Herein, two oligomers (P1 and P2) with different fluorescence emissions by controlling the concentration of zwitterionic monomers before polymerization are synthesized. It is worth noting that the maximum emission wavelength of P2 at high concentration is up to 712 nm, which is very rare in previous reports. In addition, the resulting oligomer (P2) shows typical aggregation-enhanced emission (AEE), excitation-dependent fluorescence, temperature-sensitive emission, and solvatochromism.

The wide range of stakeholders in human trafficking presents major challenges. Direct stakeholders are law enforcement, NGOs and INGOs, businesses, local/planning government authorities, and survivors. Viewed from a very high level, all stakeholders share in a rich network of interactions that produce and consume enormous amounts of information. The problems of making efficient use of such information for the purposes of fighting trafficking while at the same time adhering to community standards of privacy and ethics are formidable. At the same time they help us, technologies that increase surveillance of populations can also undermine basic human rights. In early March 2020, the Computing Community Consortium (CCC), in collaboration with the Code 8.7 Initiative, brought together over fifty members of the computing research community along with anti-slavery practitioners and survivors to lay out a research roadmap. The primary goal was to explore ways in which long-range research in artificial intelligence (AI) could be applied to the fight against human trafficking. Building on the kickoff Code 8.7 conference held at the headquarters of the United Nations in February 2019, the focus for this workshop was to link the ambitious goals outlined in the A 20-Year Community Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence Research in the US (AI Roadmap) to challenges vital in achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goal Target 8.7, the elimination of modern slavery.","output":"CCC/Code 8.7: Applying AI in the Fight Against Modern Slavery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The perpetuation of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has permitted the continued evolution of mutations, many of which appear to promote infectivity, transmission, and immune evasion. Critically, several derivative lineages defined as variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs) have emerged in the last year that possess a constellation of highly adaptive mutations that have resulted in unprecedented propagation. To better understand the significance of these mutations, we analyzed their molecular and immunological consequences against the immunogenetic profile of the United States population using immunoinformatics to analyze in silico data. Our findings indicate that several evolving mutations in the VOCs and VOIs appear to confer immune evasion properties leading to antigenic drift, specifically for Ab-mediated and Th cell-mediated immune recognition, whereas mutations leading to evasion from innate immune mechanisms are less common in the more successful VOC strains compared with the VOIs. Importantly, several of these mutations raise concerns for the effectiveness of anamnestic responses achieved through natural infection and vaccination as well as for the utility of Ab-based therapeutic interventions. The emergence of such adaptations underscores the need for vaccine enhancements as well as the continued need to for preventative hygiene measures to help minimize transmission.","output":"Memory Gaps in America: Mutational and Immunoinformatic Analysis of Evolving SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern and Interest."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The title compound was synthesized and structurally characterized.

Extended longitudinal studies with multi-timepoint sampling to evaluate dynamic changes in antibody levels are required to identify the time horizon in which these applications of serology are valid, and to explore the longevity of protective humoral immunity. METHODS: Healthcare workers were recruited to a prospective cohort study from the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic peak in London, undergoing weekly symptom screen, viral PCR and blood sampling over 16-21 weeks. Serological analysis (n =12,990) was performed using semi-quantitative Euroimmun IgG to viral spike S1 domain and Roche total antibody to viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) assays. Comparisons were made to pseudovirus neutralizing antibody measurements. FINDINGS: A total of 157/729 (21.5%) participants developed positive SARS-CoV-2 serology by one or other assay, of whom 31.0% were asymptomatic and there were no deaths. Peak Euroimmun anti-S1 and Roche anti-NP measurements correlated (r = 0.57, p<0.0001) but only anti-S1 measurements correlated with near-contemporary pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres (measured at 16-18 weeks, r = 0.57, p<0.0001). By 21 weeks' follow-up, 31/143 (21.7%) anti-S1 and 6/150 (4.0%) anti-NP measurements reverted to negative. Mathematical modelling revealed faster clearance of anti-S1 compared to anti-NP (median half-life of 2.5 weeks versus 4.0 weeks), earlier transition to lower levels of antibody production (median of 8 versus 13 weeks), and greater reductions in relative antibody production rate after the transition (median of 35% versus 50%). INTERPRETATION: Mild SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with heterogeneous serological responses in Euroimmun anti-S1 and Roche anti-NP assays. Anti-S1 responses showed faster rates of clearance, more rapid transition from high to low level production rate and greater reduction in production rate after this transition. In mild infection, anti-S1 serology alone may underestimate incident infections. The mechanisms that underpin faster clearance and lower rates of sustained anti-S1 production may impact on the longevity of humoral immunity.

DESIGN Prospective observational study. SETTING Neonatal intensive care unit. PATIENTS Stable preterm infants transitioned from nCPAP to HFNC using a 1:1 pressure to flow ratio. INTERVENTIONS The electrical activity of the diaphragm was measured by transcutaneous electromyography (dEMG) from 30 min before until 3 hours after the transition. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES At eight time points after the transition to HFNC, diaphragmatic activity was compared with the baseline on nCPAP. Percentage change in amplitudedEMG, peakdEMG and tonicdEMG were calculated. Furthermore, changes in respiratory rate, heart rate and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) were analysed. RESULTS Thirty-two preterm infants (mean gestational age: 28.12.2 weeks, mean birth weight: 1118368 g) were included.

I differentiate the impact of contact-tracing into three (one direct and two emergent) effects: isolation of the documented patient's direct infectees (descendants), isolation of non-descendant infectees, and temporary isolation of susceptible contacts. Contrary to expectation, isolation of descendants cannot stabilize an equilibrium; based on current data, the effect of the latter two are necessary and greater in effect overall.

RECENT FINDINGS: Delirium is a form of acute brain dysfunction that results in significant mortality and morbidity for older emergency department (ED) patients. Delirium is frequently missed by healthcare providers, but monitoring for this syndrome using brief delirium assessments may improve recognition. Once delirium is diagnosed, emergency medicine providers primary goal is to perform a comprehensive history and physical examination to uncover the underlying etiology for delirium. This includes obtaining history from a collateral historian and obtaining an accurate medication history. If posssible, emergency physicians (EPs) should treat the medical etiology that precipitated the delirium. If agitated, non-pharmacologic interventions such that minimize the use of tethers are preferred. Pharmacologic agents such as antipsychotic medications should be used as a last resort. SUMMARY: Delirium is a common geriatric emergency and requires the EP to assess, diagnose, evaluate, prevent, and treat. Delirium is a key geriatric syndrome that geriatric ED providers should routinely screen for. A strong emphasis is on the widespread use of delirium screening, followed by prevention and treatment efforts.","output":"Succinct Approach to Delirium in the Emergency Department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Basophils and mast cells are among the principal inducers of Th2 responses and have a crucial role in allergic and anti-parasitic protective immunity. Basophils can function as antigen-presenting cells that bind antigens on their surface and boost humoral immune responses, inducing Th2 cell differentiation. Their depletion results in lower humoral memory activation and greater infection susceptibility. Basophils seem to have an active role upon immune response to SARS-CoV-2. In fact, a coordinate adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is magnified by basophils. It has been observed that basophil amount is lower during acute disease with respect to the recovery phase and that the grade of this depletion is an important determinant of the antibody response to the virus. Moreover, mast cells, present in a great quantity in the nasal epithelial and lung cells, participate in the first immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Their activation results in a hyperinflammatory syndrome through the release of inflammatory molecules, participating to the cytokine storm and, in a longer period, inducing pulmonary fibrosis. The literature data suggest that basophil counts may be a useful prognostic tool for COVID-19, since their reduction is associated with a worse prognosis. Mast cells, on the other hand, represent a possible therapeutic target for reducing the airway inflammation characteristic of the hyperacute phase of the disease.","output":"Basophils and Mast Cells in COVID-19 Pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe 9 patients at a medical center in Detroit, Michigan, USA, with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and Clostridioides difficile.

Model results represent an important part of the information base for the decision process on different administrative levels. The Robert-Koch-Institute (RKI) initiated a project whose main goal is to predict COVID-19-specific occupation of beds in intensive care units: Steuerungs-Prognose von Intensivmedizinischen COVID-19 Kapazit?ten (SPoCK). The incidence of COVID-19 cases is a crucial predictor for this occupation. METHODS: We developed a model based on ordinary differential equations for the COVID-19 spread with a time-dependent infection rate described by a spline. Furthermore, the model explicitly accounts for weekday-specific reporting and adjusts for reporting delay. The model is calibrated in a purely data-driven manner by a maximum likelihood approach. Uncertainties are evaluated using the profile likelihood method. The uncertainty about the appropriate modeling assumptions can be accounted for by including and merging results of different modelling approaches. The analysis uses data from Germany describing the COVID-19 spread from early 2020 until March 31st, 2021. RESULTS: The model is calibrated based on incident cases on a daily basis and provides daily predictions of incident COVID-19 cases for the upcoming three weeks including uncertainty estimates for Germany and its subregions. Derived quantities such as cumulative counts and 7-day incidences with corresponding uncertainties can be computed. The estimation of the time-dependent infection rate leads to an estimated reproduction factor that is oscillating around one. Data-driven estimation of the dark figure purely from incident cases is not feasible. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully implemented a procedure to forecast near future COVID-19 incidences for diverse subregions in Germany which are made available to various decision makers via an interactive web application.

We assessed changes in hospital resource utilization and estimated the future backlog of cases in the colorectal surgery division of a large safety-net hospital. METHODS: Patients undergoing colorectal procedures from 3/16/20 to 4/23/20 (COVID) were compared with those from January through June 2018 (historical). Resource utilization rates were calculated by weekly case volumes and hospital stay in each group. A future catch up timeframe and new wait times from scheduling to surgery dates were calculated. RESULTS: The COVID and historical groups included 13 and 239 patients, respectively. The COVID group showed a 74% relative decrease in weekly surgical case rates (9.2 to 2.4 patients per week). Both groups had similar lengths of stay. The COVID group had a longer average ICU stay (1.4  2.5 days vs. 0.4  1.2 days, P = 0.016) and a 132% increase in ICU resource utilization. Overall, the COVID group had a 48% relative decrease in hospital resource utilization, owing to reduced volume but higher acuity. If the surgery numbers returns to pre-COVID volumes, the calculated catch up times range from 4.6 weeks to 9.2 weeks. Wait times for new cases may increase by 70% compared with pre-COVID levels. CONCLUSION: Cancelling elective colorectal surgeries results in a decrease in overall but increase in ICU-specific resource utilization. Though necessary, cancellations result in an increasing backlog of cases that poses significant future logistical and clinical challenges in an already overburdened safety-net hospital.

Herein, a colorimetic serological assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgGs in patients' plasma was developed using short antigenic epitopes conjugated to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Four immunodominant linear B-cell epitopes, located on the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2, were characterized for their IgG binding affinity and used as highly specific biological motifs on the nanoparticle to recognize target antibodies. Specific bivalent binding between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and epitope-functionalized AuNPs trigger nanoparticle aggregation, which manifests as a distinct optical transition in the AuNPs' plasmon characteristics within 30 min of antibody introduction. Co-immobilization of two epitopes improved the assay sensitivity relative to single-epitope AuNPs with a limit of detection of 3.2 nM, commensurate with IgG levels in convalescent COVID-19-infected patients. A passivation strategy was further pursued to preserve the sensing response in human plasma medium. When tested against 35 clinical plasma samples of varying illness severity, the optimized nanosensor assay can successfully identify SARS-CoV-2 infection with 100% specificity and 83% sensitivity. As the epitopes are conserved within the circulating COVID-19 variants, the proposed platform holds great potential to serve as a cost-effective and highly specific alternative to classical immunoassays employing recombinant viral proteins.

Angiogenesis and tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) recruitment are closely associated with CRC development. Nevertheless, the mechanisms revealing CRC progression are still not fully understood. 5'-Nucleotidase domain containing 2 (NT5DC2), a member of the NT5DC family, modulates various cellular events to mediate tumor growth, and thus serves as a disgnostic biomarker. Here, we explored the potential of NT5DC2 on tumor progression in CRC. We first found that NT5DC2 expression was significantly up-regulated in CRC tissues and cell lines. CRC patients with higher NT5DC2 expression showed poor overall survival. Furthermore, CRC cell lines stably transfected with shNT5DC2 lentivirus plasmids exhibited markedly reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion compared with the negative control group. Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) expression levels were remarkably reduced in CRC cells with NT5DC2 deletion, along with evidently reduced tube formation in the HUVECs cultured in the collected conditional medium. The expression levels of CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and its receptor CCR2 were found to be greatly down-regulated in CRC cells transfected with shNT5DC2. Moreover, NT5DC2 knockdown markedly suppressed the activation of protein kinase-B/nuclear transcription factor B (AKT/NF-B) signaling in CRC cells. Furthermore, we found that NT5DC2 deletion obviously reduced the TAM recruitments through suppressing CCL2/CCR2 and AKT/NF-B signaling pathways. Intriguingly, our in vitro experiments demonstrated that VEGF reduction was necessary for shNT5DC2-inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis and TAM recruitment. In vivo studies also confirmed that NT5DC2 knockdown effectively reduced the tumor growth and VEGF expression in a xonegraft mouse model with CRC. Lung metastasis of CRC cells was also hindered by NT5DC2 deletion in vivo.

Among 3352 HCW, those with  1 previous TBEV vaccination (n = 2018, 60%) showed a reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion (adjusted odds ratio: 0.8, 95% CI: 0.7C1.0, P = 0.02). However, laboratory testing of a subgroup of 26 baseline and follow-up samples did not demonstrate any neutralizing effect of anti-TBEV antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in live-virus neutralization assay.

Based on these data, we conclude that the observed association of previous TBEV vaccination and reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely due to residual confounding factors. The increase in TBEV follow-up antibody titers can be explained by natural TBEV exposure or potential non-specific immune activation upon exposure to various pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2.

Independent (non-sponsored) studies have a great potential to enhance public confidence in vaccines and accelerate their uptake process. Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional study for the side effects (SE) of CoronaVac was carried out in February 2021 among Turkish healthcare workers who were recently vaccinated. The questionnaire inquired about local and systemic SEs that occurred in the short-term, within four weeks, following vaccination. Results: A total of 780 healthcare workers were included in this study;62.5% of them experienced at least one SE. Injection site pain (41.5%) was the most common local SE, while fatigue (23.6%), headache (18.7%), muscle pain (11.2%) and joint pain (5.9%) were the common systemic SEs. Female healthcare workers (67.9%) were significantly more affected by local and systemic SEs than male colleagues (51.4%). Younger age, previous infection, and compromised health status (chronic illnesses and regular medicines uptake) can be associated with an increased risk of CoronaVac SEs;Conclusions: The independent research shows a higher prevalence of CoronaVac SEs than what is reported by phase ICIII clinical trials.

SHANK3 is critical for synaptic function, and preclinical and clinical studies suggest that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) can reverse a range of deficits in PMS. IGF-1 release is stimulated by growth hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary gland, and this study sought to assess the feasibility of increasing IGF-1 levels through recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) treatment, in addition to establishing safety and exploring efficacy of rhGH in children with PMS. METHODS: rhGH was administered once daily for 12 weeks to six children with PMS using an open-label design. IGF-1 levels, safety, and efficacy assessments were measured every 4 weeks throughout the study. RESULTS: rhGH administration increased levels of IGF-1 by at least 2 standard deviations and was well tolerated without serious adverse events. rhGH treatment was also associated with clinical improvement in social withdrawal, hyperactivity, and sensory symptoms.

Therefore, repetitive benchmarking appears to be essential for sustainable improvement in health care. The general idea in this approach is to establish a reference level, upon which improvement may be strived for and quantified. While the laboratory community traditionally is highly aware of the need for laboratory performance and public scrutiny is more intense than ever due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, few initiatives span the globe. The aim of this study was to establish a good practice approach towards benchmarking on a high abstraction level for three key dimensions of medical laboratory performance, generate a tentative snapshot of the current state of the art in the region of Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), and thus set the stage for global follow-up studies. METHODS The questionnaire used and previously published in this initiative consisted of 50 items, roughly half relating to laboratory operations in general with the other half addressing more specific topics. An international sample of laboratories from EMEA was approached to elicit high fidelity responses with the help of trained professionals. Individual item results were analyzed using standard descriptive statistics. Dimensional reduction of specific items was performed using exploratory factor analysis and assessed with confirmatory factor analysis, resulting in individual laboratory scores for the three subscales of \\"Operational performance\\", \\"Integrated clinical care performance\\", and \\"Financial sustainability\\". RESULTS Altogether, 773 laboratories participated in the survey, of which 484 were government hospital laboratories, 129 private hospital laboratories, 146 commercial laboratories, and 14 were other types of laboratories (e.g. research laboratories). Respondents indicated the need for digitalization (e.g. use of IT for order management, auto-validation), automation (e.g. pre-analytics, automated sample transportation), and establishment of formal quality management systems (e.g. ISO 15189, ISO 9001) as well as sustainably embedding them in the fabric of laboratory operations. Considerable room for growth also exists for services provided to physicians, such as \\"Diagnostic pathways guidance\\", \\"Proactive consultation on complex cases\\", and \\"Real time decision support\\" which were provided by less than two thirds of laboratories. Concordantly, the most important kind of turn-around time (TAT) for clinicians, sample-to-result TAT, was monitored by only 40% of respondents. CONCLUSIONS Altogether, the need for stronger integration of laboratories into the clinical care process became apparent and should be a main trajectory of future laboratory management. Factor analysis confirmed the theoretical constructs of the questionnaire design phase, resulting in a reasonably valid tool for further benchmarking activities on the three aimed-for key dimensions.","output":"Benchmarking medical laboratory performance: survey validation and results for Europe, Middle East, and Africa."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The newest type of influenza virus, influenza D virus (IDV), was isolated in 2011.

Here, we report that thiopurines inhibit the replication of the betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2, and to a lesser extent, the alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E. 6-Thioguanine (6-TG) disrupted early stages of infection, limiting synthesis of full-length and subgenomic HCoV RNAs. Furthermore, consistent with our previous report on the effects of thiopurines on influenza A virus glycoproteins, we observed that 6-TG inhibited accumulation of Spike glycoproteins from diverse HCoVs. Specifically, 6-TG treatment decreased the accumulation of Spike proteins and increased their electrophoretic mobility, consistent with Spike migration following the enzymatic removal of N-linked oligosaccharides with Peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF). SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (VLPs) harvested from 6-TG-treated cells were deficient in Spike. 6-TG treatment had a similar effect on lentiviruses pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 Spike; lentiviruses could be harvested from cell supernatants but were deficient in Spike and unable to infect human cells bearing ACE2 receptors. Together, these findings from complementary ectopic expression and infection models strongly indicate that defective Spike trafficking and processing is an outcome of 6-TG treatment. At low micromolar doses, the primary known mode of action of 6-TG is selective inhibition of the small GTPase Rac1. However, we observed that selective chemical inhibitors of the small GTPases Rac1, CDC42 and Rho had no effect on Spike processing and accumulation. The GTPase agonist ML099 countered the effects of 6-TG, suggesting that an unknown GTPase could be the relevant 6-TG-target protein involved in regulating Spike processing and accumulation. Overall, these findings provide important clues about the mechanism of action of a candidate antiviral that can broadly target HCoVs and suggest that small GTPases are promising targets for host-targeted antivirals. AUTHOR SUMMARY The COVID-19 pandemic has ignited efforts to repurpose existing drugs as safe and effective antivirals. Rather than directly inhibiting viral enzymes, host-targeted antivirals inhibit host cell processes to indirectly impede viral replication and/or stimulate antiviral responses. Here, we describe a new antiviral mechanism of action for the FDA-approved thiopurine 6-thioguanine. We demonstrate that this thiopurine is a pro-drug that must be metabolized by host enzymes to gain antiviral activity. We show that it can inhibit the replication of several human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, at least in part by interfering with the processing and accumulation of Spike glycoproteins, thereby impeding assembly of infectious progeny viruses. We provide evidence implicating host cell GTPase enzymes in the antiviral mechanism of action.","output":"Thiopurines inhibit coronavirus Spike protein processing and incorporation into progeny virions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND This study aimed to examine the prevalence, location, and severity of chronic internal, external, and combined head and neck lymphedema (HNL) in patients with head and neck (HNC) who were treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) or postoperative radiotherapy (PORT).

However, there has not been much research to establish if this is really beneficial. The current study aims to investigate whether engaging FDWs specifically for caregiving of PWDs truly moderates caregiver stress and to explore caregivers experiences of engaging FDWs. METHODS: A multi-method study design with a quantitative and qualitative sub-study was adopted. For the quantitative sub-study, 282 informal caregivers of PWDs were recruited. Propensity score matching analysis was used. For the qualitative sub-study, 15 informal caregivers with FDWs were interviewed. Inductive thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The quantitative sub-study confirmed that engaging FDWs did moderate the depressive symptoms of informal dementia caregivers (marginal effect = -3.35, p = 0.0497). However, such support did not affect their caregiving burden, self-efficacy, and perceived positive aspects of caregiving.

For lesions adjacent to the perirolandic area and descending motor tracts, mapping can be done with both awake craniotomy (AC) and under general anesthesia (GA). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine which anesthetic protocol-AC vs. GA-provides better patient outcomes by comparing EOR and postoperative morbidity for surgeries using IS mapping in gliomas located near or in motor areas of the brain. METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out to identify relevant studies from 1983 to 2019. Seven databases were screened. A total of 2351 glioma patients from 17 studies were analyzed. RESULTS: A random-effects meta-analysis revealed a trend towards a higher mean EOR in AC [90.1% (95% C.I. 85.8-93.8)] than with GA [81.7% (95% C.I. 72.4-89.7)] (p = 0.06). Neurological deficits were divided by timing and severity for analysis. There was no significant difference in early neurological deficits [20.9% (95% C.I. 4.1-45.0) vs. 25.4% (95% C.I. 13.6-39.2)] (p = 0.74), late neurological deficits [17.1% (95% C.I. 0.0-50.0) vs. 3.8% (95% C.I. 1.1-7.6)] (p = 0.06), or in non-severe [28.4% (95% C.I. 0.0-88.5) vs. 20.1% (95% C.I. 7.1-32.2)] (p = 0.72), and severe morbidity [2.6% (95% C.I. 0.0-15.5) vs. 4.5% (95% C.I. 1.1-9.6)] (p = 0.89) between patients who underwent AC versus GA, respectively.

Whether this relatively conservative strategy will impact in-hospital outcome for NSTEMI patients remains unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS The current study included all consecutive NSTEMI patients who visited the emergency department in Fuwai Hospital from February 1 to March 31, 2020 and all the NSTEMI patients in the same period of 2019 as a historical control. Very-high-risk patients were defined as clinical presentation of heart failure, cardiac shock, cardiac arrest, recurrent chest pain, and life-threatening arrhythmias. The primary outcome was in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as a composite of all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction, or heart failure. A total of 115 NSTEMI patients were enrolled since the outbreak of COVID-19, and a total of 145 patients were included in the control group. There was a tendency toward higher MACE risk in 2020 compared with 2019 (18.3% vs. 11.7%, p = .14). Among very-high-risk patients, early percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) strategy in 2019 was associated with reduced MACE risk compared with delayed PCI in 2020 (60.6% [20/33] in 2020 vs. 27.9% [12/43] in 2019, p = .01).

Our aim was to develop a module of questions for use in telephone health surveys on perceptions of threat of pandemic influenza, and on preparedness to comply with specific public health behaviours in the event of pandemic influenza. METHODS: A module of questions was developed and field tested on 192 adults using the New South Wales Department of Health's in-house Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) facility. The questions were then modified and re field tested on 202 adults. The module was then incorporated into the New South Wales Population Health Survey in the first quarter of 2007. A representative sample of 2,081 adults completed the module. Their responses were weighted against the state population. RESULTS: The reliability of the questions was acceptable with kappa ranging between 0.25 and 0.51. Overall 14.9% of the state population thought pandemic influenza was very or extremely likely to occur; 45.5% were very or extremely concerned that they or their family would be affected by pandemic influenza if it occurred; and 23.8% had made some level of change to the way they live their life because of the possibility of pandemic influenza. In the event of pandemic influenza, the majority of the population were willing to: be vaccinated (75.4%), be isolated (70.2%), and wear a face mask (59.9%). People with higher levels of threat perception are significantly more likely to be willing to comply with specific public health behaviours. CONCLUSION: While only 14.9% of the state population thought pandemic influenza was very or extremely likely to occur, a significantly higher proportion were concerned for self and family should a pandemic actually occur.

METHODS Wild-type C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat high-sugar (HFHS) diet for 8 weeks to induce obesity. After the first 8 weeks, TM5441 was added to the diet for an additional 8 weeks. In order to determine the efficacy of PAI-1 inhibition in conjunction with dietary modification, mice were fed an HFHS diet for 8 weeks to induce obesity and were then switched to a low-fat diet with or without TM5441 for an additional 2 to 8 weeks. RESULTS Obese mice showed weight reduction and significant improvement in hepatic steatosis when TM5441 was added to the HFHS diet. Obese mice that were treated with TM5441 in conjunction with dietary modification showed enhanced weight loss and a more rapid reversal of hepatic steatosis compared with obese mice treated with dietary modification alone. The enhanced weight loss among mice treated with TM5441 was associated with increased adipose tissue expression of adipose triglyceride lipase, phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase, and phosphorylated perilipin-1 as well as induction of adipose tissue lipolysis.

CV and renal diseases increase with age, and there are sex differences evident in both the prevalence and progression of CV and renal disease. These age and sex differences seen in cardio-renal health implicate sex hormones as potentially important regulators to be studied.

Likewise, incentives are an important element of clinical governance understood as health services management at the micro-level, aimed at achieving better health outcomes for patients. In Spain, monetary and non-monetary incentives are sometimes used in the health services, but not as frequently as in other countries. There are already several examples in European countries of initiatives searching the promotion of biosimilars through different sorts of incentives, but not in Spain. Hence, this paper is aimed at identifying the barriers that incentives to prescribe biosimilars might encounter in Spain, with particular interest in incentives in the framework of clinical governance. Both questions are intertwined. Barriers are presented from two perspectives. Firstly, based on the nature of the barrier: (i) the payment system for health professionals, (ii) budget rigidity and excessive bureaucracy, (iii) little autonomy in the management of human resources (iv) lack of clinical integration, (v) absence of a legal framework for clinical governance, and (vi) other governance-related barriers. The second perspective is based on the stakeholders involved: (i) gaps in knowledge among physicians, (ii) misinformation and distrust among patients, (iii) trade unions opposition to productivity-related payments, (iv) lack of a clear position by professional associations, and (v) misalignment of the goals pursued by some healthcare professionals and the goals of the public system.

Here, we used the online SARS-CoV-2 databases, Nextstrain and Ourworld, to map the evolution and epidemiology of the virus. We identified 30 high entropy residues which underwent a progressive evolution to arrive at the current dominant variant - Delta variant. The virus underwent mutational waves with the first wave made up of structural proteins important in its infectivity and the second wave made up of the ORFs important for its contagion. The most important driver of the second wave is ORF8 mutations at residue 119 and 120. Further mutations of these two residues are creating new clades that are offshoots from the Delta backbone. More importantly the further expansion of the S protein in the Omicron variant is now followed with the acquisition of ORF8 mutations 119 and 120. These findings demonstrate how SARS-CoV-2 mutates and points to two evolutionary paths; 1) Mutational expansion on the Delta backbone among the ORFs and 2) Mutational expansion of the S protein on other backbone follow with mutational wave among the ORFs.

After the ureteral defect was repaired through surgery, the rabbits in the negative control group were administered a non-bioactive stent, and rabbits in the observation group were treated with an ECM stent. RESULTS Comparison of macro-indicators: The negative control group had a higher infection rate, a lower survival rate and more complications than the observation group (p < 0.05). The frequency of ureteral peristalsis in the negative control group was lower than in the observation group. In addition, the rate of urinary dysfunction was higher, and the ratio of ureteral diameter was lower in the negative control group than in the observation group (all p < 0.05). Comparison of histopathology: Three months after the operation, the vascular, smooth muscle and mucous membrane of the ureter in the observation group regenerated to close to normal ureteral tissue.

We aimed to determine whether influenza diagnoses masked early COVID-19 cases and estimate numbers of undetected COVID-19 cases. DESIGN: Time-series study of influenza and COVID-19 cases, 2010-2020. SETTING: Primary care, Catalonia, Spain. PARTICIPANTS: People registered in primary-care practices, covering >6 million people and >85% of the population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weekly new cases of influenza and COVID-19 clinically diagnosed in primary care. ANALYSES: Daily counts of both cases were computed using the total cases recorded over the previous 7 days to avoid weekly effects. Epidemic curves were characterised for the 2010-2011 to 2019-2020 influenza seasons. Influenza seasons with a similar epidemic curve and peak case number as the 2019-2020 season were used to model expected case numbers with Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average models, overall and stratified by age. Daily excess influenza cases were defined as the number of observed minus expected cases. RESULTS: Four influenza season curves (2011-2012, 2012-2013, 2013-2014 and 2016-2017) were used to estimate the number of expected cases of influenza in 2019-2020.

The trial allocated parents to three groups: Cascade, peer-support, waitlist. Cascade achieved good parent engagement. We successfully delivered Cascade to participants who lived >3200 km apart. Any technical difficulties caused only minor disruptions. Most Cascade parents were satisfied and reported experiencing benefits from the program. However, Cascade did not improve our main outcomes, including parents quality of life, depression and anxiety. Cascade parents reported a short-term improvement in their confidence to use the skills they learnt, but this did not translate into actual use. After six months, Cascade parents felt their child survivor had lower psychological health than waitlisted parents. Our findings show that while some parents find Cascade helpful, it may not suit everyone. We used these findings to further improve Cascade and will trial the new version in future. ABSTRACT: We conducted a three-armed trial to assess Cascade, a four-module group videoconferencing cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) intervention for parents of childhood cancer survivors currently aged <18 years. We allocated parents to Cascade, an attention control (peer-support group), or a waitlist. The primary outcome was parents health-related quality of life (PedsQL-Family Impact/EQ-5D-5L) six months post-intervention. Parents also reported their anxiety/depression, parenting self-agency, fear of recurrence, health service and psychotropic medication use, engagement in productive activities, confidence to use, and actual use of, CBT skills, and their childs quality of life. Seventy-six parents opted in; 56 commenced the trial. Cascade achieved good parent engagement and most Cascade parents were satisfied and reported benefits. Some parents expressed concerns about the time burden and the group format. Most outcomes did not differ across trial arms. Cascade parents felt more confident to use more CBT skills than peer-support and waitlisted parents, but this did not lead to more use of CBT. Cascade parents reported lower psychosocial health scores for their child than waitlisted parents. Cascade parents health service use, psychotropic medication use, and days engaged in productive activities did not improve, despite some improvements in waitlisted parents. Our trial was difficult to implement, but participants were largely satisfied. Cascade did not improve most outcomes, possibly because many parents were functioning well pre-enrolment.

Generally, a high Treg infiltration has been correlated to a worse patient outcome, but it is still unclear how the composition of different Treg subsets affects patient relapse and survival. In this study, we used mass and flow cytometry to characterize Treg in colon tumors and corresponding unaffected tissue, followed by a correlation to clinical parameters and patient outcome. RESULTS: Using mass cytometry, we defined 13 clusters of intestinal Treg, three of which were enriched in the tumors. The two most enriched clusters were defined by their expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 and CD56, respectively. The Treg accumulating in the tumors expressed inducible T-cell co-stimulator (ICOS), OX-40, and CD39, indicating that they were effector Treg (eTreg). Intratumoral CD39+ Treg also had a higher expression of Foxp3, suggesting a higher suppressive activity, and we subsequently used CD39 as a marker for eTreg. Our further studies showed that colon tumors can be divided into two tumor groups, based on the proportion of CD39+ putative eTreg in the tumors. This property was independent of both tumor microsatellite status and tumor stage, which are important factors in predicting cancer disease progression. In a prospective study of forty-four colon cancer patients, we also showed that patients with a high CD39 expression on tumor-infiltrating Treg have a tendency towards a less favorable patient outcome in terms of cumulative cancer-specific survival. CONCLUSIONS: This study uncovers novel subsets of tumor-infiltrating Treg in colon cancer, and suggests that CD39 may be a potential therapeutic target in patients with microsatellite stable colon tumors, which are usually refractory to checkpoint blockade therapy.","output":"Intratumoral regulatory T cells from colon cancer patients comprise several activated effector populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An oligosymptomatic patient with initially exclusively gastrointestinal symptoms (massive nausea and mild pancreatitis) turned out to suffer from COVID-19 during the hospital stay.

DATA SOURCES MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and EconLit were searched without language restrictions. The search had no limiting start date and concluded on 16 September 2020. STUDY SELECTION Studies that estimated the association between receipt of industry payments (exposure) and prescribing (outcome). DATA EXTRACTION Pairs of reviewers extracted the primary analysis or analyses from each study and evaluated risk of bias (ROB). DATA SYNTHESIS Thirty-six studies comprising 101 analyses were included. Most studies (n = 30) identified a positive association between payments and prescribing in all analyses; the remainder (n = 6) had a mix of positive and null findings. No study had only null findings. Of 101 individual analyses, 89 identified a positive association. Payments were associated with increased prescribing of the paying company's drug, increased prescribing costs, and increased prescribing of branded drugs. Nine studies assessed and found evidence of a temporal association; 25 assessed and found evidence of a dose-response relationship. LIMITATION The design was observational, 21 of 36 studies had serious ROB, and publication bias was possible. CONCLUSION The association between industry payments and physician prescribing was consistent across all studies that have evaluated this association. Findings regarding a temporal association and dose-response suggest a causal relationship.

COVIPREG is a prospective French multicenter study to assess the seroprevalence at the time of delivery and the maternal and neonatal impact of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. In order to study factors associated with poor outcomes after COVID-19 Infection during pregnancy and adapt the sample size of the study, a preliminary assessment of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was planned after 500 inclusions in a one perinatal center of Paris area. OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody response in pregnant women at the time of delivery during the COVID-19 pandemia. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective observational study at Cochin hospital (Level III maternity). Patients admitted for delivery were offered to participate to the study. Each patient participating to the study was tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using a commercially available ELISA. RESULTS: Among the 529 patients included in the COVIPREG study between April 29 and June 26, 529 were assessed for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody response and 25 had a positive test, ie 4.7 % with a confidence interval at 95 % [3.0 %C6.9 %]). CONCLUSIONS: Four months after the beginning of the infection in Paris, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in pregnant women at the time of delivery is low.

In the glomerular and tubular compartments of the nephron, consistent studies demonstrated that well-characterized, distinct populations of progenitor cells, localized in the parietal epithelium of Bowman capsule and scattered in the proximal and distal tubules, could generate segment-specific cells in physiological conditions and following tissue injury. However, defective or abnormal regenerative responses of these progenitors can contribute to pathologic conditions. The molecular characteristics of renal progenitors have been extensively studied, revealing that numerous classical and evolutionarily conserved pathways, such as Notch or Wnt/-catenin, play a major role in cell regulation. Others, such as retinoic acid, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, TLR2 (Toll-like receptor 2) and leptin, are also important in this process. In this review, we summarize the plethora of molecular mechanisms directing renal progenitor responses during homeostasis and following kidney injury.

Our findings will help to optimize shift work scheduling, use the existing nursing workforce more efficiently, and improve nursing quality. BACKGROUND: Nurses are one of the main professionals fighting against COVID\\\\19. Providing care for COVID\\\\19 patients is challenging. In isolation wards, the workload has increased, and the workflow and shift patterns are completely different from the usual. More importantly, there is a shortage of nurses. Therefore, it is essential and urgent to arrange nurses shifts correctly and use the existing workforce resources efficiently. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study of 14 nurses in Chinese hospitals was conducted. METHODS: Semi\\\\structured interviews were used based on the phenomenological research method; data was analyzed using Colaizzis method of data analysis. This study aligns with the COREQ checklist. RESULTS: Four themes were extracted: assess the competency of nurses to assign nursing work scientifically and reasonably, reorganize nursing workflow to optimize shift patterns, communicate between managers and front\\\\line nurses to humanize shift patterns, and nurses various feelings and views on shift patterns. CONCLUSION: It is necessary to arrange shift patterns scientifically and allocate workforce rationally to optimize nursing workforce allocation, reduce nurses workload, improve nursing quality, and promote physical and mental health among nurses during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

As global health leadership programs evolve, many have incorporated experiential learning and mentoring (ELM) components into their structure. However, there has been incomplete consideration on how ELM activities are deployed, what challenges they face and how programs adapt to meet those challenges. This paper builds on the co-authors experiences as trainees, trainers, organizers and evaluators of six global health leadership programs to reflect on lessons learned regarding ELM. We also consider ethics, technology, gender, age and framing that influence how ELM activities are developed and implemented. FINDINGS: Despite the diverse origins and funding of these programs, all six are focused on training participants from low- and middle-income countries drawing on a diversity of professions. Each program uses mixed didactic approaches, practice-based placements, competency and skills-driven curricula, and mentorship via various modalities. Main metrics for success include development of trainee networks, acquisition of skills and formation of relationships; programs that included research training had specific research metrics as well. Common challenges the programs face include ensuring clarity of expectations of all participants and mentors; maintaining connection among trainees; meeting the needs of trainee cohorts with different skill sets and starting points; and ensuring trainee cohorts capture age, gender and other forms of diversity. CONCLUSIONS: ELM activities for global health leadership are proving even more critical now as the importance of effective individual leaders in responding to crises becomes evident. Future efforts for ELM in global health leadership should emphasize local adaptation and sustainability. Practice-based learning and established mentoring relationships provide the building blocks for competent leaders to navigate complex dynamics with the flexibility and conscientiousness needed to improve the health of global populations. KEY TAKEAWAYS: Experiential learning and mentorship activities within global health leadership programs provide the hands-on practice and support that the next generation of global health leaders need to address the health challenges of our times. Six global health leadership programs with experiential learning and mentorship components are showcased to highlight differences and similarities in their approaches and capture a broad picture of achievements that can help inform future programs. Emphasis on inter-professional training, mixed-learning approaches and mentorship modalities were common across programs. Both individual capacity building and development of trainees professional networks were seen as critical, reflecting the value of inter-personal connections for long-term leadership success. During program design, future programs should recognize the frame within which the program will be incorporated and intentionally address diversityin all its formsduring recruitment as well as consider North-South ethics, leadership roles, hierarchies and transition plans.","output":"Experiential Learning and Mentorship in Global Health Leadership Programs: Capturing Lessons from Across the Globe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize clinical presentation and healthcare utilization for pediatric COVID-19 in Western Pennsylvania (PA). METHODS: We established and analyzed a registry of pediatric COVID-19 in Western PA that includes cases in patients <22 years of age cared for by the pediatric quaternary medical center in the area and its associated pediatric primary care network from March 11 through August 20, 2020. RESULTS: Our cohort included 424 pediatric COVID-19 cases (mean age 12.5 years, 47.4% female); 65% reported exposure and 79% presented with symptoms. The most common initial healthcare contact was through telehealth (45%). Most cases were followed as outpatients, but twenty-two patients (4.5%) were hospitalized: 19 with acute COVID-19 disease, and three for multisystem inflammatory syndrome of children (MIS-C). Admitted patients were younger (p<0.001) and more likely to have pre-existing conditions (p<0.001). Black/Hispanic patients were 5.8 times more likely to be hospitalized than white patients (p=0.012). Five patients (1.2%) were admitted to the PICU, including all three MIS-C cases; two required BiPAP and one mechanical ventilation. All patients survived.

Here, we have demonstrated nanogap electrodes fabrication by using the self-assembly technique, which provides suspension to the 2D-MoS2. These nano-spacing electrodes not only give suspension but also provide robustness strength to the atomic layer, which remains freestanding after coating of the Hafnium oxide (HfO2) as well as linkers and antibodies.

The ability of many viruses to cross the placenta and cause abortions and fetal malformations is well understood. There is also significant evidence that viral infections have additional actions in dairy cows, which are reflected in reduced conception rates. These effects are, however, highly dependent on the time at which an individual animal first contracts the disease and are less easy to quantify. This paper reviews the evidence relating to five viruses that can affect fertility, together with their potential mechanisms of action. Acute infection with non-cytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in mid-gestation increases abortion rates or causes the birth of persistently infected calves. BVDV infections closer to the time of breeding can have direct effects on the ovaries and uterine endometrium, which cause estrous cycle irregularities and early embryo mortality. Fertility may also be reduced by BVDV-induced immunosuppression, which increases the susceptibility to bacterial infections. Bovine herpesvirus (BHV)-1 is most common in pre-pubertal heifers, and can slow their growth, delay breeding, and increase the age at first calving. Previously infected animals subsequently show reduced fertility. Although this may be associated with lung damage, ovarian lesions have also been reported. Both BHV-1 and BHV-4 remain latent in the host following initial infection and may be reactivated later by stress, for example associated with calving and early lactation. While BHV-4 infection alone may not reduce fertility, it appears to act as a co-factor with established bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Trueperella pyogenes to promote the development of endometritis and delay uterine repair mechanisms after calving. Both Schmallenberg virus (SBV) and bluetongue virus (BTV) are transmitted by insect vectors and lead to increased abortion rates and congenital malformations. BTV-8 also impairs the development of hatched blastocysts; furthermore, infection around the time of breeding with either virus appears to reduce conception rates. Although the reductions in conception rates are often difficult to quantify, they are nevertheless sufficient to cause economic losses, which help to justify the benefits of vaccination and eradication schemes.","output":"Importance of Viral Disease in Dairy Cow Fertility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has profoundly impacted residency training and education. To date, there has not been any broad assessment of urological surgery residency changes and concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS The Society of Academic Urologists distributed a questionnaire to urology residency program directors on March 30, 2020 exploring residency programs changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics are presented. A qualitative analysis of free response questions was undertaken. A post hoc analysis of differences related to local COVID-19 incidence is described. RESULTS The survey was distributed to 144 residency programs with 65 responses for a 45% response rate. Reserve staffing had started in 80% of programs. Patient-contact time had decreased significantly from 4.7 to 2.1 days per week (P<0.001). Redeployment was reported by 26% of programs. Sixty percent of programs reported concern that residents will not meet case minimums due to COVID-19. Wellness activities centered on increased communication. All programs had begun to use video-conferencing and the majority planned to continue using this. Programs in states with higher incidence of COVID-19 were more likely to report resident redeployment (48% vs 11%, P=0.002) and exposure to COVID-19-positive patients (70% vs 40%, P=0.03) and were less likely to report concerns regarding exposure (78% vs 97%, P=0.02) and personal protective equipment (PPE) availability (62% vs 89%, P=0.02).

METHODS The investigator initiated NASA registry recruited North American sites to submit retrospective angiographic and clinical outcome data on consecutive acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients treated with the Solitaire FR between March 2012 and February 2013. The primary outcome was a Thrombolysis in Myocardial Ischemia (TIMI) score of 2 or a Treatment in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score of 2a. Secondary outcomes were 90 day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, mortality, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS 354 patients underwent treatment for AIS using the Solitaire FR device in 24 centers. Mean time from onset to groin puncture was 363.4239 min, mean fluoroscopy time was 32.925.7 min, and mean procedure time was 100.957.8 min.

METHODS Using the Optum Research Database from January 2017 to March 2021, including approximately 19 million US adults with commercial health insurance, we identified new breast cancer diagnoses and first treatment after diagnosis. We compared breast cancer incidence and proportion of newly diagnosed patients receiving pre-operative systemic therapy pre-COVID, in the first 2 months of the COVID pandemic and in the later part of the COVID pandemic. RESULTS Average monthly breast cancer incidence was 19.3 (95% CI 19.1-19.5) cases per 100,000 women and men pre-COVID, 11.6 (95% CI 10.8-12.4) per 100,000 in April-May 2020, and 19.7 (95% CI 19.3-20.1) per 100,000 in June 2020-February 2021. Use of pre-operative systemic therapy was 12.0% (11.7-12.4) pre-COVID, 37.7% (34.9-40.7) for patients diagnosed March-April 2020, and 14.8% (14.0-15.7) for patients diagnosed May 2020-January 2021.

Many EM clinicians lack training on how to manage acute opioid withdrawal or initiate treatment with buprenorphine. We developed a brief buprenorphine training program and assessed the impact of the training on subsequent buprenorphine initiation and knowledge retention. METHODS: We conducted a pilot randomized control trial enrolling EM clinicians to receive either a 30-min didactic intervention about buprenorphine (standard arm) or the didactic plus weekly messaging and a monetary inducement to administer and report buprenorphine use (enhanced arm). All participants were incentivized to complete baseline, immediate post-didactic, and 90-day knowledge and attitude assessment surveys. Our objective was to achieve first time ED buprenorphine prescribing events in clinicians who had not previously prescribed buprenorphine in the ED and to improve EM-clinician knowledge and perceptions about ED-initiated buprenorphine. We also assessed whether the incentives and reminder messaging in the enhanced arm led to more clinicians administering buprenorphine than those in the standard arm following the training; we measured changes in knowledge of and attitudes toward ED-initiated buprenorphine. RESULTS: Of 104 EM clinicians enrolled, 51 were randomized to the standard arm and 53 to the enhanced arm. Clinical knowledge about buprenorphine improved for all clinicians immediately after the didactic intervention (difference 19.4%, 95% CI 14.4% to 24.5%). In the 90 days following the intervention, one-third (33%) of all participants reported administering buprenorphine for the first time. Clinicians administered buprenorphine more frequently in the enhanced arm compared to the standard arm (40% vs. 26.3%, p = 0.319), but the difference was not statistically significant. The post-session knowledge improvement was not sustained at 90 days in the enhanced (difference 9.6%, 95% CI ? 0.37% to 19.5%) or in the standard arm (difference 3.7%, 95% CI ? 5.8% to 13.2%). All the participants reported an increased ability to recognize patients with opioid withdrawal at 90 days (enhanced arm difference .55, 95% CI .01C1.09, standard arm difference .85 95% CI .34C1.37). CONCLUSIONS: A brief educational intervention targeting EM clinicians can be utilized to achieve first-time prescribing and improve knowledge around buprenorphine and opioid withdrawal. The use of weekly messaging and gain-framed incentivization conferred no additional benefit to the educational intervention alone. In order to further expand evidence-based ED treatment of OUD, focused initiatives that improve clinician competence with buprenorphine should be explored.

The immaturity of the developing immune system, and particularly the distinct functionality of T lymphocytes in early life, has been implicated in increased susceptibility to infection. Previous work has demonstrated that immune responses in early life are skewed toward limited inflammation and atopy; however, there is mounting evidence that such responses are context- and tissue-dependent. The regulation, differentiation, and maintenance of infant T cell responses, particularly as it relates to tissue compartmentalization, remains poorly understood. How the tissue environment impacts early-life immune responses and whether the development of localized protective immune memory cell subsets are established is an emerging area of research. As infectious diseases affecting the respiratory and digestive tracts are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide in infants and young children, a deeper understanding of site-specific immunity is essential to addressing these challenges.

However, on Aug 2nd, the reproductive ration remained below that threshold for only 702 counties. The estimated effect of any individual NPI is different across counties. Public school closings were estimated to be effective in metropolitan, urban, and suburban counties, while advisory NPIs were estimated to be effective in more rural counties. The cumulative prevalence predicted by the model ranges from 0 to 58.6% across the counties examined. The median is 2.6% while the 25th and 75th percentile are 1.3% and 44.6% respectively, indicating that most counties are far from herd immunity. Our results suggest that local conditions, including socioeconomic, demographic and infrastructural factors, in addition to the cumulative prevalence are pertinent to containment and re-opening decisions.","output":"Changes in Reproductive Ratio of SARS-CoV-2 Due to Implementation and Rollback of Non-pharmaceutical Interventions in 1,904 United States Counties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ANTECEDENTES: La pandemia de COVID-19 ha ocasionado que los servicios de ciruga y de salud en todo el mundo tengan que reorganizarse y planear para poder brindar la mejor atencin a los pacientes, con la proteccin necesaria para el personal de salud.

INTRODUCTION: the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a reorganization of hospital and general surgery departments worldwide to assure the best medical and surgical treatment of patients with this disease and protection of the health-related personnel. Some of them will require surgical treatment either elective or urgent. OBJECTIVE: report the initial experience in the management of patients with COVID-19 in a third level hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: a review of the surgical protocols, personal protection equipment used by the surgical teams, and results of the treatment of forty-two patients submitted to surgery. RESULTS: During four months (April-July 2020) forty-two patients with suspicion or confirmed infection of SARS-CoV2 underwent surgical treatment. The most common surgery was tracheostomy in 16 patients (38%) followed by exploratory laparotomy in 8 patients (19%). The median postoperative stay was 17 days and the thirty-day postoperative mortality rate was 26%. CONCLUSIONS: reorganization of the general surgery department and the hospital, favors adequate management and treatment of patients with COVID-19 and protection to the health-related personnel.

We try to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in non-Wuhan areaand explore its effective treatment. MethodsRetrospective, single-center case series of the 51 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital in Chongqing, China, from January 20 to February 3, 2020The discharge time was from January 29 to February 11, 2020. The main results and indicators of epidemiology, demography, clinical manifestation, laboratory examination, imaging data and treatment data of 51 patients with covid-19 were collected and analyzed. The changes of blood routine and biochemical indexes at discharge and admission were compared. Compare the clinical characteristics of severe patients (including severe and critical patients) and non- severe patients (general patients). Results Of 51 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 45 years (interquartile range, 34-51; range, 16-68 years) and 32 (62.7%) were men.4384.3%patients had been to Wuhan or Other Hubei areas outside Wuhanand 47.7% patients had a clear contact history of COVID-19 patients before the onset of the disease, and 47.7% patients had no clear epidemiological history of COVID-19.Common symptoms included fever (43 [84.3%]), cough (38 [74.5%]) and fatigue (22 [43.1%]). Lymphopenia was observed in 26 patients (51.0%), and elevated C-reactive protein level in 32 patients (62.7%). Ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (41 [80.4%])Local consolidation of pneumonia in some patients(17 [33.3%]).Most of the patients were treated with traditional Chinese medicine decoction (28 [54.9%])all of them received aerosol inhalation of recombinant human interferon a-1b for injection and oral antiviral therapy with Lopinavir and Ritonavir tablets (51 [100%]); Most of the patients were given Bacillus licheniformis capsules regulated intestinal flora treatment (44 [86.3%]). 10 patients (19.6%) received short-term (3-5 days) glucocorticoid treatment. Compared with non-severe patients (n = 44), severe patients (n = 7) were older (median age, 52 years vs 44 years), had a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (4 [57.1%] vs 0 [0.0%]), most of them needed antibiotic treatment (7 [100%] vs 4 [9.1%], most of them needed nutritional diet (6 [85.7%) vs 0 [0.0%], and were more likely to have dyspnea (6 [85.7%] vs 5 [11.4%])most of them needed noninvasive mechanical ventilation (6 [85.7%] vs 0 [0.0%]). Except one patient died, the remaining 50 patients were discharged according to the discharge standard, the common clinical symptoms disappeared basically, the lymphocyte increased significantly (P=0.008), CRP decreased significantly (P <0.001). The median length of stay was 12 days (IQR, 9-13). ConclusionIn 51 single center cases confirmed as COVID-19 and discharged from the hospital, 13.7% of the patients were severe. The main clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever, cough and astheniaSome patients had obvious dyspnea. They had clinical laboratory and radiologic characteristics. There is no specific drug treatment for the disease. For the treatment of COVID-19, in addition to oxygen inhalation and antiviral treatment, attention should be paid to the dialectical treatment of traditional Chinese medicine, regulation of intestinal flora, nutritional support treatment and other comprehensive treatment.","output":"Clinical characteristics of 51 patients discharged from hospital with COVID-19 in ChongqingChina"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cities play an important role in fostering and amplifying the transmission of airborne diseases (e.g., influenza) because of dense human contacts. Before an outbreak of airborne diseases within a city, how to determine an appropriate containment area for effective vaccination strategies is unknown. This research treats airborne disease spreads as geo-social interaction patterns, because viruses transmit among different groups of people over geographical locations through human interactions and population movement. Previous research argued that an appropriate scale identified through human geo-social interaction patterns can provide great potential for effective vaccination. However, little work has been done to examine the effectiveness of such vaccination at large scales (e.g., city) that are characterized by spatially heterogeneous population distribution and movement. This article therefore aims to understand the impact of geo-social interaction patterns on effective vaccination in the urbanized area of Portland, Oregon. To achieve this goal, we simulate influenza transmission on a large-scale location-based social network to 1) identify human geo-social interaction patterns for designing effective vaccination strategies, and 2) and evaluate the efficacy of different vaccination strategies according to the identified geo-social patterns. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of vaccination strategies based on geosocial interaction patterns in containing the epidemic outbreak at the source. This research can provide evidence to inform public health approaches to determine effective scales in the design of disease control strategies.","output":"A large-scale location-based social network to understanding the impact of human geo-social interaction patterns on vaccination strategies in an urbanized area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To present the authors' experience treating dural carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas (CCF) with retrograde embolization via the thrombosed superior ophthalmic vein (SOV). METHODS The medical records of 4 patients with dural CCFs treated via the thrombosed SOV were reviewed. All procedures were performed unilaterally in the interventional radiology unit with the administration of general anesthesia. The SOV was exposed via an eyelid crease incision, and then an angiocatheter was inserted in the vein and advanced through the segment with thrombosis to the cavernous sinus, where embolizing agents were deposited. After the procedure, the patients were followed up and evaluated clinically. RESULTS Three patients had unilateral CCFs, and 1 had a bilateral CCF (3 women and 1 man; age range, 58-68 years). The CCFs were Barrow type B (n=2) and Barrow type D (n=2). All patients had severe venous congestive orbital symptoms, chorioretinopathy, increased intraocular pressure, and visual loss. In all cases, the SOV appeared as a pale, thin, tortuous vessel adherent to the surrounding tissues during the surgical procedure. In 3 patients, the cavernous sinus was successfully embolized, and all symptoms were completely resolved without recurrence during follow up (3, 15, and 24 months). In the patient in whom the SOV could not be catheterized, the symptoms regressed slowly, but visual acuity remained unchanged during follow up (64 months). CONCLUSIONS Dural CCFs can be successfully treated through the SOV, even when the vein is thrombosed. Identification and catheterization of the thrombosed SOV may be difficult because of the tiny and fibrotic structure of the vein.","output":"Embolization of dural carotid-cavernous fistulas via the thrombosed superior ophthalmic vein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the early stage of the pandemic outbreak between 2019-2020, the capacity and preparedness of Thailand in coping with the crisis were reconfirmed with ranking the country sixth among a total of 195 countries in terms of health security and making it the only developing country worldwide on the top 10 list and number1 in Asia. In the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, the Village Health Volunteers (VHVs) play an important role as a representative and gatekeeper of the community in the response to the pandemic. Previous research paid less attention to explore how local communities in the northeast of Thailand are able to prevent themselves from the pandemic by utilizing certain form of local resources. The research pays attention to the roles and functions of VHVs, as well as to the process of social network formation of the VHVs in Nakhon Phanom. It applies anthropological research methods: focus group, observations and in-depth interviews with five VHVs. Following the network and social capital concepts (Lin 2005), this paper argues that local communities in the northeast of Thailand attempt to cope with the risks and challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic by mobilizing a variety of local resources, and such mobilization is operated and maintained by numerous local agencies or relevant stakeholders. The VHVs formulate socio-political networks, or can be seen as a pluralistic network based on a collaborative system between numerous agents/stakeholders in the community, including VHV groups, villagers, families/households, local politicians/officials, and private sector actors. This research can be used as fundamental research applying to understand the larger societies where community collaborations, social networks, and social capital are key mechanisms empowering agencies to encounter the invasion of a global pandemic.","output":"Anthropological study of village health volunteers (VHVs) socio-political network in minimizing risk and managing the crisis during COVID-19()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Differences in mortality rates previously reported in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 have increased the need for additional data on mortality and risk factors for death. We conducted this study to describe length of stay, mortality, and risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality in mechanically ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Two urban, academic referral hospitals in Indianapolis, Indiana. PATIENTS OR SUBJECTS: Participants were critically ill patients 18 years old and older, admitted with coronavirus disease 2019 between March 1, 2020, and April 27, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Outcomes included in-hospital mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of stay. A total of 242 patients were included with mean age of 59.6 years (sd, 15.5 yr), 41.7% female and 45% African American. Mortality in the overall cohort was 19.8% and 20.5% in the mechanically ventilated subset. Patients who died were older compared with those that survived (deceased: mean age, 72.8 yr [sd, 10.6 yr] vs patients discharged alive: 54.3 yr [sd, 14.8 yr]; p < 0.001 vs still hospitalized: 59.5 yr [sd, 14.4 yr]; p < 0.001) and had more comorbidities compared with those that survived (deceased: 2 [0.5C3] vs survived: 1 [interquartile range, 0C1]; p = 0.001 vs still hospitalized: 1 [interquartile range, 0C2]; p = 0.015). Older age and end-stage renal disease were associated with increased hazard of in-hospital mortality: age 65C74 years (hazard ratio, 3.1 yr; 95% CI, 1.2C7.9 yr), age 75+ (hazard ratio, 4.1 yr; 95% CI, 1.6C10.5 yr), and end-stage renal disease (hazard ratio, 5.9 yr; 95% CI, 1.3C26.9 yr). The overall median duration of mechanical ventilation was 9.3 days (interquartile range, 5.7C13.7 d), and median ICU length of stay in those that died was 8.7 days (interquartile range, 4.0C14.9 d), compared with 9.2 days (interquartile range, 4.0C14.0 d) in those discharged alive, and 12.7 days (interquartile range, 7.2C20.3 d) in those still remaining hospitalized.

METHODS: This national death registry included all adult (aged &#8805;18 years) deaths in England and Wales between January 1, 2014, and June 30, 2020. Daily deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared against the expected daily deaths, estimated with use of the Farrington surveillance algorithm for daily historical data between 2014 and 2020 by place and cause of death. RESULTS: Between March 2 and June 30, 2020, there was an excess mortality of 57,860 (a proportional increase of 35%) compared with the expected deaths, of which 50,603 (87%) were COVID-19 related. At home, only 14% (2267) of the 16,190 excess deaths were related to COVID-19, with 5963 deaths due to cancer and 2485 deaths due to cardiac disease, few of which involved COVID-19. In care homes or hospices, 61% (15,623) of the 25,611 excess deaths were related to COVID-19, 5539 of which were due to respiratory disease, and most of these (4315 deaths) involved COVID-19. In the hospital, there were 16,174 fewer deaths than expected that did not involve COVID-19, with 4088 fewer deaths due to cancer and 1398 fewer deaths due to cardiac disease than expected. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a large excess of deaths in care homes that were poorly characterized and likely to be the result of undiagnosed COVID-19. There was a smaller but important and ongoing excess in deaths at home, particularly from cancer and cardiac disease, suggesting public avoidance of hospital care for non-COVID-19 conditions.","output":"Place and Underlying Cause of Death During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective Cohort Study of 3.5 Million Deaths in England and Wales, 2014 to 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus outbreak in December 2019 completely changed the dynamic of consumption in different sectors of industry. The food and beverage industries have been profoundly affected, from production, to modifications in consumers choices. Among the different reasons behind those modifications is confinement, which forces consumers to stay at home for an extended period and just go out to perform essential tasks, such as going to the supermarket. We hypothesized that this new dynamic of consumption could create a situation of fear that changes food choice. To test this hypothesis, two studies were conducted in three countries with a different degree of confinement: Mexico (flexible), Spain (strict), and Peru (hard). Study one consisted of a free association task with 60 participants in each country with the inductor word coronavirus and food. The different associations served as the basis to build a structured questionnaire, which was used in the second study focused on fear and food choice. The second study was applied to 450 participants in the same three countries. Results showed that fear can be separated into nine dimensions: social, emotional, food supply, government, basic needs, food-delivery, overeating, immunity, and family conflicts. The participants could also be clustered into four different groups that differ in their country of origin and sex, but also in their food choice.

All financial markets, including the cryptocurrency market, belong to the economical sphere of human activity that seems to be the most interrelated and complex. The cryptocurrency market complexity can be studied from different perspectives. First, the dynamics of the cryptocurrency exchange rates to other cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies can be studied and quantified by means of multifractal formalism. Second, coupling and decoupling of the cryptocurrencies and the conventional assets can be investigated with the advanced cross-correlation analyses based on fractal analysis. Third, an internal structure of the cryptocurrency market can also be a subject of analysis that exploits, for example, a network representation of the market. We approach this subject from all three perspectives based on data recorded between January 2019 and June 2020. This period includes the Covid-19 pandemic and we pay particular attention to this event and investigate how strong its impact on the structure and dynamics of the market was. Besides, the studied data covers a few other significant events like double bull and bear phases in 2019. We show that, throughout the considered interval, the exchange rate returns were multifractal with intermittent signatures of bifractality that can be associated with the most volatile periods of the market dynamics like a bull market onset in April 2019 and the Covid-19 outburst in March 2020. The topology of a minimal spanning tree representation of the market also used to alter during these events from a distributed type without any dominant node to a highly centralized type with a dominating hub of USDT.

Physicians still worry, however, about the range of its application and possible complications such as infection of the retained cuff and breakage. We, therefore, applied this technique in patients and enriched its administration for removing PD catheters. Altogether, 24 PD catheter removals in 24 patients were reviewed during the period from July 2018 to October 2019 in our hospital. Using the pull technique, the PD catheter's superficial cuff was dissected using an electronic knife, and the deep cuff was retained. All patients' catheters were successfully removed with no breakage. No incision or retained cuff was infected during the follow-up period (1.1-15.6 months). The appropriate peak force of pull traction was approximately 12-13 pounds, not very different from the mean maximum tensile force of 21.48 pounds for silicone tube breakage. The use of intermittent (rather than sustained) traction may reduce the breakage risk of the silicone tube.

These electret layers are essential for the efficient filtration of difficult-to-capture small particles, yet the exact nature of electrostatic capture with respect to the charge on both the particles and the electret fibres as well as the effect of the immediate environment remain unclear. Here, we explore in detail the electrostatic interactions between the surface of a single charged electret fibre and a model of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatics coupled to a detailed spike protein charge regulation model, we show how pH and salt concentration drastically change both the scale and the sign of the interaction. Furthermore, the configuration of the few spike proteins closest to the electret fibre turns out to be as important for the strength of the interaction as their total number on the virus envelope, a direct consequence of spike protein charge regulation.

Leveraging boundary theory and a dual pathway to creativity model (DPCM), the present study hypothesized that cognitive detachment from work will influence employee creativity in an inverse U-shaped pattern, with cognitive flexibility as a mediator and the boundary condition of intrinsic motivation for creativity being included. Our results, which were gained from a sample of 304 research and development (R&D) employees, indicate that employees' cognitive detachment from work and their degree of creativity possess a curvilinear relationship and that cognitive flexibility is a likely mediator between them. Notably, this inverse U-shaped relationship is significant only if the employees have high intrinsic motivation for creativity.

AIM: To establish womens thoughts on and experience of non-antibiotic treatment for auUTIs. DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative interview study with primary care patients in Oxfordshire, UK, embedded within the Cranberry for Urinary Tract Infection (CUTI) feasibility trial. METHOD: One-to-one, semi-structured interviews were conducted between August 2019 and January 2020 with some CUTI trial participants and some patients who were not part of the CUTI trial who had experienced at least one urinary tract infection (UTI) in the preceding 12 months in Oxfordshire, UK. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: In total, 26 interviews were conducted and analysed. Women expected to receive an immediate antibiotic for their UTI but were aware of the potential harms of this approach. They were keen to find a non-antibiotic, natural alternative that could effectively manage their symptoms. In certain situations (early illness, milder illness, and with no important upcoming engagements), women indicated they would be prepared to postpone antibiotic treatment by up to 3 days, especially if offered an interim non-antibiotic option with perceived therapeutic potential. CONCLUSION: Many women with auUTIs are open to trying non-antibiotic treatments first in certain situations. There is scope for more dialogue between primary care clinicians and patients with auUTI around delaying antibiotic treatment and using non-antibiotic options initially, which could reduce antibiotic consumption for this common infection.","output":"Non-antibiotic treatment of acute urinary tract infection in primary care: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic has induced entire cities in China placed under 'mass quarantine'.

However, these associations disappeared in the women with positive TPOAb (p > 0.05). Additionally, we found associations between daily reported new case of COVID-19 and maternal FT4 for single-day lag1, lag3 and multi-day lag01 and lag04 when adjusting for the covariates (each p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Mass confinement as a primary community control strategy may have a significant cost to public health resources. Access to health service systems and adequate medical resources should be improved for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The association between COVID-19 pandemic and maternal isolated hypothyroxinemia in first and second trimesters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As one of the foundations of existential positive psychology, self-transcendence can bring positive intrapersonal and interpersonal outcomes, especially in the COVID-19 era in which people are suffering huge mental stress Based on Schwartz's theory of human basic values, the current study combines variable-centered and person-centered approaches to examine the relationships between adolescents' values and mental health across two regions in China The results generally showed that (1) both self-enhancement and conservation values were positively correlated with depression and loneliness, while both self-transcendence and openness to change values negatively correlated with depression and loneliness The results also showed that (2) there were four value clusters (i e , self-focus, other-focus, anxiety-free, undifferentiated), and, compared to adolescents in the self-focus and undifferentiated values cluster, all adolescents in the anxiety-free values cluster reported lower depression and loneliness, while all adolescents in the other-focus values cluster reported higher depression and loneliness The differences between the two regional groups only emerged in depression Specifically, adolescents in Shanghai have higher levels of depression than adolescents in Qingdao This study provides some evidence for the new science of self-transcendence among adolescents and also sheds light on how we may improve the level of mental health during the COVID-19 era","output":"The Benefits of Self-Transcendence: Examining the Role of Values on Mental Health Among Adolescents Across Regions in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown on frail populations with advanced Parkinson disease (APD) and their caregivers may present with peculiar features and require specific interventions. METHODS: We enrolled here 100 APD patients and 60 caregivers. Seventy-four patients were treated with device-aided therapies (DAT) and 26 with standard medical treatment (SMT). Through a telephonic interview, subjects underwent the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A; HADS-D), and an ad hoc questionnaire to explore thoughts and emotions related to the pandemic. RESULTS: Depression was observed in 35% of APD patients and anxiety in 39%, with a significant reduction of the latter after the lockdown (p= 0.023). We found a significant correlation between the type of therapy and the HADS-A score (p= 0.004). Patients' main worries were as follows: a possible higher risk of COVID-19 infection (25%), interruption of non-pharmacological treatments (35%), interruption of outpatient clinics (38%), PD complications related to COVID-19 (47%). Patients treated with DAT manifested worries about device-related issues and risk for caregivers' infection. The 40% of caregivers showed anxiety, while the 21.7% of them showed depression.

Currently, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and computed tomography (CT) scanning are clinically prescribed for COVID-19 detection across the globe. AREAS COVERED: This systematic review is focused on currently used diagnostic methods for COVID-19 detection and their future prospects. Online searches on Google Scholar, PubMed and online resources were conducted on the period of year 2017 to mid-2020. Studies investigating laboratory examinations, radiographical analysis, and potential sensors for COVID-19 detection were included. Along with this, the current status of commercially available kits for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus detection is discussed. EXPERT OPINION: The search has identified the potential applications of nucleic acid technology, diagnostics radiology examinations, and in-vitro diagnostic kits in detection of COVID-19 infections.

Canada was uniquely positioned to transition to telemedicine because internationally common restrictions on abortion medication were removed before the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize the experiences of abortion health care professionals in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of the pandemic response on abortion services. METHODS: We conducted a sequential mixed methods study between July 2020 and January 2021. We invited physicians, nurse practitioners and administrators to participate in a cross-sectional survey containing an open-ended question about the impact of the pandemic response on abortion care. We employed an inductive codebook thematic analysis, which informed the development of a second, primarily quantitative survey. RESULTS: Our initial survey had 307 respondents and our second had 78. Fifty-three percent were family physicians. Our first survey found respondents considered abortion access essential. We identified three key topicss: access to abortion care was often maintained despite pandemic-related challenges (e.g. difficulty obtaining tests, additional costs); change of practice to low-touch medication abortion care and provider perceptions of patient experience, including shifting demand, telemedicine acceptability and increased rural access. The second survey indicated uptake of telemedicine medication abortion among 89% of participants except in Quebec, where regulations meant procedures were nearly exclusively surgical. Restrictions did not delay care according to 76% of participants. CONCLUSIONS: Canadian health care professionals report their facilities deemed abortion an essential service. Provinces and territories, except Quebec, described a robust pandemic transition to telemedicine to ensure access to services.

It has resulted in loss of thousands of lives globally and has brought countries to the brink of economic, social, and health collapse. A major issue of this infection is the ease with which it transmits through salivary droplets and its survival for long durations outside the body. Therefore, its early detection is critical in prevention, diagnostic, and management efforts of COVID-19 patients. Loss of taste and smell is one of the early symptoms reported in these patients and the virus is abundantly found in the salivary secretion of the infected symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Infection and inflammation of salivary glands are common among viral infections, particularly in the early stages, which lead to salivary composition changes. Chemosensory sensation of taste is critically dependent on the salivary flow rate and its inorganic constituents, protein levels, specific 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate and 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels, ghrelins, pH levels, and enzymes.

METHODS: We conducted a discrete choice experiment alternative, a separated adaptive dual response. We chose this approach to reduce extreme response behavior, considering the emotionally-charged topic of health data sales, and to measure willingness to accept. Previous experiments in lab settings led to demands for high monetary compensation. After a first online survey and two pre-studies, we validated four attributes for the final online study: monthly bonus payment, stakeholder handling the data (e.g., health insurer, pharmaceutical or medical device companies, universities), type of data, and data sales to third parties. We used a random utility framework to evaluate individual choice preferences. To test the expected prices of the main study for robustness, we assigned respondents randomly to one of two identical questionnaires with varying price ranges. RESULTS: Over a period of three weeks, 842 respondents participated in the main survey, and 272 respondents participated in the second survey. The participants considered transparency about data processing and no further data sales to third parties as very important to the decision to share data with different stakeholders, as well as adequate monetary compensation. Price expectations resulting from the experiment were high; pharmaceutical and medical device companies would have to pay an average digital dividend of 237.30/month for patient generated health data of all types. We also observed an anchor effect, which means that people formed price expectations during the process and not ex ante. We found a bimodal distribution between relatively low price expectations and relatively high price expectations, which shows that personal data selling is a divisive societal issue. However, the results indicate that a digital dividend could be an accepted economic incentive system to gather large-scale, self-tracked data for research and development purposes. After the COVID-19 crisis, price expectations might change due to public sensitization to the need for big data research on patient generated health data. CONCLUSION: A continuing success of existing data donation models is highly unlikely. The health care sector needs to develop transparency and trust in data processing. An adequate digital dividend could be an effective long-term measure to convince a diverse and large group of people to share high-quality, continuous data for research purposes.","output":"Pricing through health apps generated dataDigital dividend as a game changer: Discrete choice experiment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main objective of the current paper was to design an automatic arterial puncture sensorial device to facilitate a fast extraction of arterial blood gas sampling from radial artery during Covid-19 pandemic COVID 19 (Coronavirus) pandemic has generated surge demand for essential healthcare equipment, medicines along with the requirement for medical examination equipment Cannulation of the radial artery can sometimes be difficult and require multiple attempts, which prolongs the time required for the procedure and this is not indicated in a COVID-19 pandemic Within this paper we provide a detailed description of a novel device for fast radial artery puncture, developed for use during the COVID-19 Pandemic, when the contact of medical staff with the infected patient must be minimal The proposed concept of the device allows the immobilization of the upper limb of the patient in the appropriate position, facilitates the precise identification of the position of the radial artery even in a situation of low peripheral pulse, allows visualization of the subcutaneous area of the vein plane in the analyzed area to avoid puncturing them and maintains needle orientation at a precise angle to the central horizontal plane of the patients forearm Thus, the proposed of AUSmart-Astrup concept creates prerequisites for reducing the time needed for arterial blood sampling, increased the efficiency of the medical procedure, provides ergonomics for the medical staff, and increased safety in the context of COVID-19 pandemic ? 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"Automatic Arterial Puncture Sensorial Device for Fast Arterial Blood Gas Sampling from Radial Artery During Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heated and hydrated naturally occurring dolomite showed very strong antiviral activity.

Our recent studies showed that Listeria monocytogenes limits immune detection and IFN- synthesis via deacetylation of its peptidoglycan, which renders the bacterium resistant to lysozyme degradation. Here, we examined signaling requirements for the massive IFN- production resulting from the infection of murine macrophages with a mutant strain of L. monocytogenes, pgdA, which is unable to modify its peptidoglycan. We report the identification of unconventional signaling pathways to the IFN- gene, requiring TLR2 and bacterial internalization. Induction of IFN- was independent of the Mal/TIRAP adaptor protein but required TRIF and the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7. These pathways were stimulated to a lesser degree by wild-type L. monocytogenes. They operated in both resident and inflammatory macrophages derived from the peritoneal cavity, but not in bone marrow-derived macrophages. The novelty of our findings thus lies in the first description of TLR2 and TRIF as two critical components leading to the induction of the IFN- gene and in uncovering that individual macrophage populations adopt different strategies to link pathogen recognition signals to IFN- gene expression.","output":"Both TLR2 and TRIF Contribute to Interferon- Production during Listeria Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) are antimalarial drugs recently reported to be active against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus- 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is causing the global COVID-19 pandemic.

We found that the catalytic subunit of the RdRp, nsp12, ligates two iron-sulfur metal cofactors in sites that were modeled as zinc centers in the available cryo-electron microscopy structures of the RdRp complex. These metal binding sites are essential for replication and for interaction with the viral helicase. Oxidation of the clusters by the stable nitroxide TEMPOL caused their disassembly, potently inhibited the RdRp, and blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture.

SARS-CoV-2 is known to use its spike glycoprotein to interact with the cell surface as a first step in the infection process. As for other coronaviruses, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 next undergoes endocytosis, but whether or not this is required for infectivity, and the precise endocytic mechanism used are unknown. Using purified spike glycoprotein and lentivirus pseudotyped with spike glycoprotein, a common model of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, we now demonstrate that following engagement with the plasma membrane, SARS-CoV-2 undergoes rapid, clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This suggests that transfer of viral RNA to the cell cytosol occurs from the lumen of the endosomal system. Importantly, we further demonstrate that knockdown of clathrin-heavy chain, which blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis, reduces viral infectivity. These discoveries reveal that SARS-CoV-2 uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis to gain access into cells and suggests that this process is a key aspect of virus infectivity.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infects cells following viral entry via clathrin-mediated endocytosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background There are no data on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Africa though the COVID-19 epidemic curve and reported mortality differ from patterns seen elsewhere. We estimated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence among blood donors in Kenya. Methods We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG prevalence by ELISA on residual blood donor samples obtained between April 30 and June 16, 2020. Assay sensitivity and specificity were 83% (95% CI 59, 96%) and 99.0% (95% CI 98.1, 99.5%), respectively. National seroprevalence was estimated using Bayesian multilevel regression and post-stratification to account for non-random sampling with respect to age, sex and region, adjusted for assay performance. Results Complete data were available for 3098 of 3174 donors, aged 15-64 years. By comparison with the Kenyan population, the sample over-represented males (82% versus 49%), adults aged 25-34 years (40% versus 27%) and residents of coastal Counties (49% versus 9%). Crude overall seroprevalence was 5.6% (174/3098). Population-weighted, test-adjusted national seroprevalence was 5.2% (95% CI 3.7, 7.1%). Seroprevalence was highest in the 3 largest urban Counties; Mombasa (9.3% [95% CI 6.4, 13.2%)], Nairobi (8.5% [95% CI 4.9, 13.5%]) and Kisumu (6.5% [95% CI 3.3, 11.2%]). Conclusions We estimate that 1 in 20 adults in Kenya had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during the study period. By the median date of our survey, only 2093 COVID-19 cases and 71 deaths had been reported through the national screening system. This contrasts, by several orders of magnitude, with the numbers of cases and deaths reported in parts of Europe and America when seroprevalence was similar.","output":"Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in Kenyan blood donors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer causes a considerable amount of mortality in the world, while arthritis is an immunological dysregulation with multifactorial pathogenesis including genetic and environmental defects. Both conditions have inflammation as a part of their pathogenesis. Resistance to anticancer and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) happens frequently through the generation of energy-dependent transporters, which lead to the expulsion of cellular drug contents. Thymoquinone (TQ) is a bioactive molecule with anticancer as well as anti-inflammatory activities via the downregulation of several chemokines and cytokines. Nevertheless, the pharmacological importance and therapeutic feasibility of thymoquinone are underutilized due to intrinsic pharmacokinetics, including short half-life, inadequate biological stability, poor aqueous solubility, and low bioavailability. Owing to these pharmacokinetic limitations of TQ, nanoformulations have gained remarkable attention in recent years. Therefore, this compilation intends to critically analyze recent advancements in rheumatoid arthritis and cancer delivery of TQ. This literature search revealed that nanocarriers exhibit potential results in achieving targetability, maximizing drug internalization, as well as enhancing the anti-inflammatory and anticancer efficacy of TQ. Additionally, TQ-NPs (thymoquinone nanoparticles) as a therapeutic payload modulated autophagy as well as enhanced the potential of other drugs when given in combination. Moreover, nanoformulations improved pharmacokinetics, drug deposition, using EPR (enhanced permeability and retention) and receptor-mediated delivery, and enhanced anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties.

Anticipating the consequences of delayed cleft care and the additional burden this would cause families, we reassessed our risk-stratification and perioperative algorithms. We hypothesized we could safely optimize nasolabial repair without burdening our care systems and without increasing COVID-19-related morbidity/mortality. METHODS Our multidisciplinary cleft team reevaluated patient selection to maximize surgical impact. Perioperative protocols were adjusted, and COVID-19 preoperative testing was utilized before nasolabial repair and prior to suture removal under anesthesia. RESULTS Early in the pandemic, unilateral cleft repair was prioritized and successfully completed on 9 patients. There were no complications related to COVID-19. Nasoalveolar molding clinic was reopened after total patient volume was significantly decreased. CONCLUSIONS We offer an approach for surgical management of nasolabial clefts during a global pandemic.

The sudden interruption in schooling and the pandemic itself caused parents to be anxious and even to panic. Mobile-based parenting skills education has been demonstrated to be an effective method for improving the psychological well-being of mothers with children with autism. However, whether it can improve the psychological states of mothers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is a subject that should be urgently investigated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of WeChat-based parenting training on anxiety, depression, parenting stress, and hope in mothers with children with autism, as well as the feasibility of the program during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental trial. A total of 125 mothers with preschool children with autism were recruited in January 2020. The participants were assigned to the control group (n=60), in which they received routine care, or the intervention group (n=65), in which they received the 12-week WeChat-based parenting training plus routine care, according to their preferences. Anxiety, depression, parenting stress, hope, satisfaction, and adherence to the intervention were measured at three timepoints: baseline (T0), postintervention (T1), and a 20-week follow-up (T2). RESULTS: In total, 109 mothers completed the T1 assessment and 104 mothers completed the T2 assessment. The results of the linear mixed model analysis showed statistically significant group  time interaction effects for the intervention on anxiety (F=14.219, P<.001), depression (F=26.563, P<.001), parenting stress (F=68.572, P<.001), and hope (F=197.608, P<.001). Of all mothers in the intervention group, 90.4% (48.8/54) reported that they were extremely satisfied with the WeChat-based parenting training. In total, 40.0% (26/65) logged their progress in home training each week and 61.5% (40/65) logged their progress more than 80% of the time for all 20 weeks.

The three-day interval of changing heat and moisture exchangers is ideal in a cardiothoracic surgery intensive care unit where patients have more airway secretions than patients in the general intensive care unit.","output":"Heat and moisture exchanger used in a cardiothoracic surgery intensive care unit: Airway resistance and changing interval."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been reported as a worldwide emergency.

Every year the number of publications and patents based on this polymer increase. Chitosan exhibits poor solubility in neutral and basic media, limiting its use in such conditions. Another serious obstacle is directly related to its natural origin. Chitosan is not a single polymer with a defined structure but a family of molecules with differences in their composition, size, and monomer distribution. These properties have a fundamental effect on the biological and technological performance of the polymer. Moreover, some of the biological properties claimed are discrete. In this review, we discuss how chitosan chemistry can solve the problems related to its poor solubility and can boost the polymer properties. We focus on some of the main biological properties of chitosan and the relationship with the physicochemical properties of the polymer. Then, we review two polymer applications related to green processes: the use of chitosan in the green synthesis of metallic nanoparticles and its use as support for biocatalysts.

We aimed to describe and analyze the perceptions and experiences of undergraduate medical students and faculty members as a consequence of this educational shift so as to identify the key elements for successful online medical learning. METHODS: A convergent mixed methods design was employed, using both quantitative and qualitative data collected successively through Phase 1: Online teaching follow-up program; Phase 2: Discussion groups (two focus groups and a nominal group with students and faculty, respectively) and a survey of students from first to fifth year; and Phase 3: Triangulation of qualitative and quantitative data. RESULTS: Thirteen strongly interconnected categories were identified. Four of them played an organizational role: course planning, coordination, communication, and pedagogical coherence. The remaining nine categories were learning outcomes, teaching methodology, online resources, evaluation, time management, workload, student motivation, participation, and teacher-student relationship. Among the key aspects of learning were those that promoted rapport between faculty and students, such as synchronous sessions, especially those based on clinical cases. CONCLUSIONS: Promoting student motivation and participation at all levels were the main lessons learned for enhancing online learning and teaching experiences in undergraduate medical education. Key elements to reach this goal are, among others, planning, coordination, communication, and pedagogical coherence.

The laboratory methods available are antigen tests that can be read in a few minutes or more lengthy RT-PCR methods in a lab. Swabs are carried out by physicians, medical staff, laypeople and in the self-test, in each case according to prior instructions. Many of these factors therefore have an influence on the informative value and the sensitivity of the entire diagnostic process. The PCR laboratory method is more sensitive than the antigen method; the swabs from the nasopharynx are considered the most valid smear site; correct execution of a test can be achieved even with non-professional individuals with good instructions. Complications with such swabs are reported very rarely, given the assumed number of procedures performed. Short-term nosebleeds after traumatic smears can be assumed without publications about it being found. Broken parts of swabs had to be removed by an ENT doctor.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective monocentric study on anti-spike protein antibody response in pwMS who had received vaccination for Sars-Cov2. Adverse events following vaccination were also recorded. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty pwMS were included: 83 females (69%); median age at vaccination 42 years (range 21C73); 112/120 patients (93%) were receiving DMTs at vaccination. Anti-spike protein IgG antibodies were detectable in 102/120 (85%) cases overall, being the proportion lower in pwMS receiving anti-CD20 antibodies (14/31, 45%) compared to non-depletive treatments (77/78, 99%), p < 0.0001. Median anti-spike titre was lower in anti-CD20 antibodies and fingolimod-treated pwMS compared to those receiving other DMTs, and it correlated with anti-CD20 treatment duration (R ? 0.93, p < 0.0001) and with age at vaccination in pwMS not receiving depletive treatments (R ? 0.25, p = 0.028). Baseline CD19+ cell count (where available) was higher in the responder group than in non-responders, p < 0.0001. Two symptomatic COVID-19 infections were diagnosed over a median follow-up of 5 months (range 2C7); adverse events were aligned with the published literature. CONCLUSION: Antibody response to anti-COVID-19 vaccines was detected in most of the pwMS analysed, but frequency of responders was reduced in those receiving CD20 depleting therapies compared to other DMTs-treated pwMS. Investigations on cell-mediated immune response are needed to assess whether a protective immune response is elicited also in non-antibody responders.","output":"Effect of disease-modifying treatments on antibody-mediated response to anti-COVID19 vaccination in people with multiple sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Maharashtra is heralded as one of the economically advanced states, but this illusion crashed under the attack of Covid-19 virus and economic deterioration is expected to follow It is argued here that the state policy dished out a raw deal to the agricultural sector and set the sector under severe stress The path of this retrogression, reasons behind the trends and the possible policy platform for the last six decades are traced Stagnation has gripped the agricultural sector, and it is losing cultivable land to other uses This is accompanied by a sharp increase in small and marginal holdings Surprisingly, the state has no agricultural policy document in place and the sector largely depends on only sporadic firefighting approaches with a policy paralysis","output":"Development challenges for agriculture in Maharashtra"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bleeding is a consequence of insufficient hemostasis and excessive bleeding at a surgical site is associated with an increased risk of post-operative infection, transfusion and re-operation, in addition to increased hospital length of stay and costs.

Hemostatic powders are a sub-group of topical hemostats, which can be used in helping as adjuncts to manage troublesome bleeding in a variety of situations. As this technology is relatively new and potentially not well known by the broad surgical community, no specific guidelines or recommendations for the optimal use of hemostatic powders in surgery currently exist. A steering group throughout Europe of multidisciplinary surgeons, expert in hemostasis and hemostatics, identified from literature and from personal experience, five key topics. When to use hemostatic powder, the evidence for use, benefits of use, safety remarks and considerations in various surgical specialties. Thirty-seven statements were subsequently drawn from these five key topics. An online survey was sent to 128 high-volume surgeons working in breast surgery, gynaecological and obstetric surgery, general and emergency surgery, thoracic surgery and urological surgery in Europe to assess agreement (consensus) with these statements. Consensus was defined as high if  75% and very high if  90% of respondents agreed with a statement.

At present, no established biomarkers exist to support diagnosis for respiratory viral infections and more importantly for severe IV disease. Studies in animal models are extremely important to understand the biological, genetic, and environmental factors that contribute to severe IV disease and to validate biomarker candidates from human studies. However, mouse human cross-species comparisons are often compromised by the fact that animal studies concentrate on the infected lungs, whereas in humans almost all studies use peripheral blood from patients. In addition, human studies do not consider genetic background as variable although human populations are genetically very diverse. Therefore, in this study, we performed a cross-species gene expression study of the peripheral blood from human patients and from the highly genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population after IV infection. Our results demonstrate that changes of gene expression in individual genes are highly similar in mice and humans. The top-regulated genes in humans were also differentially regulated in mice. We conclude that the mouse is a highly valuable in vivo model system to validate and to discover gene candidates which can be used as biomarkers in humans.

To better target antimicrobial therapy, control and prevention towards the involved pathogens, there is a growing interest in microbiological tests on respiratory samples. However, these tests are time consuming, cost money and sampling might compromise animal welfare. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to develop immediately applicable decision trees for pathogen identification in outbreaks of bovine respiratory disease based on circumstantial factors. Data from a cross sectional study, involving 201 outbreaks of bovine respiratory disease in dairy and beef farms between 2016 and 2019 was used. Pathogens were identified by a semi-quantitative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) on a pooled non-endoscopic broncho-alveolar lavage sample from clinically affected animals. Potential risk factors of involved animals, environment, management and housing were obtained by enquiry. Classification and regression tree analysis was used for decision tree development with cross-validation. Different trees were constructed, involving a general 3-group classification tree (viruses, Mycoplasma bovis or Pasteurellaceae family) and a tree for each single pathogen. The general 3- group classification tree was 52.7 % accurate and had a sensitivity of 81.5 % and a specificity 52.2 % for viruses, respectively 51.7 % and 84.4 % for M. bovis and 28.9 % and 93.6 % for Pasteurellaceae.

For Pasteurella multocida, M. bovis and parainfluenzavirus type 3 no meaningful tree was obtained. The concept and trees are promising, but currently lack sensitivity and specificity in order to be a reliable tool for practice.

We included cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies that reported risk factors of contracting COVID-19 or its outcome in patients with MS on univariate or multivariate regression analyses. Results: Out of the initial 2719 records and 1553 conference abstracts, a total of 20 studies were included. Factors associated with COVID-19 susceptibility were reported in 11 studies and risk factors for infection outcomes were discussed in 10. History of contact with an infected is strongly suggested as a risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility. Other factors that could be associated with contracting infection are younger age, relapsing course, and anti-CD20 agents. The evidence suggests that increasing age, greater MS severity, treatment with anti-CD20 agents, previous use of corticosteroids, and specific comorbidities (obesity and coronary artery disease) could be independently associated with worse infection outcomes. Male sex is likely to be a risk factor for more severe disease. The black or African American race was reported as a possible risk factor.

There is little information about the systemic cytokine status in viral respiratory-infected asthmatic patients compared with non-asthmatic patients. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine changes in circulating cytokines (IL-1, TNF-, IL-4, IL-5) and chemokines (MCP1: monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and RANTES: regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) in patients with an asthmatic versus a non-asthmatic background with respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus or adenovirus respiratory infection. In addition, human monocyte cultures were incubated with respiratory viruses to determine the cytokine/chemokine profiles. PATIENTS/METHODS: Patients with asthmatic (n = 34) and non-asthmatic (n = 18) history and respiratory infections with respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, and adenovirus were studied. Healthy individuals with similar age and sex (n = 10) were used as controls. Cytokine/chemokine content in blood and culture supernatants was determined by ELISA. Monocytes were isolated by Hystopaque gradient and cocultured with each of the above-mentioned viruses. RESULTS: Similar increased cytokine concentrations were observed in asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients. However, higher concentrations of chemokines were observed in asthmatic patients. Virus-infected monocyte cultures showed similar cytokine/chemokine profiles to those observed in the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating cytokine profiles induced by acute viral lung infection were not related to asthmatic status, except for chemokines that were already increased in the asthmatic status.

Abstract Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many questions have come up regarding safe anesthesia management of patients with the disease. Regional anesthesia, whether peripheral nerve or neuraxial, is a safe alternative for managing patients with COVID-19, by choosing modalities that mitigate pulmonary function involvement. Adopting regional anesthesia mitigates adverse effects in the post-operative period and provides safety to patients and teams, as long as there is compliance with individual protection and interpersonal transmission care measures. Respecting contra-indications and judicial use of safety techniques and norms are essential. The present manuscript aims to review the evidence available on regional anesthesia for patients with COVID-19 and offer practical recommendations for safe and efficient performance.","output":"Recomendaes para realizao de anestesia loco-regional durante a pandemia de COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review evaluates the ability of the fibrosis index based on four factors (FIB-4) identifying fibrosis stages, long-time prognosis in chronic liver disease, and short-time outcomes in acute liver injury.

However, a comprehensive understanding of epidemiology of COVID-19 infection in young children under five years, the most at-risk age-group for respiratory infections, remain unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection in children under five years. METHOD: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses , we searched several electronic databases (Pubmed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus) with no language restriction for published epidemiological studies and case-reports reporting laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection in children under five years until June 4, 2020. We assessed pooled prevalence for key demographics and clinical characteristics using Freeman-Tukey double arcsine random-effects model for studies except case-reports. We evaluated risk of bias separately for case-reports and other studies. RESULTS: We identified 1,964 articles, of which, 65 articles were eligible for systematic review that represented 1,214 children younger than five years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. The pooled estimates showed that 50% young COVID-19 cases were infants (95% CI: 36% ? 63%, 27 studies); 53% were male (95% CI: 41% ? 65%, 24 studies); 43% were asymptomatic (95% CI: 15% ? 73%, 9 studies) and 7% (95% CI: 0% ? 30%, 5 studies) had severe disease that required intensive-care-unit admission. Of 139 newborns from COVID-19 infected mothers, five (3.6%) were COVID-19 positive. There was only one death recorded. DISCUSSION: This systematic review reports the largest number of children younger than five years with COVID-19 infection till date. Our meta-analysis shows nearly half of young COVID-19 cases were asymptomatic and half were infants, highlighting the need for ongoing surveillance to better understand the epidemiology, clinical pattern, and transmission of COVID-19 to develop effective preventive strategies against COVID-19 disease in young paediatric population.","output":"Epidemiology of COVID-19 infection in young children under five years: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Besides reducing the quality of obstetric care, the direct impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and postpartum is uncertain.

Here, we report the anti-HBV activity of Euphorbia schimperi and its quercetin (QRC) and kaempferol derivatives. The anti-HBV-active methanol fraction of E. schimperi was subjected to chromatographic techniques, leading to isolation of three flavonols, following their structure determination by (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopies. Their cytotoxicity and anti-HBV potential were assessed using HBV reporter HepG2.2.15 cells, and their modes of action were delineated by molecular docking. The isolated compounds identified as quercetin-3-O-glucuronide (Q3G), quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside (Q3R), and kaempferol-3-O-glucuronide (K3G) were non-cytotoxic to HepG2.2.15 cells. The viral HBsAg/HBeAg production on day 5 was significantly inhibited by K3G (70.2/73.4%), Q3G (67.8/72.1%), and Q3R (63.2%/68.2%) as compared to QRC (70.3/74.8%) and lamivudine (76.5/84.5%) used as standards. The observed in vitro anti-HBV potential was strongly supported by in silico analysis, which suggested their structure-based activity via interfering with viral Pol/RT and core proteins.

The international scientific community, following World Health Organization (WHO) indications, launched different trials for testing drugs putatively able to block the SARS-CoV-2 infection or treat the COVID-19 disease symptoms. In parallel, studies devoted to a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology are in the course for designing an effective vaccine. One of the human membrane proteins known to be docked by the virus is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), proposed to be responsible for viral entry in target cells. Recently, the 3D structure of ACE2 has been obtained, showing its physical interaction with B0AT1 (SLC6A19), a plasma membrane transporter involved in the trafficking of amino acids in cells. The receptor targeted by SARS-CoV-2 is a supercomplex formed by a dimer of ACE2-B0AT1, in which ACE2 binds the viral protein and B0AT1 stabilizes the heterodimer. As a serendipity occurrence, nimesulide was shown to abolish the transport function of B0AT1.

However, the ability of a vaccine to prevent infection or disease depends critically on protecting older individuals, who are at highest risk of severe disease. OBJECTIVE: We quantitatively estimated the relative benefits of COVID-19 vaccines, in terms of preventing infection and death, with a particular focus on effectiveness in elderly people. DESIGN: We applied compartmental mathematical modelling to determine the relative effects of vaccines that block infection and onward transmission, and those that prevent severe disease. We assumed that vaccines showing high efficacy in adults would be deployed, and examined the effects of lower vaccine efficacy among the elderly population. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Our mathematical model was calibrated to simulate the course of an epidemic among the entire population of British Columbia, Canada. Within our model, the population was structured by age and levels of contact. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): We assessed the effectiveness of possible vaccines in terms of the predicted number of infections within the entire population, and deaths among people aged 65 years and over. RESULTS: In order to reduce the overall rate of infections in the population, high rates of deployment to all age groups will be critical. However, to substantially reduce mortality among people aged 65 years and over, a vaccine must directly protect a high proportion of people in that group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Effective vaccines deployed to a large fraction of the population are projected to substantially reduce infection in an otherwise susceptible population. However, even if transmission were blocked highly effectively by vaccination of children and younger adults, overall mortality would not be substantially reduced unless the vaccine is also directly protective in elderly people. We strongly recommend: (i) the inclusion of people aged 65 years and over in future trials of COVID-19 vaccine candidates; (ii) careful monitoring of vaccine efficacy in older age groups following vaccination.","output":"Importance of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy in older age groups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coal is an important basic energy source, widely distributed throughout the world, but resource abundance is uneven.

The neck domain of these proteins drives multimerization, which is believed to be required for efficient recognition of multivalent ligands. The neck domain of DC-SIGN consists of seven sequence repeats with rare variations. In contrast, the DC-SIGNR neck domain is polymorphic and, in addition to the wild type (wt) allele with seven repeat units, allelic forms with five and six sequence repeats are frequently found. A potential association of the DC-SIGNR genotype and risk of HIV-1 infection is currently under debate. Therefore, we investigated if DC-SIGNR alleles with five and six repeat units exhibit defects in pathogen capture. Here, we show that wt DC-SIGNR and patient derived alleles with five and six repeats bind viral glycoproteins, augment viral infection and tetramerize with comparable efficiency. Moreover, coexpression of wt DC-SIGNR and alleles with five repeats did not decrease the interaction with pathogens compared to expression of each allele alone, suggesting that potential formation of hetero-oligomers does not appreciably reduce pathogen binding, at least under conditions of high expression. Thus, our results do not provide evidence for diminished pathogen capture by DC-SIGNR alleles with five and six repeat units. Albeit, we cannot exclude that subtle, but in vivo relevant differences remained undetected, our analysis suggests that indirect mechanisms could account for the association of polymorphisms in the DC-SIGNR neck region with reduced risk of HIV-1 infection.","output":"Impact of polymorphisms in the DC-SIGNR neck domain on the interaction with pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thrombus formation remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.

Planners anticipated the possibility of a pandemic involving high mortality, high health care demands, rates of absenteeism rising up to 20-30% among health care workers, rationing of health care, and extraordinary psychological stress. METHOD The intervention we describe emerged from the recognition that an expected influenza pandemic indicated a need to build resilience to maintain the health of individuals within the organization and to protect the capacity of the organization to respond to extraordinary demands. Training sessions were one component of a multifaceted approach to reducing stress through effective preparation and served as an evidence based platform for our hospital's response to the H1N1 pandemic. RESULTS The training was delivered to more than 1250 hospital staff representing more than 22 departments within the hospital. The proportion of participants who felt better able to cope after the session (76%) was significantly higher than the proportion who felt prepared to deal confidently with the pandemic before the session (35%). Ten key themes emerged from our qualitative analysis of written comments, including family-work balance, antiviral prophylaxis, and mistrust or fear towards health care workers. CONCLUSIONS Drawing on what we learned from the impact of SARS on our hospital, we had the opportunity to improve our organization's preparedness for the pandemic. Our results suggest that an evidence-based approach to interventions that target known mediators of distress and meet standards of continuing professional development is not only possible and relevant, but readily supportable by senior hospital administration.","output":"Resilience training for hospital workers in anticipation of an influenza pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nondermatophyte molds (NDM) onychomycosis is often difficult to diagnose as NDMs have been considered contaminants of nails. There are several diagnostic methods used to identify NDMs, however, repeated laboratory isolation at different time points is recommended to validate pathogenicity. With NDM and mixed infection (dermatophytes plus NDM) onychomycosis on the rise, accurate clinical diagnosis along with mycological tests are recommended. Systemic antifungal agents such as itraconazole and terbinafine (e.g. pulse regimen: 1 pulse = every day for one week, followed by no treatment for three weeks) have shown efficacy in treating onychomycosis caused by various NDM pathogens such as Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, and Onychocola canadensis. Studies investigating topical therapy and devices for NDM onychomycosis treatment are limited. The emergence of antifungal resistance necessitates the incorporation of antifungal susceptibility testing into diagnosis, when possible, for the management of recalcitrant infections. Case studies documented in the literature show newer azoles such as posaconazole and voriconazole as sometimes effective in treating resistant NDM onychomycosis following determination of their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. Treatment with broad-spectrum antifungal agents (e.g. itraconazole and efinaconazole) and other combination therapy (oral+oral and/or oral+topical) may be considerations in the management of NDM onychomycosis.","output":"Nondermatophyte Mold Onychomycosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treated in hospital emergency departments (EDs) in Spain, and to assess associations between characteristics and outcomes MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective, multicenter, nested-cohort study Sixty-one EDs included a random sample of all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 1 and April 30, 2020 Demographic and baseline health information, including concomitant conditions;clinical characteristics related to the ED visit and complementary test results;and treatments were recorded throughout the episode in the ED We calculated crude and adjusted odds ratios for risk of in-hospital death and a composite outcome consisting of the following events: intensive care unit admission, orotracheal intubation or mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death The logistic regression models were constructed with 3 groups of independent variables: the demographic and baseline health characteristics, clinical characteristics and complementary test results related to the ED episode, and treatments RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of patients was 62 (18) years Most had high- or low-grade fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and diarrhea The most common concomitant conditions were cardiovascular diseases, followed by respiratory diseases and cancer Baseline patient characteristics that showed a direct and independent association with worse outcome (death and the composite outcome) were age and obesity Clinical variables directly associated with worse outcomes were impaired consciousness and pulmonary crackles;headache was inversely associated with worse outcomes Complementary test findings that were directly associated with outcomes were bilateral lung infiltrates, lymphopenia, a high platelet count, a D-dimer concentration over 500 mg/dL, and a lactate-dehydrogenase concentration over 250 IU/L in blood CONCLUSION: This profile of the clinical characteristics and comorbidity of patients with COVID-19 treated in EDs helps us predict outcomes and identify cases at risk of exacerbation The information can facilitate preventive measures and improve outcomes OBJETIVO: Describir las caracteristicas clinicas de los pacientes con COVID-19 atendidos en los servicios de urgencias hospitalarios (SUH) espanoles y evaluar su asociacion con los resultados de su evolucion METODO: Estudio multicentrico, anidado en una cohorte prospectiva Participaron 61 SUH que incluyeron pacientes seleccionados aleatoriamente de todos los diagnosticados de COVID-19 entre el 1 de marzo y el 30 de abril de 2020 Se recogieron caracteristicas basales, clinicas, de exploraciones complementarias y terapeuticas del episodio en los SUH Se calcularon las odds ratio (OR) asociadas a la mortalidad intrahospitalaria y al evento combinado formado por el ingreso en unidad de cuidados intensivos (UCI), la intubacion orotraqueal o ventilacion mecanica invasiva (IOT/ VMI), crudas y ajustadas con modelos de regresion logistica para tres grupos de variables independientes: basales, clinicas y de exploraciones complementarias RESULTADOS: La edad media fue de 62 anos (DE 18) La mayoria manifestaron fiebre, tos seca, disnea, febricula y diarrea Las comorbilidades mas frecuentes fueron las enfermedades cardiovasculares, seguidas de las respiratorias y el cancer Las variables basales que se asociaron independientemente y de forma directa a peores resultados evolutivos (tanto a mortalidad como a evento combinado) fueron edad y obesidad;las variables clinicas fueron disminucion de consciencia y crepitantes a la auscultacion pulmonar, y de forma inversa cefalea;y las variables de resultados de exploraciones complementarias fueron infiltrados pulmonares bilaterales y cardiomegalia radiologicos, y linfopenia, hiperplaquetosis, dimero-D &gt;

The infection is considered as one of the deadliest ones although the mortality rate is not very high. COVID-19 infection is being caused by SARS-CoV2 which is termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus. To prevent the community, transfer among the masses, testing plays an important role. Efficient and quicker testing techniques helps in identification of infected person which makes it easier for to isolate the patient. Deep learning methods have proved their presence and effectiveness in medical image analysis and in the identification of some of the diseases like pneumonia. Authors have been proposed a deep learning mechanism and system to identify the COVID-19 infected patient on analyzing the X-ray images. Symptoms in the COVID-19 infection is well similar to the symptoms occurring in the influenza and pneumonia. The proposed model Inception Nasnet (INASNET) is being able to separate out and classify the X-ray images in the corresponding normal, COVID-19 infected or pneumonia infected classes. This testing method will be a boom for the doctors and for the state as it is a way cheaper method as compared to the other testing kits used by the healthcare workers for the diagnosis of the disease. Continuous analysis by convolutional neural network and regular evaluation will result in better accuracy and helps in eliminating the false-negative results. INASNET is based on the combined platform of InceptionNet and Neural network architecture search which will result in having higher and faster predictions. Regular testing, faster results, economically viable testing using X-ray images will help the front line workers to make a win over COVID-19.","output":"INASNET: Automatic identification of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) based on chest X-ray using deep neural network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A Sociedade Brasileira de Dermatologia (SBD) solicitou aos membros do seu Departamento de Hansenase anlise sobre as possveis interaes do coronavrus com protocolos clnicos de tratamento da hansenase e, a partir de artigos publicados, exp?es suas as principais conclus?es","output":"Combate  Covid: SBD refor?a importancia de pacientes e dermatologistas seguirem protocolo do MS para tratamento da hansenase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reports the intent to receive a SARS-COV-2 vaccine, its predictors and willingness to pay in Bangladesh. We carried out an online cross-sectional survey of 697 adults from the general population of Bangladesh in January 2021. A structured questionnaire was used to assess vaccination intent. The questionnaire included sociodemographic variables and health belief model constructs which may predict vaccination intent. Among the participants, 26% demonstrated a definite intent, 43% probable intent, 24% probable negative, and 7% a definite negative intention. Multivariable logistic regression analyses suggest an association between definite intent and previous COVID-19 infection (OR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.71C4.78), perceiving COVID-19 as serious (OR: 1.93; 1.04C3.59), the belief that vaccination would make them feel less worried about catching COVID-19 (OR: 4.42; 2.25C8.68), and concerns about vaccine affordability (OR: 1.51; 1.01C2.25). Individuals afraid of the side effects (OR: 0.34; 0.21C0.53) and those who would take the vaccine if the vaccine were taken by many others (OR: 0.44; 0.29C0.67) are less likely to have a definite intent. A definite negative intent is associated with the concern that the vaccine may not be halal (OR: 2.03; 1.04C3.96). Furthermore, 68.4% are willing to pay for the vaccine. The median amount that they are willing to pay is USD 7.08.

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been proposed to help guide decision-making for readiness to liberate from MV following a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and prospective observational studies that measured BNP levels at the time of SBT in patients receiving MV. The primary endpoint was successful liberation from MV (absence of reintubation or non-invasive ventilation at 48 h). Statistical analyses included bi-variate and Moses-Littenberg models and DerSimonian-Laird pooling of areas under ROC curve (AUROC). RESULTS: A total of 731 articles were screened. Eighteen adult and 2 pediatric studies were fulfilled pre-specified eligibility. The measure of the relative variation of BNP during SBT (&#916;BNP%) after exclusion of SBT failure by clinical criteria in adults yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 0.889 [0.831-0.929] and 0.828 [0.730-0.896] for successful liberation from MV, respectively, with a pooled AUROC of 0.92 [0.88-0.97]. The pooled AUROC for any method of analysis for absolute variation of BNP (&#916;BNP), pre-SBT BNP, and post-SBT BNP were 0.89 [0.83-0.95], 0.77 [0.63-0.91], and 0.85 [0.80-0.90], respectively. CONCLUSION: The relative change in BNP during a SBT has potential value as an incremental tool after successful SBT to predict successful liberation from MV in adults. There is insufficient data to support the use of BNP in children or as an alternate test to clinical indices of SBT, or the use of &#916;BNP, BNP-pre, and BNP-post as an alternate or incremental test.

Guided ICBT aims to increase a patient's knowledge and competence to better cope with their disorder. Despite the growing evidence supporting the effects of guided ICBT, there is remarkably little research on the different factors that are important for patients to achieve effects from using such digital treatment interventions. Thus, the aim of this study was to conduct a user evaluation of a therapist-guided ICBT program using the updated DeLone and McLean (D&M) model for measuring information systems (IS) success or effectiveness. This model includes the following six dimensions: system quality, information quality, service quality, intention to use and use, user satisfaction, and net benefits (impacts or effect). Ten users of a Norwegian therapist-guided ICBT program for treating anxiety disorders named Assisted Self-Help (Assistert Selvhjelp) participated in phone-based individual interviews. Data were analysed using directed content analysis. Results showed that the participants were quite satisfied with the program's system quality and information quality. However, participants suggested improvements, including in-program instruction, improved visibility of system status, more flexibility regarding automated measurement surveys, and the inclusion of more videos with patient stories. Further, the results indicated a need for improvement in the service quality of guided ICBT introduction, instruction, follow-up, guidance, and support from therapists. The results showed that user friendliness and high educational content might not be sufficient for a therapist-guided ICBT program to be perceived as effective. It might also be necessary for therapists to provide follow-up, guidance, and support that are more in line with individual patient needs. Thus, the results suggest that guided ICBT requires active participation from all involved in the process, including the therapist.","output":"User evaluation of a therapist-guided internet-delivered treatment program for anxiety disorders: A qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To assess PrEP service delivery preferences among Black cis-gender women living in urban and rural settings in Alabama, we conducted a cross-sectional discrete choice experiment survey.

The optimum cutoff value to predict mortality in patient using D-dimer levels on admission was 668 ng/ml (sensitivity 90%, specificity 63.3%, Areas under the ROC curve 0,775). As for D-dimer levels on day 5, it was 1360 ng/ml (sensitivity 100%, specificity 88,6%, Areas under the ROC curve 0.946). The group with D-dimer levels on day 5 > 1360 ng/ml (19 patients) had a worst evolution and a higher incidence of mortality compared to the group with D-dimer < 1360 ng/ml (69 patients) (10/19 vs 0/69, P = 0,0002). Conclusion: D-dimer greater than 1360 ng/ml on day 5 could help clinicians identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage of COVID-19.","output":"Elevated levels of D-dimer in patients with COVID-19: prognosis value"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to continue using highly frequented rooms such as classrooms, seminar rooms, offices, etc., any SARS-CoV-2 virus concentration that may be present must be kept low or reduced through suitable ventilation measures. In this work, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to develop a virtual simulation model for calculating and analysing the viral load due to airborne transmission in indoor environments aiming to provide a temporally and spatially-resolved risk assessment with explicit relation to the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. In this work, the first results of the model and method are presented. In particular, the work focuses on a critical area of the education infrastructure that has suffered severely from the pandemic: classrooms. In two representative classroom scenarios (teaching and examination), the duration of stay for low risk of infection is investigated at different positions in the rooms for the case that one infectious person is present. The results qualitatively agree well with a documented outbreak in an elementary school but also show, in comparisons with other published data, how sensitive the assessment of the infection risk is to the amount of virus emitted on the individual amount of virus required for infection, as well as on the supply air volume. In this regard, the developed simulation model can be used as a useful virtual assessment for a detailed seat-related overview of the risk of infection, which is a significant advantage over established analytical models.","output":"Numerical Flow Simulation on the Virus Spread of SARS-CoV-2 Due to Airborne Transmission in a Classroom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present an unusual case of phalangeal fracture resulting from direct penetration by the barb of a conducted electrical weapon (Taser).

Liver disease is the third commonest cause for death in PEH after accidents and suicides. Some studies have identified chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in up to 50% of this population. Alcohol disorders are also extremely common.MethodsFrom June 2018, a weekly Hepatology clinic was co-located with a primary care clinic serving a population of 2,500 PEH. Blood borne virus testing, near patient HCV RNA testing, transient elastography and anti-viral drug dispensing for Hepatitis B and C was introduced. All patients with HCV were treated in line with national guidelines.ResultsBetween the period of June 2018 and November 2020, 326 patients were reviewed within the Hepatology clinic. A total of 1,236 appointments were offered with 632 attendances (51.1%).241 patients were referred due to a positive HCV Ab test. 193 were RNA positive (80%), 30 RNA negative (12.4%) and 19 had unknown HCV RNA status. Transient elastography was performed on 138 with 31 having advanced fibrosis.Treatment was initiated on 101/193 HCV RNA positive patients. 93 patients were receiving opiate substitution therapy. 65% had a co-existing mental health diagnosis whilst 24% had a significant alcohol intake, 2% were co-infected with Hepatitis B and C and 3% were co-infected with both Hepatitis C and HIV. The genotypes were 44 G1a;3 G1b;6 G2;34 G3;1 G4 and 13 unknown.There is a high rate of sustained virological response (SVR) being achieved with 61 patients having achieved SVR (82%). 13 patients needed to re-start treatment. 37 have SVR 12 pending. 3 patients have relapsed.Of the remaining 92 known RNA positive patients within the clinic, 40 identified within our service have been treated elsewhere during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic. 24 SVR blood tests were performed for the patients treated in other locations. 21 patients are approved to start treatment. 9 are awaiting genotyping and transient elastography. 5 are no longer patients of the primary care clinic and attempts have been made to arrange onward referrals to Hepatology services in their new locations and 5 patients have died.ConclusionPersons experiencing homelessness often have difficulty accessing healthcare. By facilitating access to Hepatology services tailored to their needs at a site where they access primary care and receive opiate substitution therapy, favourable SVR rates can be achieved with significant risk reduction.","output":"Delivery of liver services within primary care can improve treatment outcomes in persons experiencing homelessness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ribavirin is currently the standard of care for treating Lassa fever. However, the human clinical trial data supporting its use suffer from several serious flaws that render the results and conclusions unreliable. We performed a systematic review of available pre-clinical data and human pharmacokinetic data on ribavirin in Lassa. In in-vitro studies, the EC50 of ribavirin ranged from 0.6 g/ml to 21.72 g/ml and the EC90 ranged from 1.5 g/ml to 29 g/ml. The mean EC50 was 7 g/ml and the mean EC90 was 15 g/ml. Human PK data in patients with Lassa fever was sparse and did not allow for estimation of concentration profiles or pharmacokinetic parameters. Pharmacokinetic modelling based on healthy human data suggests that the concentration profiles of current ribavirin regimes only exceed the mean EC50 for less than 20% of the time and the mean EC90 for less than 10% of the time, raising the possibility that the current ribavirin regimens in clinical use are unlikely to reliably achieve serum concentrations required to inhibit Lassa virus replication. The results of this review highlight serious issues with the evidence, which, by today standards, would be unlikely to support the transition of ribavirin from pre-clinical studies to human clinical trials. Additional pre-clinical studies are needed before embarking on expensive and challenging clinical trials of ribavirin in Lassa fever.","output":"Ribavirin for treating Lassa fever: A systematic review of pre-clinical studies and implications for human dosing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Portable and wearable devices can monitor a number of physical performances and lately have been applied to patients with neuromuscular disorders (NMDs). METHODS: We performed a systematic search of literature databases following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) principles, including all studies reporting the use of technological devices for motor function assessment in NMDs from 2000 to 2021. We also summarized the evidence on measurement properties (validity, reliability, responsiveness) of the analyzed technological outcome measures. RESULTS: One hundred studies fulfilled the selection criteria, most of them published in the past 10 years. We defined four categories that gathered similar technologies: gait analysis tools, for clinical assessment of pace and posture; continuous monitoring of physical activity with inertial sensors, which allow \\"unsupervised\\" activity assessment; upper limb evaluation tools, including Kinect-based outcome measures to assess the reachable workspace; and new muscle strength assessment tools, such as Myotools. Inertial sensors have the evident advantage of being applied in the \\"in-home\\" setting, which has become especially appealing during the COVID-19 pandemic, although poor evidence from psychometric property assessment and results of the analyzed studies may limit their research application. Both Kinect-based outcome measures and Myotools have already been validated in multicenter studies and different NMDs, showing excellent characteristics for application in clinical trials.

In addition, WBAN has many issues such as high energy consumption, overhead and latency due to the scarcity in resources, for that we bring edge assisted 5G environment in WBAN. The patient information is sensitive and easily traced by the attackers due to insecurity, for that, we proposed the EiA-H2B model (Edge intelligent Agent Hybrid Hierarchical Blockchain) which includes five phases. Firstly we proposed Biological PUF based sensor authentication, which is a strong credential that provides high security. All the sensors are authenticated by the virtual authenticator that is deployed by a blockchain ledger. Due to the mobility of WBAN, we focused on handover that is done by Bi-Partite One to N matching theory. Secondly, we proposed high voting based virtual clustering, in this phase high voting sensor is elected as a super node and that is used to create a virtual cluster. Thirdly, we proposed duty cycle MAC scheduling protocol is used to predict the original state of the sensors which is done by Attention Matrix based Gated Recurrent Unit (AM-GRU), and then the timeslots are allocated for avoiding packet loss and retransmission. Fourth, we perform relay selection and routing that is done by Global Optimization based Artificial Electric Field Algorithm (AEFA). And finally, we predict emergency data and generate an alert in EiA using Human Learning aided State Action Reward State Action (SARSA) algorithm that finds the current state and predicts the corresponding action. Based on that current state information SARSA provides an efficient recommendation to the patients. Experiments are conducted by OMNeT ++ network simulator and evaluate the performance of the proposed EiA-H2B model in terms of energy consumption, success rate, network throughput, end to end delay, packet loss rate, authentication time and processing time.","output":"Edge Intelligent Agent Assisted Hybrid Hierarchical Blockchain for continuous healthcare monitoring & recommendation system in 5G WBAN-IoT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo O artigo discute a complexidade da pandemia destacando as vrias dimens?es, intrnsecas e extrnsecas envolvidas no desenvolvimento das vacinas contra o SARS-CoV-2, com nfase nos dois produtos mais avan?ados no campo dos testes clnicos S?o eles, a vacina desenvolvida pela Universidade de Oxford associada  farmacutica britanica AstraZeneca e a desenvolvida pela empresa chinesa Sinovac Essa escolha deriva tambm do fato das duas estarem com atividades de testagem e, caso bem-sucedidas, com futura produo no Brasil, respectivamente pelo Bio-Manguinhos, na Fiocruz, e pelo Instituto Butant?, em S?o Paulo Do ponto de vista conceitual, o artigo parte da reflex?o oriunda do campo da Sade Coletiva que trata das fronteiras entre o biolgico e o social Procura ainda demonstrar que, caso sejam bem sucedidas, as vacinas, muito embora importantes ferramentas para o enfrentamento da pandemia, n?o dispensar?o a continuidade de outras medidas n?o farmacolgicas j utilizadas The paper discusses the complex nature of the pandemic by highlighting the various intrinsic and extrinsic dimensions in the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, with an emphasis on the two most advanced products in clinical testing, namely, the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford associated with the British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, and the one developed by Chinese company Sinovac This choice also stems from the fact that both have testing activities, which, if successful, will lead to future production in Brazil, by Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, and the Butant?

Also, the same endpoints were analyzed with concentrations ten times higher to simulate a polluted worst-case scenario. The results showed that the presence of some metals in aquatic environments reduced pejerrey sperm motility (in ~50%) and velocity (in ~30%). These results were obtained using a computer assisted sperm analyzer enforcing the application of this analysis as a tool or bioindicator of aquatic pollution. In addition, fertilization rate was diminished (in ~40%) for all treatments.

There is currently no consensus for the types of PPE that are recommended to be worn by HCWs, nor is there a universal process for the donning and doffing of PPE. METHODS: HCWs from Bellevue Hospital participate in quarterly PPE trainings as part of the Special Pathogens Program (SPP), which consist of didactic sessions as well as an evaluation of donning and doffing techniques. A total of 50 HCWs completed the training curriculum in 2017. During the doffing process, PPE trainers applied corn start powder paint (Chameleon Colors; American Fork, UT) to the participants gloved hands between multiple steps of PPE removal. At the end of the process, the areas where paint was found on was documented including the outer surgical gown, the powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) helmet and shroud, the inner impermeable suit, the knee-high boots and boot covers, and the extended-cuff gloves. RESULTS: The areas of PPE that were most marked with paint were the lower shoulders and upper arms of the surgical gowns, the top sides of the PAPR shroud, the front upper chest area, and the center back of the inner impermeable suits. In a majority of cases no powder paint was noted on the knee-high boots. In a minority of cases, paint was observed on the inside upper chest area of the surgical gown. These paint markings were used to discuss potential breaches in PPE doffing technique in real-time, as well as identify areas to target in future PPE trainings. CONCLUSION: The powdered paint quality improvement process for donning and doffing PPE is a method to evaluate the complex PPE dressing procedure. It is particularly useful given the fact that it is incumbent on each hospital or healthcare system to develop its own processes and procedures for PPE, as well as maintain readiness through periodic trainings. Powdered paint can identify vulnerabilities in their process as well as areas that require further education.

After exclusions, 191 cases were included in final analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were 30-day mortality and postoperative pulmonary complications. Secondary outcomes included Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) on discharge, length of stay (LoS), operative and anaesthetic times and grade of primary surgeon. An exploratory outcome was the SARS-CoV-2 status of patients. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the pandemic and matched cohorts in 30-day mortality, pulmonary complications, discharge GOS, LoS, operative or anaesthetic times. There was a significant difference in the variation of grade of primary surgeon. Only 2.2% (n=5) of patients had a SARS-CoV-2 positive swab. CONCLUSION: During the first UK wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the mortality, morbidity and functional outcomes of operatively managed neurosurgical patients at University Hospitals Birmingham were not significantly affected compared with normal practice. The grade of primary surgeon was significantly more senior and adds to the growing body of evidence that demonstrates how the pandemic has negatively impacted UK surgical training. Mixing COVID-19 positive, unknown and negative cases did not significantly impact on outcomes and indicates that further research is required to support the implementation of evidence-based surgical pathways, such as COVID-light sites, throughout the next stage of the pandemic.","output":"Comparison of outcomes of neurosurgical operations performed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a matched cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Determinants of COVID-19 clinical severity are commonly assessed by transverse or longitudinal studies of the fatality counts. However, the fatality counts depend both on disease clinical severity and transmissibility, as more infected also lead to more deaths. Moreover, fatality counts (and related measures such as Case Fatality Rate) are dynamic quantities, as they appear with a delay to infections, while different geographic regions generally belong to different points on the epidemics curve. Instead, we use epidemiological modeling to propose a disease severity measure, which accounts for the underlying disease dynamics. The measure corresponds to the ratio of population averaged mortality and recovery rates (m/r). It is independent of the disease transmission dynamics (i.e., the basic reproduction number) and has a direct mechanistic interpretation. We use this measure to assess demographic, medical, meteorological and environmental factors associated with the disease severity. For this, we employ an ecological regression study design and analyze different US states during the first disease outbreak. Principal Component Analysis, followed by univariate and multivariate analyses based on machine learning techniques, is used for selecting important predictors. Without using prior knowledge from clinical studies, we recover significant predictors known to influence disease severity, in particular age, chronic diseases, and racial factors. Additionally, we identify long-term pollution exposure and population density as not widely recognized (though for the pollution previously hypothesized) predictors of the disease severity. Overall, the proposed measure is useful for inferring severity determinants of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, and the obtained results may aid a better understanding of COVID-19 risks.","output":"COVID-19 severity determinants inferred through ecological and epidemiological modeling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most countries have adopted measures of social distance, with the childhood population being one of the main focus of attention in these measures Methods: A rapid scoping review was carried out by searching PubMed to know if children are more contagious than adults, and the proportion of asymptomatic cases in children Google Scholar and MedRxiv/bioRxiv were also searched The time period was restricted from 1 December 2019 until 28 May 2020 Only studies published in English, Italian, French or Spanish were included Results: Fourteen out of 1099 identified articles were finally included Studies included cases from China (n=9 to 2143), China and Taiwan (n=536), Korea (n=1), Vietnam (n=1), Australia (n=9), Geneva (n=40), the Netherlands (n=116), Ireland (n=3) and Spain (population-based study of IgG, n=8243) Although no complete data were available, between 15% and 55%-60% were asymptomatic, and 75%-100% of cases were from family transmission Studies analysing school transmission showed children as not a driver of transmission Prevalence of COVID-19 IgG antibody in children 15 years was lower than the general population in the Spanish study Conclusions: Children are not transmitters to a greater extent than adults There is a need to improve the validity of epidemiological surveillance to solve current uncertainties, and to take into account social determinants and child health inequalities during and after the current pandemic","output":"Role of children in the transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction.

The research was performed among nurses (n = 577) working during the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in infectious (n = 201) and non-infectious (n = 376) wards in 11 Polish hospitals. To evaluate work conditions, the questionnaire prepared by the authors and the Emotional Control Scale (Courtauld Emotional Control ScaleCECS), which rates the control of anger, depression, and fear were used. Results. In the entire research group, fear had the highest rate of suppression among the negative emotions18.25 points, 17.91 points in infectious wards and 18.44 points among nurses working in non-infectious wards; p > 0.05. The nurses fear was significantly repressed when there was no possibility of the nurses having to perform a COVID-19 test in the workplace; p < 0.05. A larger emotional supressed occurred in nurses who simultaneously declared the perception of increased stress level; p < 0.05. Conclusions. A high level of emotion suppression, especially regarding fear, combined with higher stress levels, occurring irrespective of the ward, points at the need for mental support for the researched nurses.","output":"Emotional Control among Nurses against Work Conditions and the Support Received during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The current level of industrialization has generated many challenges worldwide, including ecological hazards, climate change, and the overuse of non-renewable natural resources, thereby creating an increasing demand for achieving the goal of the Triple Bottom Line (TBL). In this regard, Industry 4.0 can be used as a crunch point to contribute to the production process that can help achieve sustainable development. PURPOSE: While the Malaysian government proposed the Industry4ward approach to enhance technological adoption, there is scarce empirical evidence in the literature that validates SMEs for Industry 4.0. Using Dynamic Capability View (DCV), this study proposes a framework that includes core determinants like top management commitment, supply chain integration, and IT infrastructure, that can significantly influence Industry 4.0 implementation toward achieving TBL sustainability. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Employing simple random sampling, the study adopted a quantitative approach based on 199 useable respondent's feedback collected through a survey questionnaire of 900 employees from Malaysian SMEs. The statistical analysis was performed using Structural Equation Modeling (Partial Least Square, SmartPLS 3.3.2). FINDINGS: The results show that top management and IT infrastructure significantly impact Industry 4.0 implementation and sustainability. In contrast, the analysis also demonstrates that supply chain integration is insignificant to Industry 4.0 implementation in SMEs. The findings also indicate that the relationship between the determinants of Industry 4.0 and TBL sustainability can be mediated by the effective implementation of Industry 4.0. RECOMMENDATIONS: The study highlights the practical consequences of the role and use of the determinants in Industry 4.0 implementation. Its findings help managers and policy-makers to optimize value creation to achieve sustainable development goals. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH: Focusing only on Malaysian manufacturing SMEs may restrict the generalization of the study; thus, a benchmarking analysis from other industrial settings is encouraged. The questionnaire-based survey is a further limitation of the study.","output":"Industry 4.0 implementation and Triple Bottom Line sustainability: An empirical study on small and medium manufacturing firms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Cardiovascular Disease TYPE: Original Investigations PURPOSE: The prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AF) in COVID-19 patients, has been evolving. Although data on the prevalence of AF is well established, its effect on mortality and survival has been inconsistent. The study aims to assess the mortality risk in Covid-19 patients who had AF during hospitalization. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients admitted with a PCR confirmed COVID 19. We estimated 7-day and 30-day mortality through Kaplan-Meier survival curves and covariate-adjusted logistic regression and Cox Proportional Hazards models. We also obtained patient demographics, length of stay (LOS), Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, and co-morbidities, including the history of asthma, Diabetes Mellitus (DM), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension (HTN), acute kidney injury (AKI), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). RESULTS: Five hundred and fifty-four patients with COVID 19 were reviewed. A group of 82 (15%) patients were identified with AF, of which 32 (40%) patients had no prior history of AF. Compared to the non-AF group, these patients were significantly older (78 vs. 69 years old), more likely to be white (77% vs. 63%), have a longer LOS (11 vs. 7), and have an ICU admission (55% vs. 24%). They also had significantly increased 7-day (16% vs. 5%) and 30-day mortality (43% vs. 12%). Additionally, they were more likely to have a history of DM, CHF, AKI, and HTN. AF during admission was associated with an increased risk of 7-day and 30-day mortality (OR=2.28, p=0.039 and OR = 3.56, p < 0.001, respectively). This group also had a significantly lower survival probability at 7 days and 30 days (p=0.005, p < 0.0001, respectively). New-onset AF was associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality (OR = 5.72 p < 0.001) and lower survival probability at 30 days (p=0.005) only. Cox Proportional Hazards regression analysis for AF on admission and new-onset AF were significant at 30-days (HR=1.9 [1.2-3] p=0.0037 and HR=2 [1.1-3.4] p=0.0173, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that COVID 19 patients with AF have significantly worse outcomes than patients without AF. In our population, since AF patients were older and had more co-comorbidities, higher LOS, and ICU admission, a cause-and-effect relationship cannot be confidently determined. However, adjusting for these co-variates still produced a statistically significant negative effect on mortality and survival. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The driving force behind the high incidence of AF, whether due to systemic illness or Covid 19 infection, remains to be determined, but it should be noted that COVID 19 patients with AF, especially new-onset AF have higher mortality.

Mimicyp adopts a typical cyclophilin-fold, yet it also forms trimers unlike any previously characterized homologue. Strikingly, immunofluorescence assays reveal that mimicyp localizes to the surface of the mature virion, as recently proposed for several viruses that recruit host cell cyclophilins such as SARS and HIV-1. Additionally mimicyp lacks peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity in contrast to human cyclophilins. Thus, this study suggests that cyclophilins, whether recruited from host cells (i.e. HIV-1 and SARS) or virally encoded (i.e. Mimivirus), are localized on viral surfaces for at least a subset of viruses.","output":"Structural, Biochemical, and in Vivo Characterization of the First Virally Encoded Cyclophilin from the Mimivirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) include verbal, physical, or sexual abuse, as well as family dysfunction (e.g., an incarcerated, mentally ill, or substance-abusing family member; domestic violence; or absence of a parent because of divorce or separation).

These alerts warned on the risks of an exponential increase in emergence of potentially pandemic zoonotic infectious diseases related to disruptive ecological niches in different regions of the globe, such as H1N1 Influenza, SARS, MERS, Zika, avian flu, swine flu, and Ebola, and also on the risks of a future and more lethal Disease X. We examine this global public health failure in anticipating and responding to the pandemic, stressing the urgent need for an innovative global pandemic preparedness system in the current transition from linear economy to a circular economy. Evidence provided here indicates that this novel preventive-based and resource-saving preparedness system could contribute to reverse the detrimental impacts of the pandemic on global economy and increase its resilience. Individual protection, contact tracing, and lockdown have proved to be just partially effective to respond to the spillover of viral zoonosis into the human population, and for most of these pathogens, vaccines are not yet available. As for COVID-19 vaccines, in spite of the extraordinary investments and unprecedented advances in innovative vaccines in few months, most of these products are expected to be available to more vulnerable developing countries populations only by mid-2022. Furthermore, even when these vaccines are available, constraints such as low efficacy, waning immunity, new concerning COVID-19 variants, adverse events, and vaccine hesitancy might possibly restrict their public health impact and could contribute to aggravate the pandemic scenario. Considering these constraints and the severe global economic and social crises resulting from the lack of adequate preparedness and delayed effective response to COVID-19 and possibly to a future Disease X, we propose a pro-active global eco-social pandemic preparedness system. This novel system, based on One Health paradigm and on artificial intelligence and machine learning, is expected to incorporate spillover foresight and management into global preparedness and timely response. Designed to mitigate damage from outbreaks and minimize human morbidity and mortality, this approach to pandemic foresight and preparedness will be key to prevent a global disaster.","output":"COVID-19 and Future Disease X in Circular Economy Transition: Redesigning Pandemic Preparedness to Prevent a Global Disaster"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To predict the tropism of human coronaviruses, we profile 28 SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus-associated receptors and factors (SCARFs) using single-cell transcriptomics across various healthy human tissues.

Yet, the resulting immunosensors often suffer from considerable limitations, which are mainly ascribed to the antibody size, conjugation chemistry, stability, and costs. Over the past decade, aptamers have emerged as promising alternative capture probes presenting some advantages over existing constraints of immunosensors, as well as new biosensing concepts. Herein, we review the employment of antibodies and aptamers as capture probes in biosensing platforms, addressing the main aspects of biosensor design and mechanism. We also aim to compare both capture probe classes from theoretical and experimental perspectives.

ResultsThe pooled analysis showed that compared to non-severe group, severe group was characterised by significantly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (standardised mean difference [SMD]: 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.23 to 1.06; p<0.001, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (SMD: 0.55, 95%CI: 0.02 to 1.07 p=0.004) and lymphopenia (SMD: -1.22, 95% CI: -2.15 to -0.30; p<0.01), decreased serum albumin (SMD: -1.60, 95% CI: -2.96 to -0.22 ; p<0.001), creatinine (SMD: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.90; p<0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)(SMD: -1.54, 95% CI: - 2.27 to -0.80; p=0.002) and haemoglobin (SMD:-0.89, 95% CI: ; p<0.001). Additionally, in the non-survivor group, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (SMD: 1.54 95% CI: -2.27 to 0.80; p=0.002), decreased serum albumin (SMD: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.75 to 1.42; p<0.001) were reported. There was no comorbidity which was found to be significant in the severe group. ConclusionSerum albumin, ALT, ESR, lymphopenia, haemoglobin, and leucocytosis can reflect the severity of COVID-19, while the LDH, leucocytosis and albumin can be considered as risk factor to higher mortality. SummaryOur manuscript discusses the various blood biochemical markers as potential predictors of disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. The timely detection of these parameters can help in providing appropriate course of treatment and reducing the mortality rate in the patients. We have found an association between the blood biochemical markers and disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Serum albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), lymphopenia, hemoglobin, and leukocytosis can reflect the severity of the disease, while the LDH, leukocytosis and albumin can be considered as risk factor to higher mortality.","output":"Blood biochemical parameters as predictors of disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients- an updated systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We used a telephone survey to determine risk factors associated with a positive polymerase chain reaction test of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) at a community hospital in Central New Jersey during the early stages of the pandemic.

The target audience had underlying health conditions associated with severe disease and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) or severely immunosuppressed household members. METHODS: An orderly approval system was established in Israel for adolescents aged 12-15 years, based on a professional position paper and compassionate treatment regulations. From 12 February 2021, eligible adolescents were referred to the Israeli Ministry of Health for permission to vaccinate, via four health maintenance organisations. Data were collected about adverse events after vaccinations and the incidence of any cases of COVID-19. RESULTS: By 15 March 2021, the vaccine had been approved for 607 adolescents: 333 had received one dose, and 92 had received two doses. The median age was 14.6 years, and the major indication was obesity. Only one child tested positive for the virus, 4 days after vaccination, and no adverse effects were recorded. CONCLUSION: The emergency use of COVID-19 vaccination for 333 adolescents aged 12-15, 92 of them with 2 doses, based on a position paper and compassionate treatment regulations, did not result in any adverse effects.

The symptomatology and epidemic profile remain little known in this population, especially in disabled oldest-old people with chronic diseases living in nursing homes. The objective of the present study was to comprehensively describe symptoms and chronological aspects of the diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a nursing home, among both residents and caregivers. DESIGN: Five-week retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A middle-sized nursing home in Maine-et-Loire, west of France. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-seven frail older residents (87.9  7.2years; 71% female) and 92 staff members (38.3  11.7years; 89% female) were included. MEASUREMENTS: Mass screening for SARS-CoV-2 was performed in both residents and staff. Attack rate, mortality rate, and symptoms among residents and staff infected with SARS-CoV-2 were recorded. RESULTS: The attack rate of COVID-19 was 47% in residents (case fatality rate, 27%), and 24% in staff. Epidemic curves revealed that the epidemic started in residents before spreading to caregivers. Residents exhibited both general and respiratory signs (59% hyperthermia, 49% cough, 42% polypnea) together with geriatric syndromes (15% falls, 10% altered consciousness). The classification tree revealed 100% COVID-19 probability in the following groups: i) residents younger than 90 with dyspnea and falls; ii) residents older than 90 with anorexia; iii) residents older than 90 without anorexia but with altered consciousness. Finally, 41% of staff members diagnosed with COVID-19 were asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: The pauci-symptomatic expression of COVID-19 in older residents, together with the high prevalence of asymptomatic forms in caregivers, justifies mass screening in nursing homes, possibly prioritizing residents with suggestive combinations of clinical signs including dyspnea, falls, anorexia and/or altered consciousness.","output":"COVID-19 in seniors: Findings and lessons from mass screening in a nursing home"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the highly pathogenic SARS-Cov-2 virus, was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020 Its main clinical manifestations are related to airway involvement;however, there is extrapulmonary impairment in some cases Given this context, this literature review aims to identify the ophthalmological conditions caused by infection with the novel coronavirus Although ocular findings do not include the standard clinical presentation of the disease, there are reports of some ophthalmological changes in COVID-19 patients, and conjunctivitis is the most common among these RESUMO A doen?a do coronavrus 2019 (COVID-19) causada pelo vrus, altamente patognico, Sars-Cov-2, foi declarada como uma pandemia pela Organizao Mundial da Sade (OMS) em mar?o de 2020 As principais manifestaes clnicas se relacionam com o acometimento da via area;no entanto, h em alguns casos comprometimento extrapulmonar Perante esse contexto, esta revis?o de literatura objetiva identificar as condies oftalmolgicas resultantes da infeco pelo novo coronavrus Apesar de os achados oculares n?o contemplarem o quadro clnico padr?o da doen?a, h relatos de algumas alteraes oftalmolgicas em pacientes com COVID-19 positivo, sendo a conjuntivite a mais comum entre estas","output":"Ocular manifestations of COVID-19: a literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Electronics courses were commonly completed with hardware and software labs to complement teaching electronics theory and enrich the learning experience for students.

The artificial iris is based on guest-host liquid crystal cells (GH-LCD) in order to actively modify the transmittance of the lens and effective pupil size. Experimental validation of the GH-LCD spectrum and iris contrast (determined to be 1:2.1) enabled the development of optical models that include the effect of a small pupil on image quality and visual quality on an optical system with aniridia characteristics. Visual simulations at different light conditions (high/low photopic and mesopic) demonstrated the theoretical capacity of the customized artificial iris smart contact lens to expand the depth-of-focus and decrease the optical aberrations (in particular, the spherical aberration). The visual modelling suggests a maximum depth-of-focus value for a 2-mm pupil diameter for both eyes as follows: 3D (1,000 cd/m2), 2D (10 cd/m2) and 0.75D (1 cd/m2).

The objective of this study was to describe possible changes in substance use in the first months of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe. METHODS: Data were obtained from a cross-sectional online survey of 36,538 adult substance users from 21 European countries conducted between April 24 and July 22 of 2020. Self-perceived changes in substance use were measured by asking respondents whether their use had decreased (slightly or substantially), increased (slightly or substantially), or not changed during the past month. The survey covered alcohol (frequency, quantity, and heavy episodic drinking occasions), tobacco, cannabis, and other illicit drug use. Sample weighted data were descriptively analysed and compared across substances. RESULTS: Across all countries, use of all substances remained unchanged for around half of the respondents, while the remainder reported either a decrease or increase in their substance use. For alcohol use, overall, a larger proportion of respondents indicated a decrease than those reporting an increase. In contrast, more respondents reported increases in their tobacco and cannabis use during the previous month compared to those reporting decreased use. No distinct direction of change was reported for other substance use. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest changes in use of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis during the initial months of the pandemic in several European countries. This study offers initial insights into changes in substance use.

Second order effects have been less well studied. This study aimed to characterise the changes in emergency activity of a high-volume cardiac catheterisation centre and to cautiously model any excess indirect morbidity and mortality. METHOD: Retrospective cohort study of patients admitted with acute coronary syndrome fulfilling criteria for the heart attack centre (HAC) pathway at St. Bartholomews hospital, UK. Electronic data were collected for the study period March 16th C May 16th 2020 inclusive and stored on a dedicated research server. Standard governance procedures were observed in line with the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society audit. RESULTS: There was a 28% fall in the number of primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) for ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) during the study period (111 vs. 154) and 36% fewer activations of the HAC pathway (312 vs. 485), compared to the same time period averaged across three preceding years. In the context of missing STEMIs, the excess harm attributable to COVID-19 could result in an absolute increase of 1.3% in mortality, 1.9% in nonfatal MI and 4.5% in recurrent ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: The emergency activity of a high-volume PCI centre was significantly reduced for STEMI during the peak of the first wave of COVID-19.

Aim: To examine womens birth experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare the experiences of women who gave birth in the United Kingdom (UK) or the Netherlands (NL) either before or during the pandemic. Method: This study is based on analyses of quantitative and qualitative data from the online Babies Born Better survey. Responses recorded by women giving birth in the UK and the NL between June and December 2020 have been used, encompassing women who gave birth between 2017 and 2020. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively, and chi-squared tests were performed to compare women who gave birth pre- versus during pandemic and separately by country. Qualitative data was analysed by inductive thematic analysis. Findings: Respondents in both the UK and the NL who gave birth during the pandemic were as likely, or, if they had a self-reported above average standard of life, more likely to rate their labour and birth experience positively when compared to women who gave birth pre-pandemic. This was despite the fact that those labouring in the pandemic reported less support and choice. Two potential explanatory themes emerged from the qualitative data: respondents had lower expectations during the pandemic, and they appreciated that care providers tried hard to personalise care. Conclusion: Our study implies that many women labouring during the COVID-19 pandemic experienced restrictions, but their experience was mitigated by staff actions.

Our approach is similar to non-parametric curve fitting in spirit and automatically adapts to key external factors, such as interventions, while retaining the parsimonious nature of the standard SIR(D) model. Initial dynamic temporal estimates of the model parameters are obtained by minimising the aggregate residual sum of squares across the number of infections, recoveries, and fatalities, over a chosen lag period. Then a geometric smoother is applied to obtain the final time series of estimates. These estimates are used to obtain dynamic temporal robust estimates of the key feature of this pandemic, namely the\\"reproduction number\\". We illustrate our method on the Indian COVID-19 data for the period March 14 - August 31, 2020. The time series data plots of the 36 states and union territories shows a clear presence of inter-regional variation in the prognosis of the epidemic. This is also bourne out by the estimates of the underlying parameters, including the reproduction numbers for the 36 regions. Due to this, an SIR(D) model, dynamic or otherwise, on the national aggregate data is not suited for robust local predictions. The time series of estimates of the model enables us to carry out daily, weekly and also long term predictions, including construction of predictive bands. We obtain an excellent agreement between the actual data and the model predicted data at the regional level. Our estimates of the current reproduction number turn out to be more than 2 in three regions (Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh) and between 1.5 and 2 in 13 regions.

Rapid antigen tests (RAT), though less sensitive than RT-PCR, offer the possibility of rapid, inexpensive and early detection of the most infectious COVID-19 cases. Only very few studies have assessed the performance of the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 RAT among asymptomatic people or in Latin America. This study set out to validate this test among people attending the public test street in Sint Maarten, Dutch Caribbean. MethodsPeople of all ages were recruited from the public COVID-19 test street regardless of COVID-19 symptoms. They received a nasopharyngeal swab for the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 RAT and the RT-PCR Qtower. Diagnostic accuracy of the RAT was compared to the RT-PCR among the overall study population and for subgroups with/without symptoms, with/without close contact and different Ct values. ResultsUsing a RT-PCR Ct cut-off value of <33, 119 out of 1,411 people (8.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Most were asymptomatic (59%). The overall sensitivity and specificity of the RAT was 84% (95% CI 76.2-90.1) and 99.9% (95% CI 99.6-100) respectively. The sensitivity reduced to 67.6% (95% CI: 49.5%, 82.6%) among people without symptoms, regardless of whether they were in close contact with a known COVID-19 case. Sensitivity reduced considerably with a Ct cut-off value of <35. ConclusionsThe Abbott Panbio RAT is a valid and cheaper alternative to RT-PCR when used on symptomatic individuals among the general population.

Previously, we developed a short 9-meric peptide, Pro9-3D, with significant antibacterial and cytotoxic effects. In this study, we attempted to produce safer peptide antibiotics against CRAB by reversing the parent sequence to generate R-Pro9-3 and R-Pro9-3D. Among the tested peptides, R-Pro9-3D had the most rapid and effective antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, particularly clinical CRAB isolates. Analyses of antimicrobial mechanisms based on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-neutralization, LPS binding, and membrane depolarization, as well as SEM ultrastructural investigations, revealed that R-Pro9-3D binds strongly to LPS and impairs the membrane integrity of CRAB by effectively permeabilizing its outer membrane. R-Pro9-3D was also less cytotoxic and had better proteolytic stability than Pro9-3D and killed biofilm forming CRAB. As an LPS-neutralizing peptide, R-Pro9-3D effectively reduced LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in RAW 264.7 cells. The antiseptic abilities of R-Pro9-3D were also investigated using a mouse model of CRAB-induced sepsis, which revealed that R-Pro9-3D reduced multiple organ damage and attenuated systemic infection by acting as an antibacterial and immunosuppressive agent.

With the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the prevalence of some infectious respiratory diseases has varied. Epidemiological features of M. pneumoniae in children from Beijing (China) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were investigated. METHODS: Between June 2016 and May 2021, a total of 569,887 children with respiratory infections from Childrens Hospital Affiliated to Capital Institute of Pediatrics (Beijing, China) were included in this study. M. pneumoniae specific-IgM antibody in serum specimens of these patients was tested by a rapid immunochromatographic assay kit. The relevant clinical data of M. pneumoniae-positive cases were also collected, and analyzed by RStudio software. RESULTS: The results showed that 13.08% of collected samples were positive for M. pneumoniae specific-IgM antibody. The highest annual positive rate was 17.59% in 2019, followed by 12.48% in 2018, 12.31% in 2017, and 11.73% in 2016, while the rate dropped to 8.9% in 2020 and 4.95% in 2021, with significant difference. Among the six years, the positive rates in summer and winter seasons were significantly higher than those in spring and autumn seasons (p < 0.001). The positive rate was the highest in school-age children (22.20%), and lowest in the infant group (8.76%, p < 0.001). The positive rate in boys (11.69%) was lower than that in girls (14.80%, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in different seasons, age groups, or genders before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that an M. pneumoniae outbreak started from the summer of 2019 in Beijing. After the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in the end of 2019, the M. pneumoniae positive rates dropped dramatically. This may be due to the restrictive measures of the COVID-19 pandemic, which effectively controlled the transmission of M. pneumoniae.

RESULTS: Twenty-five participants were enrolled in the intervention. Mean age was 38 years, and the majority were women. Only nine participants attended at least 70% of the sessions and completed the final evaluation. Men, those who did not complete high school, and workers in service or construction jobs were more likely to drop out. Knowledge about protective factors [pre- vs. post-intervention median (inter-quartile range) = 111 (100, 120) vs. 115 (100, 124)] and coping mechanisms [96 (85, 104) vs. 99 (90, 110)], as well as psychosocial distress [3 (2, 3) vs. 2 (2, 3)] improved after the intervention in both intent-to treat and complete case analyses (p < 0.05). Qualitative results also support improvements in targeted protective factors. DISCUSSION: The intervention was successful in improving psychological distress among Mexican immigrants. These results support the implementation of evidence-based mental health promotion interventions among Mexican immigrants via free and familiar programs. A limitation was the high attrition; future studies should explore approaches to improve retention in this population.","output":"A Window Into Mental Health: Developing and Pilot-Testing a Mental Health Promotion Intervention for Mexican Immigrants Through the Ventanilla de Salud Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), screening of effective drugs has became the emphasis of research today; furthermore, screening of Chinese classic prescriptions has became one of the directions for drug development. This study analyzed the application of classic prescriptions in the diagnosis and treatment schemes based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Schemes for Coronavirus Disease at the country, provincial and municipal levels, and further explored its disrobing effect on COVID-19 disease severe phase network, and selected representative prescriptions for core target screening and gene enrichment analysis, so as to reveal its mechanism of action. Among them, 13 prescriptions were found to be used for 10 times or more, including Maxing Shigan Tang, Yinqiao San, Shengjiang San, Dayuan Drink, Xuanbai Chengqi Decoction. In addition, the COVID-19 efficacy prediction analysis platform(TCMATCOV platform) was used to calculate the network disturbances of the Chinese classic prescriptions involved. Based on the prediction results, 68 classic prescriptions were assessed on the COVID-19 disease network robustness disturbance. The average disturbance scores for the interaction confidence scores were ranked to be 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 from the highest to the lowest. There were 7 prescriptions with a score of 17 or more, and 50 prescriptions with a score of 13 or more. Among them, the top three prescriptions were Ganlu Xiaodu Dan(18.19), Lengxiao Wan(17.74), and Maxing Shigan Tang(17.62). After further mining the action targets of these three prescriptions, it was found that COVID-19 disease-specific factors Ccl2, IL10, IL6 and TNF were all the targets of three prescriptions. Through the enrichment analysis of the biological processes of the core targets, it was found that the three prescriptions may prevent the development of the disease by affecting cell-to-cell adhesion, cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, and chronic inflammatory responses to COVID-19 at the severe phase. This study showed that the TCMATCOV platform could evaluate the disturbance effect of different prescriptions on the COVID-19 disease network, and predict potential effectiveness based on the robustness of drug-interfered pneumonia disease networks, so as to provide a reference for further experiments or clinical verification.","output":"[Analysis of potential role of Chinese classic prescriptions in treatment of COVID-19 based on TCMATCOV platform]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been associated with diffuse lung injury. Corticosteroids have been shown to suppress inflammation-mediated lung injury and as a result, decrease progression to respiratory failure. Based on the RECOVERY trial, the use of dexamethasone in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or supplemental oxygen at randomization [1]. Per IDSA treatment guidelines dexamethasone use in hospitalized patients is strongly recommended, thereby prompting most intuitions in the United States and worldwide to initiate its use. We present a unique case of Nocardia farcinica brain abscess in the setting of prolonged dexamethasone use in a patient with COVID-19 infection. CASE PRESENTATION: 80-year-old female from Pakistan with a past medical history of hypertension, who while in Pakistan was diagnosed with COVID-19 and treated with Xarelto and dexamethasone (dose and duration unknown). Her course was complicated by the development of left elbow and hand Zoster and over the 10 days prior to presentation, she was noted to develop increasing left-sided weakness and aphasia. Patient was transferred to the United States where a CT scan revealed a left frontal mass, prompting transfer to a tertiary care facility. MRI brain revealed a left frontal cystic rim-enhancing lesion that was concerning for a brain abscess. The patient subsequently underwent left frontal stereotactic brain biopsy with recovery of 3 mL of purulent fluid. Gram staining revealed beaded branching gram-positive rods. She was initially placed on vancomycin/cefepime/metronidazole/dexamethasone and was changed to IV Bactrim/ceftriaxone/doxycycline to cover for Nocardia and Actinomyces. Modified acid-fast stain returned positive with beaded, branching, filamentous rods, consistent with Nocardia. Cultures returned with Nocardia farcinica. DISCUSSION: Nocardia infection primarily occurs via inhalation or direct skin inoculation and subsequently disseminates hematogenously to end organs, which include the brain [2]. Nocardia typically presents as a respiratory or skin infection;brain abscesses are rare and primarily found in immunocompromised patients. As outlined in this case, an immunocompromised state was induced by high dose steroid use. Corticosteroids modulate inflammatory mediators and thereby cause immunosuppression. New symptoms should be monitored closely in patients undergoing steroid therapy, as seen in our patient who presented with new onset aphasia and left sided weakness. This is especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic that has prompted widespread use of dexamethasone in order to prevent respiratory failure and death. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should be vigilant of superimposed infections in patients with COVID-19 receiving high dose steroids. REFERENCE #1: RECOVERY Collaborative Group.

Although major efforts to control M. hyopneumoniae infection and its detrimental effects have been made, significant economic losses in pig production worldwide due to EP continue. M. hyopneumoniae is typically introduced into pig herds by the purchase of subclinically infected animals or, less frequently, through airborne transmission over short distances. Once in the herd, M. hyopneumoniae may be transmitted by direct contact from infected sows to their offspring or between pen mates. The gold standard technique used to diagnose M. hyopneumoniae infection, bacteriological culture, is laborious and is seldom used routinely. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction detection methods, in addition to post-mortem inspection in the form of abattoir surveillance or field necropsy, are the techniques most frequently used to investigate the potential involvement of M. hyopneumoniae in porcine respiratory disease. Such techniques have been used to monitor the incidence of M. hyopneumoniae infection in herds both clinically and subclinically affected by EP, in vaccinated and non-vaccinated herds and under different production and management conditions. Differences in the clinical course of EP at farm level and in the efficacy of M. hyopneumoniae vaccination suggest that the transmission and virulence characteristics of different field isolates of M. hyopneumoniae may vary.

Methods: The medical records of 816 patients (504 men, 312 women) with eye loss due to different etiologies were evaluated retrospectively for this study. Patients were divided into four age groups (preschool, school, adolescence and adulthood) and causes of eye loss were grouped as follows: trauma, postoperative and other causes (infection, tumor, congenital diseases). Pearson's Chi-square test was used to compare the causes of eye loss with age sex and the affected side of the patients. Results: The mean age was 12.613.6 (range, 0-76) years. There were 317 patients (38.8%) in group 1, 214 patients (26.2%) in group 2, 107 patients (13.1%) in group 3, and 178 patients (21.8%) in group 4). The most frequent etiologic factor of eye loss among all the patients and individually in each group was trauma (p<0.001). The percentage of trauma tended to increase by age until the age of 20 years. After that, the predominance of other causes of eye loss increased. Fortunately, the overall number of patients with eye loss tended to decrease by age. Traumatic etiologies were more frequently seen in male (68%) population, whereas other causes (infection, tumor and natal diseases) of eye loss were seen more in the female population (57.7%) (p<0.001). Conclusion: The young adult males are more prone to work-related accidents resulting in eye loss.

METHODS: Double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled single center clinical trial. Included subjects were health care workers caring for severe COVID-19 patients. Main outcome was time to symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: 127 subjects with a confirmed baseline negative RT-PCR SARS-CoV2 test were included in the trial. 62 assigned to HCQ and 65 to placebo. One subject (1.6%) in the HCQ group and 6 (9.2%) subjects in the placebo group developed COVID-19 (Log-Rank test p = 0.07). No severe COVID-19 cases were observed. The study was suspended because of a refusal to participate and losses to follow up after several trials reported lack of effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

However, vaccination rollouts may not be as fast as expected in some regions due to individuals' vaccination hesitation. For this reason, in Detroit, Michigan, the city government has offered a $50 prepaid card to people who entice city residents to visit vaccination sites. This study examined vaccination rates in the US using Detroit, Michigan, as the setting. It sought to address two issues. First, we analyzed the vaccination diffusion process to predict whether any region would reach a vaccination completion level that ensures herd immunity. Second, we examined a natural experiment involving a vaccination incentive scheme in Detroit and discovered its causal inference. We collected weekly vaccination data and demographic Census data from the state of Michigan and employed the Bass model to study vaccination diffusion. Also, we used a synthetic control method to evaluate the causal inference of a vaccination incentive scheme utilized in Detroit. The results showed that many Michigan countiesas well as the city of Detroitwould not reach herd immunity given the progress of vaccination efforts. Also, we found that Detroit's incentive scheme indeed increased the weekly vaccination rate by 44.19% for the first dose (from 0.86 to 1.25%) but was ineffective in augmenting the rate of the second dose. The implications are valuable for policy makers to implement vaccination incentive schemes to boost vaccination rates in geographical areas where such rates remain inadequate for achieving herd immunity.","output":"Vaccination Diffusion and Incentive: Empirical Analysis of the US State of Michigan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first official case of COVID-19 was reported, many researchers around the world have spent their time trying to understand the dynamics of the virus by modeling and predicting the number of infected and deaths. The rapid spread and highly contagiousness motivate the necessity of monitoring cases in real-time, aiming to keep control of the epidemic. As pointed out by [3], some pitfalls like limited infrastructure, laboratory confirmation and logistical problems may cause reporting delay, leading to distortions of the real dynamics of the confirmed cases and deaths. The aim of this study is to propose a suitable statistical methodology for modeling and forecasting daily deaths and reported cases of COVID-19, considering key features as overdispersion of data and correction of notification delay. Both, reporting delays and forecasting consider a Bayesian approach in which the daily deaths and the confirmed cases are modelled using the negative binomial (NB) distribution in order to accommodate the population heterogeneity. For the correction of notification delay, the mean number of occurrences regarding time t notified at time t + j (mean delayed notifications) is associated to the temporal and the delay lag evolution of the notification process through a log link. With regard to daily forecasting, the functional form adopted for the number of deaths and reported cases of COVID-19 is related to the sigmoid growth equation. A variable regarding week days or days off was considered in order to account for possible reduction of the records due to the lower offer of tests on days off. To illustrate the methodology, we analyze data of deaths and infected cases of COVID-19 in Esprito Santo, Brazil.

Compared with current rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT), our in vitro pseudovirus-based neutralization assay (PBNA) is much less labor-intensive while demonstrating better reproducibility. Moreover, the in vivo PBNA assay was also found to be superior to the live virus based assay. Following intravenous administration, the pseudovirus effectively infected the mice, with dynamic viral distributions being sequentially observed in spleen, liver and brain. Furthermore, data from in vivo PBNA showed great agreement with those generated from the live virus model but with the experimental time significantly reduced from 2 weeks to 3 days. Taken together, the effective pseudovirus production system facilitated the development of novel PBNA assays which could replace live virus-based traditional assays due to its safety, rapidity, reproducibility and high throughput capacity.","output":"Development of in vitro and in vivo rabies virus neutralization assays based on a high-titer pseudovirus system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study is based on a large international survey, which collected the views of general practitioners (GPs) in 11 different countries on their respective healthcare systems in 2019 Findings show that Dutch GPs are positive about the quality of GP care and that they are satisfied with their profession However, findings also show that there is room for improvement (i) Work pressure and work-related stress among GPs is high in the Netherlands, which may be due to moves to substitute primary care for some hospital care (ii) Dutch GPs are behind other high-income countries in their uptake of some digital applications (e g video consultations) (iii) According to Dutch GPs, pressure from patients, lack of time, and fear of complaints contributes to provision of low-value care The COVID-19 epidemic has created opportunities to improve Dutch GP care further, for example through wider uptake of digital health applications","output":"[Primary health care through the eyes of the general practitioner;an international study]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long derided as an inferior form of geography, there is now a recognition that if we want to understand geography and war, we can no longer depend on elite texts and elite actors.

This study aimed at determination of the risk factors for thyroid hormone replacement following hemithyroidectomy and to develop a predictive nomogram. METHODS: Data of patients treated by hemithyroidectomy for benign thyroid disease between January 2015 and January 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Baseline characteristics, surgery-related variables, and preoperative and postoperative thyroid function of patients were collected from the case records and compared between patients with postoperative euthyroidism and patients with postoperative hypothyroidism. Postoperative euthyroidism patients without thyroid hormone replacement were compared to those who developed postoperative hypothyroidism with thyroid hormone replacement. The factors associated with thyroid hormone replacement were used to construct a binomial logistic-regression model and visualized as a predictive nomogram to evaluate the risk of thyroid hormone replacement following hemithyroidectomy. RESULTS: Of the 378 patients (74% female) included in the study, 110 (29.1%) developed postoperative hypothyroidism. Preoperative serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) > 2.172 IU/mL was identified as an independent risk factor for postoperative hypothyroidism (odds ratio [OR] = 8.02; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.87C13.20; P < 0.001). Of 110 patients with postoperative hypothyroidism, 56 (50.9%) received thyroid hormone replacement. Unilateral thyroid nodule and preoperative serum TSH > 2.172 IU/mL were independent predictors of postoperative thyroid hormone replacement (P = 0.01, and P < 0.001, respectively). Temporary subclinical hypothyroidism occurred in 12 patients; all 12 reverted to euthyroid state without thyroid hormone replacement. The discriminative effect of the binomial regression model was proved reliable by the HosmerCLemeshow goodness-of-fit test (P = 0.503), and predictive ability of the nomogram was satisfactory with a C-index of 0.833. CONCLUSIONS: Hypothyroidism is common after hemithyroidectomy, and almost half of the patients will need thyroid hormone replacement. Elevated preoperative serum TSH level and unilateral thyroid nodule were independent predictors of thyroid hormone replacement following hemithyroidectomy.

Being male (?: -0.141, p<0.001) and aged >30 (?: -0.099, p=0.030) were associated with lower knowledge scores, while education level of bachelor's degree and above (?: 0.092, p=0.003), living in urban environment (?: 0.062, p=0.044) and being a student (?: 0.240, p<0.001) were associated with higher knowledge scores. Only 638 (53.1%) of the participants agreed that COVID-19 will be successfully controlled. The vast majority of the participants (1,092 or 90.9%) have not visited any crowded place and 1,043 (86.9%) wore masks when they were going out... Decreased exposure to crowded places [(OR=0.427, p<0.001);(OR=0.805, p<0.001)] and an increase of wearing a mask while leaving home [(OR=1.564, p=0.022);(OR=1.219, p<0.001)] were associated with female sex and higher knowledge scores, respectively. Age group 18-29 (OR=0.616, p=0.007) and living in rural environment (OR=0.600, p<0.025) were associated with not wearing a mask outside the home. Conclusions: Our study suggests that residents of Bosnia and Herzegovina have had good knowledge, a relatively optimistic attitudes and appropriate practices towards COVID-19 during the first period of outbreak.","output":"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 among residents of Bosnia and Herzegovina during the first stage of COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study looks into how a group of graduate research students from an Australian university created online collaborative spaces that facilitated highly productive environments for thesis writing during the global lockdown and travel restrictions triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic Using virtual meetings and shared digital repositories, these researchers progressed through stages in their writing from the formation of research questions, developing literature review, data collection and analysis and finally writing the discussion, each working on a different topic within the broader field of education The study found that the regular online Shut Up N Write (SUNW) sessions created the conditions that allowed these researchers not only to share their work and solicit critical feedback, but to be aware of their own learning styles The writing sessions became a facilitative ground in which a process and genre approach to writing allowed them to work independently, yet also drawing on advice from others that provided a greater sense of belonging Using reflective autoethnographic narratives, and by combining genre, metacognition and third space theories, the study problematises these virtual meetings as spaces of inner growth as writers who, while learning from each other, also find their own distinctive voices in developing their theses ? 2021, Western Australian Institute for Educational Research Inc All rights reserved","output":"Creating online metacognitive spaces: Graduate research writing during the covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 is an acute inflammatory respiratory disease. It causes many changes in hemogram parameters. Low albumin levels are associated with mortality risk in hospitalized patients. The aim of the present study is to reveal the place of neutrophil count to albumin ratio in predicting mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: 144 patients, 65 females and 79 males, were included in the study. Patients were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 was the non-severe group (n:85), and Group 2 was severe (n:59). Demographic data, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet counts, albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were recorded. Neutrophil count to albumin ratio (NAR) was calculated by dividing the absolute neutrophil counts by the albumin levels. The NAR and levels of the two groups were then compared. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in gender and platelet count (201 vs. 211 K/mL) between the groups (p>0,05). Ages (62.0  14.3 vs 68.6  12.2 years), albumin (33.1 vs 29.9 gr/L), CRP (33 vs 113 mg/l), neutrophil count (4 vs 7.24 K/mL), WBC counts (6.70 vs 8.50 K/mL), NAR values (113.5 vs 267.2) and number of Death (5 vs 33) were found to be statistically higher (p <0.001) in Group 2 than in Group 1. The NAR value of 201.5 showed mortality in all patients with COVID-19 to have 71.1% sensitivity and 71.7% specificity (AUC:0.736, 95% CI: 0.641-0.832, p<0.001).

Methods: Five databases were screened from inception to 27-Aug-2020. The effects of specific drug interventions on safety and efficacy were assessed in COVID-19 patients. Risk Ratios (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models. Results: A total of 10 studies were identified which fulfill the inclusion criteria. Patients taking antivirals had 26% less risk of having a severe adverse event (SAE) compared to controls (RR, 0.74, CI:0.62 to 0.89, P=0.002). Clinical improvement at day 14 was observed among the cases treated with antivirals compared to the control group (RR 1.24, CI: 1.00 to 1.53 p=0.05). Conclusion: There is evidence that Remdesivir and LPV/r reduces the hospital length of stay and that patients to which antivirals were administered had less SAE and improvement when compared to patients not prescribed with antivirals. Due to a lack of power and the quality of the studies, it was not possible to determine which antivirals have a greater risk-benefit balance, and therefore the optimal approach to antiviral treatment is still uncertain.

Syrian refugees provide an example of people who migrated because of a single major event: the war in Syria. The article examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fathering practices. The Swedish COVID-19 strategy differed from those adopted in many other countries. Lockdowns were minimal and were not stringently enforced, based on the assumption that individuals would trust the authorities and would take personal responsibility for complying with their guidelines and recommendations. Previous research suggests that migrants and other vulnerable groups were not always well informed about the public policies introduced prior to and during the pandemic. The article draws on empirical data from a wider research project on the family lives of Syrian migrants in Sweden. The authors present their findings from an analysis of eleven ethnographically informed semi-structured interviews, carried out before and during the pandemic, with married fathers who had been living in Sweden for several years. In this article, they focus on three cases representing fathers with varied educational backgrounds and employment histories. These families had in common what are considered by Swedish standards to be overcrowded living conditions; they were forced to accept close family proximity, both physically and emotionally, as they no longer had the supportive networks they were used to in Syria. The three fathers were found to rely more heavily on information provided by the people with whom they were in contact in Sweden than on policies and recommendations from the authorities. These findings confirmed that the previous experiences among refugees of shifting policies regarding migration and integration had lowered their trust in government. They had learnt that they needed to rely on mutual dependency not only between spouses, but also between parents and children.","output":"Fathering Practices in Sweden During the COVID-19: Experiences of Syrian Refugee Fathers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians have been plagued with dilemmas related to the uncertainty about diagnostic testing for the virus.

Daily full-coverage PM2.5 data at a spatial resolution of 10 km is our first near real-time product. The TAP PM2.5 is estimated based on a two-stage machine learning model coupled with the synthetic minority oversampling technique and a tree-based gap-filling method. Our model has an averaged out-of-bag cross-validation R2 of 0.83 for different years, which is comparable to those of other studies, but improves its performance at high pollution levels and fills the gaps in missing AOD on daily scale. The full coverage and near real-time updates of the daily PM2.5 data allow us to track the day-to-day variations in PM2.5 concentrations over China in a timely manner.

Since the beginning of the COVID\\\\19 (coronavirus disease 2019) outbreak, several public health interventions have been adopted to reduce viral spread. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and lockdown measures on Pediatric Emergency Department (ED) admission for acute wheezing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared demographics and clinical data of patients admitted to the ED for acute wheezing during the COVID\\\\19 outbreak and in the 5 previous years through a retrospective cross\\\\sectional study. RESULTS: During the COVID\\\\19 outbreak we observed an average drop of 83% in pediatric ED admission for acute wheezing, compared to the 5 previous years. In this period, 121 (80.7%) children presented with wheezing and 29 (19.3%) with bronchiolitis. The mean age of the sample was higher compared to the 5 previous years. We also noted an increased number of children presenting with higher acuity color codes during the COVID\\\\19 period, while no differences emerged as for the hospitalizations. During the pandemic we recorded a decrease in the number of viral infections detected. Only two cases of wheezing associated with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 were identified. CONCLUSION: The COVID\\\\19 outbreak and the national lockdown led to a drop of the number of admission to the ED for wheezing in children. This could be due to a reduction in the circulation of common respiratory viruses and partially to a reduced exposure to aeroallergens during the COVID\\\\19 period.

The misinformation or disinformation which stems from uncertainties, unrest, and anxiety because of movement control order procedures, financial and economic hardship caused wrong information to spread like fire. Called as 'info-demic', it becomes a second source of virulent information that requires arresting just like the pandemic itself. Controlling fake news in the time of pandemic is a daunting problem that slaps Internet regulation at its face. On the Internet, lies spreads faster than truth and correcting misinformation means tonnes of work. This paper examines Internet self- and co-regulatory approaches in selected jurisdictions to reduce the impact of fake news on governments, industry, and private actors. In applying content analysis as a qualitative research method, the first section analysed specific legislations enacted by parliaments to criminalise the acts of disseminating and publishing fake news. The second section examines legislative and administrative efforts to impose civil and criminal liability on platform providers to monitor online content. The final section analysed self-regulatory efforts to introduce online fact-checking portals and awareness campaigns.

Novel point-of-care antigen assays present a promising opportunity for rapid screening for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. The purpose of this study was the clinical assessment of the new Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test.Methods. The clinical performance of Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test was evaluated versus a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) laboratory-based assay (Seegene AllplexTM2019-nCoV) in nasopharyngeal swabs collected from a series of consecutive patients referred for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics to Pederzoli Hospital (Peschiera del Garda, Verona, Italy) over a 2-week period.Results. The final study population consisted of 321 consecutive patients (mean age, 46 years and IQR, 32-56 years;181 women, 56.4%), with 149/321 (46.4%) positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA via the Seegene AllplexTM2019-nCoV Assay, and 109/321 (34.0%) positive with Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test, respectively. The overall accuracy of Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test compared to molecular testing was 86.9%, with 72.5% sensitivity and 99.4% specificity. Progressive decline in performance was observed as cycle threshold (Ct) values of different SARS-CoV-2 gene targets increased.

This virus pandemic has turned more complicated as individuals with co-morbidities like diabetes, cardiovascular conditions and obesity are at a high risk of acquiring infection and suffering from a more severe course of disease. Prolonged viral infection and obesity are independently known to lower the immune response and a combination can thus result in a \\"cytokine storm\\" and a substantial weakening of the immune system. With the rise in obesity cases globally, the chances that obese individuals will acquire infection and need hospitalization are heightened. In this review, we discuss why obesity, a low-grade chronic inflammation, contributes toward the increased severity in COVID-19 patients. We suggest that increased inflammation, activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, elevated adipokines and higher ectopic fat may be the factors contributing to the disease severity, in particular deteriorating the cardiovascular and lung function, in obese individuals.

Examples of serious ethical issues include sexual abuse of patients (Dubois, Walsh, Chibnall et al., 2017), criminal prescription of opioids (Johnson, 2019) and unnecessary surgical procedures (Tayade and Dalvi, 2016) or shortages in service delivery because of little knowledge or experience especially during pandemic outbreaks (Hay-David et al., 2020). In many cases involving medical ethics, patients are identified as the first victims; however, this study aimed to consider clinicians and other healthcare practitioners as other probable victims (Ozeke et al., 2019). Design/methodology/approach: The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that tens of millions of patients worldwide suffer disabling injuries or death every year due to unsafe medical practices and services. Nearly, one in ten patients is harmed due to preventable causes while receiving health care in well-funded and technologically advanced hospital settings (WHO, 2016). Much less is known about the burden of unsafe care in non-hospital settings, where most healthcare services are delivered (Jha et al., 2013). Furthermore, there is little evidence concerning the burden of unsafe care in developing countries, where the risk of harm to patients is likely to be greater, due to limitations in infrastructure, technologies and human resources (Elmontsri et al., 2018). Findings: While these problems are endemic in health care, they are exacerbated in times of health and social crises such as the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This pandemic has few precedents, being most closely paralleled with the global influenza pandemic of 1918 (Terry, 2020). Initially compared to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002C2003 (Parrym, 2003), COVID-19 is already proving much more deadly. The WHOs estimates of the number of SARS cases from the start of the outbreak in 2002, until it was brought under control in July 2003, was 8,437 cumulative cases, with 813 deaths (WHO, 2003). The European Center for disease prevention and Control estimated that as of May 15, 2020, that 4,405,680 cases of COVID-19 have been reported with 302,115 deaths (ECDC, 2020) Research limitations/implications: The outbreak of COVID-19 was declared in February 2020 in the Islamic Republic of Iran, and up to March 2020, the cases of morbidity reached 12,729, with 611 deaths (Bedasht, 2020). The current figure at the time of editing (May 16, 2020) is 118,392 cases, with 6,937 deaths (Worldometer, 2020). Acting in cognizance of its ethical responsibility to the citizens of Iran, the Iranian government has taken the following action to attempt to mitigate the deleterious effects of the virus: in each province, one or more hospitals have been evacuated and allocated to patients with pulmonary problems with suspected to COVID-19. Access to intensive care units and specialist equipment is a primary ethical issue that concerns the Iranian healthcare system. The issue is exacerbated by the knowledge that these facilities are not distributed equitably in the country. Therefore, equity is the first ethical concern in this situation. Practical implications: All nurses, clinicians, practitioners and specialists have been asked to volunteer their services in hospitals in the most infected areas. This raises ethical concerns about access to personal protective equipment (PPE) such as appropriate masks, gowns, gloves and other equipment to protect healthcare workers from infection. Access to PPE was restricted because of government failure to stockpile the necessary amount of disposable medical equipment. This was related to lack of domestic capacity to produce the equipment and problems accessing it internationally due to political-economic sanctions that were imposed on Iran by the USA and some European countries. Such shortages can quickly lead to a catastrophic situation; current evidence demonstrates that about 40% of healthcare workers are vulnerable to the COVID-19 infection (Behdasht, 2020). However, it should be noted that this is not a problem limited to Iran. As of March 2020, the WHO was already warning about PPE shortages and the dangers this posed for healthcare workers around the world (WHO, 2020). Social implications: A Disaster Committee was created by the Iranian Ministry of Health to take responsibility for decision-making and daily information sharing to the community. The ethical dilemma that arises in terms of reporting the situation is the conflict between transparently presenting accurate and timely information and the creation of public panic and fear that this may cause in the community. Originality/value: As a steward for public health, the Ministry of Health was afforded direct responsibility to maintain intra-sector relationships and leadership with other organizations such as political executive organizations, municipalities, military agencies, schools, universities and other public organizations to reach consensus on the best methods of controlling the COVID-19 outbreak. An important ethical issue is found in potential areas of conflict between the therapeutic and preventive roles of the Ministry of Health and those related to public health and the civil administrations.","output":"Reflections on COVID-19 and the ethical issues for healthcare providers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Statement of problem Salivary gland ducts are one of the primary targets of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

We will also search electronic grey literature databases, Internet search engines and organizational websites; hand search reference list of previous systematic reviews and included study records; and consult additional experts. STUDY ELIGIBILITY AND CRITERIA We will include working-age (15 years) participants in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State, but exclude child workers (<15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. For Systematic Review 1, we will include quantitative prevalence studies of relevant levels of occupational exposure to long working hours (i.e. 35-40, 41-48, 49-54 and 55 h/week) stratified by country, sex, age and industrial sector or occupation, in the years 2005-2018. For Systematic Review 2, we will include randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies with an estimate of the relative effect of relevant level(s) of long working hours on the incidence of or mortality due to depression, compared with the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (i.e. 35-40 h/week). STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS At least two review authors will independently screen titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. At least two review authors will assess risk of bias and the quality of evidence, using the most suited tools currently available. For Systematic Review 2, if feasible, we will combine relative risks using meta-analysis. We will report results using the guidelines for accurate and transparent health estimates reporting (GATHER) for Systematic Review 1 and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines (PRISMA) for Systematic Review 2.

This study shows that the gap between knowledge and behaviour, in the context of COVID-19 pandemic, consists of two components: knowledge-intention gap and intention-behaviour gap. It is important to be aware that cognitively communicating public risks, e.g. by providing statistical information, is not enough to nudge behavioural improvement regarding COVID-19.

This study aimed to investigate associations between DPP-4 inhibitors and risk of autoimmune disorders in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Taiwan. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used the nationwide data from the diabetes subsection of Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2013. Cox proportional hazards models were developed to compare the risk of autoimmune disorders and the subgroup analyses between the DPP-4i and DPP-4i-na?ve groups. RESULTS: A total of 774,198 type 2 diabetic patients were identified. The adjusted HR of the incidence for composite autoimmune disorders in DPP-4i group was 0.56 (95% CI 0.53C0.60; P < 0.001). The subgroup analysis demonstrated that the younger patients (aged 20C40 years: HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.35C0.61; aged 41C60 years: HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.46C0.55; aged 61C80 years: HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.58C0.68, P = 0.0004) and the lesser duration of diabetes diagnosed (0C5 years: HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.44C0.52; 6C10 years: HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.43C0.53; R 10 years: HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78C0.96, P < 0.0001), the more significant the inverse association of DPP-4 inhibitors with the incidence of composite autoimmune diseases. CONCLUSIONS: DPP-4 inhibitors are associated with lower risk of autoimmune disorders in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Taiwan, especially for the younger patients and the lesser duration of diabetes diagnosed.

Specifically, we aimed to: (1) Describe the impact of COVID on patients and associated rehabilitation needs; (2) Outline the adaptations and preparations required to enable the provision of COVID rehabilitation; (3) Describe the types of rehabilitation services and treatments provided to COVID patients; and (4) Identify barriers and facilitators to delivering COVID rehabilitation. LITERATURE SURVEY: We searched Medline, PsychINFO, Embase, and CINAHL on June 26(th), 2020 using key words such as rehabilitation, physical medicine, allied health professionals and variations of COVID. The search was updated on October 13(th), 2020. We included articles published in English and that focused on some aspect of COVID rehabilitation for adults. We excluded articles focused on pediatric populations and those not focused (or minimally focused) on rehabilitation for COVID patients. METHODOLOGY: Data were charted based on article type (i.e. primary data, secondary data, guidelines). Key information extracted included: (i) COVID sequelae; (ii) rehabilitation adaptations; (iii) structure, function and content of rehabilitation services/programs; (iv) facilitators and/or barriers to providing COVID rehabilitation; and (v) recommendations for COVID rehabilitation programming. Data were synthesized narratively. SYNTHESIS: In total, 129 articles were included in the review that reported primary data (n=33), secondary data (n=82), and clinical practice/patient self\\\\management guidelines (n=13). Evidence begins to suggest that rehabilitation is necessary and valuable for addressing COVID\\\\related declines in health, function, and well\\\\being. Most articles recommended that an individualized rehabilitation program be provided across the continuum of care by an interdisciplinary team of professionals and that the nature and extent of rehabilitation be informed by the care setting and COVID severity. Most issues that challenged COVID rehabilitation delivery were directly addressed by the facilitators and adaptations identified. CONCLUSIONS: Future recommendations include a greater emphasis on the psychosocial aspects of COVID rehabilitation, inclusion of families in rehabilitation planning, and the use of qualitative approaches to complement clinical data.

Vitamin D was found to play an essential role in DVT, and gender may influence the serum vitamin D levels. This study aimed to explore whether vitamin D played a role in the gender difference in DVT. Materials and Methods: A total of 444 patients with acute stroke were recruited, which were divided into the DVT group (n = 222) and the non-DVT group (n = 222). Serum vitamin D levels were measured after admission and were split into three categories, including deficiency (<50 nmol/L), insufficiency (52.5C72.5 nmol/L), and sufficiency (more than 75 nmol/L). Hierarchical regression analysis was adopted to analyze the relationship between gender and DVT, controlling the confounding factors. Results: Females showed a higher proportion of DVT than males (60.7 vs. 42.5%, p < 0.001), and lower serum vitamin D levels than males (53.44  16.45 vs. 69.43  23.14, p < 0.001). Moreover, serum vitamin D levels were lower in the DVT group than in the non-DVT group (59.44  19.61 vs. 66.24  23.86, p < 0.001). Besides, the DVT group showed a lower proportion of vitamin D sufficiency than the non-DVT group (21.2 vs. 32.9%, p < 0.05). Hierarchical regression analysis showed that females had 2.083-fold (p < 0.001, unadjusted model) and 1.413-fold (p = 0.155, adjusted model) risk to develop DVT. In addition, the sufficiency status of vitamin D showed an independent protective effect on DVT (unadjusted model OR, 0.504, p = 0.004; adjusted model OR, 0.686, p = 0.011). Conclusion: Females had a higher risk of DVT than males, and vitamin D may play an essential role in this relationship.

METHODS Patients under combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) with fully suppressed HIV plasma viral load (pVL) >24 months-whereof >6 months on an NVP- containing regimen-were switched to oral NVP plus 3TC for 24 weeks. Patients could then decide whether to continue DT or return to the previous cART. HIV pVL was monitored monthly until week 144. The primary outcome was confirmed viral failure (RNA >100 copies/ml). Low-level detection of HIV-RNA in plasma was compared in each patient with pre-study viral load measurements. RESULTS Twenty patients were included, switched to DT and all completed week 24. One patient decided thereafter to discontinue study participation for personal reasons. After a total of 144 observation weeks, none of the patients failed. The frequency of low- level HIV-RNA detection was not different from the period before randomization. CONCLUSIONS Our findings are surprising but given the nature of a proof-of-concept study, the results do not support the use of this dual regimen. However, as this dual HIV maintenance strategy was feasible and effective, over a period of 144 weeks, we suggest NVP plus 3TC warrants further evaluation as potential maintenance option in patients tolerating nevirapine.

Formal child care has an important role in supporting breastfeeding, as many Australian infants commence care before two years of age. Currently, little is known about support or barriers in child care contexts. The present qualitative instrumental case study explores practices which protect, promote and support breastfeeding at a child care centre located in the Australian Capital Territory's outer suburbs. Extending from a previously published collective case study, a cultural-institutional focus of analysis was used to explore the roles of proximity, flexibility and communication in supporting breastfeeding within a child care centre located close to an infant's home. Interviews with centre staff and mothers, triangulated with observations of the centre environment and policy documents provide insight into the environment. Affirming the roles of flexibility in routine and staff rostering and two-way communication, findings suggest longer-term benefits may be derived from selecting a child care centre close to an infant's home, provided mothers can overcome barriers to breastmilk expression in the workplace. The study recognises the role of non-lactating caregivers in the transition to formal child care, and of the support culture for educators who breastfeed.

The number of measures used, and the range of measures applied, have far exceeded previous public health emergencies of international concern. However, efforts to advance research, policy and practice to support their effective use has been hindered by a lack of clear and consistent definition. RESULTS: Based on a review of existing datasets for cross-border health measures, such as the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker and World Health Organization Public Health and Social Measures, along with analysis of secondary and grey literature, we propose six categories to define measures more clearly and consistently - policy goal, type of movement (travel and trade), adopted by public or private sector, level of jurisdiction applied, stage of journey, and degree of restrictiveness. These categories are then brought together into a proposed typology that can support research with generalizable findings and comparative analyses across jurisdictions. Addressing the current gaps in evidence about travel measures, including how different jurisdictions apply such measures with varying effects, in turn, enhances the potential for evidence-informed decision-making based on fuller understanding of policy trade-offs and externalities. Finally, through the adoption of standardized terminology and creation of an agreed evidentiary base recognized across jurisdictions, the typology can support efforts to strengthen coordinated global responses to outbreaks and inform future efforts to revise the WHO International Health Regulations (2005). CONCLUSIONS: The widespread use of cross-border health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted significant reflection on available evidence, previous practice and existing legal frameworks. The typology put forth in this paper aims to provide a starting point for strengthening research, policy and practice.","output":"Managing borders during public health emergencies of international concern: a proposed typology of cross-border health measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Regulated cell death frequently occurs upon infection by intracellular pathogens, and extent and regulation is often cell-type-specific. We aimed to identify the cell death-signaling pathways triggered in macrophages by infection with modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), an attenuated strain of vaccinia virus used in vaccination. While most target cells seem to be protected by antiapoptotic proteins encoded in the MVA genome, macrophages die when infected with MVA. We targeted key signaling components of specific cell death-pathways and pattern recognition-pathways using genome editing and small molecule inhibitors in an in vitro murine macrophage differentiation model. Upon infection with MVA, we observed activation of mitochondrial and death-receptor-induced apoptosis-pathways as well as the necroptosis-pathway. Inhibition of individual pathways had a little protective effect but led to compensatory death through the other pathways. In the absence of mitochondrial apoptosis, autocrine/paracrine TNF-mediated apoptosis and, in the absence of caspase-activity, necroptosis occurred. TNF-induction depended on the signaling molecule STING, and MAVS and ZBP1 contributed to MVA-induced apoptosis. The mode of cell death had a substantial impact on the cytokine response of infected cells, indicating that the immunogenicity of a virus may depend not only on its PAMPs but also on its ability to modulate individual modalities of cell death. These findings provide insights into the diversity of cell death-pathways that an infection can trigger in professional immune cells and advance our understanding of the intracellular mechanisms that govern the immune response to a virus.","output":"Diversity of cell death signaling pathways in macrophages upon infection with modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research is a quantitative study aimed to find the effect of the Google meet application on student interest in the University of Nurul Jadid Paiton Probolinggo by using experimental design research design using two parallel classes, one class is used for experimental treatments and one other class as a control class There is a significant difference between the experimental class conducted by learning using the Google Meet application and the control class where the learning process is carried out directly (face to face) The highest interval of interest in learning is found in the experimental class with a score of 110 and the lowest with a score of 94 with an average interval of 101 84 While the control class only had the highest score of 106 and the lowest score of 70 with an average interval of 89 52 So with this overall data that learning using the Google meet application has a very high influence on student interest in learning this is because the learner is very easy to implement, time is flexible and can be implemented where each student is located ?

On the one hand, it is widely acknowledged that biowaste treatment processes such as composting should be adopted to divert biowaste from landfills, protect the environment, safeguard human health and well-being, and comply with the European environmental policies and legislation;on the other hand, national and local government efforts that promote its implementation appear to be lethargic preventing the move toward a sustainable bioeconomy. Using the political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal (PESTEL) approach, the study conceptually explores the underlying motives and multitude of reasons that may preclude the adoption of composting for biowaste management. Findings suggest that the lack of a biowaste management infrastructure investment strategy plan has derailed progress on biowaste management, despite the national government's rhetoric to promote sustainable development. Moreover, the lack of waste planning at the local level, public awareness on the consequences of biowaste mismanagement, and the lack of market demand for the compost produced are additional barriers to the adoption of composting. This emphasizes the urgent need for collaboration between the national and local governments to promote the development of a functional, sustainable biowaste management strategy. The study informs on the need of policy and decision-makers to prioritise the development of biowaste management strategy that would be broadly implemented could not only help Cyprus reduce its reliance on landfills and comply with the European legislation, but create environmental, economic and social value via the recovery of resources from biowaste and a sense of responsibility to its public.

ObjectivesEvaluate safety and immunogenicity of 100-{micro}g of mRNA-1273 booster dose in adults. DesignOpen-label, Phase 2/3 study. SettingMulticenter study at 8 sites in the U.S. ParticipantsThe mRNA-1273 100-{micro}g booster was administered to adults who previously received a two dose primary series of 100-{micro}g mRNA-1273 in the phase 3 Coronavirus Efficacy (COVE) trial, at least 6 months earlier. InterventionLipid nanoparticle containing 100-{micro}g of mRNA encoding the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-HU-1). Main Outcomes and MeasuresSolicited local and systemic adverse reactions, and unsolicited adverse events were collected after vaccination. Primary immunogenicity objectives were to demonstrate non-inferiority of the neutralizing antibody (nAb) response against SARS-CoV-2 based on the geometric mean titer (GMTs) and the seroresponse rates (SRRs) (booster dose vs. primary series in a historical control group). nAbs against SARS-CoV-2 variants were also evaluated. ResultsThe 100-{micro}g booster dose had a greater incidence of local and systemic adverse reactions compared to the second dose of mRNA-1273 as well as the 50-{micro}g mRNA-1273 booster in separate studies. The geometric mean titers (GMTs; 95% CI) of SARS-CoV-2 nAbs against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 at 28 days after the 100-{micro}g booster dose were 4039.5 (3592.7,4541.8) and 1132.0 (1046.7,1224.2) at 28 days after the second dose in the historical control group [GMT ratio=3.6 (3.1,4.2)]. SRRs (95% CI) were 100% (98.6,100) at 28 days after the booster and 98.1% (96.7,99.1) 28 days after the second dose in the historical control group [percentage difference=1.9% (0.4,3.3)]. The GMT ratio (GMR) and SRR difference for the booster as compared to the primary series met the pre-specified non-inferiority criteria. Delta-specific nAbs also increased (GMT fold-rise=233.3) after the 100-{micro}g booster of mRNA-1273. Conclusions and RelevanceThe 100-{micro}g mRNA-1273 booster induced a robust neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV-2, and reactogenicity was higher with the 100-{micro}g booster dose compared to the authorized booster dose level in adults (50-{micro}g). mRNA-1273 100-{micro}g booster dose can be considered when eliciting an antibody response might be challenging such as in moderately or severely immunocompromised hosts. Trial Registration: NCT04927065 Key PointsQuestion: What is the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of 100 {micro}g of mRNA-1273 in adults who previously received the primary series of mRNA-1273? Findings: In this open-label, Phase 2/3 study, the 100 {micro}g booster dose of mRNA-1273 had a greater incidence of local and systemic adverse reactions compared to a 50 {micro}g booster dose of mRNA- 1273 or after the second dose of mRNA-1273 during the primary series. The 100 {micro}g booster dose of mRNA-1273 induced a robust antibody response against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and variants.

METHODS: We conducted an online sociodemographic and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) survey during the second phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Mexico to evaluate the presence of psychological distress, signs of post-traumatic stress, and to identify the groups at highest risk in the sample. RESULTS: Prevalence of psychological distress at moderate or severe levels in the sample were as follows: 943 (22%) intrusive thoughts, 933 (22.3%) avoidance, and 515 (12.2%) hyperarousal. Furthermore, we found the symptoms of clinically significant post-traumatic stress in 1160 (27.7%) of the participants. The variables positively correlated with higher psychological distress were as follows: age (younger), sex (female), employment (employed), relationship status (single), in social isolation, number of days in isolation, the number of people in the household (3-5), and a perception of a high risk of contracting COVID-19, change in routine, engaging in less activity, and loss of income.

Over 30 new infectious agents have been detected worldwide in the last three decades; 60 per cent of these are of zoonotic origin. Developing countries such as India suffer disproportionately from the burden of infectious diseases given the confluence of existing environmental, socio-economic, and demographic factors. In the recent past, India has seen outbreaks of eight organisms of emerging and re-emerging diseases in various parts of the country, six of these are of zoonotic origin. Prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases will increasingly require the application of sophisticated epidemiologic and molecular biologic technologies, changes in human behaviour, a national policy on early detection of and rapid response to emerging infections and a plan of action. WHO has made several recommendations for national response mechanisms. Many of these are in various stages of implementation in India. However, for a country of size and population of India, the emerging infections remain a real and present danger. A meaningful response must approach the problem at the systems level. A comprehensive national strategy on infectious diseases cutting across all relevant sectors with emphasis on strengthened surveillance, rapid response, partnership building and research to guide public policy is needed.","output":"Emerging & re-emerging infections in India: An overview"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus may have a negative impact not only on physical, but also on mental wellbeing.

The use of this technique can reduce postoperative pain and length of stay and gives the surgeon the same operative perspective as open surgery. METHODS We retrospectively analysed the data of 73 patients who underwent uniportal VATS lobectomies from November 2014 to December 2015 in our institution. We divided the patients in two groups (group 1: first 30 patients vs. group 2: established phase, 43 patients) to compare and evaluate the data regarding the learning curve. To explore evolution of learning curve, data were plotted to calculate Spearman's Rank-Order Correlation. R (version 3.2.3) was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS The median age was 69.9 (group 1) and 68.8 (group 2) years. Mean operative time was 84.933.0 (group 1) and 84.831.5 (group 2) minutes. The conversion rate was 13.3% in group 1 vs. 9.3% in group 2, showing a significant learning reduction (rho=0.590). Overall morbidity rate was 15.1%. The most common complication consisted in prolonged air leak. Interpolation line of complications showed a significant decrease due to learning curve (rho=0.676). The median length of stay was 4 days in group 1 vs. 3 days in group 2. The 30-day mortality was 3.3% in group 1 and 0% in group 2. CONCLUSIONS The comparison between the groups showed that the median length of stay, operative time, conversion rate and 30-day mortality statistically significantly improved in the established phase. Also, complications like prolonged air leak were decreasing in the established phase. In conclusion, the uniportal VATS lobectomy technique can be performed safely from experienced surgeons without major complications and with an acceptable mortality rate.","output":"Learning curve and established phase for uniportal VATS lobectomies: the Papworth experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is forcing our entire society to adopt numerous changes, at least until an effective treatment and/or vaccine becomes widely available.

By virtue of lung ultrasound scores (LUSS), lung ultrasonography (LUS) was used to estimate the excessive lung fluid which is an important clinical manifestation of COVID-19 PN, with high sensitivity and specificity. However, as a qualitative method, LUSS suffered from large inter-observer variations and requirement for experienced clinicians. Considering this limitation, we developed a quantitative and automatic lung ultrasound scoring system for evaluating the COVID-19 PN. A total of 1527 ultrasound images prospectively collected from 31 COVID-19 PN patients with different clinical conditions were evaluated and scored with LUSS by experienced clinicians. All images were processed via a series of computer aided analysis including curve-to-linear conversion, pleural line detection, region of interest (ROI) selection and feature extraction. A collection of 28 features extracted from the ROI was specifically deofined for mimicking the LUSS. Multi-layer fully connected neural networks, support vector machines and decision trees were developed for scoring LUS images using the 5-fold cross-validation. The model with 128C256 two fully connected layers gave the best accuracy of 87%.

Like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), NL63 also employs the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor for cellular entry. To identify residues in the spike protein of NL63 that are important for hACE2 binding, this study first generated a series of S1-truncated variants, examined their associations with the hACE2 receptor and subsequently mapped a minimal receptor-binding domain (RBD) that consisted of 141 residues (aa 476-616) towards the C terminus of the S1 domain. The data also demonstrated that the NL63 RBD bound to hACE2 more efficiently than its full-length counterpart and had a binding efficiency comparable to the S1 or RBD of SARS-CoV.

We collected blood within 24 h of ARDS onset, generated expression profiles, and performed k-means clustering to identify sub-phenotypes. We tested the association between sub-phenotypes and PICU mortality and ventilator-free days at 28 days using multivariable logistic and competing risk regression, respectively. RESULTS: We enrolled 106 subjects, of whom 96 had usable samples. We identified three sub-phenotypes, dubbed CHOP ARDS Transcriptomic Subtypes (CATS) 1, 2, and 3. CATS-1 subjects (n = 31) demonstrated persistent hypoxemia, had ten subjects (32%) with immunocompromising conditions, and 32% mortality. CATS-2 subjects (n = 29) had more immunocompromising diagnoses (48%), rapidly resolving hypoxemia, and 24% mortality.

In our model, viruses exhibit variable binding to cells, with better infection and replication countered by a stronger immune response and a high rate of mutation. By varying host conditions (permissivity to viral entry T and immune clearance intensity A) for large numbers of cells and viruses, we study the dynamics of how viral populations evolve from initial infection to steady state and obtain a phase diagram of the range of cell and viral responses. We find three distinct replicative strategies corresponding to three physiological classes of viral infections: acute, chronic, and opportunistic. We show similarities between our findings and the behavior of real viral infections such as common flu, hepatitis, and SARS-CoV-2019. The phases associated with the three strategies are separated by a phase transition of primarily first order, in addition to a crossover region. Our simulations also reveal a wide range of physical phenomena, including metastable states, periodicity, and glassy dynamics. Lastly, our results suggest that the resolution of acute viral disease in patients whose immunity cannot be boosted can only be achieved by significant inhibition of viral infection and replication. Author summaryVirus, in particular RNA viruses, often produce offspring with slightly altered genetic composition. This process occurs both across host populations and within a single host over time. Here, we study the interactions of viruses with cells inside a host over time. In our model, the viruses encounter host cell defenses characterized by two parameters: permissivity to viral entry T and immune response A). The viruses then mutate upon reproduction, eventually resulting in a distribution of related viral types termed a quasi-species distribution. Across varying host conditions (T, A), three distinct viral quasi-species types emerge over time, corresponding to three classes of viral infections: acute, chronic and opportunistic. We interpret these results in terms of real viral types such as common flu, hepatitis, and also SARS-CoV-2019. Analysis of viral of viral mutant populations over a wide range of permissivity and immunity, for large numbers of cells and viruses, reveals phase transitions that separate the three classes of viruses, both in the infection-cycle dynamics and at steady state. We believe that such a multiscale approach for the study of within-host viral infections, spanning individual proteins to collections of cells, can provide insight into developing more effective therapies for viral disease.","output":"Modeling the dynamics of within-host viral infection and evolution predicts quasispecies distributions and phase boundaries separating distinct classes of infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The systematic position of a large and strikingly coloured reddish-black moth, Cartaletis dargei Herbulot, 2003 (Geometridae: Sterrhinae) from Tanzania, has remained questionable since its description.

IRF 3 and IRF7 play a critical role as key transcription factors in the activation of the IFN induction. Viruses have evolved a variety of strategies to evade innate immunity. Our previous studies have shown that the nonstructural protein (NSs) of the severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) can suppress the IFN- induction through its interaction with tank-binding kinase-1 and sequestering the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase(IKK) complex into the inclusion bodies formed by NSs. In this study, we characterized the unique function of IRF7 in innate immunity and its role in inducing IFN- in particular, regulated by NSs during the SFTSV infection in several cell types of human origin. Whereas IRF3 is constitutively expressed, IRF7 was significantly induced differentially in various cell types in response to SFTSV infection, promoted the induction of IFN-2 and -4, and further induced IFN-, thus contributing to suppressing the viral replication. Our data indicate that NSs directly interacted with and sequestered IRF7 into the inclusion bodies, which is different from IRF3 indirectly interacting with NSs. Although interaction of NSs with IRF7 did not inhibit IRF7 phosphorylation, p-IRF7 was trapped in the inclusion bodies, resulting in a significant reduction of the IFN-2 and -4 induction and therefore enhanced viral replication. Interaction of the viral NSs with both IRF7 and IRF3 and subsequent sequestration of these transcription factors into viral inclusion bodies, a unique strategy used by this phlebovirus, may ensure effective evasion and suppression of host innate immunity.","output":"Suppression of the IFN- and - Induction through Sequestering IRF7 into Viral Inclusion Bodies by Nonstructural Protein NSs in Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Bunyavirus Infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent revolution in computational protein structure prediction provides folding models for entire proteomes, which can now be integrated with large-scale experimental data.

In this study, we determine the structural context of these PTMs and investigate how this information can be leveraged to pinpoint potential regulatory sites. Our analysis uncovers global patterns of PTM occurrence across folded and intrinsically disordered regions. We found that this information can help to distinguish regulatory PTMs from those marking improperly folded proteins. Interestingly, the human proteome contains thousands of proteins that have large folded domains linked by short, unstructured regions that are strongly enriched in regulatory phosphosites. These include well-known kinase activation loops that induce protein conformational changes upon phosphorylation. This regulatory mechanism appears to be widespread in kinases but also occurs in other protein families such as solute carriers. It is not limited to phosphorylation but includes ubiquitination and acetylation sites as well. Furthermore, we performed three-dimensional proximity analysis which revealed examples of spatial co-regulation of different PTM types and potential PTM crosstalk.

The objective of this study was to determine the magnitude of non-adherence and its contributing factors among diabetes mellitus patients attending the diabetes mellitus clinic at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital. OBJECTIVE: To assess prevalence and factors contributing to non-adherence to antidiabetic medication among diabetes mellitus patients in the diabetic clinic at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was adopted at the diabetes clinic, Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital, between July and October 2020. Study participants were systemically sampled, and data regarding their medication non-adherence was collected using a structured questionnaire, based on the Hill-Bone medication adherence scale. Data entry was done using Microsoft Excel Version 2010, and analysis was carried out using STATA version 13. The odds ratio was used to determine the strength of association between diabetic medication non-adherence and associated factors. The cutoff value for all statistical significance tests was set at p < 0.05 with a confidence interval of 95%. RESULTS: A total of 257 participants were recruited with a 100% response rate. More than one-third (98, 38.1%) of the participants were non-adherent to their antidiabetic medication.

In order to assess for infectiousness reproduction numbers have been widely used in existing literature. A recent research has estimated reproduction numbers by location in order to account for differences among infectiousness. Aims and Objective: The aim of the present work was to use reproduction numbers in order to obtain an estimate for the mean number of contacts of some patient up to the first transmission of the disease to some other person in a specific location. The objective is to help authorities collect even more information on disease transmission. Materials and Methods: Our study was based on results obtained in a recent research work where replicated values of reproduction numbers have been generated in order to estimate medians and 95% confidence intervals for these numbers and thus assess infectiousness. We proposed a method that relies on a geometric distribution such that the parameter for this distribution is related to these reproduction numbers. Results: Our method showed that large reproduction numbers were associated with small mean numbers of contacts up to first transmission of the disease whereas small reproduction numbers were associated with a large mean number of contacts up to first transmission of the disease for all the locations under investigation. Conclusion: Our method has shown a nice performance and thus it can be considered as an alternative tool, by comparison with reproduction numbers, for assessing the risk of disease transmission, which is particularly useful when locations are investigated separately.

The key determinants of HRQOL have not been investigated in large populations of people with PD (PwPD). Our objective was to evaluate correlates of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in a large, online cohort of PwPD. METHODS: As part of an ongoing online cohort study, we performed a cross-sectional analysis at enrollment of 23,058 PwPD. We conducted univariate and stepwise multivariate linear regression analyses of HRQOL as measured by the EQ-5D-5L tool. In addition, we performed an interaction analysis to evaluate heterogeneity of the effect of motor symptoms on HRQOL and Spearman correlation analysis to evaluate the association of non-motor symptoms with HRQOL. RESULTS: In the multivariate linear regression model, participants with moderate or severe depression, more severe motor symptoms, and a higher burden of medical comorbidities had the most substantially decreased HRQOL as measured by the EQ index (beta=-0.11, -0.18, -0.02, -0.01 respectively, p<0.001 for all). An interaction analysis showed that more severe motor symptoms had a higher impact on individuals of female sex, lower educational level, lower income, more severe depression, and more severe cognitive impairment (p<0.01 for interaction terms). Neuropsychiatric symptoms and falls had the most negative associations with HRQOL (rho=-0.31-0.37, p<0.0001). DISCUSSION: Potentially treatable motor and non-motor symptoms, particularly neuropsychiatric symptoms, account for a large amount of the variation in HRQOL in PwPD. Motor symptoms may have differential effects on HRQOL in different demographic and clinical subpopulations, highlighting important areas for future health disparities research. Our findings provide targets for clinician intervention and future research on symptom management to optimize HRQOL in PD.

The Traditional Chinese Medicine Information Database TCM-ID, at http://tcm.cz3.nus.edu.sg/group/tcm-id/tcmid.asp, was introduced for providing comprehensive information about all aspects of TCM including prescriptions, constituent herbs, herbal ingredients, molecular structure and functional properties of active ingredients, therapeutic and side effects, clinical indication and application and related matters. RESULTS TCM-ID currently contains information for 1,588 prescriptions, 1,313 herbs, 5,669 herbal ingredients, and the 3D structure of 3,725 herbal ingredients. The value of the data in TCM-ID was illustrated by using some of the data for an in-silico study of molecular mechanism of the therapeutic effects of herbal ingredients and for developing a computer program to validate TCM multi-herb preparations. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The development of systems biology has led to a new design principle for therapeutic intervention strategy, the concept of 'magic shrapnel' (rather than the 'magic bullet'), involving many drugs against multiple targets, administered in a single treatment. TCM offers an extensive source of examples of this concept in which several active ingredients in one prescription are aimed at numerous targets and work together to provide therapeutic benefit.

Currently, neither effective therapeutic strategies nor approved vaccines exist for SFTS. Therefore, there remains a pressing need to better understand the pathogenesis of the disease and to identify therapeutic strategies to ameliorate SFTS outcomes. Using a type I interferon (IFN)-deficient mouse model, we investigated the viral tropism, disease kinetics, and the role of the virulence factor nonstructural protein (NSs) in SFTS. Ly6C(+) MHCII(+) cells in the lymphatic tissues were identified as an important target cell for SFTSV. Advanced SFTS was characterized by significant migration of inflammatory leukocytes, notably neutrophils, into the lymph node and spleen, however, these cells were not required to orchestrate the disease phenotype. The development of SFTS was associated with significant upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, including high levels of IFN- and IL-6 in the serum, lymph node, and spleen. Humoral immunity generated by inoculation with delNSs SFTSV was 100% protective. Importantly, NSs was critical to the inhibition of the host IFN? response or downstream IFN-stimulated gene production and allowed for the establishment of severe disease. Finally, therapeutic but not prophylactic use of anti-IL-6 antibodies significantly increased the survival of mice following SFTSV infection and, therefore, this treatment modality presents a novel therapeutic strategy for treating severe SFTS.","output":"Exploration of immunological responses underpinning severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus infection reveals IL-6 as a therapeutic target in an immunocompromised mouse model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Delays in elective and non-urgent procedures along with economic hardships brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in long-term negative consequences for women across the US. Time-sensitive and lifesaving cancer screening and care have been canceled and delayed. This abstract will discuss the devastating and irreversible impact that these delays and cancellations in screening, diagnosis, and treatment have had on womens health and how they have exacerbated the deep-seated racial and ethnic health disparities in the US. Methods: Secondary research was conducted to identify the procedure rates, and further analysis was undergone to understand the willingness to attend screenings and care. This analysis also explores the link between COVID-19, healthcare inequities, and the impact on womens health, with a focus on mammograms and breast cancer. Results: A survey of 600 breast care patients revealed that 60% had delays in diagnostic imaging and two-thirds had reconstruction surgery delayed. Another survey suggests that nearly half of breast cancer patients have delayed care during the pandemic. Additionally, an analysis by the nonprofit Families USA estimated that 5.4 million workers lost health insurance during the first three months of the pandemic. This financial instability and inability to pay for care disproportionately affected minority women, as the analysis revealed more women have lost their jobs compared to men, with black and Hispanic women experiencing even steeper declines. In June, the director of the National Cancer Institute proclaimed that a conservative model forecasts nearly 10,000 excess deaths from breast and colon cancer in the next decade because of drops in screening and treatment. Conclusions: As the industry emerges from the pandemic, new solutions and partnerships should address ways to develop effective and patient-tailored strategies for healthcare systems to provide adequate care for breast cancer patients, reduce inequities, and transform the future of womens health.","output":"PCN120 Clinical and Economic Consequences of Delayed Care Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic- Focus on Mammograms and Breast Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A subset of patients with coronavirus 2 disease (COVID-19) experience neurological complications. These complications include loss of sense of taste and smell, stroke, delirium, and neuromuscular signs and symptoms. The etiological agent of COVID-19 is SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), an RNA virus with a glycoprotein-studded viral envelope that uses ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) as a functional receptor for infecting the host cells. Thus, the interaction of the envelope spike proteins with ACE2 on host cells determines the tropism and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. Loss of sense of taste and smell is an initial symptom of COVID-19 because the virus enters the nasal and oral cavities first and the epithelial cells are the receptors for these senses. Stroke in COVID-19 patients is likely a consequence of coagulopathy and injury to cerebral vascular endothelial cells that cause thrombo-embolism and stroke. Delirium and encephalopathy in acute and post COVID-19 patients are likely multifactorial and secondary to hypoxia, metabolic abnormalities, and immunological abnormalities. Thus far, there is no clear evidence that coronaviruses cause inflammatory neuromuscular diseases via direct invasion of peripheral nerves or muscles or via molecular mimicry. It appears that most of neurologic complications in COVID-19 patients are indirect and as a result of a bystander injury to neurons.","output":"Neurological injuries in COVID-19 patients: direct viral invasion or a bystander injury after infection of epithelial/endothelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Physical impairment after critical illness is recognized as a part of the post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). About one third of intensive care unit (ICU) survivors suffer from long-term physical disability, yet the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remains poorly understood. The pro-inflammatory alarmin, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), promotes muscle dysfunction in experimental models, and HMGB1 stays elevated in some patients after ICU discharge. Accordingly, we investigated the relationship between HMGB1 plasma levels and physical performance in ICU survivors. METHODS Prospective cohort study of 100 ICU survivors from the general ICU at the Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden. Patients returned for follow up at three (58 patients) and six months (51 patients) after ICU discharge. Blood samples were collected, and a 6-min walk test (6-MWT), a handgrip-strength test (HST), and a timed-stands test (TST) performed. RESULTS Compared to reference values of the different physical tests, 16% of patients underperformed at all tests at three months and 12% at six months. All test results, except hand-grip strength left, improved significantly over the follow-up period (p < 0.05). There was no significant association between plasma HMGB1 levels at three and six months and scores on the three tests (6-MWT, TST, HST) (p = 0.50 - 0.69).

Case #2 was a 34-year-old woman whose treatment for SLE included 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine per day since 2017. She arrived at the clinic with a dry cough, asthenia, and myalgias. Case #3 was a 24-year-old woman who had been using 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine per day since 2010. She presented with asthenia, myalgias, headaches, hypogeusia, and anosmia. Case #4 was a 39-year-old woman taking 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine every day for SLE who presented with dyspnea, chest pain, odynophagia, hypogeusia, anosmia, diarrhea, and fever.

METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, hyperinflammatory states, and at least two of the following signs: fever (body temperature >38C), pulmonary infiltrates, or the need for supplemental oxygen in order to maintain an oxygen saturation greater than 92%. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive standard care plus a single dose of either tocilizumab (8 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo. The primary outcome was intubation or death, assessed in a time-to-event analysis. The secondary efficacy outcomes were clinical worsening and discontinuation of supplemental oxygen among patients who had been receiving it at baseline, both assessed in time-to-event analyses. RESULTS: We enrolled 243 patients; 141 (58%) were men, and 102 (42%) were women. The median age was 59.8 years (range, 21.7 to 85.4), and 45% of the patients were Hispanic or Latino. The hazard ratio for intubation or death in the tocilizumab group as compared with the placebo group was 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38 to 1.81; P = 0.64), and the hazard ratio for disease worsening was 1.11 (95% CI, 0.59 to 2.10; P = 0.73). At 14 days, 18.0% of the patients in the tocilizumab group and 14.9% of the patients in the placebo group had had worsening of disease. The median time to discontinuation of supplemental oxygen was 5.0 days (95% CI, 3.8 to 7.6) in the tocilizumab group and 4.9 days (95% CI, 3.8 to 7.8) in the placebo group (P = 0.69). At 14 days, 24.6% of the patients in the tocilizumab group and 21.2% of the patients in the placebo group were still receiving supplemental oxygen. Patients who received tocilizumab had fewer serious infections than patients who received placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab was not effective for preventing intubation or death in moderately ill hospitalized patients with Covid-19.

Swab samples were taken from individual ceiling ventilation openings and surfaces in central ducts. Samples were subsequently subjected to rRT-PCR targeting the N and E genes of SARS-CoV-2.

In two subsequent samplings, SARS-CoV-2 N and E genes were detected in seven and four out of 19 room vents, respectively. Central ventilation HEPA exhaust filters from the ward were found positive for both genes in three samples. Corresponding filters from two other, adjacent COVID-19 wards were also found positive. Infective ability of the samples was assessed by inoculation of susceptible cell cultures but could not be determined in these experiments. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in central ventilation systems, distant from patient areas, indicate that virus can be transported long distances and that droplet transmission alone cannot reasonably explain this, especially considering the relatively low air change rates in these wards.

Since several of these signal molecules are known to be associated with lipid raft (LR) domains, we investigated the role of LR during KSHV infection of HMVEC-d cells. Pretreatment of cells with LR-disrupting agents methyl beta-cyclo dextrin (MbetaCD) or nystatin significantly inhibited the expression of viral latent (ORF73) and lytic (ORF50) genes. LR disruption did not affect KSHV binding but increased viral DNA internalization. In contrast, association of internalized viral capsids with microtubules (MTs) and the quantity of infected nucleus-associated viral DNA were significantly reduced. Disorganized and disrupted MTs and thick rounded plasma membranes were observed in MbetaCD-treated cells. LR disruption did not affect KSHV-induced FAK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation; in contrast, it increased the phosphorylation of Src, significantly reduced the KSHV-induced PI3-K and RhoA-GTPase and NF-kappaB activation, and reduced the colocalizations of PI3-K and RhoA-GTPase with LRs. Biochemical characterization demonstrated the association of activated PI3-K with LR fractions which was inhibited by MbetaCD treatment. RhoA-GTPase activation was inhibited by PI3-K inhibitors, demonstrating that PI3-K is upstream to RhoA-GTPase. In addition, colocalization of Dia-2, a RhoA-GTPase activated molecule involved in MT activation, with LR was reduced. KSHV-RhoA-GTPase mediated acetylation and aggregation of MTs were also reduced. Taken together, these studies suggest that LRs of endothelial cells play critical roles in KSHV infection and gene expression, probably due to their roles in modulating KSHV-induced PI3-K, RhoA-GTPase, and Dia-2 molecules essential for postbinding and entry stages of infection such as modulation of microtubular dynamics, movement of virus in the cytoplasm, and nuclear delivery of viral DNA.","output":"Lipid rafts of primary endothelial cells are essential for Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus/human herpesvirus 8-induced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and RhoA-GTPases critical for microtubule dynamics and nuclear delivery of viral DNA but dispensable for binding and entry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Osteoporosis (OP) is a systemic bone disease characterized by decreased bone strength, microarchitectural changes in bone tissues, and increased risk of fracture.

Three proteins (a, a, and a) are translated directly from the genomic RNAs and the remaining proteins encoded on RNA and RNA are expressed via three subgenomic messenger RNAs (sgRNAs). sgRNA1 directs synthesis of the triple gene block 1 (TGB1) protein. The TGB2 protein, the TGB2 minor translational readthrough protein, and the TGB3 protein are expressed from sgRNA2, which is present in considerably lower abundance than sgRNA1. A third sgRNA, sgRNA, is required for expression of the b protein. We have used deletion analyses and site-specific mutations to define the boundaries of promoter regions that are critical for expression of the BSMV sgRNAs in infected protoplasts. The results reveal that the sgRNA1 promoter encompasses positions ?29 to ?2 relative to its transcription start site and is adjacent to a cis-acting element required for RNA replication that maps from ?107 to ?74 relative to the sgRNA1 start site. The core sgRNA2 promoter includes residues ?32 to ?17 relative to the sgRNA2 transcriptional start site, although maximal activity requires an upstream hexanucleotide sequence residing from positions ?64 to ?59. The sgRNA promoter maps from ?21 to +2 relative to its transcription start site and therefore partially overlaps the a gene. The sgRNA1, 2, and  promoters also differ substantially in sequence, but have similarities to the putative homologous promoters of other Hordeiviruses.

The authors sought to understand whether the experience of being assessed and receiving feedback differs between men and women internal medicine (IM) residents and how women respond to these experiences. METHOD A constructivist grounded theory approach to data collection and interpretation was used. The authors invited all IM residents in postgraduate years 1-3 at the University of Toronto to participate in semistructured focus groups (August-October 2019). Twenty-two residents participated (8 men, 14 women). Focus groups were divided by gender and training level. RESULTS The authors found a profound difference in experiences of receiving feedback between men and women residents. The themes of challenges to power and authority, tactics to re-establish power and authority, conflicting feedback from attendings, and ways of moving forward all diverged between men and women residents. Women repeatedly brought up feedback outside of official assessment moments and relied on symbols, such as a white coat, stethoscope, and demure clothing, to \\"dress the part\\" of a physician. Women also encountered conflicting feedback from supervisors regarding confidence and assertiveness (e.g., sometimes told to be more assertive, other times to be less), often resulting in self-censorship; similar feedback was rarely noted by men. CONCLUSIONS Gendered differences in the experiences of being assessed and receiving feedback are not always reflected in standard measures. Gender and medicine can be considered performative, and these findings demonstrate women IM residents integrate multiple forms of feedback to create the persona of the woman physician. The authors believe this research contributes a unique vantage point to the experience of women residents interpreting explicit and implicit feedback in IM and highlights the socialization that occurs to become a woman physician.","output":"Dressing the Part: Gender Differences in Residents' Experiences of Feedback in Internal Medicine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The year 2020 marks the start of the implementation of the Renewable Portfolio Standards in the Philippines. To raise the countrys renewable energy (RE) share to 35% by 2030 (aspirational target), an annual minimum incremental RE of 1% has been imposed to all mandated participants. This local-level policy implementation has allowed the assessment of RE resource adequacy to be carried out on a smaller geographical scale (i.e., province level). The case for grid-connected island provinces, such as our study area, can be more interesting because of the opportunity to self-sustainable energy production. In this paper, we assess the adequacy of domestic RE resources of Bohol province to reach this target by estimating the technical potential of solar, wind, biomass, and hydropower using spatio-temporal datasets. Then, for every identified potential RE project, we calculate the busbar levelized cost.

By targeting a specific region of the viral genome, siRNAs can efficiently downregulate viral replication and suppress viral infection. However, to achieve the desired therapeutic activity, siRNA requires a suitable delivery system. The VIPER (virus-inspired polymer for endosomal release) block copolymer has been reported as promising delivery system for both plasmid DNA and siRNA in the past years. It is composed of a hydrophilic block for condensation of nucleic acids as well as a hydrophobic, pH-sensitive block that, at acidic pH, exposes the membrane lytic peptide melittin, which enhances endosomal escape. In this study, we aimed at developing a formulation for pulmonary administration of siRNA to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung epithelial cells. After characterizing siRNA/VIPER polyplexes, the activity and safety profile were confirmed in a lung epithelial cell line. To further investigate the activity of the polyplexes in a more sophisticated cell culture system, an air-liquid interface (ALI) culture was established. siRNA/VIPER polyplexes reached the cell monolayer and penetrated through the mucus layer secreted by the cells. Additionally, the activity against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 in the ALI model was confirmed by qRT-PCR. To investigate translatability of our findings, the activity against SARS-CoV-2 was tested ex vivo in human lung explants. Here, siRNA/VIPER polyplexes efficiently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication. Finally, we verified the delivery of siRNA/VIPER polyplexes to lung epithelial cells in vivo, which represent the main cellular target of viral infection in the lung. In conclusion, siRNA/VIPER polyplexes efficiently delivered siRNA to lung epithelial cells and mediated robust downregulation of viral replication both in vitro and ex vivo without toxic or immunogenic side effects in vivo, demonstrating the potential of local siRNA delivery as a promising antiviral therapy in the lung.","output":"Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lung with siRNA/VIPER polyplexes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diabetes is a chronic metabolic condition characterized by hyperglycemia and is associated with several complications. Prevalence of Diabetes in adult population in India ranges from 10.9 to 14.2% in urban area and 3.0-7.8% in rural area. Glycemic control is an important factor in preventing the complications associated with diabetes. HBA1c is the indicator of long-term glycemic control and slight variation in it significantly alters the risk of diabetic complications. Thus, the aim of this study was to study the change in HBA1c levels due to lock down in patients with diabetes. METHODS: 307 patients with diabetes who had attended our endocrine OPD in last 3 months before nationwide 68 days lockdown from 24 March 2020 to 31 May 2020, and had recent HBA1c report in past and willing to participate were included in the study after informed consent from 2nd June 2020 to 14th June 2020 when first phase of Unlock started, to identify the change in HBA1c levels during the lockdown period in our patients with diabetes. RESULTS: The patients were aged between 25-69 years and male to female ratio was 181:126 (1.44: 1). The mean age and mean duration of diabetes in our patients was 55.68 years and 7.95 years respectively. Increment of 0.51% was seen in mean HBA1c levels in our patient from 7.92% mean pre-lockdown HBA1c to mean of 8.43% after release of lock down. CONCLUSION: Glycemic control got deranged during lockdown period with significant increase of mean HBA1c by 0.51% in immediate post lock down period which may significantly increase the annual incidence of complications related to diabetes.","output":"Observational study on effect of lock down due to COVID 19 on HBA1c levels in patients with diabetes: Experience from Central India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mass spectrometry (MS)-based, integrated proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics (collectively, multi-omics) studies provide a very detailed snapshot of virus-induced changes to the host following infection and can lead to the identification of novel prophylactic and therapeutic targets for preventing or lessening disease severity.

With such a rapid spread it is no surprise that there has been a massive effort around the world to collectively elucidate the mechanism by which the virus is transmitted. Despite this, there is still no definitive consensus regarding droplet versus airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Public health officials around the world have introduced guidelines within the scope of droplet transmission. However, increasing evidence and comparative analysis with similar coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) and middle eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), suggest that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be effectively ruled out. As the data supporting COVID-19 airborne transmission grows, there needs to be an increased effort in terms of technical and policy measures to mitigate the spread of viral aerosols. These measures can be in the form of broader social distancing and facial covering guidelines, exploration of thermal inactivation in clinical settings, low-dose UV-C light implementation, and greater attention to ventilation and airflow control systems. This review summarizes the current evidence available about airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, available literature about airborne transmission of similar viruses, and finally the methods that are already available or can be easily adapted to deal with a virus capable of airborne transmission.","output":"Shifting Approach to Environmentally Mediated Pathways for Mitigating COVID-19: A Review of Literature on Airborne Transmission of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An increasing number of researchers support reproducibility by including pointers to and descriptions of datasets, software and methods in their publications.

Additionally, renal metabolism participates in the whole body disposition of amino acids. Therefore, a wide array of axially heterogeneously expressed transporters is localized on both epithelial membranes. For transepithelial transport, luminal uptake, which is carried out mainly by active symporters, is coupled with a mostly passive basolateral efflux. Many transporters require partner proteins for appropriate localization, or to modulate transporter activity, and/or increase substrate supply. Interacting proteins include cell surface antigens (CD98), endoplasmic reticulum proteins (GTRAP3-18 or 41), or enzymes (ACE2 and aminopeptidase N). In the past two decades, the molecular identification of transporters has led to significant advances in our understanding of amino acid transport and aminoacidurias arising from defects in renal transport. Furthermore, the three-dimensional crystal structures of bacterial homologues have been used to yield new insights on the structure and function of mammalian transporters. Additionally, transgenic animal models have contributed to our understanding of the role of amino acid transporters in the kidney and other organs and/or at critical developmental stages.

Thrombotic and bleeding or thrombotic pathologies are significant accompaniments to acute respiratory syndrome and lung complications in COVID-19. Thrombotic events and bleeding, often occurs in subjects with weak multiple risk factors and co-morbidities. Of particular interest are the various circulating inflammatory coagulation biomarkers involved directly in clotting, with specific focus on fibrin(ogen), D-dimer, P-selectin and von Willebrand Factor (vWF).

Latin America is the hardest-hit region of the world, accumulating almost 20% of COVID-19 cases worldwide.

We analyzed the genomic variability during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Costa Rica using 185 sequences, 52 from the first months of the pandemic, and 133 from the current wave. Three GISAID clades (G, GH, and GR) and three PANGOLIN lineages (B.1, B.1.1, and B.1.291) were predominant, suggesting multiple re-introductions from other regions. The whole-genome variant calling analysis identified a total of 283 distinct nucleotide variants, following a power-law distribution with 190 single nucleotide mutations in a single sequence, and only 16 mutations were found in >5% sequences. These mutations were distributed through the whole genome. The prevalence of worldwide-found variant D614G in the Spike (98.9% in Costa Rica), ORF8 L84S (1.1%) is similar to what is found elsewhere. Interestingly, the frequency of mutation T1117I in the Spike has increased during the current pandemic wave beginning in May 2020 in Costa Rica, reaching 29.2% detection in the full genome analyses in November 2020. This variant has been observed in less than 1% of the GISAID reported sequences worldwide in 2020. Structural modeling of the Spike protein with the T1117I mutation suggests a potential effect on the viral oligomerization needed for cell infection, but no differences with other genomes on transmissibility, severity nor vaccine effectiveness are predicted. In conclusion, genome analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Costa Rica suggest the introduction of lineages from other countries and the detection of mutations in line with other studies, but pointing out the local increase in the detection of Spike-T1117I variant.

Eighty-four pre-service science teachers, who engaged in HBPW in a chemistry module, were purposively selected as the participants. The data were generated through individual reflections at the end of the semester. An adaption of the equivalence theory was ideal in analysing and interpreting the results. Results show that HBPW was flexible, empowering, contextualised, and enhanced active learning. New forms of interaction emerged in the absence of physical student-teacher and student-student interactions. Concerns over its ability to develop practical skills are expressed. Recommendations are made with a view to optimising HBPW.","output":"Pre-service Science Teachers' Experiences of Home-based Practical Work under Emergency Remote Teaching"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To investigate the imaging findings of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). Methods: From January 20 to February 5, 2020, a total of 130 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from seven hospitals in China were collected. The imaging data were reviewed and analyzed in detail. Results: (1) Distribution: the lesion detected in the lung unilaterally in 14 cases (10.7%) and bilaterally in 116 cases (89.3%). According to the distribution in the lobes of the lung, all cases could be classified into subpleural distribution (102 cases, 78.4%), centrilobular distribution (99 cases, 76.1%) and diffused distribution (8 cases, 6.1%). (2) Number of lesions: single lesion 9 cases (6.9%); multiple lesions 113 cases (86.9%), diffuse lesions 8 cases (6.1%). (3) Imaging density: 70 cases (53.8%) of ground-glass opacity (GGO), 60 cases (46.2%) of GGO + consolidation. (4) Accompanying signs: 100 cases (76.9%) with vascular thickening, 98 cases (75.3%) with \\"pleural parallel sign\\" ; \\"intralobular septal thickening\\" in 100 cases (76.9%); \\"halo sign\\" in 13 cases (10%); \\"reversed-halo sign\\" in 6 cases (4.6%); pleural effusion in 3 cases (2.3 %), and pneumatocele in 2 cases (1.5%); no case with pulmonary cavity. Among 35 patients that underwent follow-up CT, 21 patients (60%) improved while 14 (40%) exacerbated. Conclusions: COVID-19 imaging characteristic mainly has subpleural, centrilobular and diffused distribution. The first two distributions can overlap or progress to diffused distribution. In the later period, it was mainly manifested as organizing pneumonia and fibrosis. The most valuable characteristic is the pleural parallel sign.","output":"[Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) CT distribution and sign features]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reviews the correlation between ACE2 and COVID-19 and the resulting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ACE2 is a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The classical ACE-angiotensin a ? (Ang II)-angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) axis and the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas counter-regulatory axis play an essential role in RAS system. ACE2 antagonises the activation of the classical RAS ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis and protects against lung injury. Similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) also uses ACE2 for cell entry. ARDS is a clinical high-mortality disease which is probably due to the excessive activation of RAS caused by 2019-nCoV infection, and ACE2 has a protective effect on ARDS caused by COVID-19. Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on ARDS, the development of drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 in the near future. In the meantime, however, the use of RAS blockers such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers that inhibit the damaging (ACE-Ang II) arm of the RAS cascade in the lung may also be promising.

However, the association between psychological resilience and mental health in NGNSs is less explored. PURPOSE: The current study was designed to determine mental health profiles measured by the Kessler 10 scale (K10) and evaluate the non-linear association between psychological resilience and mental health in NGNSs. METHODS: A total of 472 NGNSs from the Be Resilient to Nursing Career program were assessed using the K10 and ten-item ConnorCDavidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 10). Latent profile analysis and generalized additive model analysis were performed. RESULTS: A four-class model based on the K10 was identified: lowest (28.0%), lower-middle (36.4%), upper-middle (26.1%), and highest (9.5%) subgroups. Academic degree and psychological resilience were significant indicators of mental health profiles. Psychological resilience was negatively and nonlinearly correlated with mental health when the CD-RISC 10 score was >17. CONCLUSION: There exists heterogeneity in NGNSs mental health. The negative and nonlinear association between psychological resilience and mental health can only be confirmed in NGNSs with moderate and high resilience levels.","output":"Heterogeneity in Psychological Resilience and Mental Health among Newly Graduated Nursing Students: A Latent Profile and Generalized Additive Model Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, the necessity of providing online interventions for adolescents, as an alternative to face-to-face interventions, has become apparent due to several barriers some adolescents face in accessing treatment. This need has become more critical with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic impacting the delivery of psychotherapy and limiting accessibility of face-to-face therapy. Whilst it has been established that face-to-face psychotherapy for adolescents with personality disorder can be effective in reducing the impact these complex mental illnesses have on functioning, online interventions for adolescents are rare, and to our knowledge there are no empirically validated online interventions for personality disorder. The development of novel online interventions are therefore necessary. To inform the development of online interventions for adolescents with personality disorder or symptoms of emerging personality disorder, a two-phase rapid review was conducted. Phase one consisted of a search and examination of existing online mental health programs for adolescents with symptoms of personality disorder, to understand how to best use online platforms. Phase two consisted of a rapid review of empirical literature examining online interventions for adolescents experiencing symptoms of personality disorder to identify characteristics that promote efficacy. There were no online programs specific to personality disorder in adolescence. However, 32 online mental health programs and 41 published empirical studies were included for analysis. Common intervention characteristics included timeframes of one to two months, regular confidential therapist contact, simple interactive online components and modules, and the inclusion of homework or workbook activities to practice new skills. There is an urgent need for online interventions targeting personality dysfunction in adolescence. Several characteristics of effective online interventions for adolescents were identified. These characteristics can help inform the development and implementation of novel online treatments to prevent and reduce the burden and impact of personality disorder, or symptoms of emerging personality disorder, in adolescents. This has implications for the COVID-19 pandemic when access to effective on- line interventions has become more urgent.

Concerns have arisen in trying to control viruses because of an increasing incidence of viral infections. Ozone is considered to be a promising method to inactivate viruses on surfaces. In this investigation, the effects of ozone concentration, contact time, different capsid architecture of viruses, and relative humidity (RH) on inactivating viruses by ozone were evaluated. The authors observed that the survival fraction of viruses on surfaces decreased exponentially with increasing ozone dose. Viruses required ozone doses of 20-112 min(mg/m3) (contact time [min] multiplied by ozone concentration [mg/m3) for 90% inactivation and 47-223 min(mg/m3) for 99% inactivation. The ozone dose for 99% inactivation was two times higher than for 90% inactivation. The required ozone concentration at 85% RH was lower than at 55% RH. In summary, ozone should be an effective method for reducing the viral number between 1 and 3 logs on surfaces.","output":"Inactivation of surface viruses by gaseous ozone."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a case of a COVID-19 patient presenting fever, headache and dyspnea evolving with severe acute abdominal pain; contrasted computed tomography (CT) scan diagnosed splenic infarction.

We perform these measurements from the homes of 2,693 participating panelists in the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Measuring Broadband America program. We found that clients do not have to trade DNS performance for privacy. For certain resolvers, DoT was able to perform faster than DNS in median response times, even as latency increased. We also found significant variation in DoH performance across recursive resolvers. Based on these results, we recommend that DNS clients (e.g., web browsers) should periodically conduct simple latency and response time measurements to determine which protocol and resolver a client should use. No single DNS protocol nor resolver performed the best for all clients.","output":"Can Encrypted DNS Be Fast?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) can cause neurological, psychiatric, psychological, and psychosocial impairments. Literature regarding cognitive impact of COVID-19 is still limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate cognitive deficits and emotional distress among COVID-19 and postCCOVID-19 patients who required functional rehabilitation. Specifically, this study explored and compared cognitive and psychological status of patients in the subacute phase of the disease (COVID-19 group) and patients in the postillness period (postCCOVID-19 group). Forty patients admitted to rehabilitation units were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups according to the phase of the disease: (a) COVID-19 group (n = 20) and (b) postCCOVID-19 group (n = 20). All patients underwent a neuropsychological assessment including Mini-Mental State Evaluation (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and Impact of Event ScaleCRevised (IES-R). A larger part of the COVID group showed neuropsychological deficits in the total MMSE (35%) compared to the post-COVID group (5%), whereas the majority of both groups (75C70%) reported cognitive impairments in the total MoCA. The post-COVID group reported significantly higher score in MMSE subtests of language (p = 0.02) and in MoCA subtests of executive functions (p = 0.05), language (p = 0.01), and abstraction (p = 0.02) compared to the COVID group. Regarding emotional disturbances, ~40% of patients presented with mild to moderate depression (57.9C60%). The postCCOVID-19 group reported significantly higher levels of distress at the IES-R compared to the COVID group (p = 0.02). These findings highlight the gravity of neuropsychological and psychological symptoms that can be induced by COVID-19 infection and the need for tailored rehabilitation, including cognitive training and psychological support.","output":"Cognitive and Emotional Disturbances Due to COVID-19: An Exploratory Study in the Rehabilitation Setting"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:O}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function V(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(D,[["render",V]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"doctor/2.md","filePath":"doctor/2.md"}'),R={name:"doctor/2.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
