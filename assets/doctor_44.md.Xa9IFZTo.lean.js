This study aimed to assess whether FIV is associated with L. infantum infection in cats from canine leishmaniosis endemic areas and to report the clinical signs and hematological alterations associated with coinfection. METHODS: A retrospective matched case-control study (ratio 1:2) was conducted. Data of clinical examination and complete blood count (CBC) were selected from a cohort of 705 cats examined for epidemiological studies on feline leishmaniosis conducted between 2012 and 2019. Ninety-one FIV seropositive cases and 182 FIV seronegative control cats were selected. Matching was done according to age, sex, lifestyle and geographic provenience of case cats. Rapid ELISA devices were mainly used to detect anti-FIV antibodies. Anti-Leishmania IgG antibodies were detected by indirect-immunofluorescence test (IFAT). Leishmania DNA was searched in blood, oral and conjunctival swabs by quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: Feline immunodeficiency virus seropositive cats had no hematological abnormalities suggestive of an advanced stage of FIV infection and were statistically more frequently IFAT positive, and their risk of being L. infantum antibody positive was 2.8 greater than in the FIV seronegatives. The association of FIV seropositivity with L. infantum antibody positivity was confirmed in the univariable model of logistic regression. A multivariate model found FIV infection and L. infantum PCR positivity as predictors of a positive L. infantum IFAT result. Male outdoor cats from rural or suburban areas were at risk for FIV and L. infantum antibody positivity. Clinical signs more frequently associated with the coinfection were oral lesions, pale mucous membranes and low body condition score (BCS). CONCLUSIONS: This study documents that FIV seropositive cats with no hematological abnormalities suggestive of an advanced stage of FIV infection are more prone to be L. infantum seroreactive by IFAT in endemic areas. Therefore, FIV seropositive cats should be tested for L. infantum antibodies and treated for preventing sand fly bites. Pale mucous membranes, low BCS and oral lesions but no CBC abnormalities were significantly associated with the coinfection.

We assessed the risk of measles outbreaks during the pandemic in Kenya as a case study for the African Region. METHODS: Combining measles serological data, local contact patterns, and vaccination coverage into a cohort model, we predicted the age-adjusted population immunity in Kenya and estimated the probability of outbreaks when contact-reducing COVID-19 interventions are lifted. We considered various scenarios for reduced measles vaccination coverage from April 2020. RESULTS: In February 2020, when a scheduled SIA was postponed, population immunity was close to the herd immunity threshold and the probability of a large outbreak was 34% (8C54). As the COVID-19 contact restrictions are nearly fully eased, from December 2020, the probability of a large measles outbreak will increase to 38% (19C54), 46% (30C59), and 54% (43C64) assuming a 15%, 50%, and 100% reduction in measles vaccination coverage. By December 2021, this risk increases further to 43% (25C56), 54% (43C63), and 67% (59C72) for the same coverage scenarios respectively. However, the increased risk of a measles outbreak following the lifting of all restrictions can be overcome by conducting a SIA with  95% coverage in under-fives. CONCLUSION: While contact restrictions sufficient for SAR-CoV-2 control temporarily reduce measles transmissibility and the risk of an outbreak from a measles immunity gap, this risk rises rapidly once these restrictions are lifted. Implementing delayed SIAs will be critical for prevention of measles outbreaks given the roll-back of contact restrictions in Kenya.

Eosinophilic pneumonia is often associated with antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A 65-year-old male presented to the emergency department for a four-day history of fatigue, cough, and worsening dyspnea; CT thorax showed extensive multifocal pneumonia, and COVID-19 was suspected. COVID-19 testing using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was negative, and complete blood count revealed peripheral eosinophilia, which is not expected in COVID-19. The patient was being treated concomitantly with daptomycin and ceftaroline for septic arthritis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. We reconsidered our initial diagnosis and held daptomycin, after which the patient started to improve. Due to hypoxia, steroids were added, which resulted in a dramatic improvement of the patient's symptoms. Daptomycin can have toxic effects, resulting in the accumulation of eosinophils in the lung parenchyma. Symptoms usually arise by the third week and include dyspnea, peripheral eosinophilia, and infiltrates involving the outer one-third of the lung fields.

To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated whether aspirin use is associated with reduced risk of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study of adult patients admitted with COVID-19 to multiple hospitals in the United States between March 2020 and July 2020 was performed. The primary outcome was the need for mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes were ICU admission and in-hospital mortality. Adjusted hazard ratios for study outcomes were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models after adjustment for the effects of demographics and co-morbid conditions. RESULTS: Four hundred twelve patients were included in the study. Three hundred fourteen patients (76.3%) did not receive aspirin, while 98 patients (23.7%) received aspirin within 24 hours of admission or 7 days prior to admission. Aspirin use had a crude association with less mechanical ventilation (35.7% aspirin vs. 48.4% non-aspirin, p=0.03) and ICU admission (38.8% aspirin vs. 51.0% non-aspirin, p=0.04), but no crude association with in-hospital mortality (26.5% aspirin vs. 23.2% non-aspirin, p=0.51). After adjusting for 8 confounding variables, aspirin use was independently associated with decreased risk of mechanical ventilation (adjusted HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37-0.85, p=0.007), ICU admission (adjusted HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38-0.85, p=0.005), and in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31-0.90, p=0.02). There were no differences in major bleeding (p=0.69) or overt thrombosis (p=0.82) between aspirin users and non-aspirin users.

The objectives are to assess rate of diagnostic photos and investigate how to improve this service. METHOD: First cycle was performed between June and July and second cycle between October and December 2020. All patients attending Audiology who had a photo taken were included. Photos were analysed based on a number of variables to identify the proportion of diagnostic and non-diagnostic photos. First cycle highlighted a few changes to practice that were then instigated for second cycle. RESULTS: 324 patients and 232 patients were included in first and second cycle respectively. 17 operators/audiologists were involved. There is slight improvement in percentage of diagnostic photos in second cycle compared to first (30.6% to 31.9% in right ear and 23.5% to 35.8% in left ear). Percentages of non-diagnostic photos with blurriness as sole reason have increased compared to first cycle. Percentages of non-diagnostic photos with all 3 variables present have reduced significantly. Mean percentage of acceptable photos per operator have also improved. 8 out of 10 ENT consultants/registrars found the service useful. CONCLUSIONS: Rate of diagnostic photos remained low (<40%) despite implementation of changes to practice from first cycle. 38% of non-diagnostic photos were wax-related.

We used the conceptual framework of prosocial behavior during an emergency - behaviors whose primary focus is benefiting others - to examine volunteering during COVID-19. Methods: We conducted an in-depth, mixed-methods cross-sectional survey, from 2nd May to 15th June 2020, of medical students studying at UK medical schools. Data analysis was informed by Latane and Darley's theory of prosocial behavior during an emergency and aimed to understand students' decision-making processes. Results: A total of 1145 medical students from 36 medical schools completed the survey. While 947 (82.7%) of students were willing to volunteer, only 391 (34.3%) had volunteered. The majority (92.7%) of students understood that they may be asked to volunteer; however, we found that deciding one's responsibility to volunteer was mitigated by a complex interaction between the interests of others and self-interest. Further, concerns revolving around professional role boundaries influenced students' decisions over whether they had the required skills and knowledge to volunteer. Deciding to volunteer depended not only on possession of necessary skills, but also seniority and identification with the nature of volunteering roles offered. Conclusions: We propose two additional domains to Latane and Darley's theory of prosocial behavior during an emergency that students consider before making their final decision to volunteer. These are 'logistics' - whether it is logistically feasible to volunteer - and 'safety' - whether it is safe to volunteer. This study highlights a number of modifiable barriers to prosocial behavior that medical students encounter and provides suggestions regarding how Latane and Darley's theory of prosocial behavior can be operationalized within educational strategies to address these barriers. Optimizing the process of volunteering can aid healthcare provision and may facilitate a safer volunteering process for all.","output":"Examining Medical Student Volunteering During The COVID-19 Pandemic As A Prosocial Behavior During An Emergency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The MnMoO(4) is an environmentally friendly semiconductor material widely employed in technological devices.

Anti-viral immune response is crucial to achieve pathogen clearance, however in some patients an excessive and aberrant host immune response can lead to an acute respiratory distress syndrome. The comprehension of the mechanisms that regulate pathogen elimination, immunity, and pathology is essential to better characterize disease progression and widen the spectrum of therapeutic options. METHODS We performed a flow cytometric characterization of immune cells subsets from 30 COVID-19 patients and correlated these data with clinical outcomes. RESULTS COVID-19 patients showed decreased numbers of circulating T, B and NK cells, and exhibited a skewing of CD8+ T cells towards a terminally differentiated/senescent phenotype. In agreement, T CD4+, T CD8+ but also NK cells displayed reduced anti-viral cytokine production capability. Moreover, a reduced cytotoxic potential was identified in COVID-19 patients, particularly in those that required intensive care. The latter group of patients showed also increased serum IL-6 levels, that correlated to the frequency of granzyme-expressing NK cells. Off-label treatment with tocilizumab restored the cytotoxic potential of NK cells. CONCLUSION In conclusion, the association between IL-6 serum levels and the impairment of cytotoxic activity suggests the possibility that targeting this cytokine may restore anti-viral mechanisms.

For this reason, we could consider that these patients may have an increased risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, it remains unclear. We aimed to analyze the cumulative incidence, the severity of the infection and its influence on the natural history of IBD in patients under biological treatment and also evaluating the possible differences with another group without these therapy. Methods: Retrospective observational study about our IBD patients followed from March 2020 to January 2021 divided into two groups: patients on treatment with biological drugs (anti-TNF, vedolizumab, ustekinumab and tofacitinib) and patients without biological drugs (thiopurines or 5-ASA). We evaluated: the cumulative incidence in 10 months for COVID-19 in the 2 cohorts;clinical variables considered risk factors for the infection, the infection severity and influence on the course of IBD employing Harvey-Bradshaw index in Crohn's disease and Mayo partial index in ulcerative colitis before and after infection. Results: It collected 755 IBD patients. 89 were infected by SARSCOV-2, 43 in the biological group and 46 in non biological group. The cumulative incidence in 10 months was 10.85% in the first group (figure 1) and 12.81% in the second group with no significant differences. We verified comparability of the groups discarded the existence of statistical differences in all of the risk factors (sex, age, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease and BMI). In most cases, the infection was mild (94.4%) and the required treatment was symptomatic in 86.4% of the total (Figure 2), without significant differences between groups. Pneumonia was diagnosed in 5 patients, whose required hospital admission (3 belonged to the biological group and 2 to the other).

Further research is required to confirm this association, determine whether cognitive deficits relate to clinical features from the acute phase or to mental health status at the point of assessment, and quantify rate of recovery. METHODS: 46 individuals who received critical care for COVID-19 at Addenbrooke's hospital between 10th March 2020 and 31st July 2020 (16 mechanically ventilated) underwent detailed computerised cognitive assessment alongside scales measuring anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder under supervised conditions at a mean follow up of 6.0 ( 2.1) months following acute illness. Patient and matched control (N = 460) performances were transformed into standard deviation from expected scores, accounting for age and demographic factors using N = 66,008 normative datasets. Global accuracy and response time composites were calculated (G_SScore & G_RT). Linear modelling predicted composite score deficits from acute severity, mental-health status at assessment, and time from hospital admission. The pattern of deficits across tasks was qualitatively compared with normal age-related decline, and early-stage dementia. FINDINGS: COVID-19 survivors were less accurate (G_SScore=-0.53SDs) and slower (G_RT=+0.89SDs) in their responses than expected compared to their matched controls. Acute illness, but not chronic mental health, significantly predicted cognitive deviation from expected scores (G_SScore (p=0.0037) and G_RT (p = 0.0366)). The most prominent task associations with COVID-19 were for higher cognition and processing speed, which was qualitatively distinct from the profiles of normal ageing and dementia and similar in magnitude to the effects of ageing between 50 and 70 years of age. A trend towards reduced deficits with time from illness (r=0.15) did not reach statistical significance. INTERPRETATION: Cognitive deficits after severe COVID-19 relate most strongly to acute illness severity, persist long into the chronic phase, and recover slowly if at all, with a characteristic profile highlighting higher cognitive functions and processing speed.

At present, whether COVID-19 has an effect on thyroid function is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate thyroid function in patients with COVID-19. METHODS Clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography scans were retrospectively reviewed for 50 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without a history of thyroid disease who underwent thyroid function testing during their course of COVID-19 infection and after recovery. They were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, between January and March 2020. Healthy participants who underwent routine physical checkups and non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients with a similar degree of severity during the same period were included in the study as the control group. Thyroid hormone and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were analyzed and compared between the COVID-19 and control groups. RESULTS TSH lower than the normal range was present in 56% (28/50) of the patients with COVID-19. The levels of TSH and serum total triiodothyronine (TT3) of the patients with COVID-19 were significantly lower than those of the healthy control group and non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients. The more severe the COVID-19, the lower the TSH and TT3 levels were, with statistical significance (p < 0.001). The degree of the decreases in TSH and TT3 levels was positive correlated with the severity of the disease. The total thyroxine (TT4) level of the patients with COVID-19 was not significantly different from the control group. All the patients did not receive thyroid hormone replacement therapy. After recovery, no significant differences in TSH, TT3, TT4, free triiodothyronine (FT3), and free thyroxine (FT4) levels were found between the COVID-19 and control groups.

PURPOSE: To describe a virtual clinical pharmacy service as a model of care to support rural and remote Australian hospitals that otherwise would not have access to onsite pharmacists. SUMMARY: Many small hospitals in Australia do not have an onsite hospital pharmacist and struggle to support and optimize patient care. To increase access to a hospital pharmacist's specialized skills and medication knowledge, a virtual clinical pharmacy service was designed and implemented in 8 hospitals across rural New South Wales, Australia in 2020. The virtual clinical pharmacy service focuses on the core role of hospital pharmacists, including obtaining a best possible medication history, medication reconciliation at transitions of care, medication review, interprofessional team meetings, provision of patient-friendly medication lists, antimicrobial stewardship, and patient and clinician education. The model is aligned with recognized standards of practice for the delivery of clinical pharmacy services in Australian hospitals. This article details a model of care for translation across other settings. It provides the necessary details on clinical services, processes, supporting structures, an evaluation framework, and other important considerations for implementing virtual pharmacy services. CONCLUSION: This research provides policymakers, health service planners, and practitioners with a model for providing comprehensive clinical pharmacy services virtually to increase the safe and effective use of medicines. Future publication of the findings of a formal evaluation of the model's acceptability and effectiveness is planned.","output":"Virtual clinical pharmacy services: A model of care to improve medication safety in rural and remote Australian health services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of current paper is to create a smart and effective tool for telemedicine to early detect and diagnose COVID-19 disease and therefore help to manage Pandemic Crisis (MCPC) in Sultanate of Oman, as a tool for future pandemic containment.

A dysregulated metabolism induces the secretion of several molecules which in turn trigger the inflammatory pathway. Inflammation is the natural reaction of the immune system to a variety of stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, and harmful substances. Metabolically triggered inflammation, also called metaflammation or low-grade chronic inflammation, is the consequence of a synergic interaction between the host and the exposomea combination of environmental drivers, including diet, lifestyle, pollutants and other factors throughout the life span of an individual. Various levels of chronic inflammation are associated with several lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes, obesity, metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), cancers, cardiovascular disorders (CVDs), autoimmune diseases, and chronic lung diseases. Chronic diseases are a growing concern worldwide, placing a heavy burden on individuals, families, governments, and health-care systems. New strategies are needed to empower communities worldwide to prevent and treat these diseases. Precision medicine provides a model for the next generation of lifestyle modification. This will capitalize on the dynamic interaction between an individuals biology, lifestyle, behavior, and environment. The aim of precision medicine is to design and improve diagnosis, therapeutics and prognostication through the use of large complex datasets that incorporate individual gene, function, and environmental variations. The implementation of high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) can predict risks with greater accuracy based on available multidimensional clinical and biological datasets. AI-powered precision medicine provides clinicians with an opportunity to specifically tailor early interventions to each individual. In this article, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing and evolving recent, data-driven technologies, such as AI, in preventing, treating and reversing lifestyle-related diseases.","output":"Precision medicine in the era of artificial intelligence: implications in chronic disease management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fifteen percent of couples are globally estimated to be infertile, with up to half of these cases attributed to male infertility. Reactive oxidative species (ROS) are known to damage sperm leading to impaired quantity and quality. Although not routinely assessed, oxidative stress is a common underlying pathology in infertile men. Antioxidants have been shown to improve semen analysis parameters by reducing ROS and facilitating repair of damage caused by oxidative stress, but it remains unclear whether they improve fertility. Carnitines are naturally occurring antioxidants in mammals and are normally abundant in the epididymal luminal fluid of men. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of carnitine supplementation for idiopathic male infertility. We searched ClinicalKey, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed and ScienceDirect for relevant studies published from 1 January 2000 to 30 April 2020. Of the articles retrieved, only eight randomised controlled trials were identified and included. Analysis showed that carnitines significantly improve total sperm motility, progressive sperm motility and sperm morphology, but without effect on sperm concentration. There was no demonstrable effect on clinical pregnancy rate in the five studies that included that outcome, although patient numbers were limited. Therefore, the use of carnitines in male infertility appears to improve some sperm parameters but without evidence of an increase in the chance of natural conception. Lay summary Although male infertility affects 1:15 men, there is no obvious reason in the vast majority of cases. Reactive oxidative species (ROS) are highly active molecules containing oxygen and are natural byproducts of normal metabolism. However, high concentrations of ROS have been shown to damage sperm, which negatively impacts a couple's ability to conceive. Carnitines are natural antioxidants found in the body that counterbalance the damaging effects of ROS. We conducted a comprehensive review of published studies to assess whether carnitine supplements are safe and effective in improving sperm quality and pregnancy rates. Our analysis shows that carnitines improve sperm swimming and production of normal-shaped sperm cells but do not affect sperm count or pregnancy rates, although there are only a few studies and scientific evidence is limited. Whilst it is possible that carnitines may benefit male infertility, more evidence is required regarding chances of pregnancy after carnitine therapy.","output":"l-carnitine and l-acetylcarnitine supplementation for idiopathic male infertility."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of 2020 was a watershed moment for all educators worldwide as schools and universities were forced to close their doors to avoid the spread of COVID-19.

Diabetes is the most common comorbidities in adult patients infected with Severe Acute Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has been associated with increased mortality. This study analyzed the mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diabetes. Methods: 654 patients with COVID-19, including 81 diabetic patients and 573 nondiabetic patients from March to December/2020, were registered. Administrative data from hospitalizations reimbursed by the health plan were analyzed. Dependent variable: mortality rate (MR) of both groups had the number of deaths as a numerator and the number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the period as denominator. Independent variables: age and sex. The main outcome was mortality by the SARS-CoV2. Statistical: Microsoft Excel? v2010 and Qlik Sense? v13.21 were used for relative and absolute frequencies, means and standard deviation (95% confidence intervals, significance when p&lt;0.05). Results: From the total number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 50.6% were male and 49.4% female. The median age was 64.3 years. Approximately 12.4% of patients had diabetes. The mortality rate in diabetic patients was 28.4% and 18.0% in nondiabetic patients, with a pooled Odds Ratio of 1.81 (95% CI 1.07 C 3.07;p &lt; 0.05).

The co-primary outcomes were between-group differences in mean COPD assessment test (CAT) score at 90 days and critical inhaler errors. Key secondary outcomes were app usage and patient activation measurement (PAM) score. Sixty patients were randomised (29 myCOPD, 31 usual care). Groups were balanced for forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1) % pred) but there was baseline imbalance between groups for exacerbation frequency and CAT score. There was no significant adjusted mean difference in CAT score at study completion, ?1.27 (95% CI ?4.47C1.92, p=0.44) lower in myCOPD.

One such concern, which has not yet been elucidated, is how telephone-based versus in-person visits differentially impact patients' perceived autonomy and the resulting patient-provider relationship. Grounded in self-determination theory (SDT), this pilot study addresses this question by investigating the association between patients' perceived autonomy support and relationship needs satisfaction (autonomy, competence, relatedness) in both types of visits with their family doctor and care team. Methods: Running from Sept. 2020 to Feb. 2021, data was collected via convenience sampling from n = 66 patients (34 in person, 32 virtual) nested within k = 6 family physicians. Patients completed an online survey containing two previously validated scales derived from SDT: The Healthcare Climate Questionnaire and the Basic Need Satisfaction in Relationships Scale. Each scale was adapted to reflect a virtual or in-person visit experience. A random effects model captured the relationship between the motivational variables in each group, adjusting for various sociodemographic effects. Results: Both groups' perceived autonomy support positively related to their relationship needs satisfaction with their family doctor and care team. Compared to traditional in-person visits, patients perceived the virtual healthcare climate as significantly less autonomy-supportive. Conclusions: In line with SDT, findings from this study suggest that when patients sense a more autonomy-supportive healthcare climate, they will experience a more needs-satisfying relationship with their family doctor and healthcare team. These results have potentially significant implications for supporting patient motivation and facilitating optimal health and wellness outcomes, particularly within the virtual care environment.

The few empirical studies that have examined pandemic related changes in rates of child maltreatment have relied predominantly on reports of suspected maltreatment. OBJECTIVE: This study examines rates of documented, substantiated child maltreatment resulting in foster care placement, as well as demographic correlates of child maltreatment within the foster care system, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Data were available for all youth in the FL foster care system from January 1, 2001 through June 30, 2020 (i.e., > 304,000 youth; > 1.1 million total placements). METHODS: This study utilizes data from the Florida State Automated Child Welfare Information System (SACWIS). RESULTS: Results revealed a decrease in the number of youths placed in the FL foster care system during the COVID-19 pandemic with the greatest reduction in April, 2020 during the Safer-at-Home Order (24% fewer youth in 2020 than 2019). In contrast, the percentage of placements into foster care due to maltreatment increased by 3.34%. Demographic-linked differences were observed in placement rates and exposure to maltreatment. CONCLUSIONS: While prior work suggests that reports of child maltreatment have decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study demonstrates that overall rates of substantiated maltreatment resulting in foster care placement have increased for White youth, while rates of placement of due to inadequate supervision, emotional neglect, and/or parental substance use have decreased for Black youth.

Here we study voluntary climate action (VCA), which is costly to todays decision-makers but essential to enable sustainable living for future generations. We predict that offspring observability is critical: parents will be more likely to invest in VCA when their own offspring observes their action, whereas when adults or genetically unrelated children observe them, the effect will be smaller. In a large-scale lab-in-the-field experiment, we observe a remarkable magnitude of VCA: parents invest 82% of their 69 endowment into VCA, resulting in almost 14,000 real trees being planted. Parents VCA varies across conditions, with the largest treatment effect occurring when a parents own child is the observer. In subgroup analyses, we find that larger treatment effects occur among parents with a high school diploma. Moreover, VCA for parents who believe in climate change is most affected by the presence of their own child.

METHODS: We selected 11 newly identified plasma vitamin C genetic variants from a large-scale plasma vitamin C GWAS dataset (n = 52,018) as the effective instrumental variables, and extracted their corresponding GWAS summary statistics from PD (33,674 PD cases and 449,056 controls) and PD age at onset (AAO) (n = 28,568). We then performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to evaluate the causal association of plasma vitamin C levels with PD and PD AAO using inverse-variance weighted (IVW), the weighted median, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO test. RESULTS: We did not observe any significant association between genetically increased vitamin C levels and PD. Interestingly, we found a reduced trend of PD AAO (1.134 years) with 1 SD genetically increased vitamin C levels using IVW (beta = ? 1.134, 95% CI: [? 2.515, 0.248], P = 0.108). Importantly, this trend was further successfully verified using both weighted median and MR-Egger. Each 1 SD genetically increased vitamin C levels could reduce PD AAO 1.75 and 2.592 years using weighted median (beta = ? 1.750, 95% CI: [? 3.396, ? 0.105], P = 0.037) and MR-Egger (beta = ? 2.592, 95% CI: [? 4.623, ? 0.560], P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the causal association between genetically increased plasma vitamin C levels and reduced PD AAO in people of European descent.

For this reason, we propose a novel approach for rumor detection in social media that consists of multiple robust models: XGBoost Classifier, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Classifier, Extra Tree Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, a hybrid model, deep learning models-LSTM and BERT. For evaluation, two datasets are used. These artificial intelligence algorithms are often referred to as \\"Black-box\\" where data go in the box and predictions come out of the box but what is happening inside the box frequently remains cloudy. Although, there have been several works on detecting fake news, the number of works regarding rumor detection is still limited and the models used in the existing works do not explain their decision-making process. We take models with higher accuracy to illustrate which feature of the data contributes the most for a post to have been predicted as a rumor or a non-rumor by the models to explain the opaque process happening inside the black-box models.

Current recommendations for CAC treatment include the use of low-molecular weight heparins (LMWH) at prophylactic or therapeutic doses, as well as the use of unfractionated heparin (UFH). Methods: A randomised, controlled trial enrolled 126 patients hospitalised in the intensive care unit with severe COVID-19 complicated by CAC. The effects of LMWH at preventive and therapeutic doses and UFH at therapeutic doses on mortality and intubation rates were compared. Results: The number of intubations and deaths showed no significant difference depending on the anticoagulant therapy used. However, multivariate logistic regression models revealed an increased risk of intubation (p = 0.026, odds ratio (OR) = 3.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15C9.59), and an increased risk of death (p = 0.046, OR = 3.01, 95% CI 1.02C8.90), for patients treated with LMWH at a prophylactic dose but not at a therapeutic dose as compared to patients treated with UFH when controlling for other risk factors.

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has proved itself to be effective and it is now the most performed weight loss procedure. We aimed to study the effectiveness and safety of LSG for weight loss in mild obesity. METHODS: A prospective cohort study. Group A; BMI (30C34.9 kg/m(2)), and group B; BMI  40 or BMI  35 with OAMP. Demographic data, perioperative complications, % excess weight loss (EWL), % total weight loss (TWL), nutritional profile, and evolution of OAMP were recorded and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 250 patients, with 80 patients (32%) in group A, and 170 (68%) in group B. The majority were female. The mean preoperative weight, BMI, and excess weight were 90.1  9.52, 32.7  1.4, and 21.5  4.9 in group A, and 129.88  26.12, 47.8  8.2, and 62.3  23.6 kg in group B respectively. The low BMI group had significantly lower OAMP, with higher pre-LSG non-surgical procedures rate. Overall post-operative morbidity rate was significantly higher in group B. %TWL was significantly lower in low BMI group. Nutritional profile was within the normal range in both groups at 3-year follow-up. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is a safe and effective weight loss solution for mild obesity with better outcome than for higher BMI. Further studies are warranted to reconsider NIHs statement for medicolegal aspects, and for matching the current changes in bariatric surgery practice, safety evidence, and patients demand.

The pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and drug interactions of the combination are well understood, but the use of a combined PK and PD model to control target-controlled infusion pumps has not been investigated. In this study, we prospectively tested the accuracy of a PD target-controlled infusion algorithm for propofol and remifentanil using a response surface model of their combined effects on Bispectral Index (BIS). METHODS Effect-site, target-controlled infusions of propofol and remifentanil were given using an algorithm based on standard PK models linked to a PD response surface model of their combined effects on BIS. The combination of a targeted BIS value and adjustable ratio of propofol to remifentanil was used to adjust infusion rates. The standard model performance measures of median performance error (bias) and median absolute performance error (inaccuracy), expressed as percentages, were used to assess accuracy of the infusions in a convenience sample of 50 adult patients undergoing surgery with general anesthesia. The influence of age and weight on the performance of the model was also assessed. RESULTS Patients had a mean (range) age of 48 (19-73) years, weight of 80 (45-169) kg, and body mass index of 28 (19-45) kg/m. The overall model had a bias of 8% (SD 24%) and inaccuracy of 25% (SD 13%). Performance was least accurate during the early induction phase of anesthesia. There was no significant bias in BIS predictions with increasing age (P = 0.44) or weight (P = 0.56). CONCLUSIONS The algorithm performed adequately in a clinical setting.

The expression levels of mitochondrial hsp10 and hsp60 were highest in histological grade 3 breast cancer tissues. Additionally, mitochondria with high hsp60 expression were more present in Her2-positive tumors. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that mtUPR was specifically activated in breast cancer tissues but inactivated in normal mammary tissue. MtUPR had also exhibited a particular increase in Her2-overexpression tumors but not in ER- or PR-positive tumors. Taken together, we suggested that mtUPR may act as a potential candidate for developing novel Her2-overexpression breast cancer therapy.","output":"Activation of mitochondrial unfolded protein response is associated with Her2-overexpression breast cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy (RT) is part of the curative treatment of approximately 70% of breast cancer (BC) patients. Wide practice variation has been reported in RT dose, fractionation and its treatment planning for BC. To decrease this practice variation, it is essential to first gain insight into the current variation in RT treatment between institutes. This paper describes the development of the NABON Breast Cancer Audit-Radiotherapy (NBCA-R), a structural nationwide registry of BC RT data of all BC patients treated with at least surgery and RT. METHODS: A working group consisting of representatives of the BC Platform of the Dutch Radiotherapy Society selected a set of dose volume parameters deemed to be surrogate outcome parameters, both for tumour control and toxicity. Two pilot studies were carried out in six RT institutes. In the first pilot study, data were manually entered into a secured web-based system. In the second pilot study, an automatic Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) RT upload module was created and tested. RESULTS: The NBCA-R dataset was created by selecting RT parameters describing given dose, target volumes, coverage and homogeneity, and dose to organs at risk (OAR). Entering the data was made mandatory for all Dutch RT departments. In the first pilot study (N = 1093), quite some variation was already detected. Application of partial breast irradiation varied from 0 to 17% between the 6 institutes and boost to the tumour bed from 26.5 to 70.2%. For patients treated to the left breast or chest wall only, the average mean heart dose (MHD) varied from 0.80 to 1.82 Gy; for patients treated to the breast/chest wall only, the average mean lung dose (MLD) varied from 2.06 to 3.3 Gy. In the second pilot study 6 departments implemented the DICOM-RT upload module in daily practice. Anonymised data will be available for researchers via a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) framework. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a set of RT parameters and implemented registration for all Dutch BC patients. With the use of an automated upload module registration burden will be minimized. Based on the data in the NBCA-R analyses of the practice variation will be done, with the ultimate aim to improve quality of BC RT. Trial registration Retrospectively registered.

SETTING: Moorfields Eye Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational cross-sectional study. METHODS: Single-centre, retrospective review of all patients that underwent phacoemulsification surgery at Moorfields Eye Hospital, between September 2019 and January 2021. Our main outcome measure was Posterior Capsule Rupture (PCR) rate before and after COVID-19 imposed restrictions to elective cataract surgery. RESULTS: We identified a total of 15689 surgeries in the period of the study performed by 256 different surgeons. In the pre-surgery restriction period (September 2019 to March 2020), the PCR rate was 0.99% while on surgery restarting after 19 weeks, the PCR rate spiked to 1.62% (Odds Ratio 1.65; p=0.001; CI 1.24-2.20; Relative Risk: 1.64). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic provided a unique opportunity to assess a large group of surgeons' performances after prolonged surgical abstinence. A 19-weeks period of restrictions in surgical activity showed an increased incidence of PCR complications. This is relevant as it can concern any surgeon on extended time off work such as sickness, sabbatical, research and parental leave.

However, contemporary data on the global prevalence of undiagnosed stage 3 CKD are scarce. REVEAL-CKD is a multinational, multifocal and observational study aiming to provide insights into undiagnosed stage 3 CKD in a large population. METHODS: Patients (aged 18 years) with data in selected secondary databases from 11 countries will be included if they have at least two estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measurements from 2015 onwards that are 30 and <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), recorded >90 and 730 days apart. Undiagnosed cases are those without an International Classification of Diseases 9/10 diagnosis code for CKD (any stage) any time before and up to 6 months after the second qualifying eGFR measurement. Time to diagnosis will be assessed using a KaplanCMeier approach; patient characteristics associated with undiagnosed CKD will be assessed using adjusted logistical regression analyses. RESULTS: REVEAL-CKD will assess the point prevalence of undiagnosed stage 3 CKD and time to CKD diagnosis in initially undiagnosed cases overall and in individual countries. Trends in undiagnosed CKD prevalence by calendar year will be assessed. Patient characteristics, healthcare resource utilization, adverse clinical outcomes, and CKD management and monitoring practices in patients with versus without a CKD diagnosis will be compared.

Capturing the interplay between host, viral and environmental factors is difficult using conventional research methods. Instead, system dynamic modelling may be used to illustrate the complex scenarios including non-linear relationships and multiple interactions which occur within hospitals during a seasonal influenza epidemic. We developed such a model intended as a support for health-care providers in identifying potentially effective control strategies to prevent influenza transmission. METHODS: By using computer simulation software, we constructed a system dynamic model to illustrate transmission dynamics within a large acute-care hospital. We used local real-world clinical and epidemiological data collected during the season 2016/17, as well as data from the national surveillance programs and relevant publications to form the basic structure of the model. Multiple stepwise simulations were performed to identify the relative effectiveness of various control strategies and to produce estimates of the accumulated number of healthcare-associated influenza cases per season. RESULTS: Scenarios regarding the number of patients exposed for influenza virus by shared room and the extent of antiviral prophylaxis and treatment were investigated in relation to estimations of influenza vaccine coverage, vaccine effectiveness and inflow of patients with influenza. In total, 680 simulations were performed, of which each one resulted in an estimated number per season. The most effective preventive measure identified by our model was administration of antiviral prophylaxis to exposed patients followed by reducing the number of patients receiving care in shared rooms. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents an system dynamic model that can be used to capture the complex dynamics of in-hospital transmission of viral infections and identify potentially effective interventions to prevent healthcare-associated influenza infections. Our simulations identified antiviral prophylaxis as the most effective way to control in-hospital influenza transmission.

A novel web-based visual acuity test, validated in a healthy population, may be of great value in the follow-up of uveitis patients. Objective To determine the measurement accuracy of the unsupervised remote Easee web-based visual acuity test in uveitis patients, when compared to a conventional in-hospital assessment. Methods: Cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study. Between April 2020 and September 2020, consecutive adult uveitis patients were invited for the web-based visual acuity test (index test) within two weeks prior to their conventional in-hospital assessment (reference test). Results: A total of 269 patients were invited by mail, of whom 84 visited the website (31%). Ultimately 98 eyes met the criteria for statistical analysis. The mean difference between the two tests was low and non-significant: 0.02 logMAR (SD 0.12, P = 0.085). The 95% limits of agreement ranged from -0.21 to 0.26 logMAR. No relevant differences were identified in clinical characteristics between subgroups with a good performance (i.e. difference between the tests <=0.15 logMAR) or underperformance (i.e. difference >0.15 logMAR) on the web-based test. Conclusion: The web-based visual acuity test is a promising tool to remotely assess visual acuity in the majority of uveitis patients, especially relevant when access to ophthalmic care is limited. No association between patient- or uveitis-related variables and (under)performance of the test were identified. These outcomes underline the potential of remote vision testing in other common ophthalmic conditions.

Six and twelve hours after inoculation, before diarrhea, extensive specific viral immunofluorescence and viral particles on electron microscopy were seen in villus but not crypt enterocytes in jejunum, mid-intestine, and ileum. At 24 and 40 hr, when diarrhea was most severe, immunofluorescence was patchy; villus blunting (P < 0.001) and increased crypt depth (P < 0.001) were observed by light microscopy in all segments; radioautographically labeled enterocytes showed accelerated migration and shortened life span; and cells on villi were deficient in sucrose activity (P < 0.001) and rich in thymidine kinase activity (P < 0.005), suggesting relative immaturity. Villus structure recovered by 72 and 144 hr, although deeper crypts (P < 0.001) and accelerated migration still persisted. We conclude that extensive, almost simultaneous direct viral invasion of villus enterocytes can occur along the entire length of the small intestine after a single exposure to virus, and thus can cause shedding of mature villus cells and proliferation and accelerated migration of cells from the crypts. At the height of diarrhea, when enterocyte turnover is maximal, the epithelium consists predominantly of immature virus-free cells which have migrated to the villi in a relatively undifferentiated state.","output":"The Mucosal Lesion in Viral Enteritis: Extent and Dynamics of the Epithelial Response to Virus Invasion in Transmissible Gastroenteritis of Piglets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2020, the FDA granted emergency approval to Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273) COVID-19 vaccines.

Different cases were simulated of a single infected person releasing viral aerosols with and without wearing a face mask. Results showed characteristic airflow and temperature distribution patterns inside the store that can drive the indoor dispersal of viral aerosols. Unsteady spatial distribution of mean age of air was used as a metric to indirectly quantify areas of higher risk of infection. Several factors affected the localization of suspended viral aerosols. Major recirculation patterns in certain locations of the store caused by persistent eddies were primarily attributed to increased mean age of air. The maximum mean age of air in the grocery store was found to be less than 30 min.

Half of the patients had de novo disease, and 46.2% had high-risk disease (61% had a Gleason score  8, 16% had visceral disease, and 54% had three or more bony lesions). The greatest PSA percentage reduction from baseline after AA/P initiation occurred at the first 3 months (median 98.3%). The reduction at 6-12 months from baseline was small (99.7-100%). Patients without PSA-mCRPC had a significantly greater 3-month reduction of PSA values compared to patients who developed PSA-mCRPC (p interaction = 0.0002). 50.8% of patients were able to achieve a non-detectable PSA (median 13.1 months). PSA-mCRPC (n = 20) was observed from 4 to 24 months after AA/P, with the majority of events occurring within the first 12 months. Patients with PSA < 0.3 ng/mL (12-month PSA-mCRPC-free 94.5% vs. 69.4%, p = 0.0004) or a  98% reduction (94.9% vs. 68.0%, p = 0.0002) at 3 months had better PSA-mCRPC-free survival compared to their counterparts. Absolute reduction at 3 months was not associated with PSA-mCRPC. Similar PSA patterns were seen in those who had Rad-mCRPC compared to no Rad-mCRPC (p interaction < 0.05). CONCLUSION The degree of PSA decline at 3 months predicted serologic progression to mCRPC. Those who developed castration-resistant disease had higher PSA and a lower percentage reduction by 3 months. Tracking early PSA pattern changes may alert clinicians to poor treatment effect and potential progression; they should consider frequent PSA measurement and imaging, as well as the initiation of sequential therapy.","output":"Identifying Prostate Surface Antigen Patterns of Change in Patients with Metastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer Treated with Abiraterone and Prednisone."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses, as exemplified by SARS-CoV-2, can evolve and spread rapidly to cause severe disease morbidity and mortality. Direct acting antivirals (DAAs) are highly effective in decreasing disease burden especially when they target essential viral enzymes, such as proteases and polymerases, as demonstrated in HIV-1 and HCV and most recently SARS-CoV-2. Optimization of these DAAs through iterative structure-based drug design has been shown to be critical. Particularly, the evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanisms underlying viral replication can be leveraged to develop robust antivirals against rapidly evolving viral targets. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, which is evolutionarily constrained to recognize and cleave 11 specific sites to promote viral maturation, exemplifies one such target. In this study we define the substrate envelope of Mpro by determining the molecular basis of substrate recognition, through nine high-resolution cocrystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with the viral cleavage sites. These structures enable identification of evolutionarily vulnerable sites beyond the substrate envelope that may be susceptible to drug resistance and compromise binding of the newly developed Mpro inhibitors.","output":"Defining the Substrate Envelope of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease to Predict and Avoid Drug Resistance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the past decades, messenger RNA (mRNA) biomarkers have been employed to identify the origin of body fluids in forensic medicine. We hypothesized that the polymorphism of mRNA could be applied to identifying individuals in mixture samples composed of two body fluids. In this study, we selected 5 blood-specific mRNA biomarkers of venous blood (SPTB, CD3G, AMICA1, ANK1, GYPA) that encompass 16 SNPs to identify the mixture contributor(s). Five specific gene markers for menstrual blood, semen, skin, saliva and vaginal secretions were amplified and typed as body-fluid positive controls. We established the system of multiplex PCR and single base extension reaction (SBE) followed by capillary electrophoresis. The amplicon size was between 90bp-294bp. The peripheral blood specificity was examined against other human body fluids, including saliva, semen, skin, menstrual blood, and vaginal secretion. The 16 SNPs were peripheral blood specific and could be successfully typed in home-made mixtures which are composed of different body fluids with 1ng peripheral blood mRNA added. This system showed a super sensitivity (1:100) in detecting the trace amount of peripheral blood mixed in other body fluids and a combined discrimination power (CDP) of 0.99929 in Chinese population. It was the first time to establish a method of identifying the blood donors and deconvoluting mixtures through detecting mRNA polymorphism with SNaPshot assay. This peripheral blood-specific SNP typing system showed high sensitivity to the typing of blood-source specific markers regardless of other body fluids in the mixture.

For many undergraduates, their first-year in college is defined by large class sizes, poor access to research faculty, and minimal standing in communities of scholars. Pepperdine University and Whittier College, funded by a National Science Foundation award to Improve Undergraduate Stem Education (NSF IUSE), partnered in the development of first-year classes specifically geared to improve student persistence in STEM and academic success. This Students as Scholars Program (SAS) engaged first-year undergraduates in scholarly efforts during their first semester in college with a careful approach to original research design and mentoring by both faculty and upperclassmen experienced in research. Courses began by introducing hypothesis formulation and experimental design partnered with the scientific focus of each course (ecological, biochemical, microbiological). Students split into research teams, explored the primary literature, designed research projects, and executed experiments over a 6C7 week period, collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. Microbiology-specific projects included partnerships with local park managers to assess water quality and microbial coliform contamination at specified locations in a coastal watershed. In addition, students explored the impact of soil salinity on microbial community structure. Analysis of these samples included next-generation sequencing and microbiome compositional analysis via collaboration with students from an upper division microbiology course. This cross-course collaboration facilitated additional student mentoring opportunities between upperclassmen and first-year students. This approach provided first-year students an introduction to the analysis of complex data sets using bioinformatics and statistically reliable gas-exchange replicates. Assessment of the impact of this program revealed students to view the research as challenging, but confidence building as they take their first steps as biology majors. In addition, the direct mentorship of first-year students by upperclassmen and faculty was viewed positively by students. Ongoing assessments have revealed SAS participants to display a 15% increased persistence rate in STEM fields when compared to non-SAS biology majors.","output":"Analysis of Microbial Water Contamination, Soil Microbial Community Structure, and Soil Respiration in a Collaborative First-Year Students as Scholars Program (SAS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper provides a theoretical framework to analyze and quantify roughness effects on sensing performance parameters of surface plasmon resonance measurements.

Malnutrition has long been associated with poor outcomes among patients with pneumonia. This may be due to the increased risk of malnourished patients to develop impaired muscle and respiratory function. We aimed to determine the outcomes of adult COVID 19 patients admitted in a tertiary government hospital accordingly to nutrition status and risk. Methods Retrospective study on the adult COVID 19 patients admitted from July 15 to September 15, 2020 who were screened using the Philippine Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition modified Subjective Global Assessment Grade tool. Chi-square or Fisher exact test, as well as Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis with post-hoc Dunn test, as appropriate were done. Survival analysis for mortality was done with right-censored data length of initial admission in days. Cox proportional hazard regression was done to determine the association of the main variables of interest with mortality with a 95% confidence interval. Results Malnourished patients were 30% less likely to be discharged [HR 0.70 95% CI (0.50, 0.97)]; malnutrition was also associated with length of hospital stay as those who were malnourished had longer lengths of hospital stay of about 4 days on the average [HR 3.55 95% CI (0.83, 6.27)]. High nutrition risk was significantly associated with length of hospital stay [HR 4.36 95% CI (0.89, 7.83)]. Conclusion The only risk factor for mortality shown in this study is ICU transfer. Malnutrition, moderate nutrition risk, and high nutrition risk were risk factors of having longer lengths of hospital stays. While only malnutrition was the risk factor for being less likely to be discharged.

The enormous genetic diversity of IBV poses difficulty in diagnosing and controlling the virus. To understand the nature of IBV prevalent in the Kashmir Himalayas, we characterized two field strains, isolated from non-immunized broiler chickens, by sequence and phylogenetic analysis of S1 subunit of the spike glycoprotein. The analysis revealed both the isolates are identical to each other, with nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities of 99.4% and 98.4%, respectively. They exhibit variable sequence divergence in the S1 gene to that of the reference serotypes. Both are of Massachusetts type belonging to GI-1 lineage of the IBV gnotype. The phylogenetic analysis revealed both of the isolates clustered into the same branch as that of many IBV strains recently reported from China and Iran. Likely, these regionally-related isolates represent revertant vaccine strains which may have been disseminated across the region by wild migratory birds.

Firstly, the influence of the heating temperature was evaluated individually, and it was revealed that this parameter was critical for printability, as a sufficiently high temperature (100 C) is necessary to avoid curling. Secondly, the effects of laser power, scan speed, and layer thickness were determined using a BoxCBehnken design. The measured responses, printing yield, height, weight, hardness, disintegration time, and percentage of drug release at 10 min showed the following ranges of values: 55.6C100%, 2.92C3.96 mm, 98.2C187.2 mg, 9.2C83.4 N, 9.7C997.7 s, and 25.8C99.9%, respectively. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) proved that the generated quadratic models and the effect of the threeCprocess parameters were significant (p < 0.05). Yield improved at high laser power, low scan speed, and increased layer thickness. Height was proportional to laser power, and inversely proportional to scan speed and layer thickness. Variations in the other responses were related to the porosity of the SOFs, which were dependent on the value of energy density. Low laser power, fast scan speed, and high layer thickness values favored a lower energy density, resulting in low weight and hardness, rapid disintegration, and a high percentage of drug release at 10 min. Finally, an optimization was performed, and an additional experiment validated the model. In conclusion, by applying a Quality by Design approach, this study demonstrates that process parameters are critical for printability, but also offer a way to personalize the properties of the SOFs.","output":"A QbD Approach for Evaluating the Effect of Selective Laser Sintering Parameters on Printability and Properties of Solid Oral Forms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a potentially fatal complication of systemic inflammation. HMGB1 is a nuclear protein released extracellularly during proinflammatory lytic cell death or secreted by activated macrophages, NK cells, and additional cell types during infection or sterile injury. Extracellular HMGB1 orchestrates central events in inflammation as a prototype alarmin. TLR4 and the receptor for advanced glycation end products operate as key HMGB1 receptors to mediate inflammation. METHODS: Standard ELISA and cytometric bead array-based methods were used to examine the kinetic pattern for systemic release of HMGB1, ferritin, IL-18, IFN-?3, and MCP-1 before and during treatment of four children with critical MAS. Three of the patients with severe underlying systemic rheumatic diseases were treated with biologics including tocilizumab or anakinra when MAS developed. All patients required intensive care therapy due to life-threatening illness. Add-on etoposide therapy was administered due to insufficient clinical response with standard treatment. Etoposide promotes apoptotic rather than proinflammatory lytic cell death, conceivably ameliorating subsequent systemic inflammation. RESULTS: This therapeutic intervention brought disease control coinciding with a decline of the increased systemic HMGB1, IFN-?3, IL-18, and ferritin levels whereas MCP-1 levels evolved independently. CONCLUSION: Systemic HMGB1 levels in MAS have not been reported before. Our results suggest that the molecule is not merely a biomarker of inflammation, but most likely also contributes to the pathogenesis of MAS. These observations encourage further studies of HMGB1 antagonists. They also advocate therapeutic etoposide administration in severe MAS and provide a possible biological explanation for its mode of action.","output":"Therapeutic administration of etoposide coincides with reduced systemic HMGB1 levels in macrophage activation syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SENDs) and their families have been particularly hard hit by the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

This scenario imposes on teachers the challenge of stimulating the students development for a critical attitude in relation to the information disseminated. By working on the mathematical and statistical concepts involved in this pandemic situation, the teacher can institute new ways of promoting learning, interaction and sharing of meanings among students. Thus, this paper aims to reflect on how teachers can work mathematical and statistical concepts with Elementary School students in the context of the pandemic. We anchored, as technical support, in the Knowledge Base proposed by Shulman, focusing on the specific knowledge of Statistics, pedagogical knowledge and curricular knowledge. We present six Teaching Cases constructed from the data and statistical information available on official websites, aiming to give sense and meaning to the information. For this purpose, we follow the premises of Statistical Literacy, the levels of reading and interpretation of graphs and critical sense.

MethodsA descriptive quantitative summary of the available data on the impact of the COVID-19 on children and adolescents (<18y) from 7 countries (Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Nigeria, Ghana, Spain) or regions (Kocaeli, Turkey), based on official published data was performed. Outcome measures were: available data on incidence, admission to hospital and to intensive care units (ICU), and deaths, by country or region; vaccination plans, including age, type of vaccine and official justification about the proposal. ResultsAll countries analyzed data showed variable incidence rate, and relatively low ICU hospitalizations and deaths. Vaccines used and age at starting were also variable, i.e. starting at 3-5y in some Latin American countries, while in other countries proposal starts at 15y old. Almost all justifications were based on the idea to promote collective protection, and that vaccination is important as it -directly and indirectly-protect the rest of the population. ConclusionsThe results reinforce the idea of the urgent need to prioritize globally and equitably distribution of vaccines in the population at greatest risk, and to apply the precautionary principle in CYP before deciding to massively vaccinate it. What is knownThe child population has less severe infections and seems to transmit the infection less than the adult population.

We sought to evaluate the clinical features of patients with childhood onset epilepsy associated with telemedicine consultations by telephone call during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the medical records in patients with childhood onset epilepsy who visited an outpatient clinic in Saitama Childrens Medical Center, Saitama, Japan from March 1st, 2020 to September 30th, 2020. To find the clinical features of patients who utilized telemedicine consultation by telephone call, we divided the patients into the following two groups: telemedicine group and face\\\\to\\\\face group. We then reviewed the following clinical features. Telemedicine consultation was not implemented for new patients. RESULTS: We enrolled 776 outpatients in total, and 294 patients (37.9%) utilized telemedicine consultations. The total number of visits were 2,299 and total number of telemedicine consultations were 373 (16.2%). There were no clinical features associated with telemedicine consultations except for age at onset of epilepsy. The number of oral antiepileptic drugs prescriptions decreased in overall 3.0% (23/776) of the patients who did not experience seizure deterioration, including status epilepticus, or who visited the emergency room.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: ENMGs performed for evaluation of diffuse weakness in patients who could not be discharged from semi-intensive care COVID unit because of difficulties in ventilation weaning were reviewed. Patients with severe COVID-19 infection who had undergone endotracheal intubation and able to co-operate were considered. ENMG protocol was focused on neurophysiological items that excluded or confirmed critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), myopathy (CIM), or polyneuromyopathy (CIPM). Standardized clinical evaluation was performed using Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score. RESULTS: Eight patients were included in the study. All presented known risk factors for intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICU-AW), and none of them had history of underlying neuromuscular disorders. ENMG findings were normal in two patients, while only two patients had an altered MRC sum score (< 48). Neuromuscular involvement was diagnosed in 6/8 patients (75%): 2 had CIP, 1 had possible CIM, 1 had CIPM, while 1 patient, with clinically evident weakness but equivocal ENMG findings, was classified as ICU-AW. Finally, 1 patient was diagnosed with acute demyelinating neuropathy. Patients with neuromuscular involvement were those with longer intubation duration and higher levels of IL-6 at admission. CONCLUSION: Neuromuscular complications are frequent in severe COVID-19 and cannot be excluded by MRC sum scores above 48. Standardized ENMG is helpful in guiding diagnosis when clinical evaluation is not reliable or possible. Elevated IL-6 at admission may be a predictor biomarker of ICU-AW in COVID-19.

Several operational definitions have been created for sarcopenia screening; however, an international consensus is lacking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recently recognized that sarcopenia detection requires improved diagnosis and screening measures. Mounting evidence hints towards changes in the corticospinal communication system where corticomuscular coherence (CMC) reflects an effective mechanism of corticospinal interaction. CMC can be assessed during locomotion by means of simultaneously measuring Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electromyography (EMG). The aim of this study was to perform sarcopenia screening in community-dwelling older adults and explore the possibility of using CMC assessed during gait to discriminate between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic older adults. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves showed high sensitivity, precision and accuracy of CMC assessed from EEG Cz sensor and EMG sensors located over Musculus Vastus Medialis [Cz-VM; AUC (95.0%CI): 0.98 (0.92-1.04), sensitivity: 1.00, 1-specificity: 0.89, p < 0.001] and with Musculus Biceps Femoris [Cz-BF; AUC (95.0%CI): 0.86 (0.68-1.03), sensitivity: 1.00, 1-specificity: 0.70, p < 0.001].

The novelty of this exploratory investigation is the hint toward a novel possible determinant of age-related sarcopenia, derived from corticospinal control of locomotion and shown by the observed large differences in CMC when sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic older adults are compared. This, in turn, might represent in future a potential treatment target to counteract sarcopenia as well as a parameter to monitor the progression of the disease and/or the potential recovery following other treatment interventions.","output":"Corticospinal Control of Human Locomotion as a New Determinant of Age-Related Sarcopenia: An Exploratory Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction A new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes a respiratory distress syndrome that has been called COVID-19 and has generated an unprecedented pandemic.

We hypothesized that deep learning interpretation of echocardiogram videos can provide additional value in understanding disease states and can evaluate common biomarkers results. METHODS: We developed EchoNet-Labs, a video-based deep learning algorithm to detect evidence of anemia, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), troponin I, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), as well as values of ten additional lab tests directly from echocardiograms. We included patients (n = 39,460) aged 18 years or older with one or more apical-4-chamber echocardiogram videos (n = 70,066) from Stanford Healthcare for training and internal testing of EchoNet-Lab's performance in estimating the most proximal biomarker result. Without fine-tuning, the performance of EchoNet-Labs was further evaluated on an additional external test dataset (n = 1,301) from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve for the internal and external test datasets. FINDINGS: On the held-out test set of Stanford patients not previously seen during model training, EchoNet-Labs achieved an AUC of 0.80 (0.79-0.81) in detecting anemia (low hemoglobin), 0.86 (0.85-0.88) in detecting elevated BNP, 0.75 (0.73-0.78) in detecting elevated troponin I, and 0.74 (0.72-0.76) in detecting elevated BUN. On the external test dataset from Cedars-Sinai, EchoNet-Labs achieved an AUC of 0.80 (0.77-0.82) in detecting anemia, of 0.82 (0.79-0.84) in detecting elevated BNP, of 0.75 (0.72-0.78) in detecting elevated troponin I, and of 0.69 (0.66-0.71) in detecting elevated BUN. We further demonstrate the utility of the model in detecting abnormalities in 10 additional lab tests. We investigate the features necessary for EchoNet-Labs to make successful detection and identify potential mechanisms for each biomarker using well-known and novel explainability techniques.

SARS-CoV-2 continues to adapt to the human population, resulting in several variants of concern (VOC) with novel properties, such as Alpha and Delta. However, factors driving SARS-CoV-2 fitness and evolution in paediatric cohorts remain poorly explored. Here, we provide evidence that both viral and host factors co-operate to shape SARS-CoV-2 genotypic and phenotypic change in primary airway cell cultures derived from children. Through viral whole-genome sequencing, we explored changes in genetic diversity over time of two pre-VOC clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 during passage in paediatric well-differentiated primary nasal epithelial cell (WD-PNEC) cultures and in parallel, in unmodified Vero-derived cell lines. We identified a consistent, rich genetic diversity arising in vitro, variants of which could rapidly rise to near fixation within two passages. Within isolates, SARS-CoV-2 evolution was dependent on host cells, with paediatric WD-PNECs showing a reduced diversity compared to Vero (E6) cells. However, mutations were not shared between strains. Furthermore, comparison of both Vero-grown isolates on WD-PNECs disclosed marked growth attenuation mapping to the loss of the polybasic cleavage site (PBCS) in Spike, while the strain with mutations in Nsp12 (T293I), Spike (P812R) and a truncation of Orf7a remained viable in WD-PNECs. Altogether, our work demonstrates that pre-VOC SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infects paediatric respiratory epithelial cells, and its evolution is restrained compared to Vero (E6) cells, similar to the case of adult cells. We highlight the significant genetic plasticity of SARS-CoV-2 while uncovering an influential role for collaboration between viral and host cell factors in shaping viral evolution and ultimately fitness in human respiratory epithelium.","output":"Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Evolution in Paediatric Primary Airway Epithelial Cell Cultures Compared with Vero-Derived Cell Lines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 variation represents a serious challenge to current COVID-19 vaccines.

Ninety-nine healthcare workers undertaking BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination were sampled at baseline, on the day of the second dose, and 14 days after the latter. Neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 B.1, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 was investigated using a Vero-E6 model. Eleven of the study participants had prior infection with SARS-CoV-2. Neutralization titers against the B.1 and the B.1.1.7 variants were not statistically different and were significantly higher than titers against the B.1.351 variant across pre-exposed and non-pre-exposed vaccinated individuals (p < .01). While all vaccinated individuals presented neutralizing antibodies against B.1 and B 1.1.7 after the second dose, 14% were negative against B.1.351 and 76% had low titers (1/201/80). Pre-exposed vaccinated individuals showed higher titers than non-pre-exposed after the first (median titers of 1/387 versus 1/28, respectively) and the second doses (1/995 versus 1/703, respectively). As high as 72% of the pre-exposed vaccines presented titers >1/80 after a single dose, while only 11% of non-exposed vaccinated individuals had titers >1/80.

We fit two hierarchical linear models to county-level death rates from January 2015 to December 2019 and predict expected deaths for each month during the pandemic. We compare these estimates with the observed numbers of deaths to obtain excess deaths for each county-month. An estimated 936,911 excess deaths occurred during 2020 and 2021, of which 171,168 were not assigned to Covid-19 on death certificates. Urban counties in the Far West, Great Lakes, Mideast, and New England experienced a substantial urban mortality disadvantage in 2020, whereas rural counties in these regions had higher mortality in 2021. In the Southeast, Southwest, Rocky Mountain, and Plains regions, there was a rural mortality disadvantage in 2020, which was exacerbated in 2021. The proportion of excess deaths assigned to Covid-19 was lower in 2020 (76.3%) than in 2021 (87.0%), suggesting fewer Covid-19 deaths went unassigned later in the pandemic.

METHODS: This article aims to provide a critical evaluation of this harm reduction policy in Taiwan. The research leading to this article included a thorough literature review and in-depth interviews with 31 active policy participants, including people working in hospitals, the academia, non-governmental organizations, community pharmacies, the legal system, and health authorities at both the central and local levels. The collected data were analyzed on the basis of situational analysis. RESULTS: The article examines the policy success by showing how this policy was assembled and by exposing the frictions and adjustments during its formation and implementation. Inter-departmental conflicts within or without the government and the efforts to coordinate them are addressed, and the transnational dimensions of this harm reduction policy are also discussed. The article then reflects on the effects of the policy and asks where the line should be drawn between what is harm reduction and what is not.

We aimed to evaluate cardiovascular damage in patients with COVID-19 and determine the correlation of high-sensitivity cardiac-specific troponin T (hs-cTnT) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) with the severity of COVID-19. Methods: We included 872 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 from February to April 2020. We tested 651 patients for high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) and 506 for NT-proBNP on admission. Cardiac injury was defined as hs-TnT > 14ng/L, the upper 99th percentile. Levels of NT-proBNP > 300 pg/mL were considered related to some extent of cardiac injury. The primary composite endpoint was 30-day mortality or mechanical ventilation (MV). Results: Cardiac injury by hs-TnT was observed in 34.6% of our COVID-19 patients. Mortality or MV were higher in cardiac injury than noncardiac injury patients (39.1% vs 9.1%). Hs-TnT and NT-proBNP levels were independent predictors of death or MV (HR, 2.18; 95%CI, 1.23-3.83 and 1.87 (95%CI, 1.05-3.36), respectively) and of mortality alone (HR, 2.91; 95%CI, 1.211-7.04 and 5.47; 95%CI, 2.10-14.26, respectively).

DESIGN: An anonymous online survey was distributed in October 2018 through the social media network MyEndometriosisTeam.com. PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 19 years and older living in several English-speaking countries who self-identified as having endometriosis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients perspectives on how endometriosis has affected their work, education, relationships, overall life decisions and attainment of goals. Subanalyses were performed for women who identified as less positive about the future (LPAF) or had not reached their full potential (NRFP) due to endometriosis. RESULTS: 743 women completed the survey. Women reported high levels of pain when pain was at its worst (mean score, 8.9 on severity scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain)) and most (56%, n=415) experienced pain daily. Women reported other negative experiences attributed to endometriosis, including emergency department visits (66%, n=485), multiple surgeries (55%, n=406) and prescription treatments for symptoms of endometriosis (72%, n=529). Women indicated that they believed endometriosis had a negative impact on their educational and professional achievements, social lives/relationships and overall physical health. Most women somewhat agreed/strongly agreed that endometriosis caused them to lose time in life (81%, n=601), feel LPAF (80%, n=589) and feel they had NRFP (75%, n=556). Women who identified as LPAF or NRFP generally reported more negative experiences than those who were non-LPAF or non-NRFP. CONCLUSIONS: Women who completed this survey reported pain and negative experiences related to endometriosis that were perceived to negatively impact major life-course decisions and attainment of goals. Greater practitioner awareness of the impact that endometriosis has on a womans life course and the importance of meaningful dialogue with patients may be important for improving long-term management of the disease and help identify women who are most vulnerable.","output":"Impact of endometriosis on womens life decisions and goal attainment: a cross-sectional survey of members of an online patient community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Investment in gender-responsive social protection systems and evidence is key to a more equal future post-COVID-19.","output":"Gender-responsive social protection post-COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The thermally activated dynamics of methyl groups are important for biochemical activity as they allow for a more efficient sampling of the energy landscape.

Objective: The purposes of this study were to assess the occurrence of RV, enterovirus, and coronavirus infections in wheezing infants and to evaluate the association of these viral findings with early school-age asthma. Methods: In 1999, outcome in relation to asthma was studied in 82 of 100 initially recruited children who had been hospitalized for wheezing in infancy during the period 1992-1993. In 2000, etiologic viral studies regarding the index episode of wheezing were supplemented by rhinovirus, enterovirus, and coronavirus detection by RT-PCR from frozen nasopharyngeal aspirates in 81 of the children for whom adequate samples were available. Of these children, 66 had participated in the follow-up in 1999. Results: Rhinoviruses were identified in 27 (33%) of the 81 children, enteroviruses in 10 (12%), and coronaviruses in none.

METHODS: We used panel data analysis to evaluate the effects of mandatory social distancing rules on social distancing. We obtained data on six different categories of mandatory restrictions implemented in Brazil, by date and state, from state government gazettes (dirios oficiais). We then defined a social distancing rules index (SDI) to measure the strictness of social distancing rules, assigning each a value of 2, 1, or 0 depending on whether restrictions were full, partial, or very limited/non-existent at every given time. A separate variable was defined for masking mandates. We tested whether the following variables were associated to social distancing: SDI, masking mandates, COVID-19 incidence, population socioeconomic status, and political orientation. Data is for each day between March 11(th) and November 10(th), 2020 in the 27 Brazilian states (N = 6615). FINDINGS: Social distancing increased when social distancing rules were stricter, and decreased when the use of face masks became mandatory. The effects of different types of restrictions varied: suspending in-person classes and gatherings, religious/sport/cultural activities had a greater effect than other types of restrictions. Also, the effect of social distancing rules on peoples behaviour decreased over time, especially when rules were stricter.

In this manuscript, we report characteristics of children with COVID-19 in Mazandaran province, northern Iran. METHOD: From 12 February to 28 July 2020, medical records of 100 children diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to the hospitals of Mazandaran province were collected. Patients' age, gender, clinical symptoms, and signs, in addition to therapeutic management and outcomes, were reported. RESULTS: 57 (57%) boys and 43 girls with the mean age of 104.63  79.14 months were evaluated. 20 patients (20%) were transferred to the PICU (pediatric intensive care unit), and 13 children experienced a severe form of the disease, pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS). The mean duration of hospitalization was 5.3  4.7 days. Fever (81%), respiratory (79%), gastrointestinal (47%), and neurologic complaints (29%) were experienced by the patients in addition to skin rash (14%). Sixty-two patients needed supplemental oxygen, and 6 of them underwent endotracheal intubation. Leukopenia was reported in 7, anemia in 24, and thrombocytopenia in 12 patients. 4 patients with underlying diseases including chronic renal failure, Down syndrome with cerebral palsy, and morbid obesity died. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 can cause symptoms in children in two stages. In the first week, upper and lower respiratory symptoms can occur which has lower severity and prevalence compared to adults. But after 2-3 weeks following infection, symptoms of MIS-C or multisystem involvement can occur and COVID-19 should be considered.

The scientific context is connected to economic theory (the recognition of the nature of such a relationship, as well as the determination of whether sustainable development acts as a stimulant or destimulant under these conditions). The Farm Accounting Data Network system was employed in the article. The econometric models were estimated by panel data based on the reported results of the farms operations in EU member states for the period of 2004-2018. Accordingly, the relationship between income and assets is positive and statistically significant, but not very clear in the group of surveyed farms. Moreover, economic sustainability was found to positively influences the relationship between income and assets. In contrast, the relationship between incomes and assets was weakened. The situation is brought about by the intrinsic growth in the value of the land, as well as by the growing importance of non-productive assets. Thus, farmers in EU countries are becoming wealthier in terms of the value of their assets but, this is not reflected directly in their income. The reason is the growing importance of environmental and social functions in the agriculture the European Union.

Objective: To develop a model that estimates the risk of SARS-CoV-2-related mortality among all enrollees of the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prognostic study used data from 7a?635a?064 individuals enrolled in the VA health care system as of May 21, 2020, to develop and internally validate a logistic regression model (COVIDVax) that predicted SARS-CoV-2-related death (n = 2422) during the observation period (May 21 to November 2, 2020) using baseline characteristics known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2-related mortality, extracted from the VA electronic health records (EHRs). The cohort was split into a training period (May 21 to September 30) and testing period (October 1 to November 2). Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2-related death, defined as death within 30 days of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. VA EHR data streams were imported on a data integration platform to demonstrate that the model could be executed in real-time to produce dashboards with risk scores for all current VA enrollees. Results: Of 7a?635a?064 individuals, the mean (SD) age was 66.2 (13.8) years, and most were men (7a?051a?912 [92.4%]) and White individuals (4a?887a?338 [64.0%]), with 1a?116a?435 (14.6%) Black individuals and 399a?634 (5.2%) Hispanic individuals. From a starting pool of 16 potential predictors, 10 were included in the final COVIDVax model, as follows: sex, age, race, ethnicity, body mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, and Care Assessment Need score. The model exhibited excellent discrimination with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 85.3% (95% CI, 84.6%-86.1%), superior to the AUROC of using age alone to stratify risk (72.6%; 95% CI, 71.6%-73.6%). Assuming vaccination is 90% effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2-related death, using this model to prioritize vaccination was estimated to prevent 63.5% of deaths that would occur by the time 50% of VA enrollees are vaccinated, significantly higher than the estimate for prioritizing vaccination based on age (45.6%) or the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention phases of vaccine allocation (41.1%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this prognostic study of all VA enrollees, prioritizing vaccination based on the COVIDVax model was estimated to prevent a large proportion of deaths expected to occur during vaccine rollout before sufficient herd immunity is achieved.","output":"Development of COVIDVax Model to Estimate the Risk of SARS-CoV-2-Related Death Among 7.6 Million US Veterans for Use in Vaccination Prioritization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Declining humoral immunity in COVID-19 patients and possibility of reinfections has raised concern. Mucosal immunity particularly salivary antibodies could be short-lived. However, long-term studies are sparse. Methods: Using a multiplex bead-based array platform, we investigated antibodies specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins in 256 saliva samples from convalescent patients 1-9 months after symptomatic COVID-19 (n=74, Cohort 1), undiagnosed individuals with self-reported questionnaires (n=147, Cohort 2), and individuals sampled pre-pandemic time (n= 35, Cohort 3). Results: Salivary IgG antibody responses in Cohort 1 (mainly mild COVID-19) were detectable up to 9 month recovery, with high correlations between spike and nucleocapsid specificity. At 9 months, IgG remained in saliva in majority as seen in blood serology. Salivary IgA was rarely detected at this timepoint. In Cohort 2, salivary IgG and IgA responses were significantly associated with recent history of COVID-19 like symptoms. Salivary IgG also tolerated temperature and detergent pre-treatments. Conclusions: Unlike SARS-CoV-2 salivary IgA that appeared short-lived, the specific IgG in saliva appears stable even after mild COVID-19 as noted for blood serology. The non-invasive saliva-based SARS-Cov-2 antibody testing with self-collection at homes may thus serve as a complementary alternative to conventional blood serology.","output":"Persisting Salivary IgG against SARS-CoV-2 at 9 Months After Mild COVID-19: A Complementary Approach to Population Surveys"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease appeared in China in December 2019 and, since then, has spread worldwide at a rapid pace.

Little is known about PWID and LEO attitudes and concerns about service referrals, however. The objective of this mixed-methods study was to examine the alignment of service referral preferences and acceptability among PWID and LEOs in Tijuana, Mexico. METHODS: We assessed service referral preferences and perceived likelihood of participation in health and social services, integrating data from structured questionnaires with 280 PWID and 306 LEOs, contextualized by semi-structured interviews and focus groups with 15 PWID and 17 LEOs enrolled in two parallel longitudinal cohorts in Tijuana, Mexico. RESULTS: Among potential service referral options, both PWID (78%) and LEOs (88%) most frequently cited assistance with drug- and alcohol-use disorders. Over half of PWID and LEOs supported including harm reduction services such as syringe service programs, overdose prevention, and HIV testing. The majority of PWID supported LEO referrals to programs that addressed basic structural needs (e.g. personal care [62%], food assistance [61%], housing assistance [58%]). However, the proportion of LEOs (30C45%) who endorsed these service referrals was significantly lower (p < 0.01). Regarding referral acceptability, 71% of PWID reported they would be very likely or somewhat likely to make use of a referral compared to 94% of LEOs reporting that they thought PWID would always or sometimes utilize them. These results were echoed in the qualitative analysis, although practical barriers to referrals emerged, whereby PWID were less optimistic that they would utilize referrals compared to LEOs. CONCLUSIONS: We identified strong support for LEO service referrals among both LEO and PWID respondents, with the highest preference for substance use treatment.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to detect the temporal patterns in emotional fluctuation, significant events during the COVID-19 pandemic that affected emotional changes and variations, and hourly variations of emotions within a single day by analyzing data from the Chinese social media platform Weibo. METHODS: Based on a longitudinal dataset of 816,556 posts published by 27,912 Weibo users in Wuhan, China, from December 31, 2019, to April 31, 2020, we processed general sentiment inclination rating and the type of sentiments of Weibo posts by using pandas and SnowNLP Python libraries. We also grouped the publication times into 5 time groups to measure changes in netizens' sentiments during different periods in a single day. RESULTS: Overall, negative emotions such as surprise, fear, and anger were the most salient emotions detected on Weibo. These emotions were triggered by certain milestone events such as the confirmation of human-to-human transmission of COVID-19. Emotions varied within a day. Although all emotions were more prevalent in the afternoon and night, fear and anger were more dominant in the morning and afternoon, whereas depression was more salient during the night.

As in previous years, women victims of domestic violence were between 30 and 40 years old and of Italian nationality; men were also victims of domestic violence. CONCLUSIONS: Also in Val Camonica violence against women is a widespread phenomenon. For this reason the Valcamonica local Authorities are taking action to expand the available network service.","output":"[Domestic violence in Val Camonica: survey on the accesses to the emergency deparment in the period post Covid-19]./ Violenza domestica in Val Camonica: indagine conoscitiva sugli accessi in pronto soccorso nel periodo post Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a stochastic small-world network model of transmission of the SARS virus. Unlike the standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed models of disease transmission, our model exhibits both geographically localised outbreaks and super-spreaders. Moreover, the combination of localised and long range links allows for more accurate modelling of partial isolation and various public health policies. From this model, we derive an expression for the probability of a widespread outbreak and a condition to ensure that the epidemic is controlled. Moreover, multiple simulations are used to make predictions of the likelihood of various eventual scenarios for fixed initial conditions. The main conclusions of this study are: (i) super-spreaders may occur even if the infectiousness of all infected individuals is constant; (ii) consistent with previous reports, extended exposure time beyond 3C5 days (i.e. significant nosocomial transmission) was the key factor in the severity of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong; and, (iii) the spread of SARS can be effectively controlled by either limiting long range links (imposing a partial quarantine) or enforcing rapid hospitalisation and isolation of symptomatic individuals.","output":"Super-spreaders and the rate of transmission of the SARS virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To explore the transmission characteristics of the typical clusters of coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) in Xi'an, so as to provide scientific basis for optimizing the control strategy of COVID-19","output":"Epidemiological characteristics of the clusters of COVID-19 in Xi'an"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, hypergraph generalizations of many graph cut problems have been introduced and analyzed as a way to better explore and understand complex systems and datasets characterized by multiway relationships. Recent work has made use of a generalized hypergraph cut function which for a hypergraph $\\\\mathcal{H} = (V,E)$ can be defined by associating each hyperedge $e \\\\in E$ with a splitting function \${\\\\bf w}_e$, which assigns a penalty to each way of separating the nodes of $e$. When each \${\\\\bf w}_e$ is a submodular cardinality-based splitting function, meaning that \${\\\\bf w}_e(S) = g(|S|)$ for some concave function $g$, previous work has shown that a generalized hypergraph cut problem can be reduced to a directed graph cut problem on an augmented node set. However, existing reduction procedures often result in a dense graph, even when the hypergraph is sparse, which leads to slow runtimes for algorithms that run on the reduced graph. We introduce a new framework of sparsifying hypergraph-to-graph reductions, where a hypergraph cut defined by submodular cardinality-based splitting functions is $(1+\\\\varepsilon)$-approximated by a cut on a directed graph. Our techniques are based on approximating concave functions using piecewise linear curves. For $\\\\varepsilon>0$ we need at most $O(\\\\varepsilon^{-1}|e| \\\\log |e|)$ edges to reduce any hyperedge $e$, which leads to faster runtimes for approximating generalized hypergraph $s$-$t$ cut problems. For the machine learning heuristic of a clique splitting function, our approach requires only $O(|e| \\\\varepsilon^{-1/2} \\\\log \\\\log \\\\frac{1}{\\\\varepsilon})$ edges. This sparsification leads to faster approximate min $s$-$t$ graph cut algorithms for certain classes of co-occurrence graphs. Finally, we apply our sparsification techniques to develop approximation algorithms for minimizing sums of cardinality-based submodular functions.","output":"Augmented Sparsifiers for Generalized Hypergraph Cuts with Applications to Decomposable Submodular Function Minimization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Failure to attend the clinic without prior intimation, known as Did Not Attend (DNA) is a significant global issue. There have been no published studies attempting to reduce DNA rates in breast clinics. We aimed to assess the impact of contacting patients prior to clinic attendance and Short Message Service (SMS) reminder on DNA rates in rapid access new patient breast clinics, evaluate Could Not Attend (CNA) rate, and explore any correlation between age, sex, clinic days and sessions. METHODS: Initially, DNAs at the rapid access new patient breast clinic between 01/04/2018 and 31/03/2019 at a district general hospital in the North-West of England was assessed (Cycle 1). Changes were introduced in terms of contacting patients prior to offering appointments, followed by SMS reminders nearer the clinic dates. Subsequently, DNA was reassessed between 01/10/2019 and 31/03/2020 (Cycle 2). RESULTS: Following implementation of changes, DNA rate reduced from 8.2 to 4.1% (p < 0.00001). CNA rates were 0.9% (Cycle 1) and 1.1% (Cycle 2) [p = 0.36]. Evening clinics had the lowest DNA rates throughout. DNA patients in cycle 2 were significantly older than those in cycle 1 (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Contacting patients prior to clinic appointments and sending SMS reminders helped reduce DNA rates significantly in rapid access new patient breast clinics. Scheduling clinic sessions with least DNA rates, such as evening clinics, should be contemplated. One should be cautious of mobile phone technology that conveys SMS, which can potentially disadvantage the older age group.

These reflect physical and radiological disease activity and are the most relevant endpoints in clinical trials. Over the past few years, the number of studies evaluating so-called patient-reported outcomes (PROs) has been increasing. PROs are reports from patients concerning their own health perception. They are typically obtained by means of questionnaires and aim to quantify symptoms such as fatigue, depression, and sexual dysfunction. The emergence of PROs has made a tremendous contribution to understanding the individual impact of disease in people with MS and their health-related quality of life. However, the assessment of PROs consumes resources, including time and personnel. Thus, useful ways to conveniently introduce PROs into clinical practice are needed. OBJECTIVE: We aim to provide a rationale and pilot study protocol for a mobile health (mHealth) solution named haMSter that allows for remote monitoring of PROs in people with MS. METHODS: The core function of haMSter is to provide three scientifically validated PRO questionnaires relevant to MS for patients to fill out at home once a month. Thereby, longitudinal and remote documentation of PROs is enabled. A scoring algorithm graphically plots PRO scores over time and makes them available at the next visit. RESULTS: The pilot study is currently ongoing and will evaluate adherence to this mHealth solution in 50 patients over a period of 6 months. Results from the haMSter pilot study are expected in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: haMSter is a novel mHealth-based solution for modern PRO research, which may constitute the first step in achieving the ability to integrate PROs in clinical practice. This allows for a more problem-oriented approach in monitoring visits, which addresses patient needs and ultimately saves time.

By using public assessed data in Lombardy, Italy, we estimated two congestion indices for isolation wards and ICU. The excess ICU needs were estimated in Lombardy, Italy, and other countries when data were available, including France, Spain, Belgium, New York State in the USA, South Korea, and Japan. RESULTS: In Lombardy, Italy, the congestion of isolation beds had increased from 2.2 to the peak of 6.0 in March and started to decline to 3.9 as of 9th May, whereas the demand for ICU during the same period has not decreased yet with an increasing trend from 2.9 to 8.0. The results showed the unmet ICU need from the second week in March as of 9th May. The same situation was shown in France, Spain, Belgium, and New York State, USA but not for South Korea and Japan.

Lack of access both undermines the degree of social benefit achieved by the use of tracing apps, and exacerbates existing social and health inequities because those who lack access are likely to already be disadvantaged. Recently, Singapore has introduced portable tracing wearables (with the same functionality as a contact tracing app) to address the equity gap and promote public health. We argue that governments have an ethical obligation to ensure fair access to the protective benefits of contract tracing during the pandemic and that wearables are an effective way of addressing some important equity issues. The most contentious issues about contact tracing apps have been the potential infringements of privacy and individual liberty, especially where the use of apps or other technology (such as wearables or QR codes) is required for access to certain spaces. Here we argue that wearables, as opposed to apps alone, will make a digital contact tracing mandate more practical and explain some conditions under which such a mandate would be justified.

We found that cognitive attitudes were a significantly stronger predictor of compliance with CDC guidelines for workers in the most economically secure class, whereas worry was a significantly stronger predictor of compliance for the most vulnerable counterpart.

Previously, a modelling study had suggested a substantial impact. DesignObservational study SettingEngland. PopulationIndividuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and their reported contacts. Main outcome measuresSecondary attack rates (SARs), hospitalisations, and deaths amongst primary and secondary contacts were calculated, compared to all other concurrent, unaffected cases. SGSS records affected by the event were matched to CTAS records and successive contacts and cases were identified. ResultsThe initiation of contact tracing was delayed by 3 days on average in the primary cases in the delay group (6 days) compared to the control group (3 days). This was associated with lower completion of contact tracing of primary cases in the delay group: 80% (95%CI: 79-81%) in the delay group and 83% (95%CI: 83-84%) in the control group. There was some evidence to suggest an increase in transmission to non-household contacts amongst those affected by the delay.

Standard prognostics do not include neurophysiological indicators or genetic biomarkers of neuroplasticity, which may be critical sources of variability. OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether a common polymorphism (Val66Met) in the gene for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) contributes to variability in post-stroke aphasia, and to assess whether BDNF polymorphism interacts with neurophysiological indicators of neuroplasticity (cortical excitability and stimulation-induced neuroplasticity) to improve estimates of aphasia severity. METHODS Saliva samples and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were collected from participants with chronic aphasia subsequent to left-hemisphere stroke. MEPs were collected prior to continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS; index for cortical excitability) and 10 minutes following cTBS (index for stimulation-induced neuroplasticity) to the right primary motor cortex. Analyses assessed the extent to which BDNF polymorphism interacted with cortical excitability and stimulation-induced neuroplasticity to predict aphasia severity beyond established predictors. RESULTS Val66Val carriers showed less aphasia severity than Val66Met carriers, after controlling for lesion volume and time post-stroke. Furthermore, Val66Val carriers showed expected effects of age on aphasia severity, and positive associations between severity and both cortical excitability and stimulation-induced neuroplasticity. In contrast, Val66Met carriers showed weaker effects of age and negative associations between cortical excitability, stimulation-induced neuroplasticity and aphasia severity. CONCLUSIONS Neurophysiological indicators and genetic biomarkers of neuroplasticity improved aphasia severity predictions.

University students residing in on-campus housing (n = 590) were followed for the development of influenza-like illness for 10-weeks during the 2012C13 influenza season. A contact network was built using weekly self-reported contacts, class schedules, and housing information. We considered a transmission event to have occurred if students were positive for the same pathogen and had a network connection within a 14-day period. Transmitters were individuals who had onset date prior to their infected social contact. Throat and nasal samples were analysed for multiple viruses by RT-PCR. Five viruses were involved in 18 transmission events (influenza A, parainfluenza virus 3, rhinovirus, coronavirus NL63, respiratory syncytial virus). Transmitters had higher numbers of co-infections (67%). Identified transmission events had contacts reported in small classes (33%), dormitory common areas (22%) and dormitory rooms (17%). These results suggest that targeting person-to-person interactions, through measures such as isolation and quarantine, could reduce transmission of respiratory infections on campus.","output":"Transmission of viral pathogens in a social network of university students: the eX-FLU study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have enabled connection and communication on a large scale.

ACE2 is also the viral receptor of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), a related coronavirus that emerged in 2002C2003. Horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) are presumed to be the original reservoir of both viruses, and a SARS-like coronavirus, RaTG13, closely related to SARS-CoV-2, has been identified in one horseshoe-bat species. Here we characterize the ability of the S-protein receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, pangolin coronavirus (PgCoV), RaTG13, and LyRa11, a bat virus similar to SARS-CoV-1, to bind a range of ACE2 orthologs. We observed that the PgCoV RBD bound human ACE2 at least as efficiently as the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and that both RBDs bound pangolin ACE2 efficiently. We also observed a high level of variability in binding to closely related horseshoe-bat ACE2 orthologs consistent with the heterogeneity of their RBD-binding regions. However five consensus horseshoe-bat ACE2 residues enhanced ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses by an enzymatically inactive immunoadhesin form of human ACE2 (hACE2-NN-Fc). Two of these mutations impaired neutralization of SARS-CoV-1 pseudoviruses. An hACE2-NN-Fc variant bearing all five mutations neutralized both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and infectious virus more efficiently than wild-type hACE2-NN-Fc. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-1 and -2 originate from distinct bat species, and identify a more potently neutralizing form of soluble ACE2.","output":"Mutations derived from horseshoe bat ACE2 orthologs enhance ACE2-Fc neutralization of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Knowledge and perceptions of the public about the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) play a critical role in the prevention of the disease through adopting effective preventive measures. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 as well as the source of information about the disease among government employees. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 1,573 government employees from 46 public institutions located in Addis Ababa was undertaken from 8th to 19th June 2020. Systematic random sampling or consecutive sampling techniques were used to select the study participants. Paper-based self-administered questionnaires were used for data collection. ANOVA test and t-test were used to assess the difference between the groups. Results: The respondents demonstrated very high knowledge of the cause of COVID-19 (93%), its main clinical symptoms (>90%), modes of transmission (89%), and the main preventive measures (>90%). Almost all respondents reported that people with travel history (86.8%) or people with close contact with COVID-19 patients (93.5%) were at higher risk to coronavirus infection. About 51% of the participants reported that people without travel history or people who had no contact with confirmed cases were also at risk of infection. About 84% of the respondents perceived those older adults above 60 years were most at risk to die from COVID-19. The majority of the respondents reported that adults with other underlying health problems (95.4%), cigarette smokers (88.1%) and substance users (87.5%) were more likely to die from the disease.

Here, we have developed a simple mass spectrometry assay for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab samples using common laboratory reagents. The method employs high sensitivity and selectivity targeted mass spectrometry detection, monitoring nine constitutive peptides representative of the three main viral proteins and a straightforward pellet digestion protocol for convenient routine applications. Absolute quantification of N, M, and S proteins was achieved by addition of isotope-labeled versions of best peptides. Limit of detection, recovery, precision, and linearity were thoroughly evaluated in four representative viral transport media (VTM) containing distinct total protein content. The protocol was sensitive in all swab media with limit of detection determined at 2  103 pfu/mL, corresponding to as low as 30 pfu injected into the LC-MS/MS system. When tested on VTM-stored nasopharyngeal swab samples from positive and control patients, sensitivity was similar to or better than rapid immunoassay dipsticks, revealing a corresponding RT-PCR detection threshold at Ct  24.

Standardized criteria of the structural valve deterioration (SVD) and bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF) have recently been defined. Limited studies have evaluated the long-term durability of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) according to these new definitions. We aim to analyze the durability of TAVI beyond 5 years and to report the frequency of SVD and BVF. METHODS A total of 89 patients who had undergone TAVI and had theoretically completed at least 5 years after the procedure were included. Either a Medtronic CoreValve or an Edwards SAPIEN XT valve were implanted in the patients. New standardized definitions were used to evaluate SVD and BVF. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 78.706.95 years. SVD occured in 4 (4.5%) patients during 6 years of follow-up. Severe SVD was observed in 2 patients (2.2%), and these patients had the New York Heart Association class II symptoms. Both patients with severe SVD also met the criteria of BVF. Moderate SVD was observed in 2 patients (2.2%), and these patients had no valve-related symptoms. Of the 4 SVD cases, 2 were associated with increased mean transaortic gradients, whereas the remaining 2 cases were associated with intraprosthetic aortic regurgitation. All patients with SVD are still alive, and none of them have required aortic valve reintervention. CONCLUSION Although first-generation TAVI devices were used, we determined the low rate of SVD and BVF at the 6-year follow-up. It may be suggested that there is no major concern associated with TAVI even with first-generation devices regarding long-term durability.","output":"Evaluation of structural valve deterioration and bioprosthetic valve failure utilizing the new European consensus definition in patients undergoing TAVI with first-generation devices: Outcomes beyond 5 years from a single center in Turkey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OPINION STATEMENT Filter technology seems relatively stable, although absorbable devices are an area of investigational interest.

The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) was used to measure resilience, the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) measured distress (i.e., composite of stress, anxiety and depression scales). Other factors assessed included: age, gender, being born overseas, number of children, self-assessed introversion, social, educational and economic variables, family resources, positive affect and emotional regulation, external social support, and partner social support. Hierarchical regression models and a moderation analysis were used to assess the aims. RESULTS: Of 2110 parents, 1701 (80.6%) were female. The mean age was 38 years old (SD = 7, range = 19-69). High loneliness was a key contributor to distress. The level of social support received did add significantly to distress, with greater assistance associated with lower stress and anxiety (both p < .01). Partner support significantly moderated the relationship between resilience and depression; however, this relationship is of unlikely clinical significance due to its small statistical effect.

METHODS Five male swine were anesthetized and instrumented followed by hemorrhage at a rate of 30 mL/min for 60 minutes. RRS-StO2 was continuously measured from the buccal mucosa, and NIRS-StO2 was continuously measured from the forelimb. Paired interval measures of SmvO2, ScvO2, and lactate were made. Pearson correlation was used to quantify the degree to which any two variables are related. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve values were used for pooled data for RRS-StO2, NIRS-StO2, SmvO2, and ScvO2 to compare performance in the ability of tissue oxygenation methods to predict the presence of an elevated arterial blood lactate level. RESULTS Sequential RRS-StO2 changes tracked changes in SmvO2 (r = 0.917; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.867-0.949) and ScvO2 (r = 0.901; 95% CI, 0.828-0.944) during hemorrhage, while NIRS-StO2 failed to do so for SmvO2 (r = 0.283; 95% CI, 0.04919-0.4984) and ScvO2 (r = 0.142; 95% CI, -0.151 to 0.412).

All three PAD-QIs significantly increased in Intervention by 31% (B=30.7, 95%CI [25.7 to 35.8]), 26% (B=25.8, 95%CI [19.4 to 32.2]), and 34% (B=33.9, 95%CI [28.4 to 39.4]) in pain, agitation/sedation and delirium, respectively. CONCLUSION A multifaceted intervention including use of Facebook-groups was associated with improved guideline-adherence in four ICUs, as measured with process PAD-QIs of PAD assessment. Further research on use of social media to improve guideline adherence is warranted, particularly as social distancing impacts clinical education and training and new approaches are needed.","output":"Multifaceted intervention including Facebook-groups to improve guideline-adherence in ICU: a quasi-experimental interrupted time series study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires broad-scale testing. Laboratory capacities for real-time-PCR were increased, and are complemented by Ag-tests. However, sample-collection still requires qualified personnel and protective equipement, may produce transmission to others during conduct and travel, and is perceived uncomfortable. We tested sensitivity of three simplified self-sampling techniques compared to professional-collected combined oro-nasopharyngeal samples (cOP/NP). Methods: From 62 symptomatic COVID-19 outpatients, we obtained simultaneously three self- and one professional-collected sample after initial confirmation in a testing centre: (i) combination swab (tongue, cheek, both nasal vestibula, MS, (ii) saliva sponge combined with both nasal vestibula, SN, and (iii) gargled tap water, GW, (iv) professionally-collected cOP/NP (standard). We compared the results of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-assays detecting E-gene and ORF1ab for the different sample types and performed bivariate statistical analysis to determine the variables reducing sensitivity of the self-collecting procedures. Results: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in all 62 professionally-collected cOP/NP. MS and SN samples showed a sensitivity of 95.2% (95%CI 86.5-99.0) and GW samples of 88.7% (78.1-95.3). Compared to the median ct-values of cOP/NP samples for E-gene (20.7) and ORF1ab (20.2) these were higher for MS (22.6 and 21.8), SN (23.3 and 22.3), and for GW (30.3 and 29.8). For MS and SN samples but not for GW specimens, false negativity in bivariate analysis was associated with non-German mother-tongue, number of sampling errors, and with symptom duration. For symptom duration of []8 days, test sensitivity for SN samples was 98.2% (95%CI 90.4-100.0) and for MS 96.4% (95%CI 87.7-99.6) and drops after day 8 below 90%. Discussion: The study is limited to sensitivity of self-collection in symptomatic patients. Still, in this group, self-collected oral/nasal/saliva samples are reliable alternatives to professional-collected cOP/NP samples, if symptom duration does not exceed eight days and operational errors are minimized. Self-sampling could contribute to up-scaling of safe and efficient testing.","output":"Self-collected oral, nasal and saliva samples yield sensitivity comparable to professional-collected oro-nasopharyngeal swabs in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been observed in temporal association with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), typically within 2 to 6 weeks of illness or exposure.

For over 60 years, various extensions and applications to the popular newsvendor model have been suggested, where cost/profit are often the focal objective. We propose a new version of the traditional single-period newsvendor model - the Rippled Newsvendor - with supply chain severity (i.e. risk propagation) as the primary objective while taking into account network structure. Our model considers exogenous and endogenous risk(s) of disruption while exploring the tension between under-supply and wear-and-tear (i.e system breakdown). To model the intricacies of this trade-off whilst minimizing the potential spread of risk, we leverage a Bayesian Network whereby the conditional probability distributions are functions of the inventory ordering decisions. We use a simulation study to understand the nature of our objective function as well as to gain insight into the potential optimal ordering policies of this new model. Furthermore, the simulation seeks to understand how the various factors in our system impact total risk severity, and if they do so in different ways. Our simulations indicate that local exogenous risk is of greater importance than non-local exogenous risk. Furthermore, we show that the type of risk, as well as the structural characteristics of the supply chain and inventory system, impact risk severity differently.","output":"The rippled newsvendor: A new inventory framework for modelling supply chain risk severity in the presence of risk propagation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quantitative nucleic acid amplification tests (qNAATs) are critical in treating infectious diseases, such as in HIV viral load monitoring or SARS-CoV-2 testing, in which viral load indicates viral suppression or infectivity. Quantitative PCR is the gold standard tool for qNAATs; however, there is a need to develop point-of-care (POC) qNAATs to manage infectious diseases in outpatient clinics, low- and middle-income countries, and the home. Isothermal amplification methods are an emerging tool for POC NAATs as an alternative to traditional PCR-based workflows. Previous works have focused on relating isothermal amplification bulk fluorescence signals to input copies of target nucleic acids for sample quantification with limited success. In this work, we show that recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) reactions on paper membranes exhibit discrete fluorescent amplification nucleation sites. We demonstrate that the number of nucleation sites can be used to quantify HIV-1 DNA and viral RNA in less than 20 minutes. An image-analysis algorithm quantifies nucleation sites and determines the input nucleic acid copies in the range of 67-3000 copies per reaction. We demonstrate a mobile phone-based system for image capture and onboard processing, illustrating that this method may be used at the point-of-care for qNAATs with minimal instrumentation.","output":"Quantitative isothermal amplification on paper membranes using amplification nucleation site analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 had negative effects upon family planning.

There are 27 cases reported of TTS associated with COVID-19 infection of which 44.5% were male. Reported median age was 57 years (IQR: 39C65) and 62.95 years (IQR: 50.5C73.5) in case series and individual patients cases in database, respectively. The time interval from the symptom onset to TTS diagnosis was median 6.5 days (IQR: 1.0C8.0) in case series and 6.7 days (IQR: 4C10) in individual patients database. The median LVEF was 36% (IQR: 35C37) and 38.15%(IQR: 30C42.5%[male: 40.33% (IQR: 33C44.2)] and female [37.15% (IQR: 30C40)] in case series and individual-patients database, respectively.

The hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) substantially compromises their innate immune system. SARS-CoV-2 uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to enter the affected cell. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia-induced glycosylation of ACE2 and the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 could facilitate the binding of S protein to ACE2, enabling viral entry. Downregulation of ACE2 activity secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with consequent accumulation of angiotensin II and metabolites, eventually leads to poor outcomes. The altered binding of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 and the compromised innate immunity of patients with DM increase their susceptibility to COVID-19; COVID-19 induces pancreatic ?-cell injury and poor glycemic control, which further compromises the immune response and aggravates hyperglycemia and COVID-19 progression, forming a vicious cycle. Sequential cleavage of viral S protein by furin and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) triggers viral entry to release the viral genome into the target cell. Hence, TMPRSS2 and furin are possible drug targets. As type 1 DM exhibits a Th1-driven autoimmune process, the relatively lower mortality of COVID-19 in type 1 DM compared to type 2 DM might be attributed to an imbalance between Th1 and Th2 immunity. The anti-inflammatory effects of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor may benefit patients with DM and COVID-19. The potential protective effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), including reduction in lactate level, prevention of lowering of cytosolic pH and reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels may justify the provision of SGLT2i to patients with DM and mild or asymptomatic COVID-19. For patients with DM and COVID-19 who require hospitalization, insulin-based treatment is recommended with cessation of metformin and SGLT2i.

METHODS: A retrospective observational analysis was conducted on two independent hospital datasets of biologic-na?ve, early-RA patients who started oral MTX. Baseline characteristics, DAS28-ESR and monthly MCV after starting MTX were obtained. Conventional and machine-learning statistical approaches were applied to the discovery cohort (Cohort 1, 655 patients) and results validated using Cohort 2 (225 patients). RESULTS: HCQ therapy with MTX was associated with a 2-fold increase in the likelihood of response defined in this study as clinical remission or low disease activity at 6 months (P <0.001). The improved clinical outcome of combination HCQ and MTX therapy was associated with an accelerated rise in MCV from 2 months after commencing therapy. The increase in MCV at 3 months was equivalent to the contemporaneous reduction in the DAS (DAS28-ESR) in predicting clinical response at 6 months. Using latent class mixed modelling, five trajectories of MCV change over 6 months from baseline were identified. The odds ratio of response to treatment was 16.2 (95% CI 5.7, 46.4, P <0.001) in those receiving combination therapy classified within the MCV elevation >5 fl class, which contained the most patients, compared with MTX alone. CONCLUSION: Our data provide mechanistic insight into the synergistic clinical benefit of concomitant HCQ with MTX, boosting the rise in MCV, which could serve as a companion biomarker of treatment response.","output":"The synergistic efficacy of hydroxychloroquine with methotrexate is accompanied by increased erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?sszefoglal A mikroszkp felfedezse ta tudjuk, hogy az egymssal szoros k?zelsgben l? egyedeknek nem csupn a lthat l?helyk k?z?s, hanem szemmel nem rzkelhet? mikroorganizmusokat is megosztanak egymssal, melyek bizonyos fokban adaptldtak gazdikhoz Az emberek letternek b?vlsvel s ezzel prhuzamosan az llatok l?helynek cs?kkensvel azonban j llatfajok kerlhetnek veszlyes k?zelsgbe, ami k?vetkezmnyes mikrobatadssal s az j gazdban a mikroba eltr? viselkedsvel jrhat Felttelezhet?en ez a jelensg vezetett a slyos akut lgz?szervi szindrma koronavrus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) kialakulshoz, mely 2019-ben jelent meg el?sz?r emberekben, s nhny hnap leforgsa alatt millikat fert?z?tt meg az egsz vilgon A pandmia lekzdshez s az jabb jrvnyok megel?zshez minden lehetsges eszk?zt fel kell hasznlni, ami egyttm?k?dst kvn a humnorvosls s az llatgygyszat, valamint az ?kolgiai, evolcis s k?rnyezeti tudomnyok szakemberei k?z?tt a globlis \\"Egy Egszsg\\" keretben A k?z?s clok rdekben t?rtn? ?sszefogs jegyben a jelen tanulmny llatorvos s humnorvos szerz?prosa ?sszefoglalja azon ismereteket, amelyek a SARS-CoV-2 vonatkozsban mindkt szakma szmra rdemlegesek lehetnek Bemutatsra kerl a vrus eredete, termszetes s mestersges el?fordulsa kl?nb?z? llatfajokban, valamint az llati koronavrusokkal kapcsolatos azon tapasztalatok, amelyek hozzjrulhatnak a SARS-CoV-2 m?k?dsnek megrtshez s az ellene val vdekezs t?kletestshez Orv Hetil 2021;162(5): 163-170 Summary Introduction: Since the discovery of the microscope, we have known that individuals living in close proximity to each other share not only their visible habitat, but also invisible microorganisms that have adapted to some degree to their hosts However, as human habitat expands and, in parallel, animal territory declines, new animal species can come into dangerous proximity, which may result in consequential transmission of microbes and different microbial behaviour in the new host Presumably, this phenomenon led to the development of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which first appeared in humans in 2019 and infected millions over the course of a few months worldwide All possible means must be used to combat the pandemic and prevent further epidemics, which will require cooperation between professionals in human medicine and veterinary medicine as well as in the ecological, evolutionary and environmental sciences, within the framework of the global \\"One Health\\" In a spirit of working together for common goals, the authors of this study, a veterinarian and a human physician, summarize the knowledge that may be relevant to both professions for SARS-CoV-2 The origin of the virus, its natural and artificial occurrence in different animal species, and experiences with animal coronaviruses that may contribute to the understanding of the functioning of SARS-CoV-2 and the development of protection against it are presented Orv Hetil 2021;162(5): 163-170","output":"A slyos akut lgz?szervi szindrmt okoz koronavrus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) orvosilag relevns aspektusai llatokban"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Responsive educational proposals to develop skills to meet the demands of Industry 4.0 have become imperative to guarantee inclusive, equitable, and quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all, also reducing the negative impact of COVID\\\\19 and the major post\\\\pandemic social issues.

Most of the fall in mobility occurred prior to the most stringent sanctions against movement, such as stay-at-home laws. However, we find evidence suggesting that state and local policies did have an independent effect on mobility even after the large initial reductions occurred. Event studies show that early and information-focused actions such as first case announcements, emergency declarations, and school closures reduced mobility by 1C5 percent after five days.

Compared to their younger counterparts, older adults spend more time at home and have less contact with natural environments due to social isolation and physical decline. However, the association of residential window-opening with depressive symptoms is understudied among older populations. METHODS: We used data from a community-based cohort study conducted in 23 provinces of China including 13,125 adults age 65 years or older (mean age: 83.8 years [SD: 11.1]). We created the window opening index (WOI) as a proxy of window-view and window-ventilation, leveraging relevant data on self-reported frequencies of manual window opening at home. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the 10-item version of the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale no fewer than 10. We used multivariate logistic regression model to examine the association between window opening and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: In the multivariate logistic regression model controlling for a set of well-designed mood-influencing environmental and individual-level covariates, a protective effect of window opening on depressive symptoms was observed, with 16% lower odds per interquartile increment in WOI (odds ratio: 0.84, 95%-CI: 0.81-0.87). Subgroup analyses indicated that the beneficial effects were more pronounced among those with higher socioeconomic status (higher levels of education, urban residents) and better surrounding environments (lower exposure of ambient fine particular matter, proximity to park, or higher levels of residential greenness).

The goal of the research was to explore the association between deprivation of socioeconomic status (SES) and spatial patterns of COVID-19 incidence in Chennai megacity for unfolding the disease epidemiology. Study design Ecological (or contextual) study for electoral wards (sub-cities) of Chennai megacity. Methods Using data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from May 15, 2020, to May 21, 2020, for 155 electoral wards obtained from the official website of the Chennai municipal corporation, we examined the incidence of COVID-19 diseases using two count regression models namely, Poisson Regression (PR) and Negative Binomial Regression (NBR). As explanatory factors, we considered area-deprivation that represented the deprivation of socioeconomic status (SES). An index of multiple deprivations (IMD) developed to measure the area-deprivation using an advanced local statistic, Geographically Weighted Principal Component Analysis (GWPCA). Based on the availability of appropriately scaled data, five domains (i.e. poor housing condition, low asset possession, poor availability of WaSH services, lack of household amenities and services, and gender disparity) were selected as components of the IMD in this study. Results The Hot-spot analysis revealed that area-deprivation was significantly associated with higher incidences of COVID-19 in Chennai megacity. The high variations (adj. R2: 72.2%) with the lower BIC (124.34) and AIC (112.12) for the NBR compared to PR suggests that the NBR model better explains the relationship between area-deprivation and COVID-19 incidences in Chennai megacity. NBR with two-sided tests, and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. The outcome of the PR and NBR suggests that when all other variables were constant, according to NBR, the relative risk (RR) of COVID-19 incidences was 2.19 for the wards with high housing deprivation or in other words, the wards with high housing deprivation having 119% higher probability (RR= e0.786=2.19, 95% CI=1.98 to 2.40) compared to areas with low deprivation. Similarly, in the wards with poor availability of WaSH services, chances of having COVID-19 incidence was 90% higher compared to the wards with good WaSH services (RR= e0.642=1.90, 95% CI=1.79 to 2.00). Spatial risks of COVID-19 infections were predominantly concentrated in the wards with higher levels of area-deprivation which were mostly located in the north-eastern parts of Chennai megacity. Conclusions We formulated an area-based IMD, which was substantially related to COVID-19 incidences in the Chennai megacity. This study highlights that the risks of COVID-19 infections tend to be higher in more deprived areas of SES and the north-eastern part of Chennai megacity was predominantly high-risk areas.

We found that contrary to the US consumer food price index, the overall price level at Amazon Fresh did not increase during the pandemic, but even slightly decreased for several product groups. Amazon seems to follow its low-price strategy also in the grocery sector, even in times of high demand. However, during the lockdown phase, there were more price increases for certain highly demanded product groups such as frozen and prepared foods.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the long\\\\term outcome of cats with AMG without evidence of a cranial mediastinal mass (CMM). ANIMALS: Eight cats diagnosed with AMG without evidence of a CMM. METHODS: Retrospective case series. The medical records of cats diagnosed with AMG between 2005 and 2018 from 2 veterinary referral hospitals were reviewed for inclusion. Inclusion criteria consisted of a diagnosis of AMG, thoracic imaging, serum biochemistry including measurement of creatine kinase, and a CBC. Exclusion criteria were the presence of an identifiable CMM, or administration of methimazole or carbimazole. RESULTS: All cats had an excellent long\\\\term outcome, achieving immune remission within 6 months of diagnosis, including 4 cats that did not receive any treatment and whose natural course of disease involved spontaneous remission. Clinical presentation was heterogeneous, and skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability induced or exacerbated by the wheelbarrow exercise stress test were the most consistent abnormalities associated with AMG. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Cats diagnosed with AMG without evidence a CMM have a favorable outcome and frequently achieve immune remission. Moreover, the natural history of AMG in cats includes spontaneous remission when there is no evidence of a CMM. Attempting to rule out the presence of a CMM therefore refines prognosis, and treatment is not always necessary in this disease population.","output":"Long\\\\term outcome of cats with acquired myasthenia gravis without evidence of a cranial mediastinal mass"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of older adults is increasing rapidly, and this demographic shift places an increased level of strain and tension on the various international healthcare and welfare systems [...].","output":"Age-Friendly Cities and Communities: State of the Art and Future Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Human Development Index measures a regions development and is a step for development debate beyond the traditional, economic perspective.

In particular, in-person laboratory components have been largely reduced or removed from anatomy teaching to comply with social distancing guidelines. While this has compromised typical learning environments, it offers a unique opportunity to implement remote teaching practices in anatomy and assess their impact on students? learning. The Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at McGill University has initiated a hybrid teaching strategy for the anatomy laboratory curriculum that combines limited hands-on cadaveric dissection with remote laboratory-adjacent activities using a 3-D software application (Complete Anatomy 2021). During the Fall 2020 semester, first-year medicine and dentistry students had the opportunity to experience both teaching formats while learning respiratory and cardiovascular anatomy. Our study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of this hybrid curriculum delivery format by comparing in-person versus digital teaching approaches implemented within the same cohort on the following outcomes: (i) student and instructor experiences, (ii) students? approach to learning (SAL) and performance, and (iii) faculty time, resources, and cost considerations. Given that hands-on cadaver-based learning is considered the gold standard in anatomy education, we hypothesized that the in-person teaching format would be associated with higher deep and lower surface learning scores, higher grades, and higher resource requirements. The qualitative feedback revealed greater student preference for in-person dissection learning. Comparisons of SAL between in-person and remote delivery formats revealed no significant differences in students? deep or surface approach scores between in-person and remote delivery formats during the respiratory (deep: p = 0.63;surface: p = 0.84) or cardiovascular (deep: p = 0.18;surface: p = 0.22) anatomy laboratory sessions. Further, no significant differences were noted in mean grades on the laboratory exam when correlated with the respective in-person vs. remote learning format for both respiratory (p = 0.65) and cardiovascular (p = 0.18) blocks. Together, these findings suggest that irrespective of the teaching method utilized, students adopted similar approaches to learning anatomy and performed equally well in summative assessments. Pending a thematic analysis of instructors? experiences, resource use, and cost considerations, findings from this study will help guide educational policy revisions aimed at maintaining student-centered learning during current and future disruptions to in-person teaching.","output":"Evaluating In-person and Remote Delivery of Human Anatomy Laboratory Education Among Medicine and Dentistry Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Solid mineral mining activities have contributed to the distribution and uptake of radionuclides.

One hundred and four individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia underwent 3 weeks of phonologically focussed treatment and 3 weeks of semantically focussed treatment in an unblinded cross-over design. A linear mixed-effects model was used to compare the effects of treatment type on proportional change in correct naming across groups. Correlational analysis and stepwise regression models were used to examine biographical and neuropsychological predictors of response to phonological and semantic treatment across all participants. Last, chi-square tests were used to explore the association between treatment response and phonological and semantic deficit profiles. Semantically focussed treatment was found to be more effective at the group-level, independently of treatment order (P = 0.041). Overall, milder speech and language impairment predicted good response to semantic treatment (r range: 0.256C0.373) across neuropsychological tasks. The Western Aphasia Battery-Revised Spontaneous Speech score emerged as the strongest predictor of semantic treatment response (R(2) = 0.188). Severity of stroke symptoms emerged as the strongest predictor of phonological treatment response (R(2) = 0.103).

These results suggest that semantic treatment may be more beneficial to the improvement of naming performance in aphasia than phonological treatment, at the group-level.

Integration of iron particles in the mesh base material allows MRI visualization of meshes. Positive-contrast susceptibility imaging (PCSI) was implemented to separate susceptibility-induced voids from proton-deficient voids. The purpose of this study was to compare PCSI with conventional gradient echo and turbo spin echo (TSE) sequences for the in vivo assessment of superparamagnetic iron oxide particle-loaded surgical meshes in an animal model. METHODS AND MATERIALS Iron-loaded polymer meshes were implanted into the abdominal wall of 10 rabbits. At days 1, 30, and 90 after surgery, conventional gradient echo, TSE, and PCSI were performed at 1.5 T in the sagittal and axial planes. Images were scored by 2 radiologists with respect to mesh visibility, delineation of the surrounding tissue, differentiation from other structures, and overall diagnostic use, on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (insufficient) to 4 (excellent). The results were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. The mesh shape, possible deformation or fracture, and possible mesh migration were evaluated on the different pulse sequences and compared with the results at surgery and autopsy. RESULTS The iron-loaded meshes appeared as hypointense signal voids on gradient echo sequences, as a hyperintense line on PCSI, and as a very thin dark line on TSE images. In all animals, a precise depiction of the mesh location and its spatial configuration and integrity was possible by MRI and confirmed by surgical and autopsy results. In all 4 categories and at all 3 time points of imaging, image quality scores were significantly higher for gradient echo imaging (range, 3.60-3.80) compared with PCSI (range, 3.12-3.42) and TSE (range, 1.64-1.89). At day 90, the image quality ratings of gradient echo and PCSI were comparable. In 2 cases, the complete delineation of mesh borders was impossible because of signal voids of adjacent anatomical structures, whereas PCSI helped achieve this differentiation. CONCLUSION In this rabbit model of iron-loaded implanted abdominal meshes, standard gradient echo imaging was best suitable to assess implant location, integrity, and configuration. In 2 of 10 animals, PCSI helped achieve a complete delineation of mesh borders.","output":"In vivo visualization of polymer-based mesh implants using conventional magnetic resonance imaging and positive-contrast susceptibility imaging."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic of novel Corona has not only brought entire socio-economic structures in to a standstill but has challenged the globalization and global operations of enterprises.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the clinical features of mask\\\\induced dermatoses and recommend prevention and treatment options. METHODS: From April to August 2020, questionnaires including preexisting skin disorders, patients reported mask\\\\related symptoms, their daily mask wearing duration and frequency, types of masks used, whether they are health care workers, and demographic information were distributed to patients of 12 hospitals. Dermatologists assessed skin lesions, confirmed diagnosis, and recorded treatment modalities. RESULTS: Itchiness was the most frequent symptom, mostly affecting the cheeks. Most common skin disease was new\\\\onset contact dermatitis (33.94%), followed by new\\\\onset acne (16.97%) and aggravation of preexisting acne (16.97%). Daily wearing (p=0.018) was significantly associated with new\\\\onset contact dermatitis. More than half of the patients with preexisting skin problems experienced aggravation while wearing masks. Longer duration (more than 6 hours/day, p=0.043) and cotton masks (p<0.001) significantly increased acne flare\\\\up. Healthcare workers had a higher incidence of skin disease. Skin lesions were generally mild and well tolerated with topical agents. LIMITATIONS: Effect of seasonal characteristics and other risk factors were not assessed.

METHODS: Multicentre randomised case-control study that involved 18 patients with COVID-19 related anosmia or severe hyposmia for more than 30 days. Nine patients were prescribed systemic prednisone and nasal irrigation with betamethasone, ambroxol and rinazine for 15 days. The other 9, untreated, patients were used as controls. The olfactory function was evaluated with CCCRC test at 20 and 40 days from the first evaluation. RESULTS: In the control group, a median olfactory score of 20 (IQR 30) was detected at baseline. At the 20-day control there was no significant improvement in olfactory function. The improvement in olfactory performance became significant at the 40-day follow-up compared to baseline scores [60 (IQR 60) versus 20 (IQR 30)]. In the treatment group, patients had a mean olfactory score of 10 (IQR 15) at initial control. At the 20-day control, a significant im-provement in the olfactory scores, compared to the baseline, was detected [70 (IQR 40) versus 10 (IQR 15)].

DESIGN Before-after observational study. SETTING Family physicians' offices in Ottawa, Ont. PARTICIPANTS General practitioners and office staff. INTERVENTIONS Four infection-control practices (use of masks, alcohol-based hand gel, and signs, and asking patients to sit at least 1 m apart in the waiting room) were observed, and 2 reported infection-control practices (disinfecting surfaces and use of hand-gel dispensers in examining rooms) were audited before the intervention and 6 weeks after the intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Percentage of patients asked to use masks and alcohol-based hand gel, number of relevant signs, and percentage of patients asked to sit at least 1 m away from other patients. Percentage of surfaces disinfected and percentage of physicians using hand-gel dispensers in examining rooms. RESULTS Of 242 practices invited, 53 agreed to participate (22% response rate), and within those practices, 143/151 (95%) physicians participated. Signs regarding respiratory infection control measures increased from 15.4% to 81.1% following the intervention (P < .001). At least 1 patient with cough and fever was given a mask in 17% of practices before the intervention; during the observation period after the intervention, at least 1 patient was given a mask in 66.7% of practices (P < .001). Patients were instructed to use alcohol-based hand gel in 24.5% of practices before the intervention and in 79.2% of practices after it (P < .001). Instruction to sit at least 1 m from others in the waiting area was given in 39.6% of practices before the intervention and in 52.8% of practices following the intervention (P < .001). Before the intervention, the percentage of practices using all 4 audited primary prevention measures was 3.8%; after the intervention, 52.8% of practices were using them (P < .001), demonstrating a 49% increase in adoption of best practices.

The novel SARS-CoV-2 not only affects the lungs causing severe acute respiratory dysfunction but also leads to significant dysfunction in multiple organs and physiological systems including the cardiovascular system. A plethora of studies have shown the viral infection triggers an exaggerated immune response, hypercoagulation and oxidative stress, which contribute significantly to poor cardiovascular outcomes observed in COVID-19 patients. To date, there are no approved vaccines or therapies for COVID-19. Accordingly, cardiovascular protective and supportive therapies are urgent and necessary to the overall prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Accumulating literature has demonstrated the beneficial effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) toward the cardiovascular system, which include ameliorating uncontrolled inflammatory reactions, reduced oxidative stress and mitigating coagulopathy. Moreover, it has been demonstrated the n-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are precursors to a group of potent bioactive lipid mediators, generated endogenously, which mediate many of the beneficial effects attributed to their parent compounds. Considering the favorable safety profile for n-3 PUFAs and their metabolites, it is reasonable to consider n-3 PUFAs as potential adjuvant therapies for the clinical management of COVID-19 patients. In this article, we provide an overview of the pathogenesis of cardiovascular complications secondary to COVID-19 and focus on the mechanisms that may contribute to the likely benefits of n-3 PUFAs and their metabolites.","output":"Can N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids be considered a potential adjuvant therapy for COVID-19-associated cardiovascular complications?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite no or limited pre-clinical evidence, repurposed drugs are massively evaluated in clinical trials to palliate the lack of antiviral molecules against SARS-CoV-2.

When treatment is initiated before or simultaneously to infection, favipiravir has a strong dose effect, leading to reduction of infectious titers in lungs and clinical alleviation of the disease. Antiviral effect of favipiravir correlates with incorporation of a large number of mutations into viral genomes and decrease of viral infectivity.

Objective To report practice patterns for common ocular complaints during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic among comprehensive ophthalmology practices in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants In this cross-sectional study, 40 private practices and 20 university centers were randomly selected from 4 regions across the US. Data were collected on April 29 and 30, 2020. Interventions Investigators placed telephone calls to each ophthalmology practice office. Responses to 3 clinical scenarios-refraction request, cataract evaluation, and symptoms of a posterior vitreous detachment-were compared regionally and between private and university centers. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary measure was time to next appointment for each of the 3 scenarios. Secondary measures included use of telemedicine and advertisement of COVID-19 precautions. Results Of the 40 private practices, 2 (5%) were closed, 24 (60%) were only seeing urgent patients, and 14 (35%) remained open to all patients. Of the 20 university centers, 2 (10%) were closed, 17 (85%) were only seeing urgent patients, and 1 (5%) remained open to all patients. There were no differences for any telemedicine metric. University centers were more likely than private practices to mention preparations to limit the spread of COVID-19 (17 of 20 [85%] vs 14 of 40 [35%]; mean difference, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.26-0.65; P < .001). Private practices had a faster next available appointment for cataract evaluations than university centers, with a mean (SD) time to visit of 22.1 (27.0) days vs 75.5 (46.1) days (mean difference, 53.4; 95% CI, 23.1-83.7; P < .001).

Graft delamination is primarily an imaging diagnosis and is confirmed with the help of ultrasound which shows the separation of graft fabric layers. Only two such cases have been described in the literature so far. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of upper extremity arteriovenous graft thrombosis in a 79 year old COVID-19 positive patient with end-stage renal disease. The diagnosis was established on ultrasonography which revealed separation of the graft fabric layers with thrombosis within the false and true lumen of the graft. The patient was managed with angioplasty and embolectomy of the clot material followed by stent-graft placement across the delaminated portion of the graft. Post-procedural angiography confirmed brisk flow across the graft and patient could successfully have subsequent hemodialysis sessions. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of graft delamination as a cause of graft failure is important as its management differs from other conventional causes since it requires stent-grafts to cover the area of delamination to re-establish flow and salvage the AV graft. The recognition of this phenomenon is essential to provide quality care and successful reuse of the AV graft.

The ADP-ribosylation cycle is maintained by writers and erasers.

However, historically, mechanisms of erasers of ADP-ribosylations have been understudied, primarily due to the lack of quantitative tools to selectively monitor specific activities of different ADP-ribosylation reversal enzymes. Here, we developed a new NUDT5-coupled AMP-Glo (NCAG) assay to specifically monitor the protein-free ADP-ribose released by ADP-ribosylation reversal enzymes. We found that NUDT5 selectively cleaves protein-free ADP-ribose, but not protein-bound poly- and mono-ADP-ribosylations, protein-free poly(ADP-ribose) chains, or NAD(+). As a proof-of-concept, we successfully measured the kinetic parameters for the exo-glycohydrolase activity of PARG, which releases monomeric ADP-ribose, and monitored activities of site-specific mono-ADP-ribosyl-acceptor hydrolases, such as ARH3 and TARG1. This NCAG assay can be used as a general platform to study the mechanisms of diverse ADP-ribosylation reversal enzymes that release protein-free ADP-ribose as a product.

METHODS: In this retrospective 44-hospital observational study, we used the Pediatric Health Information System database to identify infants aged &#8804;60 days evaluated for fever in emergency departments from January 2016 through December 2017. We described hospital-level variation in laboratory testing, including HSV, imaging and other diagnostic evaluations, acyclovir use, and LOS. We assessed the relationship between HSV testing and LOS using generalized linear mixed effects models adjusted for age and illness severity. RESULTS: In 24 535 encounters for fever, the median HSV testing frequency across hospitals was 35.6% (interquartile range [IQR]: 28.5%-53.5%) for infants aged 0 to 21 days and 12% (IQR: 8.6%-15.7%) for infants aged 22 to 60 days.

The prevalence of additional testing varied substantially by hospital and age group. Risk-adjusted LOS for HSV-tested infants was significantly longer than risk-adjusted LOS for those not tested (2.6 vs 1.9 days, P < .001).

We compared estimated numbers of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 by May 2021 to cumulative incidence of confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases from case-based surveillance, and calculated infection: case ratios by state and type of anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid immunoassay used for seroprevalence testing. ResultsAnalyses included 67,321 serum specimens tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among children in 14 U.S. states. Estimated ratios of SARS-CoV-2 infections to reported confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases among children and adolescents varied by state and type of immunoassay, ranging from 0.8-13.3 in May 2021. ConclusionsThrough May 2021, the majority of children in selected states did not have detectable SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibodies. Case-based surveillance underestimated the number of children infected with SARS-CoV-2, however the predicted extent of the underestimate varied by state, immunoassay, and over time. Continued monitoring of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence should inform prevention and vaccination strategies.","output":"Methods for Estimation of SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence and Reported COVID-19 Cases in U.S. Children, August 2020 - May 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly affected mortality in the world, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and occasionally into multiorgan dysfunction.

A prompt identification of mental signs and symptoms is important for preventing mental disorders in the public. This study examined whether local public have adequate knowledge to identify mental health symptoms and the need to get timely professional help. METHODS: The population-based telephone surveys were conducted in 2015 and 2018. It involved a random sample of 4033 respondents aged 12C75 years. Mental health knowledge and help seeking attitude were assessed using six vignettes depicting subtle and obvious symptoms of anxiety disorders, mixed anxiety and depressive disorders, and dementia. Logistic regression models were performed to examine association between mental health knowledge and help-seeking attitude. RESULTS: Individuals with poor knowledge in subtle symptoms were more likely to be males (t = ? 5.0, p < .001), younger (F = 15.0, p < .001), have tertiary education (F = 15.0, p < .001), and employed (t = ? 2.1, p = .037). The knowledge scores of subtle and obvious symptoms were 1.5 and 2.3 respectively. Binary logistic regression found that poor knowledge of subtle symptoms was associated with reluctance to professional help seeking. CONCLUSIONS: Poorly identified subtle mental health symptoms is a major barrier to early professional help in highly educated working males.

An international group of experts in lung cancer radiotherapy established this practice recommendation pertaining to whether and how to adapt radiotherapy for lung cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For this ESTRO & ASTRO endorsed project, 32 experts in lung cancer radiotherapy contributed to a modified Delphi consensus process. We assessed potential adaptations of radiotherapy in two pandemic scenarios. The first, an early pandemic scenario of risk mitigation, is characterized by an altered risk-benefit ratio of radiotherapy for lung cancer patients due to their increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 infection, and minimization of patient travelling and exposure of radiotherapy staff. The second, a later pandemic scenario, is characterized by reduced radiotherapy resources requiring patient triage. Six common lung cancer cases were assessed for both scenarios: peripherally located stage I NSCLC, locally advanced NSCLC, postoperative radiotherapy after resection of pN2 NSCLC, thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation for limited stage SCLC and palliative thoracic radiotherapy for stage IV NSCLC. RESULTS: In a risk-mitigation pandemic scenario, efforts should be made not to compromise the prognosis of lung cancer patients by departing from guideline-recommended radiotherapy practice. In that same scenario, postponement or interruption of radiotherapy treatment of COVID-19 positive patients is generally recommended to avoid exposure of cancer patients and staff to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. In a severe pandemic scenario characterized by reduced resources, if patients must be triaged, important factors for triage include potential for cure, relative benefit of radiation, life expectancy, and performance status. Case-specific consensus recommendations regarding multimodality treatment strategies and fractionation of radiotherapy are provided. CONCLUSION: This joint ESTRO-ASTRO practice recommendation established pragmatic and balanced consensus recommendations in common clinical scenarios of radiotherapy for lung cancer in order to address the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Practice Recommendations for Lung Cancer Radiotherapy During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An ESTRO-ASTRO Consensus Statement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"China, Hong Kong SAR and Singapore are bracing themselves for those firms no longer supported by the US capital markets","output":"China responds to aggressive moves in US capital markets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fourteen months into the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we identify key lessons in the global and national responses to the pandemic.

The objective of this study was to examine consecutive antibody seroprevalence changes among hospital staff, a high-risk population. A two-time survey was performed in May and October 2020 for 545 hospital staff to investigate the changes in the results of the rapid kit test and chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). The seroprevalence of each assay was summarized at both the survey periods. The proportion of seropositive individuals in the CLIA for each survey period and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Central Fukushima were then compared. We chose 515 participants for the analysis. The proportion of IgM seroprevalence in CLIA increased from 0.19% in May to 0.39% in October, and IgG seroprevalence decreased from 0.97% in May to 0.39% in October. The proportion of IgM seroprevalence in the rapid kit test decreased from 7.96% in May to 3.50% in October, and IgG seroprevalence decreased from 7.77% in May to 2.14% in October. The IgG and IgM antibody seroprevalence among hospital staff in rural Central Fukushima decreased; the seroprevalence among hospital staff was consistent with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Central Fukushima area. Although it is difficult to interpret the results of the antibody assay in a population with a low prior probability, constant follow-up surveys of antibody titers among hospital staff had several merits in obtaining a set of criteria regarding the accuracy of measures against COVID-19 and estimating the COVID-19 infection status among hospital staff.","output":"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among hospital staff in rural Central Fukushima, Japan: A historical cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT A survey was carried out in order to study the geopolitical distribution of fascioliasis on Santiago Island, Cape Verde.

No licensed vaccines are available in the United States, and currently there is no efficacious therapy to treat this viral infection. Therefore the importance of developing effective antiviral approaches to combat pathogenic arenaviruses is clear. Moreover, the prototypic arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is an important model for the study of viral persistence and associated diseases, as well as for exploring therapies to treat viral chronic infections. The use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to downregulate gene expression via RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a powerful genetic tool for the study of gene function. In addition, the successful use of siRNAs to target a variety of animal viruses has led us to consider RNAi as a potential novel antiviral strategy. We have investigated the use of RNAi therapy against LCMV. Here, we show that siRNAs targeting sequences within the viral L polymerase and Z mRNAs inhibit LCMV multiplication in cultured cells. Unexpectedly, the antiviral efficacy of RNAi-based therapy against LCMV was highly dependent on the method used to deliver effector siRNA molecules. Thus, transfection of chemically synthesized siRNA pools to L and Z was ineffective in preventing virus multiplication. In contrast, targeting of the same viral L and Z gene products with siRNAs produced inside cells using a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus expression system inhibited LCMV multiplication very efficiently. Notably, transduction with the replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus expression system to Z and L effectively cured persistently LCMV-infected cells, suggesting the feasibility of using RNAi therapy to combat viral chronic infections by riboviruses.","output":"RNA interference-mediated virus clearance from cells both acutely and chronically infected with the prototypic arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ethiopia has taken unprecedented preventive measures, such as confinement to home and closure of schools and offices to halt the spread of Corona virus pandemic in the country. Unfortunately, such orders may have been associated with intimate partner violence (IPV) against women but there is no study conducted to assess the magnitude of IPV during the lock-downs in the country. Thus, this study intended to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of IPV against women during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on sample of 617 married or cohabited women. A systematic random sampling technique was employed to identify and enroll women who are married. A logistic regression analysis was used to identify the predictors of IPV among women and all statistical analyses were carried out using STATA 14.2. In this study, amongst the 589 married women who were included in the analysis, 22.4% [95% CI: 19.1%, 25.9%] were experienced at least one form of IPV. Additionally, 11.0%, 20.0%, and 13.8% of women also experienced physical, psychological, and sexual IPVs respectively. After adjusting for covariate; being illiterate [AOR=2.37: 95% CI 1.29, 4.35], having illiterate husband [AOR=2.67: 95% CI 1.36, 5.21], having substance user husband (alcohol, chat or cigarettes) [AOR=2.75: 95% CI 1.42, 5.34], and community tolerant attitude to violence [AOR=2.97: 95% CI 1.17, 7.61] were the independent predictors of IPV amongst married women. In conclusion, the prevalence of IPV among married women was comparable to the national pre-COVID figure of IPV. Therefore, national and regional governments should work toward enhancing gender equality, coupled with addressing risk factors at multiple levels, using community- and institution-based approaches to prevent IPV and to specifically achieve SDG5 of eliminating violence against women by 2030.","output":"Prevalence and Associated Factors of Intimate Partner Violence Among Married Women During COVID-19 Pandemic Restrictions: A Community-Based Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) is a serious complication of COVID-19 patients Treatment is tocilizumab The use of glucocorticoids (GC) is controversial In other very similar CSS, such as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and hemophagocytic syndrome (HFS), the main treatment are corticosteroids Our objective is to evaluate the efficacy of GC in the CSS by COVID-19 Patients We included 92 patients with CSS associated to COVID-19 who received GC, GC, and tocilizumab and only tocilizumab We determine CSS markers We evaluated mortality, intubation, and a combined variable Results In all cases the percentages of events were lower in the group of patients with GC was administered The hazard ratio of the final variables with GC versus the group in which only tocilizumab was administered was lower as CGs were considered, with statistical significance for survival Discussion The early use of GC pulses could control SLC, with a lower requirement to use tocilizumab and a decrease in events such as intubation and death Resumen Introduccin El sndrome de liberacin de citocinas (SLC) es una complicacin grave de los pacientes COVID-19 La base del tratamiento es tocilizumab El uso de glucocorticoides (GC) es controvertido En otros SLC muy parecidos, como son el sndrome de activacin macrofgica (SAM) y el sndrome hemofagoctico (SHF) el tratamiento con los corticoides es fundamental Nuestro objetivo es evaluar la eficacia de los GC en el SLC por COVID-19 Pacientes Incluimos 92 pacientes con SLC por COVID-19 que recibieron GC, GC y tocilizumab y slo tocilizumab Determinamos marcadores de SLC Evaluamos mortalidad, intubacin y una variable combinada Resultados En todos los casos los porcentajes de eventos fueron menores en el grupo de pacientes en los que se administraron GC Las razones de riesgo de las variables finales de los grupos con GC frente al grupo en el que se administr slo tocilizumab fue menor conforme se consideraron los GC, con significacin estadstica para la supervivencia Discusin El uso precoz de pulsos de GC puede controlar el SLC, con un menor requerimiento de uso de tocilizumab y una disminucin de eventos como la intubacin y muerte","output":"Effectiveness of corticoid pulses in patients with cytokine storm syndrome induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Emergence of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants requires more efficient control measures to limit nosocomial transmission and maintain healthcare capacities during pandemic waves. Yet the relative importance of different strategies is unknown. METHODS: We developed an agent-based model and compared the impact of personal protective equipment (PPE), screening of healthcare workers (HCWs), contact tracing of symptomatic HCWs and restricting HCWs from working in multiple units (HCW cohorting) on nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The model was fit on hospital data from the first wave in the Netherlands (February until August 2020) and assumed that HCWs used 90% effective PPE in COVID-19 wards and self-isolated at home for 7 days immediately upon symptom onset. Intervention effects on the effective reproduction number (R(E)), HCW absenteeism and the proportion of infected individuals among tested individuals (positivity rate) were estimated for a more transmissible variant. RESULTS: Introduction of a variant with 56% higher transmissibility increased  all other variables kept constant  R(E) from 0.4 to 0.65 (+ 63%) and nosocomial transmissions by 303%, mainly because of more transmissions caused by pre-symptomatic patients and HCWs. Compared to baseline, PPE use in all hospital wards (assuming 90% effectiveness) reduced R(E) by 85% and absenteeism by 57%. Screening HCWs every 3 days with perfect test sensitivity reduced R(E) by 67%, yielding a maximum test positivity rate of 5%. Screening HCWs every 3 or 7 days assuming time-varying test sensitivities reduced R(E) by 9% and 3%, respectively. Contact tracing reduced R(E) by at least 32% and achieved higher test positivity rates than screening interventions. HCW cohorting reduced R(E) by 5%. Sensitivity analyses show that our findings do not change significantly for 70% PPE effectiveness. For low PPE effectiveness of 50%, PPE use in all wards is less effective than screening every 3 days with perfect sensitivity but still more effective than all other interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In response to the emergence of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants, PPE use in all hospital wards might still be most effective in preventing nosocomial transmission. Regular screening and contact tracing of HCWs are also effective interventions but critically depend on the sensitivity of the diagnostic test used.

The aim of the study is to assess whether pre-operative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 could be performed at between 48 and-72 hours pre-operatively with specific advice about minimising the risk of SARS-CoV-2 restricted to between PCR and admission. Methods A multi-centre, international, observational cohort study of 1000 lower limb arthroplasty cases was performed. The dual primary outcomes were thirty-day conversion to SARS-CoV-2 positive and thirty-day SARS-CoV-2 mortality. Secondary outcomes included thirty-day SARS-CoV-2 morbidity. Results Of the 1000 cases, 935 (94%) had a PCR between 48 and 72-hours pre-operatively. All cases were admitted to, and had surgery through a COVID-free pathway.

METHODS: RISK11 was measured in a longitudinal study of RISK11-guided TPT in HIV-uninfected adults, a cross-sectional respiratory organisms cohort, or a longitudinal study in people living with HIV (PLHIV). HIV-uninfected RISK11(+) participants were randomized to TPT or no TPT; RISK11(?) participants received no TPT. PLHIV received standard-of-care antiretroviral therapy and TPT. In the cross-sectional respiratory organisms cohort, viruses and bacteria in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were quantified by real-time quantitative PCR. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: RISK11(+) status was transient in most of the 128 HIV-negative participants with longitudinal samples; more than 70% of RISK11(+) participants reverted to RISK11(?) by 3 months, irrespective of TPT. By comparison, reversion from a RISK11(+) state was less common in 645 PLHIV (42.1%).

Use of ATS is associated with a range of health and social problems, and has been increasing internationally in the last decade. Self-harm and ATS use share a number of underlying risk factors and occur at elevated rates in marginalised groups with high rates of exposure to trauma. The relationship between self-harm and ATS use is likely complex, and the causal pathway may run in either direction. A comprehensive review, synthesis and analysis of the evidence are warranted to investigate this relationship and inform policy and practice. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search the Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO and Scopus databases for relevant observational studies published in peer-reviewed journals. The initial search was conducted on 5 February 2021, with a final search expected on 1 February 2022. All studies will be independently screened by two reviewers, first on title and abstract, and then on full-text to determine inclusion in the review. We place no restriction on the population that studies investigate, our exposure of interest is both prescription and illicit ATS use, comparators will be those not currently using ATS, and our primary outcome of interest is the prevalence of self-harm. Data will be extracted using a predesigned template, and pooled prevalence and pooled measures of effect for the association between ATS use and self-harm. If sufficient data are available, we will perform multiple meta-analyses to produce pooled measures of effect for each measure of ATS exposure, as well as different population sub-groups.

METHODS: Hospital attendance at 10 public hospitals were obtained including Machakos Level 5 Hospital (the county referral facility) and one health facility from each of the 9 Sub-counties of Machakos County. Data on outpatient and inpatient attendance from November 2019 to May 2020 were obtained and compared with a similar calendar period from the previous year. Key informant interviews (KIIs), focused group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews were conducted with the hospital management personnel (n = 46), as well as with the patients (n = 453) who missed scheduled clinic appointments at Machakos Level 5 Hospital to understand the reasons behind the drop in attendance numbers. RESULTS: Overall, there was a decline in the number of patient attendances compared to the prior calendar period.

Efforts to minimize adverse impacts of indirect impacts on access to health care and preventative services to counter increased morbidity and mortality require attention throughout the pandemic.","output":"The impact of measures to curb COVID-19 on patient attendance at 10 hospitals in Machakos County, Kenya"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a cluster outbreak caused by an imported case from Hubei Province was reported in Xian City, Shaanxi Province, China. Ten patients from 2 families and 1 hospital were involved in the transmission. MATERIAL/METHODS: We conducted an epidemiological investigation to identify the cluster transmission of COVID-19. The demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and cluster characteristics were described and analyzed. RESULTS: From January 27 to February 13, 2020, a total of 10 individuals were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 by the nucleic acid testing of nasopharyngeal swabs from 2 families and 1 hospital. Among the confirmed cases, 7 had atypical clinical symptoms and 3 were asymptomatic. The median times from onset to diagnosis and to discharge were 3.5 days (range, 1C5 days) and 19.5 days (range, 16C38 days), respectively. There were 4 patients whose exposure dates were 1, 3, 3, and 2 days earlier than the onset dates of their previous-generation cases, respectively. Four prevention and control measures were effectively used to interrupt the disease transmission. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 can be easily transmitted within families and in hospitals, and asymptomatic patients could act as a source of disease transmission. The results of this outbreak at the early epidemic stage support the recommendation that individuals with confirmed COVID-19 and all their close contacts should be subjected to medical quarantined observation and nucleic acid screening as early as possible, even if they do not have any symptoms. Meanwhile, people in high-risk areas should improve their protective measures.","output":"A Cluster Transmission of Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the Prevention and Control Measures in the Early Stage of the Epidemic in Xian, China, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study aimed to identify the different level of knowledge in medical students of Universitas Sumatera Utara based on the length of study.

Although, in the last 20 years, several interventions have been developed to reduce the impact of social isolation and loneliness on the health of older people. However, only a small proportion of these interventions are effective. This study aims to describe the components of the Psychological Support Service for Socially Isolated Elderly People (PSIE), in addition to analysing the effectiveness of a community intervention based on an outreach strategy to combat situations of social isolation in the elderly population. The sample consisted of 63 people over 65 years of age from the city of Madrid (Spain), detected by the socio-health services as people at risk of social isolation. Sociodemographic, mental health, health and psychosocial functioning, global functioning, disability and socio-sanitary needs were evaluated with observational scales. Descriptive statistics were calculated for sociodemographic and mental health variables. An analysis was carried out to study the possible influence of gender in the initial sample on the different variables assessed, using Chi-squared and Students t-tests for independent samples, with measures of effect size in each case. A study of the effectiveness of PSIE was carried out with an analysis of pre- and post-treatment measures. A Students t-test was used for related samples, as well as the effect size of Cohens d statistic. For the assessment of the possible influence of gender on the results of the intervention, a 2  2 repeated-measures ANOVA (pre-/post-measures  gender) was conducted. Regarding mental health, 65.2% of the sample presented symptoms compatible with a severe mental disorder, the most frequent being psychotic disorder (22.7%), alcohol use disorder (16.7%), personality disorder (15.2%), anxiety disorders (10.4%) and mood disorders (10.4%). The gender variable does not seem to have an influence on any of the outcome measures studied. The results of the effectiveness study indicate that the PSIE is an intervention programme that serves to improve the scores of people in the sample in all variables that the programme studied. Some of the components of PSIE that could explain its effectiveness are individualized interventions, with a home-based approach by professionals, serving as a link between the older person and the normalized social-sanitary network. Further research is required to provide more robust data on the effectiveness of interventions.","output":"People over 65 Years Old in Social Isolation: Description of an Effective Community Intervention in the City of Madrid (Spain)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-COVID-19 pandemic is bringing to light significant issues that require deliberations on how to manage patients at high cardiovascular risk or with proven heart disease. The evidence that the hospital can be a place where one might contract the infection and spread the disease has drastically reduced non-COVID-19 accesses to emergency rooms (ER) and to elective non-COVID-19 hospital activities. If this, on one hand, results in reducing improper access to the ER and hospital, on the other hand it substantiates the risk of underestimating problems not connected to COVID-19, such as an increased delay in the diagnosis and treatment of acute myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular emergencies. In addition, the need to reorganize hospital activities to treat patients suffering from serious COVID-19 disease forms forces us to reflect on how to safely manage patients who stay at home with milder COVID-19 disease forms and the need to keep the most vulnerable subjects, such as patients with chronic heart failure, away from the hospital. The problem is furtherly amplified by the uncertain trend of the epidemic, by the duration of forced isolation and limited mobility measures and by the inadequate integration between hospital and territory, especially in high-risk areas such as residences for the elderly or in socially and economically fragile environments. Our opinion is that a syndemic approach, which considers the complex interplay between social, economic, environmental and clinical problems, can be the most appropriate and achieved by means the contribution of telemedicine and telecardiology, intended as integration and not as an alternative to traditional management. A flexible use of telematic tools, now available for teleconsultation, and/or remote monitoring adapted to the needs of clinical, family and social-health contexts could allow the creation of integrated and personalized management programs that are effective and efficient for the care of patients.","output":"[Being a cardiologist at the time of SARS-COVID-19: is it time to reconsider our way of working?]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The piper gurnard fish, Trigla lyra, is one of numerous fish species contributing to the Mediterranean marine biodiversity.

This study explores stress among the Arab minority in Israel during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, and its association with the population's perceived COVID-19 threat, trust in the healthcare system, adherence to guidelines, and perceived discrimination. The study analyzed a cross-sectional online survey of 626 Israeli Arabs. Most participants (65%) reported moderate levels of stress, and 10% reported severe levels. The Bedouin population reported significantly higher levels of stress compared to other minority groups. The participants also reported a high degree of perceived threat, a moderate-to-high level of discrimination, a moderate level of trust in the healthcare system, and very high adherence to guidelines. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that the participants' perceived threat and trust mediated the association between their perceived discrimination and stress [indirect effect=0.13, SE = 0.03 CI = (0.08, 0.18)], whereby discrimination was negatively associated with trust (=-0.52), which, in turn, was negatively associated with stress (=-0.10). Furthermore, discrimination was positively associated with perceived threat ( = 0.21), which, in turn, was positively associated with stress ( = 0.35). Discrimination is an important social determinant of health - especially during health emergencies when trust in healthcare systems and perceived threats are crucial. Our findings could assist policymakers in developing fair policies, that are tailored to various population groups and that may reduce stress levels among minorities, thereby improving their mental and physical health.

More than 6,973,427 confirmed cases were diagnosed in nearly 213 countries and territories around the world and two international conveyances, causing globally over 400,000 deaths. Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients have been identified, but the factors influencing the immune system against COVID-19 have not been well established. Upon infection or cell damage, high amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are released from damaged cells, which serve as mediators of inflammation through purinergic cell surface receptor signaling. As a protective mechanism to prevent excessive damage to host tissue, adenosine counteracts ATP's effects by adenosine receptor stimulation to suppress the pro-inflammatory response. Adenosine is seen as a major obstacle to the efficacy of immune therapies, and the adenosinergic axis components are critical therapeutic targets for cancer and microbial infections. Pharmacologic inhibitors or antibodies specific to adenosinergic pathway components or adenosine receptors in microbial and tumor therapy have shown efficacy in pre-clinical studies and are entering the clinical arena. In this review, we provide a novel hypothesis explaining the potential for improving the efficiency of innate and adaptive immune systems by targeting adenosinergic pathway components and adenosine A(2A) receptor signaling for the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Targeting adenosinergic pathway and adenosine A(2A) receptor signaling for the treatment of COVID-19: A hypothesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mortality rates from cervical cancer demonstrate deep inequality in health between richer and poorer populations. Over 310 000 women died of this preventable disease in 2018, mostly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) where screening and treatment are beyond the capacity of health systems. Immunisation against human papillomavirus (HPV) offers a primary prevention strategy, but rates of vaccination uptake are unclear. Understanding coverage levels and factors affecting uptake can inform immunisation strategies. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the status of HPV vaccination coverage from nationally reported indicators and to estimate global coverage in a single year cohort of vaccine-eligible girls. DESIGN: This study provides quantitative population-level estimates of important global health indicators. Using data from the Global Cancer Observatory and WHO/UNICEF, incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer and HPV vaccination coverage are described for countries, categorised by income group. Characteristics of LMICs achieving high coverage are explored using selected development indicators from World Bank sources. Global HPV immunisation coverage is calculated and its impact on cervical cancer mortality estimated. RESULTS: Incidence and mortality for cervical cancer correlate with poverty. Whilst all WHO member states report high infant measles vaccination rates, fewer than half report on HPV vaccination. Even amongst high-income countries, coverage varies widely. In upper-middle-income countries, there is a trend for higher coverage with increased health spending per capita. Four LMICs report good coverage levels, all associated with external funding. Global HPV immunisation coverage for 2018 is estimated at 12.2%. Of the global cohort of 61 million 15-year-old girls in 2018, 7000 are likely to die from cervical cancer, almost all in LMICs.

This paper also provides a novel empirical inquiry into the moderating role of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs. Using an online survey, a total of 395 usable responses were collected. The data were collected during the lockdown imposed in May-June 2021 in Pakistan after the country was hit with the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall findings signaled that resilient consumers perceived a lesser threat of COVID-19 as compared to vulnerable consumers, and consequently, panic buying disposition was more prevalent among the vulnerable consumers.

New pathogens are believed to emerge from animal reservoirs when ecological changes increase the pathogen's opportunities to enter the human population(1) and to generate subsequent human-to-human transmission(2). Effective human-to-human transmission requires that the pathogen's basic reproductive number, R(0), should exceed one, where R(0) is the average number of secondary infections arising from one infected individual in a completely susceptible population(3). However, an increase in R(0), even when insufficient to generate an epidemic, nonetheless increases the number of subsequently infected individuals.

Specifically, DLX5 maintains a bivalent state in normal tissues; its promoter is hypermethylation, leading to DLX5 transcriptional silencing in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). In stark contrast, DLX5 promoter gains active histone marks and becomes transcriptionally activated in ESCC, which is directly mediated by SOX2.

The burgeoning neurointerventional workforce and the rapid growth in the neurointerventional space on the heels of groundbreaking clinical trials prompted us to assess the fellowship's academic impact and its graduates' perceptions and productivity. An anonymized web-based survey was sent to all former neuroendovascular fellows with specific questions pertaining to current practice, research and funding, and perceptions about the fellowship's impact on their skills, competitiveness, and compensation. Additionally, the h-index was calculated to assess the academic productivity of each graduated fellow. Among 50 former fellows, 42 (84%) completed the survey. The fellows came from various countries, ethnic backgrounds, and specialties including neurosurgery (n = 39, 93%), neurology (n = 2, 5%), and neuroradiology (n = 1, 2%). Twenty (48%) respondents were currently chairs or directors of their practice. Most (n = 30, 71%) spent at least 10% of their time on research activities, with 27 (64%) receiving research funding. The median h-index of all 50 former fellows was 14. The biggest gains from the fellowship were reported to be improvement in endovascular skills (median = 10 on a scale of 0-10 [highest]) and increase in competitiveness for jobs in vascular neurosurgery (median = 10), followed by increase in academic productivity (median = 8), and knowledge of vascular disease (median = 8). In an era with open calls for moratoriums on endovascular fellowships, concerns over market saturation, and pleas to improve training, fellowship programs perhaps merit a more objective assessment.

Although ACC is more often superficial and small, it can be large and involve the underlying structures such as skull and dura, thus increasing the risk of hemorrhage, infection, and mortality. Controversy exists regarding nonsurgical versus surgical intervention for this condition. This study reviews indications and modalities for treatment of this rare congenital anomaly. RESULTS Management of this anomaly depends on size, location, and structures at risk. Small lesions with intact underlying structures and lesions affecting extremities are treated in a conservative fashion with dressings and ointments followed by delayed scar excision. Aplasia cutis congenita scar excision often requires complex tissue rearrangement, tissue expansion, or skin grafting. Larger ACC lesions or lesions with exposure of vital structures require early surgical intervention. Initially, exposed vital structures and bony ridges can be protected using conservative measures. Delayed definitive repair can then be performed using scalp flaps, split- and full-thickness skin grafts, cultured epithelial autografts, delayed split rib cranioplasty, tissue expansion, and composite cranioplasty. CONCLUSIONS Aplasia cutis congenita should be individually evaluated based on size, depth, location, and tissues involved. Using conservative and surgical modalities, one can achieve complete closure of the defect, thus avoiding risks of infection, hemorrhage, and further trauma.","output":"Aplasia cutis congenita: clinical management of a rare congenital anomaly."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has become a public health emergency of international concern; it has not only threatened people's physical health but has also affected their mental health and psychological well-being. It is necessary to develop and offer strategies to reduce the psychological impact of the outbreak and promote adaptive coping. OBJECTIVE: This study protocol aims to describe a self-administered web-based intervention (Mental Health COVID-19) based on the principles of positive psychology supported by elements of cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral activation therapy to reduce the symptoms of anxiety and depression and increase positive emotions and sleep quality during and after the COVID-19 outbreak through a telepsychology system. METHODS: A randomized controlled clinical superiority trial with two independent groups will be performed, with intrasubject measures at four evaluation periods: pretest, posttest, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: self-administered intervention with assistance via chat or self-administered intervention without assistance via chat. The total required sample size will be 166 participants (83 per group). RESULTS: The clinical trial is ongoing. This protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the Free School of Psychology-University of Behavioral Sciences (Escuela libre de Psicologa-Universidad de Ciencias del Comportamiento). The aim is to publish the preliminary results in December 2020. A conservative approach will be adopted, and the size effect will be estimated using the Cohen d index with a significance level (&#945;) of .05 (95% reliability) and a conventional 80% power statistic.

BACKGROUND: Much knowledge is available concerning change in complex cognitive capacities under the effects of thermal stress. Our science can inform critical care facilities as to remediation strategies such as work-rest schedules to minimize performance error in highly cognitively demanding circumstances such as intensive care units. METHOD: The present exposition draws from the state-of-the-art understanding concerning thermal stress effects on cognition and workload in complex and demanding tasks. RESULTS: The summation and synthesis of HF/E findings provides important insights into combinatorial effects of forms of stress, typically dealt with only as discrete sources in traditional standards and regulations. The identified interaction between ascending thermal stress and cognitive task demand provides an instance of the plurality of ways HF/E can specify performance limitations in safety-critical circumstances, as witnessed in the current pandemic. CONCLUSION: Accumulated HF/E insights provide systematic ways in which to address and ameliorate the combined forces of physical and cognitive stress on medical personnel constrained to use varying forms of PPE. These principles extend beyond this specific domain to all who are required to work in differential and isolated microclimates. APPLICATION: To minimize the possibility of critical and life-threatening error in intensive care facilities which necessitate PPE use, we need principled work-rest ratio and heat stress mitigation guidance.

We present our clinical practices and patients' outcomes after elective, emergent, and urgent cardiovascular surgery and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). We also investigated the rate of nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 in health workers (HWs), including surgeons after cardiovascular procedures and percutaneous interventions (PCI). MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed 186 cardiovascular operations and PCI between March 15 and October 15. According to the level of priority (LoP), we performed urgent and emergent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and cardiac valve repair or replacement surgery in 44 patients. In one patient with acute chordae rupture with pulmonary edema, we performed mitral valve replacement. We performed the aortic arch repair in two patients with type-I aortic dissection in urgent situations. Therefore, in 47 patients we performed cardiac operations in urgent or emergent situations. Elective CABG (N = 28) and elective cardiac valve (N = 10) surgeries were performed (total: 38). While rescue PCI was urgently performed in 47 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), it was performed in elective or emergent situations in 40 patients with myocardial ischemia. Endovascular treatment was performed in four patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and in four patients with chronic arterial occlusion, respectively. Surgical vascular repair and embolectomy were performed in patients with peripheral artery injury (N = 6) and acute arterial embolic events (N = 4), respectively. We performed thoracic computed tomography followed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in patients with irregular diffuse reticular opacities with or without consolidation on chest X-ray. Blood coagulation disorders including d-dimer, thromboplastin time (TT), and partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) were measured prior to procedures. RESULTS No mortality and morbidity was seen after percutaneous and surgical arterial or venous procedures. The total mortality rate was 4.1% (8 of 186 CAD patients or valve surgery) after urgent and emergent CABG (N = 4), an urgent valve replacement (N = 1), and PCI (N = 3). Low cardiac output syndrome (LOS) and major adverse cardiac cerebrovascular event (MACCE) were the mortality factors after cardiac surgery. The reasons for death after PCI were sudden cardiac arrest related to the dissection of the left main coronary artery during procedure and pneumonia due to COVID-19 (N = 2). Ground-glass opacities in combination with pulmonary consolidations were detected in seven patients. Interlobular septal and pleural thickening with patchy bronchiectasis in the bilateral lower lobe involvement was found after thoracic computed tomography in these patients. We confirmed in-hospital COVID-19 using a PCR test in two patients with STEMI prior to PCI. PT and aPTT increased, but fibrin degradation products did not in those two patients. We confirmed COVID-19 via phone call in six CABG patients and one PCI patient after discharge from the hospital. None of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19 died after being discharged from the hospital. CONCLUSION Cardiovascular surgery and PCI can safely be performed with acceptable complications and mortality rates in elective situations, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Preoperative control of OR traffic, careful evaluation of the patient's history, consultation, and precautions taken by healthcare professionals are important, during and after procedures. Also important is wearing a mask and face shield and careful disinfection of equipment and space.","output":"Should We Postpone Elective Cardiovascular Procedures and Percutaneous Coronary Interventions During the COVID-19 Pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One limitation to engaging KC12 students and the public with microorganisms is the inability to cultivate and dispose of bacterial and fungal samples safely without expensive equipment or services.

Primary SARS-CoV-2 infection with systemic viral RNA release (RNAaemia) contributes to innate immune coagulation cascade activation, with both pulmonary and systemic immunothrombosis - including venous territory strokes. However, anti-SARS-CoV-2 adenoviral-vectored-DNA vaccines -initially shown for the ChAdOx1 vaccine-may rarely exhibit autoimmunity with autoantibodies to Platelet Factor-4 (PF4) that is termed Vaccine-Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT), an entity pathophysiologically similar to Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). The PF4 autoantigen is a polyanion molecule capable of independent interactions with negatively charged bacterial cellular wall, heparin and DNA molecules, thus linking intravascular innate immunity to both bacterial cell walls and pathogen-derived DNA. Crucially, negatively charged extracellular DNA is a powerful adjuvant that can break tolerance to positively charged nuclear histone proteins in many experimental autoimmunity settings, including SLE and scleroderma. Analogous to DNA-histone interactons, positively charged PF4-DNA complexes stimulate strong interferon responses via Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) 9 engagement. A chain of events following intramuscular adenoviral-vectored-DNA vaccine inoculation including microvascular damage; microbleeding and platelet activation with PF4 release, adenovirus cargo dispersement with DNA-PF4 engagement may rarely break immune tolerance, leading to rare PF4-directed autoimmunity. The VITT cavernous sinus cerebral and intestinal venous territory immunothrombosis proclivity may pertain to venous drainage of shared microbiotal-rich areas of the nose and in intestines that initiates local endovascular venous immunity by PF4/microbiotal engagement with PF4 autoantibody driven immunothrombosis reminiscent of HIT. According to the proposed model, any adenovirus-vectored-DNA vaccine could drive autoimmune VITT in susceptible individuals and alternative mechanism based on molecular mimicry, vaccine protein contaminants, adenovirus vector proteins, EDTA buffers or immunity against the viral spike protein are secondary factors. Hence, electrochemical DNA-PF4 interactions and PF4-heparin interactions, but at different locations, represent the common denominator in HIT and VITT related autoimmune-mediated thrombosis.","output":"Mechanisms of Immunothrombosis in Vaccine-Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT) Compared to Natural SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral infection caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which spreads rapidly from person to person and manifests in most symptomatic patients as a respiratory illness, similar to prior SARS viruses.

This study examines the prospective association of herpesviruses with (pre)diabetes to evaluate their potential role in diabetes aetiology. METHODS: Two follow-up examinations of the German population-based KORA cohort (F4 and FF4) were used to identify participants with normal glucose tolerance at baseline, thus being at risk for (pre)diabetes (n = 1257). All participants had repeated OGTTs and antibody measurements for herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, EpsteinCBarr virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human herpesvirus 6 and 7. Regression models were used to evaluate the association between serostatus with (pre)diabetes incidence after a 7 year follow-up and HbA(1c). RESULTS: HSV2 and CMV were associated with (pre)diabetes incidence after adjustment for sex, age, BMI, education, smoking, physical activity, parental diabetes, hypertension, lipid levels, insulin resistance and fasting glucose. Seropositivity of both viruses was also cross-sectionally associated with higher HbA(1c) at baseline, with the association of HSV2 being independent of confounders, including the prevalence of (pre)diabetes itself. While seropositivity for multiple herpesviruses was associated with a higher incidence of (pre)diabetes, this association was not independent of confounders.

The effective policy requires taking into account public information and adaptability to new knowledge. Epidemiological models built to understand COVID-19 seldom provide the policymaker with the capability for adaptive pandemic control (APC). Among the core challenges to be overcome include (a) inability to handle a high degree of non-homogeneity in different contributing features across the pandemic timeline, (b) lack of an approach that enables adaptive incorporation of public health expert knowledge, and (c) transparent models that enable understanding of the decision-making process in suggesting policy. In this work, we take the early steps to address these challenges using Knowledge Infused Policy Gradient (KIPG) methods. Prior work on knowledge infusion does not handle soft and hard imposition of varying forms of knowledge in disease information and guidelines to necessarily comply with. Furthermore, the models do not attend to non-homogeneity in feature counts, manifesting as partial observability in informing the policy. Additionally, interpretable structures are extracted post-learning instead of learning an interpretable model required for APC. To this end, we introduce a mathematical framework for KIPG methods that can (a) induce relevant feature counts over multi-relational features of the world, (b) handle latent non-homogeneous counts as hidden variables that are linear combinations of kernelized aggregates over the features, and (b) infuse knowledge as functional constraints in a principled manner. The study establishes a theory for imposing hard and soft constraints and simulates it through experiments.

Methods A longitudinal follow-up investigation of 25 patients from a tertiary hospital in Henan provincial was conducted 8 weeks after discharge. Of these patients, 15 attended a second follow-up appointment 8 weeks after that. A throat swab reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis for SARS-CoV-2 and chest computerized tomography (CT) scans were implemented at the first follow-up appointment, and a total of 40 blood samples (25 from the first and 15 from the second follow-up appointment) were collected. Patients' levels of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody against S-Receptor binding domain (S-RBD) and Nucleocapsid Protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 and the subpopulation of lymphocytes were evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) test and flow cytometry, respectively. Results At the first follow-up appointment, 10 of the 25 patients (40.0%) showed complete radiological resolution. Of these patients, 80.0% were classified as moderate, and 80.0% were younger (those whose age was  the median age of all the patients). The predominant patterns of abnormalities included an irregular line (12/25, 48.0%), ground-glass opacity (GGO) (44.0%), and multiple GGOs (28.0%). At the first follow-up appointment, 40.0% (10/25) of patients still had lymphopenia. Of the 15 patients who were followed-up with twice, the ratio of lymphopenia was 80% (12/15), 60.0% (9/15), and 46.7% (7/15) at 0, 8, and 16 weeks after discharge, respectively. This was mainly due to a decrease in the cluster of differentiation (CD) 4+ T lymphocyte, which was observed in 60% (9/15), 60% (9/15), and 46.7% (7/15) of total patients at 0, 8, and 16 weeks after discharge, respectively. All of the patients were S-RBD and NP IgG antibody positive at the first follow-up appointment. 40.0% (6/15) and 66.7% (10/15) of patients showed a decrease over 50.0% in the level of NP and S-RBD IgG antibodies, respectively, at the second follow-up appointment. The NP and S-RBD IgG antibodies' levels declined to 44.6% (P=0.044) and 28.1% (P=0.18), respectively. 0 and 26.7% (4/15) of patients turned from NP and S-RBD IgG antibody positive to negative, respectively. Conclusions About half of the patients still showed at least 1 abnormality in chest CT scans 8 weeks after discharge and lymphopenia 16 weeks after discharge. The level of the IgG antibody had declined by the follow-up appointment. Notably, the S-RBD IgG antibody declined more dramatically than that of NP.

Early cholecystectomy has many reported advantages. Operation-related morbidity and mortality have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, our aim is to present our general clinical approach to patients who were diagnosed with AC during the pandemic and our percutaneous cholecystostomy experience during this period. METHODS: This study included 72 patients who were presented to our hospital's emergency room between March 11 and May 31, 2020, with AC. Patients were divided into three groups based on their treatment: outpatients (Group 1), inpatients (Group 2) and patients undergoing percutaneous cholecystostomy (Group 3). These three groups were compared by their demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: There were 36 (50%) patients in Group 1, 25 (34.7%) patients in Group 2, and 11 (15.3%) patients in Group 3. The demographic characteristics of the patients were similar. The CRP and WBC levels of the patients in Group 3 were significantly higher compared to the other groups. Moreover, the wall of the gallbladder was thicker and the size of the gallbladder was larger in Group 3. Patients had percutaneous cholecystostomy at the median of 3.5 days and the length of hospital stay was longer compared to Group 2 (3.9 days versus 9.2 days, p=0.00). The rate of re-hospitalization after discharge was similar in Group 2 and Group 3, but none of the patients in Group 1 required hospitalization. None of 72 patients developed an emergency condition requiring surgery, and there was no death. CONCLUSION: Although many publications emphasize that laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) can be performed with low morbidity at the first admission in acute cholecystitis, it is a clinical condition that can be delayed in the COVID-19 pandemic and other similar emergencies. Thus, percutaneous cholecystostomy should be effectively employed, and its indications should be extended if necessary (e.g., younger patients, patients with lower CCI or ASA).

The condensed cap mesenchyme is hypothesized to generate a population of stem/progenitor cells that undergo mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) originating nephrons. Few immunohistochemical markers are available for detecting cap mesenchymal cells in the early phases of MET. METHODS The expression of MUC1 was evaluated in the kidneys, of 4 human foetuses and 2 newborns. RESULTS MUC1 immunoreactivity was detected in all the examined kidneys in the cap mesenchyme and in the renal vesicles. Immunostaining for MUC1 in cap mesenchymal cells changed from one nodule to the next: some mesenchymal nodules were negative, some showed MUC1 reactivity in scattered cells, whereas in others, positive cells revealed the presence of a roundish developing epithelial structure. CONCLUSIONS Our data clearly indicates, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, immunohistochemical evidence of MUC1 expression during human kidney development. We focused on MUC1 reactivity in the cap mesenchyme. On the basis of these preliminary data, we speculate that MUC1 may be involved in human nephrogenesis and may play a relevant role in MET from the cap mesenchyme to the renal vesicle, changing the fate of renal stem/progenitor cells.","output":"MUC1 in mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition during human nephrogenesis: changing the fate of renal progenitor/stem cells?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This meta-analysis was performed to access the influence of dexmedetomidine versus propofol for adult patients with sepsis undergoing mechanical ventilation.

Revman 5.3 and Stata software (version 12.0, Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX, United States) were used for meta-analysis. Results: Fifteen studies were included, and the data from the included studies were incorporated into the meta-analysis. Also, the result shows that compared with propofol, dexmedetomidine does not reduce 28-day mortality [risk ratios (RR) =0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) =0.83-1.13, p = 0.70].

It is critical to identify COVID-19 patients who are most likely to develop a severe disease. This study was designed to determine the clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 patients associated with the development of pneumonia and factors associated with disease progression. METHODS: Seventy consecutive patients with etiologically confirmed COVID-19 admitted to PLA General Hospital in Beijing, China from December 27, 2019 to March 12, 2020 were enrolled in this study and followed-up to March 16, 2020. Differences in clinical and laboratory findings between COVID-19 patients with pneumonia and those without were determined by the &#967;2 test or the Fisher exact test (categorical variables) and independent group t test or Mann-Whitney U test (continuous variables). The Cox proportional hazard model and Generalized Estimating Equations were applied to evaluate factors that predicted the progression of COVID-19. RESULTS: The mean incubation was 8.67 (95% confidence interval, 6.78-10.56) days. Mean duration from the first test severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-positive to conversion was 11.38 (9.86-12.90) days. Compared to pneumonia-free patients, pneumonia patients were 16.5 years older and had higher frequencies of having hypertension, fever, and cough and higher circulating levels of neutrophil proportion, interleukin-6, low count (< 190/l) of CD8+ T cells, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio. Thirteen patients deteriorated during hospitalization. Cox regression analysis indicated that older age and higher serum levels of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and lactate at admission significantly predicted the progression of COVID-19. During hospitalization, circulating counts of T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells were lower, whereas neutrophil proportion, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and the circulating levels of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were higher, in pneumonia patients than in pneumonia-free patients. CD8+ lymphocyte count in pneumonia patients did not recover when discharged. CONCLUSIONS: Older age and higher levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitionin, interleukin-6, and lactate might predict COVID-19 progression. T lymphocyte, especially CD8+ cell-mediated immunity is critical in recovery of COVID-19.

Interleukin 6 (IL-6) plays the role of pro-inflammatory cytokine, it is a receptor mediated signalling system. Macroalgae is well known as a source of valuable bioactive substances with potential biological activities. Among them is the sulphated polysaccharide lambda-carrageenan -CGN which has been reported as an anti-inflammatory agent. However, its mechanism of action against IL-6 production is currently unknown. This study aims to predict potential molecular mechanisms of -CGN chemical compound against IL-6 expression through in silico study. Chemical compound of -CGN and target protein in this study were obtained from the pubchem and protein data bank (PDB). The molecular docking prediction was conducted with PyRx software, the result is -CGN compound showing strong binding energy to bind target protein IL-6 receptor with the value of -5.9 kcal/mol. Based on the results of in silico study, the sulphated polysaccharide -CGN potentially inhibits IL-6R expression by binding ligand pocket with six conventional hydrogen bonds (amino acid residus: His256, His 257, Trp 219, Arg 231, and Asp 221) and two carbon hydrogen bonds (amino acid residus: THR 218 and GLN 220). Binding with these amino acid residues potentially contributes to IL-6 receptor structural change which could result in functional change. Hence, further studies related to in vitro and in vivo investigations would be interesting to further understand the inhibitory mechanism of -CGN against IL-6.","output":"Anti-inflammatory potential of -carrageenan by inhibition of IL-6 receptor: in silico study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is exposing critical failures in public and occupational health in the United States.

Typically delivered piecemeal in the UK, by a variety of agencies with inconsistent funding, provision is fragmented and many such interventions struggle to continue after only a short start-up period. This realist review investigates what can promote or hinder such interventions in being able to sustain long term. METHODS: Key sources of evidence were gathered using formal searches of electronic databases and grey literature, together with informal search methods such as citation tracking. No restrictions were made on article type or study design; only data pertaining to regularly meeting, ongoing, community-based interventions were included. Data were extracted, assessed, organised and synthesised and a realist logic of analysis applied to trace contextCmechanismCoutcome configurations as part an overall programme theory. Consultation with stakeholders, involved with a variety of such interventions, informed this process throughout. RESULTS: Ability to continually get and keep members; staff and volunteers; the support of other services and organisations; and funding/income were found to be critical, with multiple mechanisms feeding into these suboutcomes, sensitive to context. These included an emphasis on socialising and person-centredness; lowering stigma and logistical barriers; providing support and recognition for personnel; networking, raising awareness and sharing with other organisations, while avoiding conflict; and skilled financial planning and management. CONCLUSIONS: This review presents a theoretical model of what is involved in the long-term sustainability of community-based interventions. Alongside the need for longer-term funding and skilled financial management, key factors include the need for stigma-free, person-centred provision, sensitive to members diversity and social needs, as well as the need for a robust support network including the local community, health and care services.

Standard Medicare Wellness visits require no physical exam beyond blood pressure and most physicians perform limited exams during these visits. The objective of this study was to test the feasibility, potential benefit, and costs of performing a screening ultrasound (US) exam during Medicare Wellness visits. METHODS A physician examiner at an academic internal medicine primary care clinic performed a screening US exam targeting important abnormalities of patients 65-85 years old during a Medicare Wellness visit. The primary care physician (PCP) recorded the follow-up items for each abnormality identified by the US examiner and assessed the benefit of each abnormality for the participant. Abnormality benefit, net exam benefit per participant, follow-up items and costs, participant survey results, and exam duration were assessed. RESULTS Participants numbered 108. Total abnormalities numbered 283 and new diagnoses were 172. Positive benefit scores were assigned to 38.8%, neutral (zero) scores to 59.4%, and negative benefit scores to 1.8% of abnormalities. Net benefit scores per participant were positive in 63.9%, 0 in 34.3%, and negative in 1.8%. Follow-up items were infrequent resulting in 76% of participants without follow-up cost.

In Java, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented throughout 2020. However, as a vaccination campaign launches, cases and deaths are rising across the island. METHODS: We used modelling to explore the extent to which data on burials in Jakarta using strict COVID-19 protocols (C19P) provide additional insight into the transmissibility of the disease, epidemic trajectory, and the impact of NPIs. We assess how implementation of NPIs in early 2021 will shape the epidemic during the period of likely vaccine rollout. RESULTS: C19P burial data in Jakarta suggest a death toll approximately 3.3 times higher than reported. Transmission estimates using these data suggest earlier, larger, and more sustained impact of NPIs. Measures to reduce sub-national spread, particularly during Ramadan, substantially mitigated spread to more vulnerable rural areas. Given current trajectory, daily cases and deaths are likely to increase in most regions as the vaccine is rolled out. Transmission may peak in early 2021 in Jakarta if current levels of control are maintained. However, relaxation of control measures is likely to lead to a subsequent resurgence in the absence of an effective vaccination campaign. CONCLUSIONS: Syndromic measures of mortality provide a more complete picture of COVID-19 severity upon which to base decision-making. The high potential impact of the vaccine in Java is attributable to reductions in transmission to date and dependent on these being maintained. Increases in control in the relatively short-term will likely yield large, synergistic increases in vaccine impact.

Accurate investigation of emerging data is crucial to inform policy makers as they construct viral mitigation strategies. Complications such as variable testing rates and time lags in counting cases, hospitalizations and deaths make it challenging to accurately track and identify true infectious surges from available data, and requires a multi-modal approach that simultaneously considers testing, incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths. Although many websites and applications report a subset of these data, none of them provide graphical displays capable of comparing different states or countries on all these measures as well as various useful quantities derived from them. Here we introduce a freely available graphical application that allows the user to simultaneously assess time trends in these measures and compare various states or countries, equipping them with a tool to investigate the potential effects of the different mitigation strategies and timelines used by various jurisdictions. Findings: COVID-TRACK is a Python based web-application that provides a platform for tracking testing, incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths related to COVID-19 along with various derived quantities.

Nurses meet patients with coronavirus disease and offer care for newly communicable diseases. Despite global and national efforts to prevent the spread, the outbreak is still on a rise, and studies on the health care behaviors of nurses were scarce in the study setting. Therefore, this study was intended in addressing nurses intention to care for coronavirus disease 19 patients and its determinants among nurses working at Debre Tabor town Health Care Institutions, 2020. Methodology: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 163 nurses working at health care institutions of Debre Tabor Town, from June 01 to 15/2020.

Effective health promotion strategies are needed to support the health of this vulnerable group. This protocol provides a methodological description of a study that aims to examine the feasibility and safety of performing a randomised clinical trial (RCT) on a wilderness programme that is developed to support the health of AYA cancer survivors. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The pilot RCT study has a mixed-method design, including quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Participants are AYAs, aged 16C39 years, that have been diagnosed with cancer during childhood, adolescence or young adulthood. A total of 40 participants will be randomly assigned to a wilderness programme (n=20) or a holiday programme (n=20). Both arms include participation in an 8-day summer programme, followed by a 4-day programme 3 months later. Primary outcomes are feasibility and safety parameters such as time to recruitment, willingness to be randomised, programme adherence and adverse effects. Secondary outcomes include self-reported health such as self-esteem, quality of life, self-efficacy and lived experiences. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyse outcomes and explore indications of differences between the programmes. Interviews are analysed by directed content analysis and hermeneutic phenomenology. A convergent parallel mixed-method analysis design will be applied to integrate quantitative and qualitative data. Results of this feasibility study will inform the preparation for a larger RCT with AYA cancer survivors.

Adverse outcomes associated with PM2.5 range from autism, auto theft, and COVID-19 mortality to elderly mortality, suicide, and violent crime. Many influential articles argue that reducing National Ambient Air Quality Standards for PM2.5 is desirable to reduce these outcomes; of late, it has become fashionable to explicitly interpret estimated statistical associations causally, implying that reducing PM2.5 would reduce associated adverse outcomes, typically by making untested modeling assumptions to justify interpreting association as causation. Yet, other studies have found that reducing particulate pollution dramatically, by as much as 70% and dozens of micrograms per cubic meter, has not detectably affected all-cause mortality rates even after decades, despite strong, statistically significant positive exposure concentration-response (C-R) associations between them (Zigler and Dominici 2014; see also Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-57358-4_17).","output":"How Do Exposure Estimation Errors Affect Estimated Exposure-Response Relations?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, in the city of Wuhan in China, a novel Coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, later called Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

While a digital revolution has allowed for open access to large datasets enabling real-time tracking of the epidemic, detailed, locally-specific clinical data has been less readily accessible to a broad range of academic faculty and their trainees. This perpetuates the separation of the primary missions of clinically-focused and primary research faculty resulting in lost opportunities for improved understanding of the local epidemic; expansion of the scope of scholarship; limitation of the diversity of the research pool; lack of creation of initiatives for growth and dissemination of research skills needed for the training of the next generation of clinicians and faculty.

Limited by the ability of the country or city in performing tests, the officially reported number of confirmed cases is expected to be much smaller than the true number of infected cases. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a new Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Confirmed-Removed (SEICR) model for predicting the spreading progression of COVID-19 with consideration of intercity travel and the difference between the confirmed cases and the actual infected cases, and to apply the model to provide realistic prediction for USA and Japan under different scenarios of active intervention. METHODS: The model introduces a new state variable corresponding to the actual number of infected cases, integrates intercity travel data to track the movement of exposed and infected individuals among cities, and allows different levels of active intervention to be considered so that realistic prediction of the number of infected individuals can be performed. Moreover, the model generates future progression profiles for different levels of intervention by setting the parameters relative to the values found from the data fitting. RESULTS: By fitting the model with the data of the COVID-19 infection cases and the intercity travel data for Japan (January 15 to March 20, 2020) and the USA (February 20 to March 20, 2020), model parameters are found and then used to predict the pandemic progression in 47 regions of Japan and 50 states (plus a federal district) in the USA. The model reveals that as of March 19, 2020, the number of infected individuals in Japan and the USA could be twenty-fold and five-fold as many as the number of confirmed cases, respectively. Results show that without tightening the implementation of active intervention, Japan and the USA will see about 6.55% and 18.% of the population eventually infected, and with drastic ten-fold elevated active intervention, the number of people eventually infected can be reduced by up to 95% in Japan and 70% in the USA. CONCLUSIONS: The new SEICR model has revealed the effectiveness of active intervention for control the spread of COVID-19. Stepping up active intervention would be more effective for Japan, while raising the level of vigilance of the public in maintaining personal hygiene and social distancing is comparatively more important for the USA.","output":"General Model for COVID-19 Spreading with Consideration of Intercity Migration, Insufficient Testing and Active Intervention: Application to Study of Pandemic Progression in Japan and USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated the effect of the personality factors, creativity, risk-taking, and locus of control, on the entrepreneurial intentions of U.S. business college students, employing the theoretical lens of the theory of planned behavior.

This study presents the current situation of coronavirus spread in India along with the impact of various measures taken for it. With the help of data sources (till 7th-8th April 2020) from various state units of India and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, this study presents various trends and patterns. This study answers six different research ques-tions in a comprehensive manner. It has been reported that growth rate of infected cases has been controlled with the help of National Lockdown, however some uncontrolled mass level events had negatively impacted the infected cases. With the help of exponential and polyno-mial regression modelling, the predictions of up to 75000 cases have been done by the end of April 2020. It has also been seen that there are some prominent clusters and patient nodes in the network of patients which are the major influencers for COVID-19 spread. Also, death rate case predictions have been done through multi-class classification models with an accuracy of 75%. At the end, strategies for continuation for lockdown has been discussed and presented. It appears that only essential services should be open for the citizens of India and the national lockdown should be carried on for next 2-4 weeks.

There is robust population-based data to show that women who have hypertension in pregnancy are much more likely to develop cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the postpartum period. Women with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP) are twice more at risk of heart disease and stroke, and four times more likely to develop hypertension after birth. Two out of three women who had HDP will die from CVD. Recent evidence suggests that young women with HDP develop signs of CVD in the immediate postpartum period, rather than several decades later as previously presumed. If confirmed, this concerning finding presents healthcare practitioners with an opportunity to influence womens cardiovascular health by advising on lifestyle choices and considering therapeutic interventions to prevent the development of CVD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This prospective cohort study design will ask approximately 300 participants to complete 3 days of home blood pressure monitoring every fortnight for 12 weeks postpartum and will culminate with a 24-hour episode of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring at 12 weeks postpartum. Women and healthcare professionals will complete questionnaires surrounding postpartum care for women who had HDP and knowledge of CVD risk. In addition, the relationship between hypertension and factors likely to influence outcomes such as severity of HDP, maternal age, body mass index and ethnicity will be analysed using logistic regression. Blood pressure and data from questionnaires will be analysed using descriptive statistics, with temporal stratification. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Research ethics approval was obtained from London-West London & GTAC Research Ethics Committee. Research outputs will be published and disseminated through midwifery, obstetric or general practitioner targeted academic journals.

CoronaVac (Sinovac Biotech, Beijing, China) is currently being used for mass vaccination in Thailand as well as other low-income countries. Three VOCs currently circulating within Thailand include the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), and B.1.617.2 (Delta) strains. We assessed NAb potency against the prototypic strain containing the original spike sequence (WT) compared to that against the 3 VOCs using sera derived from a cohort of healthcare workers who received a full 2-dose regimen of CoronaVac. Sera from two other cohorts consisting of COVID-19 patients who had been hospitalized in 2020 and 2021 were evaluated for comparison. We found that, despite equally robust production of S1-RBD-binding IgG and 100% seropositivity, sera from both CoronaVac vaccinees and naturally infected individuals had significantly reduced neutralizing capacity against all 3 VOCs compared to WT. Strikingly, NAb titers against Alpha and Beta were comparable, but Delta appears to be significantly more refractory to NAbs in all groups. Our results may help inform on CoronaVac NAb-inducing capacity, which is a proxy for vaccine efficacy, in the context of the WT strain and 3 VOCs. Our results also have critical implications for public health decision-makers who may need to maintain efficient mitigation strategies amid a potentially high risk for infection with VOCs even in those who have been previously infected.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern exhibit reduced sensitivity to live-virus neutralization in sera from CoronaVac vaccinees and naturally infected COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new pandemic classified by the World Health Organization and called COVID-19, is causing widespread respiratory infections and deaths in several countries on the five continents.

Reports indicate that the antibody (Ab) response in MM after 1 dose of SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine is attenuated. The impact of treatment on cellular immunity after vaccination remains unknown. Methods: We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding (anti-S) IgG level in 320 MM patients receiving SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccination. Blood and saliva were taken at multiple time points and compared with serology data of 69 age-matched vaccinated healthcare workers. We profiled SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in a subset of 45 MM patients and 12 age-matched healthy controls by flow cytometry and ELIspot. All subjects were enrolled in studies approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Results: The 320 patients (median age 68 year) received two-dose RNA vaccines (69.1% BNT162b2, 27.2% mRNA-1273). Median time to diagnosis was 60 months with a median of 2 prior treatment lines (range 0-16). We included 23 patients with smoldering MM. Patients received various treatments at vaccination with 148 (43.8%) on anti-CD38-containing treatment, 36 (11.3%) on BCMA-targeted therapy and 59 (18.4%) not on active treatment (incl. SMM patients). At the last available evaluation prior to vaccination, 131 (40.9%) exhibited a complete response. At data cutoff, a total of 260 patients (81.3%) had anti-S IgG measured >10 days after the second vaccine (median 51 days). Of these, 84.2% mounted measurable anti-S IgG levels (median 149 AU/mL). In the control group, Ab levels were significantly higher (median 300 AU/mL). Ab levels in the vaccinated MM patients with prior COVID-19 were 10-fold higher than those of patients without prior COVID-19 (p<0.001). Repeat Ab measurements up to 60 days after second vaccination confirm delayed and suboptimal IgG kinetics, particularly in patients receiving anti-MM treatment compared to controls (Figure 1). MM patients on active treatment had lower anti-S IgG levels (p=0.004) compared to patients not on therapy (median 70 vs 183 AU/mL). Notably, 41 patients (15.8%) failed to develop detectable anti-S IgG: 24/41 (58.5%) were on anti-CD38, 13/41 (31.7%) on anti-BCMA bispecific Ab therapy and 4/41 (9.8%) >3 months after CAR T. Univariate analysis showed an association of disease-related factors with absence of anti-S IgG: more previous lines of treatment (>3 lines, p=0.035; >5 lines, p=0.009), receiving active MM treatment (p=0.005), grade 3 lymphopenia (p=0.018), receiving anti-CD38 therapy (p=0.042) and receiving BCMA-targeted therapy (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis (corrected for age, vaccine type, lines of treatment, time since diagnosis, response status and lymphopenia) confirmed that anti-CD38 (p=0.005) and BCMA-targeted treatment (p<0.001) are associated with not developing detectable anti-S IgG. Clinical relevance is emphasized by 10 cases of COVID-19 after 1 (n=7) or 2 vaccine doses (n=3, all without anti-S IgG) with 1 patient passing due to respiratory failure. We studied SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses >2 weeks after the second vaccine in 18 MM patients with undetectable anti-S IgG (seronegative), 27 with detectable anti-S IgG (seropositive) and 12 healthy seropositive controls. We found that seropositive MM patients had CD4+CD154+ T cells producing IFNg, TNFa and IL-2 at similar levels as controls, whereas in the seronegative MM cohort CD4 T cell responses were significantly reduced (p<0.005). SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cell responses were overall weaker and not different across cohorts. This data suggests that absence of detectable IgG is associated with suboptimal response of humoral and cellular immunity. Conclusion: MM patients mount a suboptimal IgG response after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, with 15.8% of patients without detectable anti-S IgG. Ongoing analyses will highlight durability of serological protection against COVID-19. Additional data on T cell responses and immunophenotyping in the context of vaccination will be updated at the meeting. Implications are continuation of non-pharmacological interventions, e.g. masking/social distancing, for vulnerable patients. The findings underscore a need for serological monitoring of MM patients after vaccination and for trials assessing use of prophylactic strategies or studies exploring additional immunization strategies.

Methods: Thirty eyes of 30 patients newly diagnosed with OHT and 24 eyes of 24 healthy controls were included in this cross-sectional study. After a detailed ophthalmological examination, macular CT was measured with enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) (Cirrus HD-OCT, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany) at the fovea and at positions 500 , 1000 , 1500  nasal and temporal to the fovea. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the CT measurements between groups. The correlation between the mean deviation, pattern standard deviation, and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL) and CT was evaluated with the Spearman correlation coefficient. Statistical significance was accepted as p<0.05. Results: The mean CT in the OHT group was significantly thinner than that of the controls at locations 1000  (250.1369.53 vs 275.9247.34; p=0.02) and 1500 (236.0365.44 vs 265.4647.56; p=0.009) temporal to the fovea. The CT at the other measurement points was also thinner in eyes with OHT, but the difference failed to reach statistical significance. A moderately negative correlation was detected between the mean deviation and CT at locations 1000 (r=-0.42; p=0.03) and 1500 (r=-0.44; p=0.02) temporal to the fovea There was a moderate correlation between the average RNFL thickness and CT at locations 500 (r=0.44; p=0.03), 1000 (r=0.42; p=0.04) and 1500 (r=0.56; p=0.005) temporal to the fovea. Conclusion: In the present study, the macular CT was thinner in patients with OHT and this thinning was statistically significant at the temporal macula.

In Bangladesh, where the entire population is susceptible and strict lockdown has been relaxed (as of May 31st 2020) due to concerns over saving livelihoods, the best available resources and capacities in the country have to be mobilized for an integrated and adaptive response strategy. In this paper we argue that a suitable response strategy for a country with highly constrained health system, must consider how response components will be delivered at scale, along with what can be delivered. In order to save maximum number of lives, an optimal strategy will be one that is able to iteratively select the most feasible set of health response and the network of organizations that can deliver most effectively at scale. This might require thinking outside of the conventional vertical network of public health system. Given its history of high-capacity non-government organizations in Bangladesh, it is likely that there are multiple alternative horizontal network options for delivering any set of response interventions. In fact many horizontal networks are already actively engaged in COVID-19 response work. The goal should be to identify and coordinate these networks, create new networks, and embed mechanisms for scaling up what works and scaling down what does not work. For a rapidly escalating and unpredictable crisis such as COVID-19, an adaptive response strategy is needed which allows for old and new networks of organizations to align and work collectively with minimum loss of lives.","output":"An Adaptive Governance and Health System Response for the Covid-19 Emergency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic represents an enormous challenge.

Drawing on a sample of adults age 60 or older receiving Meals on Wheels/Grab and Go Meals in the state of Nebraska, this study investigates loneliness among rural and underserved older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys were distributed to 3725 meal recipients across Nebraskas eight Area Agencies on Aging in July 2020 (response rate = 50%), and a stratified random subsample was selected for preliminary analysis (N = 240). Logistic regression models were used to estimate the effects of COVID-19 and its associated safety precautions on loneliness. The findings reveal that 1 in 10 older adults have not left their home in over a month, and 38 percent feel lonelier due to the impact of COVID-19. Older adults who engaged in more community activities before the pandemic, reported leaving their home less, and experienced a longer absence of social interaction since the pandemic all had significantly increased odds of feeling lonelier in the COVID-19 era.

How to improve production performance under limited labor resources is an urgent problem for global manufacturing factories. This work studies an energy-efficient job-shop scheduling problem with limited workers. Those workers can have multiskills. A many-objective model with five objectives, that is: 1) makespan; 2) total tardiness; 3) total idle time; 4) total worker cost; and 5) total energy, is built. To solve this many-objective optimization problem (MaOP), a novel fitness evaluation mechanism (FEM) based on fuzzy correlation entropy (FCE) is adopted. Two construction methods for reference points are proposed to build the bridge between MaOP and a fuzzy set. Based on FCE and cluster methods, an environmental selection mechanism (ESM) is proposed to achieve a balance between solution convergence and diversity. With the proposed FEM and ESM, two many-objective evolutionary algorithms are proposed to solve MaOP. The effect of FCE-based FEM and ESM on the performance of algorithms is verified via experiments. The proposed algorithms are compared with four well-known peers to test their performance.

MethodsPlasma samples were collected from older adults (75-98 years) before and after three doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination, and from younger adults (18-74 years) post-dose two, for comparison. Antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2 antigens (spike protein [S], S-receptor binding domain [S-RBD], and nucleocapsid [N]) and functional activity against S were measured against the vaccine virus and variants of concern (VOC). ResultsVaccination induced greater antibody titers in older females than males, with both age and frailty associated with reduced antibody responses to vaccine antigens in males, but not females. ACE2 binding inhibition declined more than anti-S or anti-S-RBD IgG in the six months following the second dose (28-fold vs. 12- and 11-fold decreases in titer). The third dose restored functional antibody responses and eliminated disparities caused by sex, age, and frailty in older adults. Responses to the VOC were significantly reduced relative to the vaccine virus, with older males having lower titers to the VOC than females. Older adults had lower responses to the vaccine and VOC viruses than younger adults, with disparities being greater in males than females. ConclusionOlder and frail males may be more vulnerable to breakthrough infections due to low antibody responses before receipt of a third vaccine dose. Promoting third dose coverage in older adults, especially males, is crucial to protecting this vulnerable population.

In this study we aimed to investigate the impact of the first lockdown period (March-May 2020) on body weight (BW) and on body mass index (BMI) in both adults and adolescents (>16 years old). A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed?, Scopus?, Web of Science? and EMBASE? databases and 36 observational (35 cross-sectional and one cohort) studies were included. BW and BMI changes after/during the lockdown period were examined. BW was stated as increased in a significant part of the individuals (11.1-72.4%), although a range of 7.2-51.4% of individuals reported weight loss. A significant higher BW was observed with a weighted mean between-group difference (WMD) 1.57 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.14) in the post-lockdown period compared to the before lockdown time and higher BMI, 0.31 WMD (95% CI, 0.17 to 0.45) was identified before the lockdown period. At variance with general trends, one study in older adults (>60 years old) notably reported a significant BW loss, suggesting a higher risk for lockdown-induced weight loss and potentially malnutrition in the elderly population. Overall increments in BW are an alarming effect of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to potential higher incidence of overweight, obesity and related health-risks as well as other noncommunicable diseases.

Therefore, health systems should make strategic shifts to ensure that limited resources provide the highest benefit for COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the risk factors associated with poor in-hospital outcomes to help clinicians make better patient care decisions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study enrolled 176 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Demographic characteristics, clinical data, lymphocyte count, CT imaging findings on admission, and clinical outcomes were collected and compared. Two radiologists evaluated the distribution and CT features of the lesions and also scored the extent of lung involvement. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the optimum cutoff point for possible effective variables on patients outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the risk factors associated with ICU admission and in-hospital death. RESULT: Thirty-eight (21.5%) patients were either died or admitted to ICU from a total of 176 enrolled ones. The mean age of the patients was 57.5  16.1 years (males: 61%). The best cutoff point for predicting poor outcomes based on age, CT score, and O(2) saturation was 60 years (sensitivity: 71%, specificity: 62%), 10.5 (sensitivity: 73%, specificity: 58%), and 90.5% (sensitivity: 73%, specificity: 59%), respectively. CT score cutoff point was rounded to 11 since this score contains only integer numbers. Multivariable-adjusted regression models revealed that ages of  60 years, CT score of  11, and O(2) saturation of  90.5% were associated with higher worse outcomes among study population (odds ratio (OR): 3.62, 95%CI: 1.35C9.67, P = 0.019; OR: 4.38, 95%CI: 1.69C11.35, P = 0.002; and OR: 2.78, 95%CI: 1.03C7.47, P = 0.042, respectively).

BALB/c mice are routine laboratory animals used in influenza virus research, but the effects of H9N2 influenza virus on tissue distribution and expression pattern of IFITM in these mice are unknown. Here, we investigated the expression patterns and tissue distribution of IFITM1 and IFITM3 in BALB/c mice by infection with H9N2 AIV strains with only a PB2 residue 627 difference. The results showed that the expression patterns of ITITM1 and IFITM3 differ in various tissues of BALB/c mice at different time points after infection.

Binding of IFN to cell surface receptors triggers a signaling cascade in which the signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) plays a key role, ultimately leading to an antiviral state of the cell. In retaliation, many viruses counteract the immune response, often by the destruction and/or inactivation of STAT2, promoted by specific viral proteins that do not possess protease activities of their own. This review offers a summary of viral mechanisms of STAT2 subversion with emphasis on degradation. Some viruses also destroy STAT1, another major member of the STAT family, but most viruses are selective in targeting either STAT2 or STAT1. Interestingly, degradation of STAT2 by a few viruses requires the presence of both STAT proteins. Available evidence suggests a mechanism in which multiple sites and domains of STAT2 are required for engagement and degradation by a multi-subunit degradative complex, comprising viral and cellular proteins, including the ubiquitinCproteasomal system.

The majority of patients had scores with the normal range of depression and anxiety (70% and 57% respectively). The mean of EuroQol Group visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) score was 80.43 (SD=19.8). 156 (48.3%) out of 323 pwMS reported fatigue while the remainder had no fatigue (n=167, 51.7%). The results indicate that only 143 patients (44.3%) had participated in vigorous physical activity during the last 70 days, with a median of 3 days per week (IQR= 5C3) and a median of 60 minutes per day 0 (Interquartile range: IQR = 60C30). Only 149 patients (49.2%) had patricpated in moderate physical activities during the previous week with a median of 3 days per week (IQR = 5C3) and a median of 40 minutes per day (IQR = 60C30). 194 patients had participated in walking activities (60.0%) with a median of 5 days per week (IQR = 7C3) and a median of 45 minutes per day (IQR = 60C30). The results revealed that fatigue was positively correlated with depression (r = 0.407, p-value < 0.001) and anxiety (r = 0.289, p-value < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The current study shows depression, anxiety, and fatigue tend to be correlated and clustered together among pwMS in our cohort. However, fatigue is not associated with the intensity of physical activity undertaken. The results of this study are important for the improvement of the clinical management of MS patients.","output":"Fatigue, Depression, and Anxiety Among Ambulating Multiple Sclerosis Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"North Carolina employs 78,000+ migrant/seasonal farmworkers (MSFWs) annually. Arrival/departure dates are crop and weather dependent. MSFWs may be employed by a grower or a farm labor contractor (FLC). Like farmworker housing, FLCs may be registered or unregistered. Primary care or enabling services are provided by the NC Farmworker Health Program or community health centers that receive dedicated federal funding for MSFWs. The arrival of NC's growing season, MSFWs, and COVID-19 brought unforeseen challenges even to those experienced in caring for MSFWs. Challenges include congregate activities, consistency/accuracy of COVID-19 related communications, availability of alternate housing, barriers to testing and contact tracing, lack of internet connectivity in farmworker housing and insufficient personal protective equipment. Challenges are discussed in no order of occurrence or level of importance as many are inter-related. To meet these challenges, a migrant health and housing workgroup was convened. Members include the NC Department of Labor-Agricultural Safety and Health Bureau, NC Department of Health and Human Services - Communicable Disease Branch and NC Farmworker Health Program, NC Community Health Center Association and NC Agromedicine Institute.

Study design We conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study in Mexico. Method Adult pneumonia inpatients fulfilling suspected COVID-19 criteria, and hospital entry from March to August 2020, were enrolled. The Kaplan-Meier method was to use to compare survival estimates among patients with negative RT-qPCR nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs and those with a baseline positive test. Results Data from 64,624 individuals fulfilling suspected CoViD-19 criteria were analyzed and 1.6% of them had negative RT-qPCR tests. The overall mortality rate was higher among laboratory-positive patients (48.5% vs. 34.2%, p < 0.001) and, at any given threshold, the survival estimates were higher among RT-qPCR negative pneumonia inpatients. Conclusions The pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19 remains poorly understood and suspected cases with pneumonia and negative laboratory results represent a major challenge for healthcare systems. Our findings suggest that RT-qPCR negative inpatients may have an improved disease prognosis but the in-hospital mortality was still high among them.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has increased nurses' role expectations and imposed a heavy social responsibility. In particular, frontline nurses are under significant stress when caring for patients during a novel epidemic because of the lack of accurate information. METHODS: A total of 232 nurses with experience in providing care for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients from seven large hospitals in three cities in Korea completed the Perceived Stress Scale, Self-Efficacy Scale and Predictive Nursing Intention Scale. RESULTS: Multiple regression confirmed that completing COVID-19-related education and self-efficacy were significant predictors of nursing intentions during the current pandemic; the regression model explained 22.0% of the variance in nursing intentions. CONCLUSION: Stress did not affect frontline nurses' nursing intentions towards COVID-19 patient care, but completing COVID-19-related education and higher self-efficacy predicted improved nursing intentions. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nurse leaders should recognize that to improve nursing intentions during a novel infection outbreak, infection-related education should be provided and strategies to improve self-efficacy should be implemented.","output":"Intentions of frontline nurses regarding COVID-19 patient care: A cross-sectional study in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neisseria gonorrhoeae is an urgent public health threat due to rapidly increasing incidence and antibiotic resistance.

This enrichment holds true for LOF mutations in another efflux pump, farAB, and in urogenitally-adapted versus typical N. meningitidis, providing evidence for a model in which expression of these pumps in the female urogenital tract incurs a fitness cost for pathogenic Neisseria.

BACKGROUND Public health guidance for those aged 70 or older was predominantly to undertake stringent social distancing within their household. Little is known about older people's experience of these measures. This paper explores changes experienced by those over the age of 70 during the first two weeks of household isolation, social distancing and shielding in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, and their early perceptions and plans to support them through the pandemic. METHODS An inductive phenomenological study. University staff posted the study invitation flyer on social media, such as WhatsApp neighbourhood groups, the NextDoor App and twitter. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 19 participants and repeated at two week intervals for 10 weeks, further data collection is still in progress. This paper presents the findings from the baseline interviews, which showed older peoples' early responses. The COREQ (COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research) Checklist was adhered to in the reporting of this study. RESULTS Three themes emerged from older people's early experiences of social distancing: protective measures; current and future plans; and acceptance of a good life, but still a life to live. CONCLUSION People over 70 adapted to household isolation, social distancing and shielding, by using social media and neighbourhood resources. Nurses and other professionals can develop holistic care for older people by listening to their experiences of what works for them, helping them link to local and distant supports.

This meta-analysis aimed to demonstrate the significant effect of heat stress on broiler mass gain and immunoglobulin levels, which regulates the mortality rate of broilers. A total of 2,585 studies were downloaded from PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from January 1, 2015, to September 1, 2021. Eventually, 28 studies were selected based on specific criteria. The results for body mass gain, total mass of immune organs (thymus, spleen, and bursa of Fabricius), immunoglobulin (IgA, IgG, and IgM) levels, and mortality rate were analyzed using odds ratio or the random-effects model (REM) at a confidence interval (CI) of 95%. Compared to the control, heat stress significantly decreased body mass gain (10 trials: REM = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.21, 1.50). Compared to that in the control, heat stress significantly increased immunoglobulin levels: IgA (7 trials: REM = 1.69, 95% CI: 0.90, 3.16), IgG (6 trials: REM = 1.24, 95% CI: 0.85, 1.81), IgM (8 trials: REM = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.44, 1.08), and heat stress also increased the broiler mortality rate (6 trials: REM = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.27). However, there were no significant changes in the immune organs between the control and heat-stressed groups.

among racial and ethnic minorities. As a result, there is a need for data-driven approaches to pinpoint the unique constellation of clinical and social determinants of health (SDOH) risk factors that give rise to poor patient outcomes following infection in US communities. METHODS: We combined county-level COVID-19 testing data, COVID-19 vaccination rates and SDOH information in Tennessee. Between February and May 2021, we trained machine learning models on a semimonthly basis using these datasets to predict COVID-19 incidence in Tennessee counties. We then analyzed SDOH data features at each time point to rank the impact of each feature on model performance. RESULTS: Our results indicate that COVID-19 vaccination rates play a crucial role in determining future COVID-19 disease risk. Beginning in mid-March 2021, higher vaccination rates significantly correlated with lower COVID-19 case growth predictions. Further, as the relative importance of COVID-19 vaccination data features grew, demographic SDOH features such as age, race and ethnicity decreased while the impact of socioeconomic and environmental factors, including access to healthcare and transportation, increased. CONCLUSION: Incorporating a data framework to track the evolving patterns of community-level SDOH risk factors could provide policy-makers with additional data resources to improve health equity and resilience to future public health emergencies.","output":"Influence of social determinants of health and county vaccination rates on machine learning models to predict COVID-19 case growth in Tennessee"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Denervation of skeletal muscle is a debilitating consequence of injury of the peripheral nervous system, causing skeletal muscle to experience robust atrophy.

METHODS: The levels of peripheral lymphocyte subsets were measured by flow cytometry in 60 hospitalized COVID-19 patients before and after treatment, and their association with clinical characteristics and treatment efficacy was analyzed. RESULTS: Total lymphocytes, CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells decreased in COVID-19 patients, and severe cases had a lower level than mild cases. The subsets showed a significant association with inflammatory status in COVID-19, especially CD8(+) T cells and CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio. After treatment, 37 patients (67%) showed clinical response, with an increase in CD8(+) T cells and B cells. No significant change in any subset was detected in nonresponsive cases. In multivariate analysis, posttreatment decrease in CD8(+) T cells and B cells and increase in CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio were indicated as independent predictors of poor efficacy.

GOALS To identify prognostic factors including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) for overall survival and intrahepatic recurrence after RFA. PATIENTS AND METHODS Not only na?ve but also previously treated patients with solitary hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma <5 cm were prospectively enrolled and a 50% decrease from baseline to 1 month after RFA was defined as an initial AFP response. Tumor responses were assessed by the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors. RESULTS Among 255 patients, 156 patients (61.2%) developed intrahepatic recurrence. Radiologic progression occurred in 54.8% (86/157) in the AFP responders and 71.4% (70/98) in the AFP nonresponders. In multivariate analysis, a history of previous treatment [hazard ratio (HR), 2.037; P=0.015 for percutaneous ethanol injection vs. none; and HR, 2.642; P<0.001 for transarterial chemoembolization vs. none] and an initial AFP nonresponse (HR, 1.899; P<0.001) were independent predictors of accelerated progression after RFA. Moreover, those who had a history of previous treatment and did not achieve an initial AFP response had significantly unfavorable overall survival (HR, 3.581; P<0.001) and the increased risk of intrahepatic remote recurrence (HR, 5.385; P<0.001) compared with those with an initial AFP response and no history of previous treatment. CONCLUSIONS Biological response evaluation by the measurement of serial AFP levels is a useful predictor of overall survival and intrahepatic remote recurrence after RFA. Therefore, an initial AFP response may aid in determining the need of closer follow-up as a therapeutic response indicator of RFA.","output":"Initial Alpha-Fetoprotein Response Predicts Prognosis in Hepatitis B-related Solitary HCC Patients After Radiofrequency Ablation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent history, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the worst infectious disease outbreaks affecting humanity. The World Health Organization has defined the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic, and the massive growth of the number of infected cases in a short time has caused enormous pressure on medical systems. Mexico surpassed 3.7 million confirmed infections and 285,000 deaths on October 23, 2021. We analysed the spatio-temporal patterns of the COVID-19 epidemic in Mexico using the georeferenced confirmed cases aggregated at the municipality level. We computed weekly Morans I index to assess spatial autocorrelation over time and identify clusters of the disease using the flexibly shaped spatial scan approach. Finally, we compared Euclidean, cost, resistance distances and gravitational model to select the best-suited approach to predict inter-municipality contagion. We found that COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico is characterised by clusters evolving in space and time as parallel epidemics. The gravitational distance was the best model to predict newly infected municipalities though the predictive power was relatively low and varied over time. This study helps us understand the spread of the epidemic over the Mexican territory and gives insights to model and predict the epidemic behaviour.","output":"Spatiotemporal patterns of the COVID-19 epidemic in Mexico at the municipality level"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As clulas Natural Killer (NK) tm um papel definido na imunidade inata e adaptativa.

This research examines Organizational Culture during Crises (OCC) as an antecedent to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model to evaluate the factors that determine the intention to adopt a virtual classroom across multiple disciplines by the faculty of a reputed Indian university. Data collected from a sample of 353 respondents was analyzed to test the research model using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The findings of the study reveal that OCC plays a positive and significant role in determining the intention of faculties to adopt a virtual classroom. We also found that OCC also significantly influences performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions and social influence.

Among economic sectors, tourism is a very important industry that contributes greatly to GDP growth of the country in the current context. Forecasting tourism revenue is very important to have reasonable policies or decisions at the macro level. In fact, in this period, with new concepts of smart cities and smart communities, we experienced IoTs (internet of things) roles in developing and promoting our local and community tourism services very much. In the current context, digital transformation is an inevitable development trend. Currently, businesses that do not follow this trend will not be able to access new achievements and advancements and will find it difficult to participate in the new value chain that digital transformation brings. The article uses the method of analyzing and forecasting tourism industry revenue. This paper proposes a solution to apply an analysis and forecasting method through linear regression to forecast tourism revenue. To implement this method, the article collects and analyzes data, thereby proposing solutions to promote socio-economic development and tourism industry.

We performed semi-structured interviews of hospitals from four diverse health systems in the United States to understand determinants of adoption within a range of clinical settings. We used the diffusion of innovation theory to guide a framework analysis of the data. Of the 27 hospitalists invited, we performed 22 interviews from four hospitals of diverse types. Median years post-residency of interviewees was 10.5 [IQR:5-15]. Four main themes emerged: (1) There are important clinical advantages to LUS despite operator dependence, (2) LUS enhances patient and clinician experience, (3) Investment of clinician time to learn and perform LUS is a barrier to adoption but yields improved efficiency for the health system and (4) Mandated training and use may be necessary to achieve broad adoption as monetary incentives are less effective. Despite the perceived benefits of LUS for patients, clinicians and health systems, a significant barrier to broad LUS adoption is the experience of time scarcity by hospitalists. Future implementation strategies should focus on changes to the clinical environment that address clinician barriers to learning and adoption of new skills.","output":"Hospitalist Perceptions of Barriers to Lung Ultrasound Adoption in Diverse Hospital Environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Like many other countries, the Netherlands shut down large parts of economic and social life in the spring of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

While these regulations represented a sharp cut in individuals personal lives, they were more relaxed in the Netherlands than in many other European countries. At the same time, the Netherlands has enacted large-scale economic relief programs. This chapter gives an overview of how labor supply and well-being have changed in the Netherlands in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Owing to the limitations of post-mortem biopsies for evaluating cardiopulmonary events involving large vessels, we continuously improved the technique during this period. Objectives: To demonstrate the usefulness of an extended MIA-US technique (EMIA-US) for the study of thoracic involvement in COVID-19. METHOD: US-guided percutaneous tissue sampling was combined with a small thoracic incision (5 cm), allowing for the sampling of larger tissue samples or even the entire organ (lungs and heart). RESULTS: EMIA-US was performed for eight patients who died of COVID-19 in 2021. We demonstrate cardiopulmonary events, mainly thromboembolism and myocardial infarction, that could be evaluated using EMIA-US. CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive image-guided post-mortem tissue sampling is a flexible and practical method to conduct post-mortem studies of human diseases, mainly in areas that do not have autopsy facilities or, alternatively, when autopsy is not possible owing to financial constraints, cultural and religious values, or for safety reasons, such as in the case of highly contagious infectious diseases.

In the COVID-19 panorama, fractures occurring in infected older adults become an even more intricate task because of concomitant metabolic derangements due to SARS-CoV-2. Multidisciplinary protocols are mandatory and pharmacological treatment in infected patients should be tailored. Regrettably, the spread of the virus in northern Italy, has been faster than scientific progress in characterizing the disease and many hospitals have had to manage the symptoms on a daily clinical bases. Our Italian hospital in the region of Lombardy, which has been the epicenter of the Italian pandemic, has admitted sixteen patients with fractured femurs in March and April 2020. The first seven patients were treated with the antithrombotic prophylaxis of a single daily dose of low-molecular-weight heparin, but we observed the highest prevalence of deaths from cardiovascular complications (four deaths). By doubling the daily dose of anticoagulants in the subsequent patients, we observed a reduction in the incidence of death (one death out of nine). Controversies exist about the surgical treatment of fractures in older adults during this pandemic. However, we have observed an increased survival after fall trauma in infected older adults if treated with high doses of anticoagulant.

Online teaching has suddenly become the main form of medical education, a form that may be used as long as the pandemic continues. We aimed at analyzing how online teaching was perceived by both teachers and learners to help determine how to adapt curricula in the next few years. An anonymous cross-sectional survey of medical students, pediatric residents, neonatal fellows, and their respective teachers was conducted between June and August 2020 to assess feelings about quality, attendance, equivalence, and sustainability of online teaching programs. 146 Students and 26 teachers completed the survey. 89% of students agreed that the offered online teaching was an appropriate way of teaching during the pandemic. Less than half of learners and teachers felt they have received or provided a training of an equivalent level and quality as in usual courses. About one-third thought that this online teaching should continue after the crisis ends. Medical school students had significantly more mixed opinions on online teaching than residents and fellows did. Attendance of learners significantly improved with synchronous online classes (p < 0.001), and among more advanced learners (p < 0.002).

We show that the proposed model is capable of predicting Hopf bifurcation points for a wide range of physically realistic parameters for the COVID-19 disease. In this regard, the model predicts periodic behavior that emanates from one Hopf point. The model also predicts stable oscillations connecting two Hopf points.

There had been very limited research on the eating patterns of diabetic patients with employment, although working age population has seen the highest increase in diabetes incidence. This study aimed to identify workplace eating patterns in relation to glycaemic control among type 2 diabetic patients with employment. METHODS: This is a sequential mixed-methods study. The exploratory qualitative study involved focus group interviews with 31 type 2 diabetic patients with employment, which guided the design of a subsequent cross-sectional investigation involving 185 patients with employment. Thematic analysis was conducted on the qualitative data to identify workplace eating patterns most relevant to glycaemic control. Hierarchical multiple linear regression was performed to examine association between workplace eating pattern and glycaemic control, proxied by HbA1c. RESULTS: The focus group interviews identified frequency in the consumption of home-prepared meals (HPM) and meal hours as the major workplace eating patterns that affected glycaemic control. The cross-sectional study confirmed that regular consumption of HPM at workplace could explain variance of HbA1c, independent of socio-demographic factors, lifestyle factors and disease condition, with R(2) = 0.146, F(14, 170) = 2.075, p = 0.015; adjusted R(2) = 0.076. Patients who were female, in non-skilled occupation, on shift, with fixed work location and had break during work were more likely to consume HPM. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of HPM at workplace should be promoted to facilitate better glycaemic control by type 2 diabetic patients with employment, possibly through more practical dietary advice, and workplace accommodation in terms of space and facilities. In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, consumption of HPM also meant additional protection for diabetic patients through reducing close contact exposures in restaurants.","output":"Consumption of home-prepared meal at workplace as a predictor of glycated haemoglobin among people with type 2 diabetes in Hong Kong: a mixed-methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen En este texto se propone un esquema para analizar dilemas ticos en el contexto de la pandemia del Covid 19, los cuales se presentan ante un conflicto moral al que se enfrenta una persona (por criterios normativos en tensin) o, cuando varias personas o instancias normativas tienen distintas estrategias ante un evento especfico y, adems, cada quien asume que su postura es la ms aceptable.

Quality assurance (QA) teams of large and medium sized pharmaceutical companies generally conduct annual risk assessments of the PV system, based on retrospective review of data and pre-defined impact factors to plan for PV audits which require a high volume of manual work and resources. In addition, for companies of this size, auditing the entire \\"universe\\" of individual entities on an annual basis is generally prohibitive due to sheer volume. A risk assessment approach that enables efficient, temporal, and targeted PV audits is not currently available. METHODS In this project, we developed a statistical model to enable holistic and efficient risk assessment of certain aspects of the PV system. We used findings from a curated data set from Roche operational and quality assurance PV data, covering a span of over 8 years (2011-2019) and we modeled the risk with a logistic regression on quality PV risk indicators defined as data stream statistics over sliding windows. RESULTS We produced a model for each PV impact factor (e.g. 'Compliance to Individual Case Safety Report') for which we had enough features. For PV impact factors where modeling was not feasible, we used descriptive statistics. All the outputs were consolidated and displayed in a QA dashboard built on Spotfire?. CONCLUSION The model has been deployed as a quality decisioning tool available to Roche Quality professionals. It is used, for example, to inform the decision on which affiliates (i.e. pharmaceutical company commercial entities) undergo audit for PV activities. The model will be continuously monitored and fine-tuned to ensure its reliability.","output":"Using Statistical Modeling for Enhanced and Flexible Pharmacovigilance Audit Risk Assessment and Planning."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To apply rapid online surveying to determine the knowledge and perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with endometriosis in Turkey. METHODS: An online survey was conducted by the Turkish Endometriosis & Adenomyosis Society and administered to patients with endometriosis who agreed to participate in the study. The survey included 25 questions prepared by an expert committee of four professionals (two gynecologists and two endometriosis specialists). RESULTS: Of the 290 questionnaires sent out, 261 (90%) were returned. A total of 213 (83.86%) patients reported that they were afraid of having endometriosis-related problems during the pandemic period. In addition, 133 (53.63%) patients thought the management of their endometriosis was affected because of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Clinical studies clearly indicate that endometriosis is a condition associated with high levels of chronic stress. The COVID-19 pandemic has led the public to experience psychological problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder, psychological distress, depression, and anxiety. The majority of patients with endometriosis were afraid of having endometriosis-related problems during the pandemic period. The majority of elective endometriosis surgeries have not been postponed. Patients were highly aware of the pandemic and practiced social distancing and hygiene.

Embedded in the Changes in Integration for Social Decisions in Aging (CISDA) model, this study examined the role of (i) analytical reasoning; (ii) affect; and (iii) news consumption frequency, and their interplay with (iv) news content, in determining fake news detection in aging during the COVID-19 pandemic. Young (age range 18-35 years, M = 20.24, SD = 1.88) and older (age range 61-87 years, M = 70.51, SD = 5.88) adults were randomly assigned to view COVID or non-COVID news articles, followed by measures of analytical reasoning, affect, and news consumption frequency. Comparable across young and older adults, fake news detection accuracy was higher for news unrelated to COVID, and non-COVID fake news detection was predicted by individual differences in analytic reasoning. Examination of chronological age effects further revealed that detection of fake news among older adults aged over 70 years depended on interactions between individual CISDA components and news content. Collectively, these findings suggest that age-related susceptibility to fake news may only be apparent in later stages of older adulthood, but vulnerabilities are context dependent. Our findings advance understanding of psychological mechanisms in fake news evaluation and empirically support CISDA in its application to fake news detection in aging.","output":"Fake News Detection in Aging During the Era of Infodemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious diseases are highly contagious due to rapid transmission and very challenging to diagnose in the early stage.

METHODS A quantitative design was used to evaluate the effect of CT on academic performance by comparing examination scores and item difficulty values (IDVs) within a CT cohort (n = 111) and between the CT cohort and non-CT retrospective cohort (n = 105). A faculty-created survey was used to measure student-perceived satisfaction in the CT cohort. RESULTS Student examination scores increased after the CT experience on a duplicate unit examination. The IDVs on 8 content-specific duplicate final examination items 1 month after the CT experience were significantly increased. There were no significant differences in the IDVs on the 8 content-specific items between a CT and non-CT retrospective cohort.

FINDINGS: A prospective study was conducted in the Central African Republic (CAR) between January and December 2010 among infants and children aged 0C15 years attending sentinel sites for influenza-like illness or acute respiratory illness. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected, and one-step real-time and multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to detect respiratory viruses. Respiratory viruses were detected in 49 of the 329 (14.9%) nasopharyngeal samples: 29 (8.8%) contained influenza viruses (5 (1.5%) had pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus and 24 (7.3%) had influenza B viruses), 11 (3.3%) contained parainfluenza viruses types 1 and 3 and 9 (2.7%) contained human respiratory syncytial virus. Most cases were detected during the rainy season in the CAR. Analysis of the amplicon sequences confirmed the identity of each detected virus. CONCLUSIONS: The influenza surveillance system in the CAR has provided valuable data on the seasonality of influenza and the circulation of other respiratory viruses.

Clinical variables and some laboratory parameters were studied. The Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidity indices were calculated. The dependent variables were mortality and admission to the ICU. A descriptive and correlational analysis was performed. Logistic regression models and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were established. RESULTS Positive correlations were observed between age, creatinine, and D-dimer levels, as well as with the scores obtained with the Charlson and Elixhauser indices. Differences in the levels of these parameters were also observed when analyzing variables such as mortality, sex or admission to the ICU. Mortality was associated with high creatinine and D-dimer levels and advanced age. Survival curves indicated longer survival in patients not admitted to the ICU, admitted to the hospital during the week, and in those with lower creatinine and D-dimer levels.

The feasibility and effectiveness of the implementation of a patient-led AF screening program for older people are unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of an AF screening program comprising patient-led monitoring of single-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) with clinician-coordinated central monitoring to diagnose AF among community-dwelling people aged 75 years in Australia. METHODS: This is a nationwide randomized controlled implementation trial conducted via the internet and remotely among 200 community-dwelling adults aged 75 years with no known AF. Randomization will be performed in a 1:1 allocation ratio for the intervention versus control. Intervention group participants will be enrolled in the monitoring program at randomization. They will receive a handheld single-lead ECG device and training on the self-recording of ECGs on weekdays and submit their ECGs via their smartphones. The control group participants will receive usual care from their general practitioners for the initial 6 months and then commence the 6-month monitoring program. The ECGs will be reviewed centrally by trained personnel. Participants and their general practitioners will be notified of AF and other clinically significant ECG abnormalities. RESULTS: This study will establish the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing the intervention in this patient population. The primary clinical outcome is the AF detection rate, and the primary feasibility outcome is the patient satisfaction score. Other outcomes include appropriate use of anticoagulant therapy, participant recruitment rate, program engagement (eg, frequency of ECG transmission), agreement in ECG interpretation between the device automatic algorithm and clinicians, the proportion of participants who complete the trial and number of dropouts, and the impact of frailty on feasibility and outcomes. We will conduct a qualitative evaluation to examine the barriers to and acceptability and enablers of implementation. Ethics approval was obtained from the human research ethics committee at the University of Sydney (project number 2020/680). The results will be disseminated via conventional scienti?c forums, including peer-reviewed publications and presentations at national and international conferences. CONCLUSIONS: By incorporating an integrated health care approach involving patient empowerment, centralized clinician-coordinated ECG monitoring, and facilitation of primary care and specialist services, it is possible to diagnose and treat AF early to reduce stroke risk.

Strategies to lower blood pressure include lifestyle modifications and home blood pressure monitoring. Nonetheless, adherence to home blood pressure monitoring remains low. This protocol details an algorithm for remote management of primary care patients with hypertension. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether wireless home blood pressure monitoring with or without financial incentives is more effective at reducing systolic blood pressure than nonwireless home blood pressure monitoring (usual care). METHODS: This study was designed as a randomized controlled open-label superiority study. A sample size of 224 was required to detect differences of 10 mmHg in average systolic blood pressure. Participants were to be randomized, in the ratio of 2:3:3, into 1 of 3 parallel study arms :(1) usual care, (2) wireless home blood pressure monitoring, and (3) wireless home blood pressure monitoring with financial incentives. The primary outcome was the mean change in systolic blood pressure at month 6. The secondary outcomes were the mean reduction in diastolic blood pressure, cost of financial incentives, time taken for the intervention, adherence to home blood pressure monitoring, effectiveness of the framing of financial incentives in decreasing nonadherence to blood pressure self-monitoring and the adherence to antihypertensive medication at month 6. RESULTS: This study was approved by SingHealth Centralised Institutional Review Board and registered. Between January 24, 2018 and July 10, 2018, 42 participants (18.75% of the required sample size) were enrolled, and 33 participants completed the month 6 assessment by January 31, 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Due to unforeseen events, the study was stopped prematurely; therefore, no results are available. Depending on the blood pressure information received from the patients, the algorithm can trigger immediate blood pressure advice (eg, Accident and Emergency department visit advice for extremely high blood pressure), weekly feedback on blood pressure monitoring, medication titration, or skipping of routine follow-ups. The inclusion of financial incentives framed as health capital provides a novel idea on how to promote adherence to remote monitoring, and ultimately, improve chronic disease management.

However, these parameters have not been observed consistently across studies. The aim of this review was to assess clinical laboratory parameters which may serve as markers or predictors of severe or critical COVID-19 disease Methods: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL and Google Scholar databases from 2019 through April 18, 2020, and reviewed bibliographies of eligible studies, relevant systematic reviews, and the medRxiv pre-print server. We included hospital-based observational studies reporting clinical laboratory parameters of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and excluded studies having large proportions (>10%) of children and pregnant women. Two authors independently carried out screening of articles, data extraction and quality assessment. Meta-analyses were done using random effects model. Meta-median difference (MMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each laboratory parameter. Results: Forty-five studies in 6 countries were included. Compared to non-severe COVID-19 cases, severe or critical COVID-19 disease was characterised by higher neutrophil count (MMD: 1.23 [95% CI: 0.58 to 1.88] x109 cells/L), and lower lymphocyte and CD4 counts with MMD (95% CI) of -0.39 (-0.47, -0.31) x109 cells/L and -204.9 (-302.6, -107.1) cells/l, respectively. Other notable results were observed for C-reactive protein (MMD: 36.97 [95% CI: 27.58, 46.35] mg/L), interleukin-6 (MMD: 17.37 [95% CI: 4.74, 30.00] pg/ml,), Troponin I (MMD: 0.01 [0.00, 0.02] ng/ml), and D-dimer (MMD: 0.65 [0.45, 0.85] mg/ml). Conclusions and Relevance: Relative to non-severe COVID-19, severe or critical COVID-19 is characterised by increased markers of innate immune response, decreased markers of adaptive immune response, and increased markers of tissue damage and major organ failure. These markers could be used to recognise severe or critical disease and to monitor clinical course of COVID-19.","output":"Clinical Laboratory Parameters Associated with Severe or Critical Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of elegant and numerous microfluidic manipulations has enabled significant advances in the processing of small volume samples and the detection of minute amounts of biomaterials. Effective isolation of single cells in a defined volume as well as manipulations of complex bioparticle or biomolecule mixtures allows for the utilization of information-rich detection methods including mass spectrometry, electron microscopy imaging, and amplification/sequencing. The art and science of translating biosamples from microfluidic platforms to highly advanced, information-rich detection system is the focus of this review, where we term the translation between the microfluidics elements to the external world off-chipping. When presented with the challenge of presenting sub-nanoliter volumes of manipulated sample to a detection scheme, several delivery techniques have been developed for effective analysis. These techniques include spraying (electrospray, nano-electrospray, pneumatic), meniscus-defined volumes (droplets, plugs), constrained volumes (narrow channels, containers), and phase changes (deposition, freezing). Each technique has been proven effective in delivering highly defined samples from microfluidic systems to the detection elements. This review organizes and presents selective publications that illustrate the advancements of these delivery techniques with respect to the type of sample analyzed, while introducing each strategy and providing historical perspective. The publications highlighted in this review were chosen due to their significance and relevance in the development of their respective off-chip technique.

For this reason, the present study investigates the impact of attitudes on TA behavior in 382 adolescents by gender and extent of technology use. Three scales were used to determine adolescents TA awareness, attitude, and behavior. The results of the dual-moderated mediation model show that gender and duration of technology use (h) moderated the full mediation of attitude on awareness and behavior in TA (F = 39.29, df = 9;372, p < .01). The indirect effect in males with 16.04 h per day of technology use is stronger (.24) than the indirect effect in males with 4.90 h per day of technology use (.13). In addition, the simple slope plot shows that when attitude scores increase, addictive behavior rises in females (simple slope = .74, t = 8.79, p < .01). On the other hand, with 16.04 h per day of technology use, when attitude scores decrease, addictive behavior rises in females (simple slope = .69, t = 7.59, p < .01). Furthermore, when the attitude scores increase, addictive behavior rises in males (simple slope = .85, t = 13.26, p < .01). As a result, the psychoeducational intervention programs to be implemented for TA should not only focus on awareness, but should also encompass behavioral, cognitive and lifestyle changes.","output":"Technology addiction of adolescents in the COVID-19 era: Mediating effect of attitude on awareness and behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Feline infectious peritonitis and other coronavirus infections of cats are briefly reviewed.

The effect of this pandemic on a subspecialty academic practice is presented. We used a data-driven approach to monitor the changing workloads in a granular fashion and dynamically adjust the scheduling of faculty and histology staff accordingly to minimize the number of people present on-site. At the peak of the pandemic locally, the main hospital in our health system had 450 COVID-positive inpatients. The surgical pathology specimen volume dropped to 13% of the pre-pandemic levels, and this occurred about 2 weeks before the peak of the inpatient census; cytology specimens (the majority of which are outreach gynecological) dropped to approximately 5% of the pre-pandemic volume, 4 weeks before the peak inpatient census. All of the surgical subspecialty services showed a significant decrease in volume, with hematopathology being the least affected (dropped to 30% of the pre-pandemic level). The genitourinary surgical subspecialty service (predominantly prostate and bladder biopsies) was the most affected (dropped to 1% of the pre-pandemic level) but was fastest to return as clinical operations began to return to normal. The only specimen type which showed a significant increase in turnaround time during the pandemic was our gynecologic cytology specimens and that occurred as the specimen volume returned. This was due to stay-at-home directives for the cytotechnologists and the fact that some of them were retasked to participate in our SARS-CoV-2 testing.","output":"An Analysis of the Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Case Volumes in an Academic Subspecialty-Based Anatomic Pathology Practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic, with the coronavirus disease spreading worryingly fast.

However, laparoscopic total gastrectomy is developing relatively slowly because of technical difficulties, particularly in esophagojejunostomy. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 83 patients with early gastric cancer in the upper portion of the stomach who underwent laparoscopic total gastrectomy between April 2007 and March 2016. We classified the patients into three periods, mainly on the basis of the esophagojejunostomy procedures performed: first period, various conventional procedures based on the physicians' choice (n=14); second period, transoral method (n=51); and third period, fully intracorporeal technique (n=18). We evaluated the clinical impact of a stepwise introduction of unfamiliar new methods during laparoscopic total gastrectomy. RESULTS Between the first and second periods, there were significant differences in the blood loss volume, number of harvested lymph nodes, frequency of conversion to open surgery, and postoperative hospital stay. The number of harvested lymph nodes was significantly higher in the third than in the second period, with no detriment to other intraoperative or postoperative factors. CONCLUSION The use of a unified surgical method for esophagojejunostomy seems to be the key to a successful and advantageous laparoscopic total gastrectomy. Stepwise introduction of a well-established technique of esophagojejunostomy during laparoscopic total gastrectomy will benefit patients, as shown, for example, by the higher number of dissected lymph nodes in the present study.

Recently, the cardiological effects of the virus have also been striking. To the best of our knowledge, there are no SARS CoV-2 positive paediatric cases reported with sinus bradycardia in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION: A 14-year-old male patient presented with complaints of abdominal pain and fatigue. The heart rate of the patient, whose grandmother was found to be positive for SARS CoV-2 test, ranged between 43 and 60/min, the heart sounds were normal. There was no known history of cardiological disorder in the patient and his family. His laboratory findings were; normal Troponin I, elevated C Reactive protein, normal Haemoglobin, normal CK-MB, mildly elevated D-Dimer. Electrocardiography of the patient was evaluated as sinus bradycardia. There was no pathological finding in his echocardiography. The SARS CoV-2 PCR test was positive. In his follow-up, the heart rate decreased to 50 beats per minute while awake and 43 beats per minute while sleeping. The patient had a bradycardic course until the 4th day of hospitalisation. Control SARS CoV-2 PCR test was negative. He was discharged on the 8th day. CONCLUSION: It's understood that SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for multiple cardiac manifestations. The most common bradyarrhythmia associated with SARS CoV-2 reported worldwide is sinus bradycardia and complete heart block.

To construct the lipid raft model, the surface pressure ()Cmolecular area (A) and surface potential (V)CA isotherms for three-component (PSM/DOPC/CHOL) systems on 0.02 M Tris buffer with 0.13 M NaCl (pH 7.4) were primarily measured by changing their compositions. Thermodynamic and interaction parameters for binary PSM/DOPC and PSM/CHOL systems revealed that PSM interacts more strongly with CHOL than with DOPC. In addition, a morphological analysis performed with Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) and fluorescence microscopy (FM) revealed an optimal ratio of PSM/DOPC/CHOL (1/1/1, by mole) as a model of lipid rafts. Second, the interaction of GC with the ternary PSM/DOPC/CHOL monolayers was investigated on Tris buffer solutions containing different GC concentrations (1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 M). In BAM and FM images, microdomains were found to become smaller by increasing the GC concentration in the subphase, suggesting that GC regulates the size of raft domains, which provide dynamic scaffolding for numerous cellular processes. More interestingly, the distinctive GC striped regions were formed at the interface at 50 M, which shows that GC divides the ternary monolayer into pieces. This phenomenon was observed only in the presence of CHOL in the monolayer. These results suggest that CHOL plays an essential role in the interaction with GC, which results in one of the major activities associated with saponins' membrane disruption.","output":"Investigation of interfacial behavior of glycyrrhizin with a lipid raft model via a Langmuir monolayer study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Understanding the characteristics of the Covid-19 pandemic in different geographical regions, ethnic and socioeconomic settings are of emerging importance. This study presents the demographic and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in a large private healthcare center in Santiago, Chile, during the first month of the pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed the demographics, laboratory and clinical characteristics including severity and outcome of all patients diagnosed with Covid-19 during the first month of the pandemic. SARS-2-CoV infection was confirmed by RT-PCR in nosopharyngeal samples. The primary outcome was a composite of ICU admission or all-cause, in-hospital mortality. Clinical and laboratory parameters of hospitalized patients were analyzed regarding their association with the primary outcome. RESULTS: From March 3 to April 4, 2020, 3679 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in our hospital. Of those, 381 had Covid-19 and were included into this analysis. Most patients (99.2%) were Chileans, 12% returning from recent travel. The median age was 39 years (IQR 31-49) and 52% were female. A total of 88 patients (23.1%) were hospitalized; 18 (3.7%) required ICU and/or died. The overall mortality was 0.7%. Increased body mass index (BMI) and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were independently associated with ICU care or death. CONCLUSION: During the first weeks of the pandemic in Chile, most Covid-19 patients were young, with low rates of hospitalization, ICU requirement, and fatality.

The timing of this study intersected with the beginning of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that required strict social distancing and hospital visitor policy changes. This study aims to answer the primary research question: What is the level and nature of stress experienced by caregivers of persons with newly-acquired stroke in the inpatient rehabilitation setting and how has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the caregiver experience? METHODS: Recruitment occurred from a single inpatient rehabilitation facility. Participants were administered the Perceived Stress Scale and then completed qualitative semistructured interviews. The investigators used a phenomenological, iterative approach to collect and analyze qualitative data. The data were independently coded and categorized before consolidated into primary themes and subthemes. RESULTS: Eleven informal caregivers' perspectives generated 13 subthemes across 4 primary thematic categories: COVID-19 impact, concerns of the caregiver, coping strategies, and important aspects of the caregiver experience. COVID-19 social distancing necessitated new visitor policies, which presented additional challenges for caregivers.

In this study, viral whole genome sequencing was performed on 133 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples collected between March 2020 and January 2021. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted to evaluate the genomic diversity of circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Cyprus. 15 different lineages were identified that clustered into three groups associated with the spring, summer and autumn/winter wave of SARS-CoV2 incidence in Cyprus, respectively. The majority of the Cypriot samples belonged to the B.1.258 lineage first detected in September that spread rapidly and largely dominated the autumn/winter wave with a peak prevalence of 86% during the months of November and December.

However, although the IR and IGF-1R signaling pathways are activated by insulin or IGF-1 in swine testis cells, they are not triggered upon TGEV infection. AG1024, therefore, inhibits coronaviral replication and downregulates JAK1 protein levels independently of IR and IGF-1R. Moreover, JAK1 proteolysis caused by AG1024 was found through activation of upstream Ndfip1/2 and its effector NEDD4-like E3 ligase Itch. In addition, ouabain, which was reported to mediate JAK1 proteolysis causing anti-coronaviral activity by activation of Ndfip1/2 and NEDD4 E3 ligase, additively inhibited anti-coronaviral activity and JAK1 diminishment in combination with AG1024.

There are advantages and disadvantages in being a small nation amidst this crisis. The centralized public health administration means that small countries are faster at adapting as they learn and evolve on a weekly basis. However, small countries tend to be dependent on their bigger neighbours, and the networks they belong to, for trade, food, medical supplies as well as policies. The risk threshold taken by a small country for the transition strategy has to be less than that taken by a bigger country because if things go wrong in a border region, there is less resilience in a small country, with immediate impact on the whole country. The blow to the tourism industry, which plays a main role especially in small countries, negatively impacted the economy, and it has been a feat to reach a balance between allowing the flow of inbound tourists and keeping the local infection rates under control.","output":"Managing COVID-19 in four small countries: Initial response to the pandemic in San Marino, Montenegro, Malta and Cyprus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was isolated from the respiratory samples of patients with pneumonia as showed by the sequence analysis of the virus genomes obtained in Wuhan, China. The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood yet, but the availability of sensitive and specific serological assays will be crucial for the early diagnosis of infection, for epidemiological studies and for defining the presence of neutralizing antibodies in response to a possible vaccine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested and compared the performances of one chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA), two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). RESULTS: The ECLIA serological assay performed best and may be a valid screening method for SARS-COV-2 infection. The IgA detected by the ELISA assay might be a more reliable and stable early serological marker than IgM. Instead, IgGs, as expected, showed stable level after 10 days from symptoms onset. CONCLUSION: The ECLIA method could be used as screening test, considering both the excellent performance and the cost per single test; while ELISA assay for IgG and IgA, which are present at a higher level than IgM and last longer, might be used as confirmatory test.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection serology validation of different methods: Usefulness of IgA in the early phase of infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Structural and biochemical studies of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins and complexes with highly potent antibodies have revealed multiple conformation-dependent epitopes highlighting conformational plasticity of spike proteins and capacity for eliciting specific binding and broad neutralization responses. In this study, we used coevolutionary analysis, molecular simulations, and perturbation-based hierarchical network modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with a panel of antibodies targeting distinct epitopes to explore molecular mechanisms underlying binding-induced modulation of dynamics and allosteric signaling in the spike proteins. Through coevolutionary analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, we identified highly coevolving hotspots and functional clusters that enable a functional cross-talk between distant allosteric regions in the SARS-CoV-2 spike complexes with antibodies. Coarse-grained and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations combined with mutational sensitivity mapping and perturbation-based profiling of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) complexes with CR3022 and CB6 antibodies enabled a detailed validation of the proposed approach and an extensive quantitative comparison with the experimental structural and deep mutagenesis scanning data. By combining in silico mutational scanning, perturbation-based modeling, and network analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer complexes with H014, S309, S2M11, and S2E12 antibodies, we demonstrated that antibodies can incur specific and functionally relevant changes by modulating allosteric propensities and collective dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. The results provide a novel insight into regulatory mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins showing that antibody-escaping mutations can preferentially target structurally adaptable energy hotspots and allosteric effector centers that control functional movements and allosteric communication in the complexes.","output":"Integrated Biophysical Modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Binding and Allosteric Interactions with Antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since 2000 we have witnessed global pandemics and public health emergencies of international concern.

OBJECTIVE: This research explored how the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the food supply of two food pantries. METHODS: A case study approach was applied to collect data during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Food supply data was collected weekly at two food pantries in Southwest Montana for 17 weeks in 2020. Surveys and interviews were conducted with food pantry clients and staff, respectively. Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics were applied to analyze quantitative data. Food supply data was analyzed using the Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015), NOVA system, and UP3 Framework. Thematic analysis was applied to qualitative data. RESULTS: The food boxes collected between the two food pantries (n = 43) had a mean Total HEI-2015 score of 76.41 (SD = 7.37) of a possible score of 100. According to both the NOVA and the UP3 Framework, 23.4% of the total food distributed was ultra-processed food (UPF). Of the food distributed, 50.0% and 48.3% was fresh, unprocessed food according to NOVA and UP3 Frameworks, respectively. From staff interviews, three themes arose that describe the food pantry operations that experienced change during the COVID-19 pandemic including: Food Procurement, Distribution Preparation, and Food Distribution. Nine supporting subthemes describing the causes and consequences of the operational themes were identified. Staff perceived that the nutrient quality of the food boxes increased from food distributed previous to the COVID-19 pandemic whereas over a third (39.4%) of food pantry clients that responded to surveys preferred the food box model. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic caused enormous operational challenges within food pantries.

The Child- Turcotte-Pugh class (CTP class) and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score are two important prognostic indicators for cirrhosis, while sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) is a dynamic score for the assessment of critically ill patients. Patients with liver disease with advanced CTP class and higher MELD scores have poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of electroencephalography (EEG) in cirrhotic patients requiring ventilator support for hepatic encephalopathy Grade III-IV. Methods A retrospective study was conducted on patients admitted to the liver intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary teaching institute. EEG records of 92 patients with Grade III-IV hepatic encephalopathy who were admitted between April 2015 and May 2017 to the liver ICU were analyzed. The correlation between EEG findings and 28-day mortality, ICU length of stay, and the number of days on mechanical ventilation was determined. Results Seventy-eight of 92 patients (85%) exhibited bilateral slowing EEG pattern, suggestive of encephalopathy. A triphasic pattern was the most common EEG abnormality in 40% (31 of 78) of the patients. Patients with abnormal EEG had a significantly higher MELD score compared to those with a normal EEG (P=0.02). There were no significant differences in length of mechanical ventilation between both groups, but an increasing trend was observed in those with abnormal EEG (P=0.09).

We used a demographic questionnaire, the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R), and the abbreviated version of the UCLA Loneliness Scale. The mean score of the participants on the SCL-90-R was 1.14 (SD = .78), and 16% of the participants scored 1 standard deviation above the mean. Some groups, including women and students, showed more severe psychological symptoms. The obsessive-compulsiveness, interpersonal sensitivity, and depression subscales had the highest three mean scores. We compared the SCL-90-R scores to previous study results and found a significant increase during the pandemic. Finally, individual stressors, COVID-19-related stressors, and perceived loneliness were found to be significant predictors, explaining 31% of the variance in psychological symptoms. Although collecting data online through self-report inventories limits the generalizability of the results, this study has important implications.

We conduct these analyses using cell phone location tracking data on daily visits to 230,403 U.S.-based community establishments that are colocated with chain establishments affiliated with 319 national brands. We disentangle the effects of social learning from confounding factors by using an instrumental variables strategy that relies on local variation in community establishments' exposure to closure decisions made by brands at the national level.

NLX-112 displays robust analgesic activity in a number of rodent models of pain, and is currently developed as a treatment for l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Noteworthy, PD patients can suffer from comorbid chronic pain, thus necessitating the use of analgesic drugs, such as opioids, which have potential for misuse. Additionally, dopamine agonists used to treat PD can produce cocaine-like effects in preclinical assays of misuse potential. The present study investigated whether NLX-112 possesses misuse potential of its own using two behavioural assays routinely used for this purpose: intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) in rats, and cocaine discrimination in macaque monkeys. In rats, low doses of NLX-112 (0.03 and 0.1a?mg/kg p.o.) did not alter ICSS frequency-rate curves, while higher doses (0.3 and 1.0a?mg/kg) shifted the curve to the right and flattened it, i.e., reduced ICSS. As expected, cocaine (10a?mg/kg i.p.) shifted the curve to the left, i.e., facilitated ICSS, but NLX-112 (0.03 and 0.1a?mg/kg p.o.) did not further enhance cocaine-induced facilitation of ICSS. In monkeys trained to discriminate cocaine (0.4a?mg/kg i.m.) from saline, NLX-112 (0.01-0.1a?mg/kg p.o.) did not substitute for cocaine. Taken together, these results suggest that NLX-112, at doses displaying anti-dyskinetic activity in rat, marmoset and macaque models of LID, is free from misuse potential. From a translational perspective, this is a desirable property for a compound destined to be used in PD patients, who can suffer from comorbid chronic pain necessitating the use of potentially misused analgesic drugs.","output":"NLX-112, a highly selective 5-HT1A receptor biased agonist, does not exhibit misuse potential in male rats or macaques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physical activity (PA) and sports are efficient ways to promote the younger generations health and wellbeing.

Differences in HRQoL due to gender, existence of comorbidities, and number of chemotherapy cycles are little explored in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) survivors. Our objective was to investigate whether differences in HRQoL in function of these factors exist 1 year after the diagnosis of DLBCL. One hundred and one patients, enrolled in the RT3 (Real-Time Tailored Therapy) Study, answered self-administrated European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), EORTC High-Grade Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL-HG29), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Post Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI), and Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) questionnaires. Adjusted means of scores were calculated in multivariate linear regression models. Fifty-seven survivors (mean age of 58.5 years) answered all questionnaires. Women have significantly higher scores of posttraumatic growth and lower physical functioning than men (P < 0.04). Survivors with comorbidities have increased physical fatigue and symptom burden, increased emotional impact, mental fatigue and depression, and reduced physical functioning and global health status (all P < 0.05). A greater number of cycles of chemotherapy increase the level of symptoms (pain, neuropathy, and dyspnoea; P < 0.05). The various aspects related to HRQoL should be discussed with DLBCL patients and investigated, with the aim of developing strategies to ensure appropriate psychosocial and supportive care and to improve the HRQoL in these patients.

Specifically, two diffusion processes are proposed whose mean functions obey multi-sigmoidal Gompertz and Weibull-type patterns. Both are constructed by introducing polynomial functions in the ordinary differential equations that originate the classical Gompertz and Weibull curves. The estimation of the parameters is approached by maximum likelihood. Various associated problems are analyzed, such as the determination of initial solutions for the necessary numerical methods in practical cases, as well as Bayesian methods to determine the degree of the polynomial. Additionally, strategies are suggested to determine the best model to fit specific data. A practical case is developed from data originating from several Spanish regions during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. The determination of the inflection time instants, which correspond to the peaks of infection and deaths, is given special attention.

We describe the frequency, types, and duration of post-discharge symptoms suggestive of PCS among previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a treatment center in Nigeria. We conducted a retrospective review of admission and post-discharge follow-up medical records of COVID-19 survivors admitted between April and December 2020. A standardized checklist was used to document post-discharge symptoms. PCS was defined as persisting or new post-discharge symptoms lasting at least 3 weeks after initial COVID-19 symptoms. The relationship between study variables and development of PCS was ascertained by univariate analysis. Thirty of 51 previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients (median age, 46 years; male, 66.7%) were studied. Seventeen (56.7%) of the 30 patients developed features suggestive of PCS. Approximately three post-discharge symptoms were reported per patient over a follow-up period of ranging from 3 weeks to 9 months after initial COVID-19 symptoms. Cough, fatigue, and dyspnea were the most common post-discharge symptoms reported. A few patients had symptoms suggestive of thrombosis and COVID-19 reinfection. Among all study variables, baseline COVID-19 severity was the only significant variable associated with the development of PCS. PCS is common in our setting and is characterized by multisystemic signs and symptoms that require vigilance by clinicians for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

We study the role of socioeconomic factors in the concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the expectations of social changes on a post-pandemic future. The analysis is performed by collecting 22 indicators from a sample of 4,395 adults in Chile. The analysis is performed first by descriptive statistics, then by fusing the indictors into three latent variables, and finally by modelling each indicator as a separate choice. We find that lower-income people are significantly more worried about a range of financial and health issues arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, including concerns about being infected by the virus, losing their job and not being able to pay debts. The concern about facing a large economic crisis is significantly larger in the extremes, i.e., for low- and high-income groups. Age, gender, having a university degree, the possibility of working from home, and the general health status also influence the fears related to the COVID-19 pandemic. From a policy point of view, we conclude that strong policy interventions are necessary to reduce the uneven negative effects of COVID-19 in society, including material and mental health problems.

Despite the existence of effective treatment, undiagnosed OSA remains a challenge. The gold standard diagnostic tool is polysomnography (PSG), yet the test is expensive, labour intensive and time-consuming. Home-based, limited channel sleep study testing (levels 3 and 4) can advance and widen access to diagnostic services. This systematic review aims to summarise available evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of limited channel tests compared to laboratory and home PSG in diagnosing OSA. METHODS Eligible studies will be identified using a comprehensive strategy across the following databases from inception onwards: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, SCOPUS, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Emcare and Web of Science Core Collection and ProQuest databases. The search will include a full economic evaluation (i.e. cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, cost-benefit, cost-consequences and cost-minimisation analysis) that assesses limited channel tests and PSG. Two reviewers will screen, extract data for included studies and critically appraise the articles for bias and quality. Meta-analyses will be conducted if aggregation of outcomes can be performed. Qualitative synthesis using a dominance ranking matrix will be performed for heterogeneous data. DISCUSSION This systematic review protocol uses a rigorous, reproducible and transparent methodology and eligibility criteria to provide the current evidence relating to the clinical and economic impact of limited channel and full PSG OSA diagnostic tests.

The article describes in detail theoretical approaches to the analysis of the spread of social diseases and discusses methodological limitations that reduce the possibility of predicting such phenomena and affect decision-making by the authorities. At the same time, we believe that for most regions, including Moscow, until May 12, 2020, the dynamics of confirmed cases are a reduced and delayed reflection of actual processes. Thus, the introduced self-isolation regime in Moscow and other agglomerations affected the decrease in the number of newly confirmed cases two weeks after its introduction. In accordance with our model, at the first stage, carriers infected abroad were concentrated in regions with large agglomerations and in coastal and border areas with a high intensity of internal and external links. Unfortunately, the infection could not be contained, and it started growing exponentially across the country. By mid-April 2020, cases of the disease were observed in all Russian regions; however, the remotest regions least connected with other parts of Russia and other countries had only isolated cases. By mid-May, at least in Moscow, the number of new cases began to decline, which created the prerequisites for reducing restrictions on the movement of residents. However, the decrease in the number of new cases after passing the peak of the epidemic in May is slower than the increase at the beginning. These facts contradict the diffusion model; thus, the model is not applicable for epidemiological forecasts based on empirical data. Using econometric methods, it is shown that for different periods of diffusion, various characteristics of the regions affect the spread of the disease. Among these features we note the high population density in cities, proximity to the largest metropolitan areas, higher proportion of the most active and frequently traveling part of the population (innovators, migrants), and intensive ties within the community, as well as with other regions and countries. The virus has spread faster in regions where the population has a higher susceptibility to diseases, which confirms the importance of the regions health capital.

BACKGROUND In response to the public health measures in Hawaii to curtail the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, Hawaii Pacific Neuroscience (HPN) adapted their patient care to ensure continuity of neurological treatment. METHODS The telephone survey was conducted on patients seen at HPN during the period of April 22, 2020-May 18, 2020 to address four areas related to patients' outpatient experience: delivery of care, general well-being, experience with telemedicine, and disease-specific questions. RESULTS A total of 928 patients were contacted of which 429 (46.2%) patients responded and 367 (85.5%) agreed to participate. A total of 133 patients with migraine and 234 patients with other neurological conditions provided responses. Our migraine patients' survey responses suggest that their well-being was disproportionately negatively affected by the pandemic. Survey respondents with migraine were significantly more likely than their non-migraine peers to report worsening anxiety and sleep problems [62/132 (47.0%) vs. 78/234 (33.3%), 2 = 6.64, p = 0.010, and 64/132 (48.5%) vs. 73/234 (31.2%), 2 = 10.77, p = 0.001]; migraine patients also reported worsening of depression as a result of the pandemic more than patients with other diagnoses, though this was not statistically significant [44/132 (33.3%) vs. 57/234 (24.4%), 2 = 3.40, p = 0.065]. In regard to access to healthcare, significantly more migraine patients reported running out of medications than those with other diagnoses [20/133 (15.0%) vs. 18/234 (7.7%), 2 = 4.93, p = 0.026]. More avoided seeking medical help for new health problems because of the pandemic [30/133 (22.6%) vs. 30/234 (12.8%), 2 = 5.88, p = 0.015]. Migraine patients were also significantly impacted economically by the pandemic; 43/132 (32.4%) of migraine patients reported losing their jobs as the result of the pandemic versus 34/234 (14.5%) of their peers (2 = 11.20, p < 0.001). An increase in headache severity or frequency was reported in 39/118 (33.1%) of respondents and 19/118 (16.1%) reported to using more abortive therapy than usual. Telemedicine was well received by almost all patients who took advantage of the option. Most of those patients found telemedicine to be easy to use and as valuable as an in-person visit. Migraine patients indicated with more frequency that without the telemedicine option, they would have missed their medical appointments [37/68 (54.4%) vs. 56/144 (38.6%), 2 = 4.31, p = 0.038]; a majority would prefer or consider telemedicine for future appointments over in-person visits.

Children and young people with pre-existing mental health difficulties may be prone to loneliness. Containment of COVID-19 has necessitated widespread social isolation, with unprecedented school closures and restrictions imposed on social interactions. This rapid review aimed to establish what is known about the relationship between loneliness and mental health problems in children and young people with pre-existing mental health problems. METHODS We sought to identify all primary research that examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between loneliness/perceived social isolation and mental health in children and young people with pre-existing mental health problems. We also aimed to identify effective interventions that reduce the adverse impact of loneliness. A rapid systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. RESULTS Of 4,531 papers screened, 15 included children and young people with pre-existing mental health conditions. These 15 studies included 1,536 children and young people aged between 6 and 23 years with social phobia, anxiety and/or depression, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Loneliness was associated with anxiety and depression both cross-sectionally and prospectively in children and young people with mental health problems and neurodevelopmental conditions. We found preliminary evidence that psychological treatments can help to reduce feelings of loneliness in this population. CONCLUSIONS Loneliness is associated with depression and anxiety in children and young people with pre-existing mental health conditions, and this relationship may be bidirectional. Existing interventions to address loneliness and/or mental health difficulties in other contexts may be applied to this population, although they may need adaptation and testing in younger children and adolescents. PRACTITIONER POINTS Loneliness is common in children and young people, and during periods of enforced social isolation such as during COVID-19, children and young people report high levels of loneliness (or increased rates of loneliness). The review showed that loneliness is associated, both cross-sectionally and prospectively, in children and young people with mental health problems and also in children and young people with neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder. Thus, loneliness is a possible risk factor of which mental health providers should be aware. Maintaining social contact both by direct and by indirect means, especially through the Internet, could be important in mitigating loneliness. Interventions to address loneliness should be further developed and tested to help children and young people with pre-existing mental health problems who are lonely by preventing exacerbation of their mental health difficulties, in particular anxiety and depression.","output":"Loneliness and mental health in children and adolescents with pre-existing mental health problems: A rapid systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an essential role in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression.

Furthermore, viruses can encode their own miRNAs, trigger changes in cellular miRNA expression or encode RNA silencing suppressor factors that inhibit cellular miRNAs. These interactions together form a complex regulatory network that controls both viral and host gene expression, which ultimately determines the outcome of viral infection at the cellular level and disease progression in the host.

Using a web-based survey, data were collected from a community and convenience sample of 196 unrelated divorced parents, assessing sociodemographic characteristics, coparenting conflict, and divorce adjustment. The study consisted of two phases: (1) forward-backward translation and cultural adaptation and (2) psychometric properties analyses: construct and criterion-related validity and internal consistency reliability. The 25-item AS was successfully translated and cross-culturally adapted to the Portuguese language. Principal component analyses (PCA) suggested a three-factor structure solution of 22-items, explaining 57.5% of the variance. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) showed the goodness of fit of this tridimensional model. The results also demonstrated acceptable convergent and good discriminant validity and high internal reliability. Scores on the AS suggested good known-groups validity and high discriminative power with 86.7% classification accuracy.

Largely, this is attributed to communication barriers between healthcare professionals and women who are deaf and/or HoH. There have been limited research studies carried out on women with invisible disabilities, such as deafness, especially amongst African women. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to gain insights into the communication experiences of women who are deaf or HoH when accessing public healthcare services in hospitals in Johannesburg. METHODS: A qualitative research study employing semi-structured interviews with 10 African women who are deaf and/or HoH residing in Johannesburg, South Africa and attending government healthcare facilities was conducted. Participants were purposively selected. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Data revealed the following themes: communication barriers resulting in compromised quality of care and infringement on participants right to confidentiality; accommodation that is not accommodative and negative attitudes of healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study confirm the alienating, exclusion, marginalisation, discrimination, invisibility, lack of independence and autonomy of women who are deaf and/or HoH when accessing healthcare services. Therefore, this study argues for a need for the conscientisation of healthcare professionals on communication needs of persons who are deaf and/or HoH.

However, these powerful cytokines are a caged lion, as excessive and sustained IFN-I production can drive immunopathology during infection, and aberrant IFN-I production is a feature of several types of autoimmunity. As specialized producers of IFN-I plasmacytoid (p), dendritic cells (DCs) can secrete superb quantities and a wide breadth of IFN-I isoforms immediately after infection or stimulation, and are the focus of this review. Notably, a few days after viral infection pDCs tune down their capacity for IFN-I production, producing less cytokines in response to both the ongoing infection and unrelated secondary stimulations. This process, hereby referred to as pDC exhaustion, favors viral persistence and associates with reduced innate responses and increased susceptibility to secondary opportunistic infections.

In this review we reflect on the mechanisms that initially induce IFN-I and subsequently silence their production by pDCs during a viral infection. While these processes have been long studied across numerous viral infection models, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has brought their discussion back to the fore, and so we also discuss emerging results related to pDC-IFN-I production in the context of COVID-19.","output":"Type I Interferon Induction and Exhaustion during Viral Infection: Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells and Emerging COVID-19 Findings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sexual assault is a public health issue that can impact one's resilience Using a multisystemic approach to resilience, there may be person-level and environment-level factors that can affect one's resilience, such as one's coping self-efficacy, satisfaction with the court process, and negative effects associated with court process Legal advocacy programs, such as those offered by the King County Sexual Assault Resource Center (KCSARC), support clients during the court proceedings In order to better serve KCSARC's clientele, it is helpful to understand how the legal advocacy program impacts post-trauma resilience This dissertation had three phases: (a) evaluating the structural validity of secondary victimization, resilience, and psychological stress measures;(b) conducting a serial mediation to see if court outcome satisfaction, secondary victimization, and sexual assault coping self-efficacy mediated the relationship between legal advocacy satisfaction on resilience;and (c) determining if race/ethnicity moderated the serial mediation Participants were at least 13 years old, cis-women clients in the KCSARC legal advocacy program who spoke English (N = 87) Although the design of the program evaluation is longitudinal, data was taken from only one of the waves that the participant completed The psychometric evaluation of the secondary victimization, resilience, and psychological stress measures in this dissertation supported their use in similar settings Results suggested a significant indirect effect from legal advocacy satisfaction to resilience, through court outcome satisfaction, secondary victimization, and resilience Even though the moderated serial mediation was statistically non-significant, results indicated that the mechanism was statistically significant for White/Caucasian participants, but not for Racial/Ethnic Minorities Legal advocates may better serve their clients by having information specifically related to court outcomes and psychoeducation on secondary victimization;and by improving their relationship with their clients to notice the signs of secondary victimization and highlight their client's coping self-efficacy and resilience Limitations include self-selection bias, completion rates, artificially inflated fit indices associated with allowing errors to covary, and confounding variables associated COVID-19 pandemic Future research should focus on validating the measures used across demographic factors and analyzing changes in variables over time (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Examining the factors that mediate the relationship from legal advocacy satisfaction to resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present the case of a 56-year-old patient suffering from an aorto-esophageal fistula after complex treatment of acute Type A dissection including thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) of the descending aorta.

RESULTS: Immunohistochemical studies have suggested that over-expression of GPC3 is associated with a poorer prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Expression of GPC3 leads to an increased apoptosis response in human lung carcinoma tumor cells, and is considered to be a candidate lung tumor suppressor gene. Increased serum levels of GPC3 have been demonstrated in ARDS patients with severe pneumonia.

Stay-at-home orders (SHO) prompted rapid upscaling of telemedicine capabilities and upskilling of providers. This study compares telemedicine usage before and after the SHO and analyzes how a Children's Center addressed challenges associated with a rapid rise in telemedicine. Methods: Data on outpatient visits across 14 specialty divisions were abstracted from the institutional electronic medical record. The 12-week study period (March 9, 2020-May 29, 2020) spanned three epochs: pre-SHO; post-SHO; reopening to in-person visits. Changes in in-person visits, video visits, and completed, cancelled, and no-show appointments were compared between three epochs. Results: A total of 4,914 outpatient pediatric specialty visits were completed, including 67% (3,296/4,914) in-person and 33% (1,618/4,914) through video. During the first two epochs encompassing the SHO, video visits increased by 4,750%. During the third epoch when the SHO was lifted, video visits decreased by 66%, with 19.4% of visits conducted through video in week 12. Overall, for outpatient video appointments, 82.8% (1,618/1,954) were completed, 9.1% (178/1,954) were cancelled, and 8.1% (158/1,954) were no-shows. The percentage of completed and no-show appointments did not differ between epochs. However, the cancellation rate decreased significantly from Epochs 1 to 3 (p = 0.008). Conclusion: A SHO was associated with a large increase in pediatric specialty video visits. Post-SHO, the percentage of pediatric specialty visits conducted through video decreased but remained higher than before the SHO.

Soluble ACE2 (sACE2) concentrations are elevated in patients with various cardiovascular disorders including heart failure. METHODS: In a total of 182 consecutive adult patients with complex congenital heart disease (CHD) and 63 healthy controls, sACE2 concentrations were measured in serum using the Human ACE2(?) assay by Cloud-Clone Corporation and associated with clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic parameters. RESULTS: Median sACE2 levels were increased in patients with complex CHD as compared to healthy controls (761.9 pg/ml vs 365.2 pg/ml, p < 0.001). Moreover, sACE2 concentrations were significantly elevated in patients with a higher NYHA class  III (1856.2 pg/ml vs 714.5 pg/ml in patients with NYHA class I/II, p < 0.001). Using linear regression analysis, higher sACE2 levels were associated with a higher NYHA class  III, more severe CHD, a morphological left systemic ventricle, higher creatinine and the use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) in the univariable model. The use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) was associated with lower sACE2 levels. In the multivariable model, higher sACE2 levels were independently associated with a higher NYHA class  III (p = 0.002) and lower sACE2 levels with the use of ACE inhibitors or ARB (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Soluble ACE2 concentrations were significantly increased in all types of complex CHD with highest levels found in patients with NYHA class  III. Moreover, a higher NYHA class  III was the most significant determinant that was independently associated with elevated sACE2 concentrations.

METHODS: The self-quarantine noncompliance rate for COVID-19 was examined using publicly available data. We collected the daily number of quarantine and quarantine violation cases from March 22 to June 10, 2020.

Therefore, aiming at strong B cell somatic hypermutation - not only at high antibody titers - is a priority when utilizing vaccines that are not targeted at individual variants. Here, we developed a next-generation sequencing based SARS-CoV-2 B cell tracking protocol to rapidly determine the level of immunoglobulin somatic hypermutation at distinct points during the immunization period. The percentage of somatically hypermutated B cells in the SARS-CoV-2 specific repertoire was low after the primary vaccination series, evolved further over months and increased steeply after boosting. The third vaccination mobilized not only naive, but also antigen-experienced B cell clones into further rapid somatic hypermutation trajectories indicating increased affinity. Together, the strongly mutated post-booster repertoires and antibodies deriving from this may explain why the booster, but not the primary vaccination series, offers some protection against immune-escape variants such as Omicron B.1.1.529.

A semiquantitative PCR for 7 respiratory pathogens was done on a pooled nonendoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage sample for each herd. Potential risk factors were collected by questionnaire and derived from the national cattle registration databank. Most outbreaks occurred between October and March, and single and multiple viral infections were detected in 58.6% (75/128) and 13.3% (17/128), respectively. Bovine coronavirus (BCV) was the most frequently isolated virus (38.4%), followed by bovine respiratory syncytial virus (bRSV; 29.4%) and parainfluenzavirus type 3 (PI-3; 8.1%). Mycoplasma bovis, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni were detected in 33.3, 41.2, 89.1, and 36.4% of the herds, respectively. Specific risk factors for BCV detection were detection of M. haemolytica [odds ratio (OR) = 2.8 (95% confidence interval = 1.1C7.5)], increasing herd size [OR = 1.3 (1.0C1.8) for each increase with 100 animals] and detection of BCV by antigen ELISA on feces in calves in the last year [OR = 3.6 (1.2C11.1)]. A seasonal effect was shown for bRSV only {more in winter compared with autumn [OR = 10.3 (2.8C37.5)]}.

Using genetically modified mouse models (GEMMs), we demonstrate that Wnt signaling promotes c-Fos-induced OS formation via the actions of the collagen-modifying enzyme Loxl2. c-Fos/AP-1 directly regulates the expression of the Wnt ligands Wnt7b and Wnt9a in OS cells through promoter binding, and Wnt7b and Wnt9a in turn promote Loxl2 expression in murine and human OS cells through the transcription factors Zeb1 and Zeb2. Concordantly, inhibition of Wnt ligand secretion by inactivating the Wnt-less (Wls) gene in osteoblasts in c-Fos GEMMs either early or in a therapeutic setting reduces Loxl2 expression and progression of OS. Wls-deficient osteosarcomas proliferate less, are less mineralized and are enriched in fibroblastic cells surrounded by collagen fibers. Importantly, Loxl2 inhibition using either the pan-Lox inhibitor BAPN or a specific inducible shRNA reduces OS cell proliferation in vitro and decreases tumor growth and lung colonization in murine and human orthotopic OS transplantation models. Finally, OS development is delayed in c-Fos GEMMs treated with BAPN or with specific Loxl2 blocking antibodies. Congruently, a strong correlation between c-FOS, LOXL2 and WNT7B/WNT9A expression is observed in human OS samples, and c-FOS/LOXL2 co-expression correlates with OS aggressiveness and decreased patient survival.

Acute effects on the Autonomic Nervous System, commonly measured using Heart Rate Variability, have been observed with manual therapy. This study aimed to investigate the effect on Heart Rate Variability in (1) a combination of home stretching exercises and spinal manipulative therapy versus (2) home stretching exercises alone over 2 weeks in participants with persistent or recurrent neck pain. METHODS: A randomized controlled clinical trial was carried out in five multidisciplinary primary care clinics in Stockholm from January 2019 to April 2020. The study sample consisted of 131 participants with a history of persistent or recurrent neck. All participants performed home stretching exercises daily for 2 weeks and were scheduled for four treatments during this period, with the intervention group receiving spinal manipulative therapy in addition to the home exercises. Heart Rate Variability at rest was measured at baseline, after 1 week, and after 2 weeks, with RMSSD (Root mean square of successive RR interval differences) as the primary outcome. Both groups were blinded to the other group intervention. Thus, they were aware of the purpose of the trial but not the details of the other intervention. The researchers collecting data were blinded to treatment allocation, as was the statistician performing data analyses. The clinicians provided treatment for participants in both groups and could not be blinded. A linear mixed-effects model with continuous variables and person-specific random intercept was used to investigate the group-time interaction using an intention to treat analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-six participants were randomized to the intervention group and sixty-five to the control group. For RMSSD, a B coefficient of 0.4 (p value: 0.9) was found, indicating a non-significant difference in the regression slope for each time point with the control group as reference. No statistically significant differences were found between groups for any of the Heart Rate Variability indices.

Cryoglobulinaemic syndrome, characterised by clinical signs of systemic vasculitis, is associated with chronic infection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and might evolve in B-cell malignancies. In about one third of all HCV infection cases, serum autoantibodies are commonly found. This is probably due directly to the transformation of infected B cells but, also, indirectly, to the viral chronic stimulation of a pool of autoreactive B cells. The pattern of IgG subclasses seems to contribute to the worsening progression of HCV infection into lymphoproliferative and/or autoimmune diseases. Many evidences showed that B cells circulating in patients with HCV-associated mixed cryoglobulinaemia (MC) are profoundly abnormal;moreover, in most of cases, normal B cells are replaced by expanded clonal B cells characterised by the low expression of CD21.

Nursing education programs have reported that their students were not able to continue their clinical education due to worries about infection risks within hospitals and some have cancelled or reduced entering cohorts. At the same time, anecdotal reports suggested that some RNs near retirement chose to retire early to reduce the risk of infection with SARS-Cov2. These changes, if true, could undermine the progress made over the past 20?years toward a balanced nursing labor market and lead to shortages of RNs in the near future. Study Design This study uses data from two surveys conducted in California to assess the current and future supply of RNs, and to learn how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting this essential workforce. Early data from two surveys have been analyzed to provide a rapid assessment of the workforce: (1) the biennial Survey of California Registered Nurses, and (2) the Board of Registered Nursing Annual Schools Survey. Data from the Survey of California RNs, which is based on a stratified sample of the state's nurses, are weighted to represent the total population of nurses. Analysis methods include tabulating means and frequency distributions for the 2020 surveys and comparing the results to prior years. The data from these surveys are then used in a stock-and-flow supply projection model to learn the extent to which RN shortages might emerge in the future. Population Studied Registered nurses and nursing education programs in California. Principal Findings Approximately 2000 RNs responded to the biennial Survey by November 2020. The data indicate that: (1) employment rates of older nurses dropped substantially: 6 percentage points for RNs 60-64?years old and 10 percentage points for RNs 65?years and older. Employment rates for nurses younger than 30?years also dropped, but not significantly. Employment of nurses 30-49?years increased approximately 6 percentage points, making up for the decreases of older RNs. Among RNs 55-64?years old, the percent reporting they intend to retire or leave nursing within two years increased from 11.4% in 2018 to 24.5% in 2020. The survey of RN education programs finds that 16 of California's 147 nursing programs skipped a cohort of students in 2020 and another 18 programs enrolled fewer students than the prior academic year. The estimated decrease in students statewide is approximately 350 - 2.3% of ~15,000 new enrollments in 2018-2019. Conclusions Although RN enrollments decreased only negligibly, the rapid decrease in employment of older nurses and increase in projected retirements suggest that RN shortages may rapidly emerge. Implications for Policy or Practice Over the past five years, hospitals have been increasingly uninterested in hiring newly-graduated nurses, even while reporting shortages of experienced RNs. Hospitals need to rapidly hire newly-graduated RNs in order to compensate for the rapid outflow of older RNs from the labor supply.","output":"Changes in Registered Nurse Employment and Education Capacity during the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Risk of Future Shortages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: To analyse the lung pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and correlate the findings with the time sequence of the disease.

Other variable features include multinucleated giant cells, pneumocytes with cytomegaly and variable amounts of inflammatory cells and foamy macrophages. One case showed superimposed bronchopneumonia. No viral inclusions were found. Coronavirus particles were identified in pneumocytes by electron microscopy.

SARS-CoV-2 binds its host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), through the viral spike (S) protein. The mortality related to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure in COVID-19 patients has been suggested to be connected with cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), an excessive immune response that severely damages healthy lung tissue. In addition, cardiac symptoms, including fulminant myocarditis, are frequent in patients in a severe state of illness. Diacerein (DAR) is an anthraquinone derivative drug whose active metabolite is rhein. Different studies have shown that this compound inhibits the IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, TNF-, NF-B and NALP3 inflammasome pathways. The antiviral activity of rhein has also been documented. This metabolite prevents hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and influenza A virus (IAV) adsorption and replication through mechanisms involving regulation of oxidative stress and alterations of the TLR4, Akt, MAPK, and NF-B signalling pathways. Importantly, rhein inhibits the interaction between the SARS-CoV S protein and ACE2 in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting rhein as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of SARS-CoV infection. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that DAR is a multi-target drug useful for COVID-19 treatment. This anthraquinone may control hyperinflammatory conditions by multi-faceted cytokine inhibition and by reducing viral infection.","output":"Diacerein: a potential multi-target therapeutic drug for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions (OGD) are a frequent symptom of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Large-scale epidemiological analyses suggest a synergistic effect of the 203 mutation and the spike L452R mutation, associated with Delta expansion. Viral competition experiments demonstrate the synergistic effect in fitness and infectivity. More importantly, we found that the combination of R203M and L452R brings in a 3.2-fold decrease in neutralizing titers to the neutralizing serum relative to L452R-only virus. R203M/L452R show an increased fitness after the initiation of global vaccination programmes, possibly associated with the enhanced immune evasion.

The baby was born to a COVID-19 PCR (+) mother by C-section and was found to be COVID-19 PCR (+) from a nasopharyngeal swab sample tested within 24 hours of birth due to the suspected transplacental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from the mother to the fetus.","output":"A novel case of neonatal acute respiratory distress syndrome with SARS-CoV-2 infection: potential perinatal transmission."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been proposed as a rescue therapy in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The aim of the present study was to determine whether combining TPE with convalescent plasma (CVP) transfusion early in the intensive care unit (ICU) stay improves survival among this heterogeneous population. The primary endpoint was survival at 30 days. Secondary endpoints included assessing the evolution of biomarkers, such as the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional inspired oxygen ratio, and C reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin levels at the 7-day follow-up. This single centre, prospective, non-randomized controlled trial was conducted in an 8-bed COVID-19 ICU and included patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring intensive care treatment. A total of 19 patients were treated by performing TPE followed by CVP transfusion, in addition to standard treatment, while for another 19 patients, only standard treatment according to hospital protocols was used. TPE was initiated during the first 24 h after ICU admission, followed immediately by transfusion of CVP. Survival at 30 days was 47.37% in the TPE CVP group and 26.32% in the control group (P=0.002). Patients in the TPE CVP group also showed better oxygenation and a reduction in inflammation, with decreased CRP, LDH and ferritin levels compared with those in the control group. Overall, the study indicated that early initiation of TPE followed by CVP transfusion may be a valid rescue therapy in severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients, with a statistically significant survival benefit, improved oxygenation and a reduction in inflammatory markers.

The purpose of this study was the clinical assessment of the new Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test. METHODS: The clinical performance of Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test was evaluated vs. a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) laboratory-based assay (Seegene AllplexTM2019-nCoV) in nasopharyngeal swabs collected from a series of consecutive patients referred for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics to the Pederzoli Hospital (Peschiera del Garda, Verona, Italy) over a 2-week period. RESULTS: The final study population consisted of 321 consecutive patients (mean age, 46 years and IQR, 32-56 years; 181 women, 56.4%), with 149/321 (46.4%) positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA via the Seegene AllplexTM2019-nCoV Assay, and 109/321 (34.0%) positive with Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test, respectively. The overall accuracy of Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test compared to molecular testing was 86.9%, with 72.5% sensitivity and 99.4% specificity. Progressive decline in performance was observed as cycle threshold (Ct) values of different SARS-CoV-2 gene targets increased. The sensitivity was found to range between 97-100% in clinical samples with Ct values <25, between 50-81% in those with Ct values between 25 and <30, but low as 12-18% in samples with Ct values between 30 and <37. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical performance of Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test is excellent in nasopharyngeal swabs with Ct values <25, which makes it a reliable screening test in patients with high viral load.

These bloodstream infections often lead to long hospital stays and have a high mortality rate. Once C. albicansenters the bloodstream it can disseminate and invade many organs of the body, including the lungs, where it can inhibit function and cause further complications. Furthermore, C. albicansis commonly isolated from the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients and often causes coinfection in patients with severe COVID-19. Current antifungal drugs exhibit high toxicity, poor water solubility, and are ineffective against some strains of C. albicans due to antifungal resistance, creating an urgent need for new antifungal therapeutics. Here, we have developed a customizable in vitroplatform to study the interaction between rat lung microvascular endothelial cells (ECs), C. albicansSC5314, and novel liposomes encapsulating the antifungal drug anidulafungin. Liposome formulations composed of hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, cholesterol, and -tocopherol were fabricated containing three different % wt/wt concentrations of anidulafungin (0.31, 1.55, and 3.10, or 1x, 5x and 10x, respectively). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the different liposome formulations for C. albicans were determined using a microdilution assay. After 24 hours of exposure, the MICs were found to be 12.50, 6.25, and 1.56 g/mL for 1x, 5x, and 10x liposome formulations, respectively. Cell Counting Kit 8 was used to determine EC viability after 24-hour treatment with the different liposome formulations. The 1x and 5x anidulafungin liposome formulations showed no significant decrease in viability up to the maximum liposome concentration tested (50 g/mL), with the 10x formulation causing a slight but significant decrease in viability. The 1x and 5x anidulafungin liposomes were then assessed at 6.25 and 12.5 g/mL in a co-culture setting. C. albicans were seeded onto established EC monolayers and were allowed to form hyphae, which is the invasive form. After the two hours, the co-cultures were treated with the antifungal liposomes. Treatment with the liposomes reduced hyphae formation and prevented C. albicansovergrowth within four hours of exposure, with the 5x anidulafungin liposome at 12.5 g/mL showing the strongest change. These data suggest that these novel antifungal liposomes have the potential to treat pulmonary candidiasis without the toxic side effects associated with current antifungal drugs.","output":"In vitro model of pulmonary candidiasis for testing novel therapeutics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the current pandemic, the unprecedented closure of universities and schools has revived the application of fully online teaching and learning.

This review summarizes the histopathologic findings and clinicopathologic correlations from autopsies and biopsies performed in patients with COVID-19. PubMed and Medline (EBSCO and Ovid) were queried from June 4, 2020 to September 30, 2020 and histopathologic data from autopsy and biopsy studies were collected based on 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Diffuse alveolar damage, thromboembolism, and nonspecific shock injury in multiple organs were the main findings in this review. The pathologic findings emerging from autopsy and biopsy studies reviewed herein suggest that in addition to a direct viral effect in some organs, a unifying pathogenic mechanism for COVID-19 is ARDS with its known and characteristic inflammatory response, cytokine release, fever, inflammation, and generalized endothelial disturbance.

Multivariable quantile regression analyzed time from diagnosis to first treatment. RESULTS Of 5713 lung cancer patients diagnosed in Norway in 2015-16, 37.9% (n = 2164) had an EP before diagnosis. Higher age, more advanced stage and more comorbidities were associated with increasing odds of having an EP (P < 0.001) and a lower odds of receiving any treatment (P < 0.001). After adjusting for case-mix, waiting times to curative radiotherapy and SACT were 12.1 days longer [95% confidence interval (CI): 10.2, 14.0] and 5.6 days shorter (95% CI: -7.3, -3.9), respectively, compared with waiting time to surgery.

Traditionally, the use of 3D scans has been limited to specialized centers owing to the high cost of the scanning equipment and the necessity for complex analysis software. Technological advances have made cheaper, more accessible methods of data capture and analysis available in the field of dentistry, potentially facilitating a primary care system to quantify disease progression. However, this system has yet to be compared with previous high-precision methods in university hospital settings. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare a dental primary care method of data capture (intraoral scanner) with a precision hospital-based method (laser profilometer) in addition to comparing open source and commercial software available for data analysis. METHODS: Longitudinal dental wear data from 30 patients were analyzed using a two-factor factorial experimental design. Bimaxillary intraoral digital scans (TrueDefinition, 3M, UK) and conventional silicone impressions, poured in type-4 dental stone, were made at both baseline and follow-up appointments (mean 36 months, SD 10.9). Stone models were scanned using precision laser profilometry (Taicaan, Southampton, UK). Three-dimensional changes in both forms of digital scans of the first molars (n=76) were quantitatively analyzed using the engineering software Geomagic Control (3D Systems, Germany) and freeware WearCompare (Leeds Digital Dentistry, UK). Volume change (mm(3)) was the primary measurement outcome. The maximum point loss (m) and the average profile loss (m) were also recorded. Data were paired and skewed, and were therefore compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: The median (IQR) volume change for Geomagic using profilometry and using the intraoral scan was C0.37 mm(3) (C3.75-2.30) and +0.51 mm(3) (C2.17-4.26), respectively (P<.001). Using WearCompare, the median (IQR) volume change for profilometry and intraoral scanning was C1.21 mm(3) (C3.48-0.56) and C0.39 mm(3) (C3.96-2.76), respectively (P=.04). WearCompare detected significantly greater volume loss than Geomagic regardless of scanner type. No differences were observed between groups with respect to the maximum point loss or average profile loss. CONCLUSIONS: As expected, the method of data capture, software used, and measurement metric all significantly influenced the measurement outcome. However, when appropriate analysis was used, the primary care system was able to quantify the degree of change and can be recommended depending on the accuracy needed to diagnose a condition.

PKR activity is regulated by a 58 kilo Dalton cellular inhibitor (P58(IPK)), which is present in inactive state as a complex with Hsp40 under normal conditions. In case of influenza A virus (IAV) infection, P58(IPK) is known to dissociate from Hsp40 and inhibit PKR activation. However the influenza virus component responsible for PKR inhibition through P58(IPK) activation was hitherto unknown. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Human heat shock 40 protein (Hsp40) was identified as an interacting partner of Influenza A virus nucleoprotein (IAV NP) using a yeast two-hybrid screen. This interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation studies from mammalian cells transfected with IAV NP expressing plasmid. Further, the IAV NP-Hsp40 interaction was validated in mammalian cells infected with various seasonal and pandemic strains of influenza viruses. Cellular localization studies showed that NP and Hsp40 co-localize primarily in the nucleus. During IAV infection in mammalian cells, expression of NP coincided with the dissociation of P58(IPK) from Hsp40 and decrease PKR phosphorylation. We observed that, plasmid based expression of NP in mammalian cells leads to decrease in PKR phosphorylation. Furthermore, inhibition of NP expression during influenza virus replication led to PKR activation and concomitant increase in eIF2 phosphorylation. Inhibition of NP expression also led to reduced IRF3 phosphorylation, enhanced IFN  production and concomitant reduction of virus replication. Taken together our data suggest that NP is the viral factor responsible for P58(IPK) activation and subsequent inhibition of PKR-mediated host response during IAV infection. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings demonstrate a novel role of IAV NP in inhibiting PKR-mediated anti-viral host response and help us understand P58(IPK) mediated inhibition of PKR activity during IAV infection.","output":"Influenza A Virus Nucleoprotein Exploits Hsp40 to Inhibit PKR Activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway modulates miscellaneous biological events in cells including gene expression, cell growth, apoptosis, metabolism and transition.

Loss of function assays were carried out to detect the influence of endostatin on the proliferation, migration, cell proliferation and apoptosis of bladder cancer cells. We demonstrated that endostatin triggered the degradation of -catenin, a key mediator of Wnt signaling. The activation of the endostatin blocked -catenin function and inhibited cell growth and migration of bladder cancer.

It has caused infections in humans in China since 2013. Five waves of the H7N9 influenza epidemic occurred in China between March 2013 and September 2017. H7N9 with low-pathogenicity dominated in the first four waves, whereas highly pathogenic H7N9 influenza emerged in poultry and spread to humans during the fifth wave, causing wide concern. Specialists and officials from China and other countries responded quickly, controlled the epidemic well thus far, and characterized the virus by using new technologies and surveillance tools that were made possible by their preparedness efforts. Here, we review the characteristics of the H7N9 viruses that were identified while controlling the spread of the disease. It was summarized and discussed from the perspectives of molecular epidemiology, clinical features, virulence and pathogenesis, receptor binding, T-cell responses, monoclonal antibody development, vaccine development, and disease burden.

However, with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia, disruptions in routine health care pose a significant risk in reversing the gains made in neonatal mortality reduction. METHODS: Using the World Health Organization's health systems building blocks framework we examined the mechanisms by which the pandemic may impact neonatal health. RESULTS: Our analysis suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken by the government to control its spread could indirectly set back the gains made in neonatal mortality reduction in Ethiopia by weakening the health system building blocks. On the other hand, by exposing longstanding issues in the health system, the pandemic has pressed health sector stakeholders to urgently test innovative approaches to maintain delivery of essential health care. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that the Ministry of Health of Ethiopia strike a right balance between the control of the pandemic and ensuring provision of essential neonatal health services. As the pandemic continues to spread in the country, the government should avoid verticalization of pandemic response efforts and adopt a diagonal investment approach to effectively respond to the pandemic as well as build health system resilience to maintain the gains made in the neonatal health.","output":"Could COVID-19 Reverse the Modest Gains Made in Newborn Health in Ethiopia?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We show how to define forward- and reverse-mode automatic differentiation source-code transformations or on a standard higher-order functional language.

This study was conducted to explore changes in patients use of dietary or herbal supplements among individuals infected with COVID-19 before and during infection and the association between herbal or dietary supplements and hospitalization. A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted enrolling symptomatic patients who had recently recovered from COVID-19. Data were collected through phone interviews, and McNemars test was used to investigate changes to consumption of dietary or herbal supplements before and during infection. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the association between supplements use during patients infection and hospitalization. A total of 738 patients were included in this study, of whom 32.1% required hospitalization. About 57% of participants were male with a mean age of 36.5 (11.9) years. The use of lemon/orange, honey, ginger, vitamin C, and black seed among participants significantly increased during their infection. In contrast, patients using anise, peppermint, and coffee peel before their infection were more likely to stop using them during their infection. In addition, using lemon/orange (p < 0.0001), honey (p = 0.0002), ginger (p = 0.0053), vitamin C (p = 0.0006), black seed (p < 0.0001), peppermint (p = 0.0027), costus (p = 0.0095), and turmeric (p = 0.0012) was significantly higher among nonhospitalized patients than hospitalized ones. However, in the multivariable logistic regression, only use of vitamin C (OR = 0.51; 95% CI 0.33C0.79), peppermint (OR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.31C0.90), and lemon/orange (OR = 0.54; 95% CI 0.33C0.88) was associated with significantly lower odds of hospitalization. The study reveals that patients consumption of dietary or herbal supplements changed in response to their COVID-19 infection, with hospitalized patients having a lower likelihood of using these supplements. Because some supplements were associated with lower odds of hospitalization, these supplements or their bioactive components should be further investigated as feasible options for COVID-19 treatment.","output":"Patients Behavior Regarding Dietary or Herbal Supplements before and during COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Environmental services personnel are a critical first line of defense against the spread of COVID-19.

Full- length LBR was targeted to the nuclear envelope. The amino-terminal domain, without any transmembrane segments, was transported to the nucleus but excluded from the nucleolus. When the amino-terminal domain of LBR was fused to the amino-terminal side of a transmembrane segment of a type II integral membrane protein of the ER/plasma membrane, the chimeric protein was targeted to the nuclear envelope, likely the inner nuclear membrane. When the amino-terminal domain was deleted from LBR and replaced by alpha-globin, the chimeric protein was retained in the ER. These findings demonstrate that the amino-terminal domain of LBR is targeted to the nucleus after synthesis in the cytoplasm and that this polypeptide can function as a nuclear envelope targeting signal when located at the amino terminus of a type II integral membrane protein synthesized on the ER.","output":"The amino-terminal domain of the lamin B receptor is a nuclear envelope targeting signal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Filho and Silva examine the COVID-19 pandemic and the political situation in Brazil which reinforced inequalities to food access Before the pandemic, Brazil had already been showing the effects of a long political and economic crisis, largely a result of the 2016 coup, which has led to more than 11% of the population unemployed and more than 40% in informal work President Jair Bolsonaro's statements have made explicit his denialist policy by prioritizing the economy over life Bolsonaro's government has been undoing social security and food security policies through the reform of the social security system, the dismantling of public universities, the shut-down of agrarian reform, the disassembling of food supply policies, and the end of the National Council for Food and Nutrition Security Bolsonaro starts from an authoritarian policy The COVID-19 pandemic, therefore, adds another societal stress factor, bringing back food insecurity and \\"the ghost of hunger\\" in Brazil","output":"Solidarity policy in defense of life: A hope in Brazil's pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been reported but still not verified why COVID-19 infection transmitted differentially across societies This paper intends to investigate the association of cultural orientation to the differential spread of present pandemic Initially, Ordinary Least Squares estimation and subsequently, a Two-Stage Least Squares analysis with Index of Historical Prevalence of Diseases as an Instrumental Variable is used to claim the findings This study suggests that countries with higher individualistic values have significantly higher COVID-19 infections and vice-versa The results are robust even after controlling for a number of related confounding factors such as density of population, percentage of urban population, uncertainty avoidance index, government effectiveness, political stability, voice and accountability, and rule of law The results indicate human behavior is responsible for the differential spreading of COVID-19 infections across countries and hence provide a rationale to social distancing, government's interventions and adherence to group norms for containment of this pandemic","output":"Is Individualism Fatal in Pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Methods have been developed for culturing a dividing population of morphologically differentiated rat parotid, lacrimal, and pancreatic acinar cells in vitro.

To be able to assess the risk of viral escape from neutralization by first-wave antibodies, we leveraged our capability for Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulation of the spike receptor binding domain (S RBD) and its binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) to predict alterations in molecular interactions resulting from the presence of the E484K, K417N, and N501Y variants found in the South African 501Y.V2 strain C alone and in combination.

Both E484K and N501Y increase affinity of S RBD for hACE2 and E484K in particular switches the charge on the flexible loop region of RBD which leads to the formation of novel favorable contacts. Enhanced affinity of S RBD for hACE2 very likely underpins the greater transmissibility conferred by the presence of either E484K or N501Y; while the induction of conformational changes may provide an explanation for evidence that the 501Y.V2 variant, distinguished from the B.1.1.7 UK variant by the presence of E484K, is able to escape neutralization by existing first-wave anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and re-infect COVID-19 convalescent individuals.","output":"Molecular dynamic simulation reveals E484K mutation enhances spike RBD-ACE2 affinity and the combination of E484K, K417N and N501Y mutations (501Y.V2 variant) induces conformational change greater than N501Y mutant alone, potentially resulting in an escape mutant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Upper respiratory and pulmonary diseases are the primary manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) However, kidney involvement has also been recognized and extensively described A large percentage of affected patients present with acute kidney injury (AKI) However, specific phenotypic aspects of AKI or other renal manifestations of COVID-19 remain sparsely characterized Many reports indicate that proteinuria can be detected in AKI associated with COVID-19 (CoV-AKI) despite CoV-AKI being largely described as a form of acute tubular injury On the other hand, individuals of African ancestry with the high-risk APOL1 genotype are uniquely at risk of developing collapsing glomerulopathy when they are infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the entity now known as COVID-19-associated nephropathy (COVAN) Patients with COVAN typically present with nephrotic-range proteinuria The exact incidence of proteinuria in COVID-19 is unclear due to heterogeneity in the frequency with which proteinuria has been assessed in cases of COVID-19, as well as methodological differences in the way proteinuria is measured and/or reported In this review we discuss the current evidence of proteinuria as a manifestation of COVID-19 and elaborate on potential pathophysiological mechanisms associated with it [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Clinical Kidney Journal is the property of Oxford University Press / USA and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Proteinuria in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Student plagiarism has always been a concern for nursing faculty.

There is a paucity of information on glycemic control among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diabetes and acute hyperglycemia. METHODS This retrospective observational study of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 adults evaluated glycemic and clinical outcomes in patients with and without diabetes and/or acutely uncontrolled hyperglycemia hospitalized March 1 to April 6, 2020. Diabetes was defined as A1C 6.5%. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia was defined as 2 blood glucoses (BGs) > 180 mg/dL within any 24-hour period. Data were abstracted from Glytec's data warehouse. RESULTS Among 1122 patients in 88 U.S. hospitals, 451 patients with diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia spent 37.8% of patient days having a mean BG > 180 mg/dL. Among 570 patients who died or were discharged, the mortality rate was 28.8% in 184 diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia patients, compared with 6.2% of 386 patients without diabetes or hyperglycemia (P < .001). Among the 184 patients with diabetes and/or hyperglycemia who died or were discharged, 40 of 96 uncontrolled hyperglycemia patients (41.7%) died compared with 13 of 88 patients with diabetes (14.8%, P < .001). Among 493 discharged survivors, median length of stay (LOS) was longer in 184 patients with diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia compared with 386 patients without diabetes or hyperglycemia (5.7 vs 4.3 days, P < .001). CONCLUSION Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia occurred frequently.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used to treat drug-related gastrointestinal damage in SLE patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the gut microbiota of SLE patients using PPIs. METHODS: Fecal samples from 20 SLE patients with PPIs (P-SLE), 20 SLE patients without PPIs (NP-SLE) and 17 healthy controls (HCs) were obtained. The structure of the bacterial community in the fecal samples was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed to observe the relationship between clinical variables and microbiome composition in P-SLE and NP-SLE patients. Based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, functional capabilities of microbiota were estimated. Network analysis was performed to analyze the association of metabolic pathway alterations with altered gut microbiota in P-SLE and NP-SLE patients. RESULTS: P-SLE patients exhibited increased alpha-diversity and an altered composition of the gut microbiota compared with NP-SLE patients. The alpha-diversity of NP-SLE patients was significantly lower than HCs but also of P-SLE patients, whose alpha-diversity had become similar to HCs. Compared with NP-SLE patients, the relative abundances of Lactobacillus, Roseburia, Oxalobacter, and Desulfovibrio were increased, while those of Veillonella, Escherichia, Morganella, Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas were decreased in P-SLE patients. RDA indicated that PPI use was the only significant exploratory variable for the microbiome composition when comparing SLE patients. KEGG analysis showed that 16 metabolic pathways were significantly different between NP-SLE and P-SLE patients. These metabolic pathways were mainly associated with changes in Escherichia, Roseburia, Stenotrophomonas, Morganella and Alipipes as determined by the network analysis. CONCLUSIONS: PPI use is associated with an improved microbiome composition of SLE patients as it 1) increases alpha-diversity levels back to normal, 2) increases the abundance of various (beneficial) commensals, and 3) decreases the abundance of certain opportunistic pathogenic genera such as Escherichia.

METHODS Comatose survivors after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (n=82) were randomised to standard (24h) or prolonged (48h) duration of TTM at 331C. Blood samples were drawn 22, 46 and 70h after attaining the target temperature. Samples were analysed for rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM? (EXTEM?, INTEM?, FIBTEM? and HEPTEM?)) and thrombin generation using the Calibrated Automated Thrombogram? assay. RESULTS With the 22-h sample, we revealed no difference between groups in the ROTEM? and thrombin generation results beside a slightly higher EXTEM? and INTEM? maximum velocity in the prolonged group (p-values0.04). With the 46-h sample, ROTEM? showed no differences when using EXTEM?; however, 11% (p<0.01) longer clotting time and 12% (p<0.01) longer time to maximum velocity were evident in the prolonged group than in the standard group when using INTEM?. The prolonged group had reduced thrombin generation compared with the standard group as indicated by 30% longer lag time (p=0.04), 106nM decreased peak concentration (p<0.001), 36% longer time to peak (p=0.01) and 411 nM*minute decreased endogenous thrombin potential (p<0.001). With the 70-h sample, no differences in ROTEM? results were found between groups. However, the prolonged group had reduced thrombin generation indicated by longer lag time, decreased peak concentration and longer time to peak (all p-values0.02) compared with the standard group.

However, the importance of social distancing has recently been highlighted during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the absence of vaccination, or when vaccine efficacy is poor, social distancing may help to curb the spread of new virus strains. However, both vaccination and social distancing are associated with various costs. It is critical to consider these costs in addition to the benefits of these strategies when determining the optimal rates of application of control strategies. We developed a game-theoretic epidemiological model that considers vaccination and social distancing under the assumption that individuals pursue the maximization of payoffs. By using this model, we identified the individually optimal strategy based on the Nash strategy when both strategies are available and when only one strategy is available. Furthermore, we determined the relative costs of control strategies at which individuals preferentially adopt vaccination over social distancing (or vice versa).","output":"Optimal Strategies for Vaccination and Social Distancing in a Game-theoretic Epidemiological Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Confinement was adopted globally as a containment measure to face the COVID pandemic declared by WHO on March 2020.

The objective of this paper was to develop consensus-based expert recommendations for in-hospital based neurorehabilitation during the COVID-19 pandemic for low- and middle-income countries based on available evidence. Methods: A group of experts in neurorehabilitation consisting of neurologists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists were identified for the consensus groups. A scoping review was conducted to identify existing evidence and recommendations for neurorehabilitation during COVID-19. Specific statements with level 2b evidence from studies identified were developed. These statements were circulated to 13 experts for consensus. The statements that received 80% agreement were grouped in different themes and the recommendations were developed. Results: 75 statements for expert consensus were generated. 72 statements received consensus from 13 experts. These statements were thematically grouped as recommendations for neurorehabilitation service providers, patients, formal and informal caregivers of affected individuals, rehabilitation service organizations, and administrators. Conclusions: The development of this consensus statement is of fundamental significance to neurological rehabilitation service providers and people living with neurological disabilities.

Healthcare workers are playing the role of frontline defense to safeguard the lives of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aimed to investigate the anxiety levels and sleep quality among frontline and second-line healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this cross-sectional study, a validated, self-administered, electronic questionnaire was distributed through email to healthcare workers. The selection of 1678 healthcare workers was based on a convenience sampling technique. The General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) instrument scales were used to assess healthcare workers anxiety levels and sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Out of 1678 respondents, 1200 (71.5%) were frontline healthcare workers, while 478 (28.5%) were second-line healthcare workers. Among all the healthcare workers, 435 (25.92%) were experiencing moderate to severe anxiety. Among them, 713 (59.4%) frontline healthcare workers were experiencing anxiety in comparison with 277 (57.9%) second-line healthcare workers. Severe anxiety symptoms were seen in 137 (11.41%) frontline healthcare workers compared to 44 (9.20%) second-line healthcare workers. In total, 1376 (82.0%) healthcare workers were found to have poor sleep quality; 975 (58.10%) were frontline, and 407 (23.89%) were second-line healthcare workers. The highest poor sleep quality levels were found among 642 (84.6%) of the healthcare workers who work in frontline areas (emergency departments, intensive care units, and wards) compared to 734 (79.9%) of the healthcare workers who work in second-line areas. These findings provide a substantial contribution to the consolidation of evidence concerning the negative impact of the pandemic on the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs). These results have established an association that the COVID-19 pandemic causes larger negative psychological symptoms in frontline healthcare workers, such as severe anxiety and poor sleep quality. Preventive measures to minimize anxiety levels and maintain sleep quality, addressing this issue nationally and globally, are essential to support the healthcare workers who are sacrificing their mental health for the future of our nations.","output":"Comparison of Generalized Anxiety and Sleep Disturbance among Frontline and Second-Line Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 1,000,000 cases across 181 countries worldwide. The global impact of COVID-19 has resulted in a surge of related research. Researchers have turned to social media platforms, namely Twitter, to disseminate their articles. The online database Altmetric is a tool which tracks the social media metrics of articles and is complementary to traditional, citation-based metrics. Citation-based metrics may fail to portray dissemination accurately, due to the lengthy publication process. Altmetrics are not subject to this time-lag, suggesting that they may be an effective marker of research dissemination during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives: To assess the dissemination of COVID-19 articles as measured by Twitter dissemination, compared to traditional citation-based metrics, and determine article characteristics associated with tweet rates. Methods: COVID-19 articles obtained from LitCovid published between January 1st to March 18th, 2020 were screened for inclusion. The following article characteristics were extracted independently, in single: Topic (General Info, Mechanism, Diagnosis, Transmission, Treatment, Prevention, Case Report, and Epidemic Forecasting), open access status (open access and subscription-based), continent of corresponding author (Asia, Australia, Africa, North America, South America, and Europe), tweets, and citations. A sign test was used to compare the tweet rate and citation rate per day. A negative binomial regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between tweet rate and article characteristics of interest. Results: 1328 articles were included in the analysis. Tweet rates were found to be significantly higher than citation rates for COVID-19 articles, with a median tweet rate of 1.09 (IQR 6.83) tweets per day and median citation rate of 0.00 (IQR 0.00) citations per day, resulting in a median of differences of 1.09 (95% CI 0.86-1.33, P < .001). 2018 journal impact factors were positively correlated with tweet rate (P < .001). The topics Diagnosis (P = .01), Transmission (P < .001), Treatment (P = .01), and Epidemic Forecasting (P < .001) were positively correlated with tweet rate, relative to Case Report. The following continents of the corresponding author were negatively correlated with tweet rate, Africa (P < .001), Australia (P = .03), and South America (P < .001), relative to Asia. Open access journals were negatively correlated with tweet rate, relative to subscription-based journals (P < .001). Conclusions: COVID-19 articles had significantly higher tweets rates compared to citation rates. This study further identified article characteristics that are correlated with the dissemination of articles on Twitter, such as 2018 journal impact factor, continent of the corresponding author, topic, and open access status.

Apart from the oxygen therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, Remdesivir and Dexamethasone have been proven to be efficacious against COVID-19, along with various vaccine candidates and monoclonal antibody cocktail therapy for Regeneron. All of these are currently at different stages of clinical trials. People with weak immunity are more prone to a severe infection of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, early and judicious nutritional supplementation along with pharmacological treatment and clinician collaborations are critical in restituting the current situation. Nutritional supplements help in acquiring strong immunity to prevent the progression of disease any further. Vitamin C, vitamin D, selenium, zinc and many other nutritional and dietary supplements inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines during a viral infection and prevents several unwanted symptoms of infection. Many dietary components like citrus fruits, black elderberry, ginger, and probiotics have the ability to attack viral replication. These supplements can also tame the overriding immune system during coronavirus infection. Keeping in view these facts, nutritional and dietary supplements can be used along with other management modalities. These nutritional and dietary supplements are potential candidates to curb the convulsive unfolding of novel COVID-19, in combination with other standard treatment protocols. In this review, various search engines were used to exploit available literature in order to provide a comprehensive review on nutritional and dietary supplements with respect to the viral infections.

Here, we used high-throughput sequencing and miRNA inhibitors to screen possible miRNAs that can inhibit PRRSV infection on its target cell, porcine alveolar macrophages. We observed that miR-218 was downregulated upon virus infection, and knockdown of miR-218 significantly enhanced PRRSV replication. Overexpression of miR-218 resulted in a decrease in PRRSV replication, and this overexpression did not alter viral genomic RNA levels, but rather increased antiviral interferon signaling. Further analysis revealed that miR-218 regulated PRRSV replication by directly targeting porcine suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), a JAK2 kinase inhibitor. Knockdown of the endogenous SOCS3 expression led to augmentation of type I interferon genes and resulted in decreased PRRSV replication, and vice versa. During PRRSV infection in vivo and in vitro, cellular miR-218 expression was downregulated and SOCS3 expression was upregulated, further supporting the inverse correlation between miR-218 and SOCS3 expression. The data on SOCS3 depletion in combination with miR-218 inhibition suggested that the antiviral activity of miR-218 required the SOCS3-mediated signaling pathway. Similarly, miR-218 negatively regulated PRRSV replication in Marc-145 cells, as well as the replication of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus in Vero and ST cells respectively. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PRRSV-induced miR-218 downregulation serves to inhibit the type I interferon response and may provide a novel therapeutic target for treatment of PRRSV and other viral infections.","output":"Downregulation of miR-218 by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus facilitates viral replication via inhibition of type I interferon responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The primary diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is based on the detection of virus RNA in nasopharyngeal swab samples. In addition, analysis of humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 has an important role in viral diagnostics and seroprevalence estimates. METHODS: We developed and optimized an enzyme immunoassays (EIA) using SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N), S1 and receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein, and N proteins from SARS, MERS, and four low-pathogenic human CoVs. Neutralizing antibody activity was compared with SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA and IgM EIA results. RESULTS: The sensitivity of EIA for detecting immune response in COVID-19 patients (n=101) was 77 % in the acute phase and 100 % in the convalescent phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection when N and RBD were used as antigens in IgG and IgA specific EIAs. SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased humoral immune responses against the 229E and NL63 N proteins.

DESIGN: Practice review of guidelines supported by scoping review methodology to examine the evidence reporting the use of guideline-recommended interventions. DATA SOURCES: An electronic search was undertaken in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, complemented by web searching for guidelines and publications providing primary evidence (July 2021). Guidelines published within the last 5 years and evidence in the last 10 years were included. RESULTS: Severe COPD should be managed using a multidisciplinary approach with a holistic assessment. For stable patients, long-acting beta-agonist/long-acting muscarinic antagonist and pulmonary rehabilitation are recommended. Low dose opioids, self-management, handheld fan and nutritional support may provide small benefits, whereas routine corticosteroids should be avoided. For COPD exacerbations, systematic corticosteroids, non-invasive ventilation and exacerbation action plans are recommended. Short-acting inhaled beta-agonists and antibiotics may be considered but pulmonary rehabilitation should be avoided during hospitalisation. Long term oxygen therapy is only recommended for patients with chronic severe hypoxaemia. Short-acting anticholinergic inhalers, nebulised opioids, oral theophylline or telehealth are not recommended.

A multivariate invariance principle for partial sums of recursive residuals is given, and the limiting distributions of the test statistics are derived under local alternatives. In the retrospective context, the local power of the tests is shown to be substantially higher than that of the conventional CUSUM test if a break occurs in the middle or at the end of the sample. When applied to monitoring schemes, the detection delay of the stacked backward CUSUM is found to be much shorter than that of the conventional monitoring CUSUM procedure.

Acute intra-arterial treatment (IAT) in the setting of extracranial and intracranial lesions is considered challenging, and whether it yields improved outcomes remains uncertain. Objective To examine whether the presence of ECD modified the effect of IAT for intracranial proximal anterior circulation occlusion. Design Prespecified subgroup analysis of a randomized clinical trial of endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke in the Netherlands. (Trial registrations: NTR1804 [Netherlands Trial Register] and ISRCTN10888758). Setting 16 hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients Acute ischemic stroke caused by proximal intracranial arterial occlusion of the anterior circulation. Extracranial carotid disease was defined as cervical internal carotid artery stenosis (>50%) or occlusion. Intervention IAT treatment versus no IAT. Measurements The primary outcome was functional outcome, as measured by the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days and reported as adjusted common odds ratio (acOR) for a shift in direction of a better outcome. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis with an interaction term was used to estimate treatment effect modification by ECD. Results The overall acOR was 1.67 (95% CI, 1.21 to 2.30) in favor of the intervention. The acOR was 3.1 (CI, 1.7 to 5.8) in the prespecified subgroup of patients with ECD versus 1.3 (CI, 0.9 to 1.9) in patients presenting without ECD. Both acORs are in favor of the intervention (P for interaction = 0.07). Limitation The study was not powered for subgroup analysis. Conclusion Intra-arterial treatment may be at least as effective in patients with ECD as in those without ECD, and it should not be withheld in these complex patients with acute ischemic stroke.

Whilst there is consensus about the principles of palliative care, less is known about how care home staff negotiate and influence decisions around end of life and how organisational context shapes that process. AIM: To explore the views and experiences of care home staff and palliative care specialists on end of life care in care homes and understand how care home settings affected palliative care provision in England and Australia. DESIGN/PARTICIPANTS: Eight focus groups in Australia and England with care home staff and palliative care specialists (n = 49). Reflexive thematic analysis was undertaken. FINDINGS: Australian participants reported collaboration between care home staff, visiting professions and family members though case conferences. English participants discussed resident-focussed involvement from specialists that was less formally organised. Negotiating roles and responsibilities in end of life care; the importance of relationships to overcome deficiencies in formal processes; and the legitimacy and authority of advance care planning at times of crisis were recurring themes. The organisation and embedding of end of life care in processes and practices of care homes differed; this closely linked to care home procedures in Australia but was less apparent in England. CONCLUSION: In both countries, partnership working was recognised and valued as key to effective palliative care. Work that enables care home staff to identify challenges with visiting professionals, such as agreeing priorities for care and negotiating their shared responsibilities, may lead to context-sensitive, sustainable solutions.","output":"A qualitative comparison of care home staff and palliative care specialists experiences of providing end of life care to people living and dying with dementia in care homes in two countries: A focus group study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract After the spread of COVID-19, the Chinese central government has issued a series of policies and regulations to guide the prevention and control of the epidemic in the elderly care industry Social workers provided a series of services for older adults in nursing homes and in the community All efforts made by government agencies and social workers have helped older adults go through the difficult time","output":"COVID-19 and social work practice for older adults in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We would like to share ideas on the article, \\"A Case of Chilblains-like Lesions Post SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine?\\"1 Meara et al reported a female case and concluded, \\"The chilblains-like lesions suggest that she had an antibody response from either 1 vaccine dose or a previous PCR-negative COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019] infection.\\"1.","output":"Post SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Chilblains-like Lesions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The notion of environmental justice reflects the disproportionately high burden of environmental hazardsCCsuch as pollutionCCborne by low-income communities, communities of color, and indigenous communities, as well as the disproportionately low access of these communities to environmental benefitsCCsuch as clean water This already unequal distribution of environmental costs and benefits has been gradually exacerbated in the United States, as elsewhere, by climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic Nowhere is the disparity clearer than with respect to water injustice Over 2 million Americans are living without access to running water and basic indoor plumbing Many more live without sanitation Two causes of water injustice in the United States are a fragmented legal framework governing water issues and a lack of recognitionCCat both the federal and state levelCCof the human right to water and sanitation Water injustices include a lack of access to clean drinking water, inequalities in the enactment or enforcement of water-specific laws and regulations, and the exclusion of community voices from federal water policy In the absence of a national program to assist low-income residents, state-to-state variations in water pricing forces vulnerable communities to trade off between safety and affordabilityas in Flint, Michigan At the core of these issues is the underrepresentation of ethnic and racial minorities in government, law, and business, all but ensuring de facto exclusion from environmental decision-making Discriminatory zoning and land-use regulations, and a chronic lack of transparency and inadequate access to information concerning water issues exacerbates these disadvantages All of these factors have led to obstacles in establishing the right to water and sanitation, experienced disproportionately by Black, Latinx, Native, homeless or otherwise disadvantaged people in the United States","output":"Water Regulation and Injustice in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Animal-model experimental systems capable of reflecting the effects of devices for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) on living organisms are limited; thus, aimed to construct an animal model of AKI-CRRT using pigs.

RESULTS Post-IRI, pigs' creatinine levels rose threefold, and they exhibited 24 hours of anuria and clear aggravation of oxidative stress, demonstrating successful induction of AKI for CRRT. Post-CRRT, no significant changes in their vital signs or hematological parameters were observed. Creatinine and blood urea nitrogen clearance, as well as suppression of increases in oxidative stress, were also confirmed.

NGS in a broader perspective holds the potential for plant health improvement by diagnosing and mitigating the new or unusual symptoms caused by novel/unidentified viruses. CRISPR-based genome editing technologies can enable rapid engineering of efficient viral/viroid resistance by directly targeting specific nucleotide sites of plant viruses and viroids. Critical genes such as eIf (iso) 4E or eIF4E have been targeted via the CRISPR platform to produce plants resistant to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses. CRISPR/Cas-based multi-target DNA or RNA tests can be used for rapid and accurate diagnostic assays for plant viruses and viroids. Integrating NGS with CRISPR-based genome editing technologies may lead to a paradigm shift in combating deadly disease-causing plant viruses/viroids at the genomic level.

The goals of our study were to gauge the impact of COVID-19 on VS trainees' personal and professional life and to assess stressors, coping, and support structures involved in these trainees' response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was an anonymous online survey administered in April 12-24, 2020 during the surge phase of the global COVID-19 pandemic. It is a subset analysis of the cross-sectional Society for Vascular Surgery Wellness Committee Pandemic Practice, Anxiety, Coping, and Support Survey. The cohort surveyed was VS trainees, integrated residents and fellows, in the United States of America. Assessment of the personal impact of the pandemic on VS trainees and the coping strategies used by them was based on the validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale and the validated 28-time Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced inventory. RESULTS: A total of 145 VS trainees responded to the survey, with a 23% response rate (145/638). Significant changes were made to the clinical responsibilities of VS trainees, with 111 (91%) reporting cancellation of elective procedures, 101 (82%) with call schedule changes, 34 (24%) with duties other than related to VS, and 29 (24%) participation in outpatient care delivery. Over one-third (52/144) reported they had performed a procedure on a patient with confirmed COVID-19; 37 (25.7%) reported they were unaware of the COVID-19 status at the time. The majority continued to work after exposure (29/34, 78%). Major stressors included concerns about professional development, infection risk to family/friends, and impact of care delay on patients. The median score for GAD-7 was 4 (interquartile range 1-8), which corresponds to no or low self-reported anxiety levels. VS trainees employed mostly active coping and rarely avoidant coping mechanisms, and the majority were aware and used social media and online support systems. No significant difference was observed between integrated residents and fellows, or by gender. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has had significant impact on VS trainees. Trainees reported significant changes to clinical responsibilities, exposure to COVID-19, and pandemic-related stressors but demonstrated healthy coping mechanisms with low self-reported anxiety levels. The VS community should maintain awareness of the impact of the pandemic on the professional and personal development of surgeons in training.

Because of limitation of resources, the number of patients that can be monitored and treated in Intensive Care Units is restricted. Hence identifying medical patients at risk of deterioration at the initial stage by means of simple protocols based on physiological parameters is crucial. The qSOFA score was introduced as a rapid bedside clinical score to identify patients with a suspected infection that are at greater risk for a poor outcome. The National Early Warning Score (NEWS) was developed to improve the detection of and response to clinical deterioration in patients with acute illness. There is paucity of literature regarding the use of these scores in patients with COVID 19 infection. This study aims at comparing the scoring systems qSOFA and NEWS in the setting of COVID-19 infection and its correlation with the final outcome of the illness. MATERIAL It is a retrospective study in which patients presenting with COVID 19 infection(diagnosed by RT-PCR testing of nasopharyngeal and oral swab) between April 2021 to June 2021 were included. Scoring was done using both the scores at admission and the patients were followed up till the outcome. Outcome was defined as 5-day, 10-day and 15-day mortality after presentation. Predictive performance was expressed as discrimination (AUC). Subsequently, sensitivity and specificity were calculated. OBSERVATION A total of 100 patients were included in the study, of whom 17 died within 5 days and 37 died within 10 days and 30 died within 15 days after presentation. q SOFA had the best performance, compared to NEWS (5 day auc : .668, .621, 10-day auc: .580, .569, 15-day auc: .625, .511) with q SOFA having sensitivity of 90.2% while that of news being 95.1% where as specificity of q SOFA is 40.7% and that of NEWS is 47.5%.

In the case of direct observation and almost-additive loss functions, we prove an exponential convergence of the a posteriori measures to a limit measure. Our estimates on the Bayes posterior convergence for direct observation are related and extend those in [47] to a context where loss functions are almost-additive.

It can be caused by a constellation of disorders which presents with hemoptysis, anemia, and diffuse alveolar infiltrates. Respiratory failure from DAH can be so severe that it has been called an ARDS mimic/imitator. Early recognition is crucial because prompt diagnosis and treatment are required for survival. DAH should be distinguished from other causes of pulmonary hemorrhage caused by localized pulmonary abnormalities and the bronchial circulation. Early bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is generally required to confirm the diagnosis of DAH and rule out infection. Progressively bloody bronchoalveolar lavage samples can distinguish DAH. Systemic vasculitis is one of the most common causes of DAH and can be pathologically defined by the presence of cellular inflammation, vessel destruction, tissue necrosis, and eventually, organ dysfunction. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents remain the gold standard for the treatment. The following case illustrates a patient who was dependent on dialysis, then presented with hemoptysis. Bronchoscopy demonstrated progressively bloody bronchoalveolar lavage samples consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Serologic testing was consistent with microscopic polyangiitis.

In this project, we focus on analyzing the relationships between participating in collective applause (i.e., a collective ritual), reinforcement of collective/relational ties, identity fusion, and compliance with quarantine norms. We carried out a study during the COVID-19 quarantine (N = 568) with people who were legally obliged to stay home. Our results indicate that participating in collective rituals relates to collective and relational ties with in-group members. This, in turn, is associated with the strength of identity fusion and the perception that other in-group members comply with quarantine norms. Thus, under the influence of a common fate that invariably threatens the lives of a large part of the population, participating in collective rituals positively relates to an increase in the sense of belonging and common identity. ? 2021 Institute of Experimental Psychology, Centre of Social and Psychological Sciences, Slovak Academy of Sciences.

Two fundamental parameters drive the dynamics: the time elapsed between contagious and isolation of infected individuals ([Formula: see text]) and the ratio of people isolated over the total infected ones (p). The evolution is more sensitive to the [Formula: see text]parameter. The model not only reproduces the real data but also predicts the second wave before the former vanishes.

AIM: To obtain a deeper understanding of Registered Nurse Anesthetists main concerns and how they resolve these in the process of extubation when caring for a patient during general anesthesia. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 17 RNAs, eight male and nine female, were included in the study. Twelve RNAs in the first step of data collection (I); and five RNAs the second step of data collection (II). METHOD: A classic grounded theory approach with a qualitative design was used for this study. FINDINGS: The RNAs main concern in the process of extubation were Safeguarding the patient in a highly technological environment, which the solved by Maintaining adaptability. Facilitators as well as challenges affected how the RNAs solved their main concern and represented the categories: Having a back-up plan, Getting into the right frame of mind, Evaluating the patients reactions, Using ones own experience, Dealing with uncertainty, Pressure from others, and Being interrupted. The theory, Safeguarding the patient in the process of extubation, emerged. CONCLUSION: To be able to safeguard the patient in a highly technological environment, the RNAs must oscillate between facilitators and challenges. By maintaining adaptability, the RNAs resolved the difficulties of oscillating, indicating a need for finding a balance between maintaining attentiveness on what is important to keep the patient safe in the process of extubation and all of the disturbances present in the OR.","output":"Safeguarding the patient: a grounded theory study of registered nurse anesthetists main concerns in the process of extubation in the anesthesia setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study assessed, using a self-reported questionnaire, the adherence to PPE (mask, gowns, and gloves) at the workplace, as well as to non-pharmacological preventive measures (NPPM) (physical distance defined as hardly ever/never approaches other people within 1.5 meters, social isolation as leaving home less than once a week, hand hygiene was defined as performing hand hygiene 6 times per period, and adherence to the use of a mask outside of the workplace was defined as on all outings and hardly ever/never removes the mask) outside of the workplace among 1,296 healthcare workers (HCWs), including if NPPM adherence was associated with COVID-19 in HCWs.

In spite of this, whether or not AKR1B1 could be related to sperm quality, functionality and fertilizing ability is yet to be elucidated. The present study, therefore, aimed to investigate: i) the presence of AKR1B1 in epididymal and ejaculated sperm; ii) the relationship between the AKR1B1 present in sperm and the physiology of the male gamete; iii) the liaison between the relative content of AKR1B1 in sperm and their ability to withstand preservation for 72 h; and iv) the potential link between sperm AKR1B1 and in vitro fertility outcomes. Immunoblotting revealed that AKR1B1 is present in both epididymal and ejaculated sperm with a similar relative content. Moreover, the relative levels of AKR1B1 in sperm (36 kDa band) were found to be negatively related to several kinematic parameters and intracellular calcium levels, and positively to the percentage of sperm with distal cytoplasmic droplets after storage. Finally, AKR1B1 amounts in sperm (36 kDa band) were negatively associated to fertilization rate at two days post-fertilization and embryo development at six days post-fertilization. The results of the present work suggest that AKR1B1 in sperm is probably acquired during maturation rather than at ejaculation and could play a role in that process. Moreover, AKR1B1 seems to be related to the sperm resilience to preservation and to their fertilizing capacity, as lower levels of the 36 kDa band (putative inactive form of this protein) result in better reproductive outcomes.","output":"Aldose Reductase B1 in Pig Sperm Is Related to Their Function and Fertilizing Ability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There are several types of coronaviruses that infect humans and cause disease. The latest is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is an emerging global threat with no current effective treatment. Normal intravenous immunoglobulin (N-IVIG) has been administered to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients to control severe inflammation and the cellular immune response. However, the neutralizing activity of N-IVIG against SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been fully evaluated. The aim of this study was to determine whether N-IVIG manufactured before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic contained IgG antibodies against the circulating human coronaviruses (HCoVs) that cross-react with the highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2. No cases of SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV have been reported in Japan. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The neutralizing and binding activities of N-IVIG against SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, HCoV 229E, and HCoV OC43 were evaluated. Nine N-IVIG lots manufactured between 2000 and 2018, derived from donors in Japan, were tested. Binding activity was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence assay. RESULTS: None of the N-IVIG lots tested displayed neutralizing or binding activity against SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, or SARS-CoV-2. However, they displayed substantial neutralizing and binding activity against HCoV OC43 and weak neutralizing and substantial binding activity against HCoV 229E.

Parents are primary gatekeepers to children's food intake; however, reaching and engaging parents in nutrition promotion can be challenging. With growth in internet and smartphone use, digital platforms provide potential to disseminate information rapidly to many people. The objectives of this review were to conduct a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of nutrition promotion via websites and apps supporting parents to influence children's nutrition, from three different perspectives: 1) current evidence base, 2) end user (parent) experience and 3) current commercial offerings. METHODS Three systematic reviews were undertaken of (1) studies evaluating the effectiveness for digital platforms for improving nutrition in children and parents, (2) studies conducting user-testing of digital tools with parents, (3) websites and apps providing lunch-provision information to parents. Searches were conducted in five databases for reviews one and two, and systematic search of Google and App Store for review three. Randomised controlled trials, cohort and cross-sectional and qualitative studies (study two only) were included if published in English, from 2013, with the intervention targeted at parents and at least 50% of intervention content focused on nutrition. Search results were double screened, with data extracted into standardised spreadsheets and quality appraisal of included search results. RESULTS Studies evaluating digital nutrition interventions targeting parents (n = 11) demonstrated effectiveness for improving nutrition outcomes, self-efficacy and knowledge. Six of the included randomised controlled trials reported digital interventions to be equal to, or better than comparison groups. User-testing studies (n = 9) identified that digital platforms should include both informative content and interactive features. Parents wanted evidence-based information from credible sources, practical tools, engaging content and connection with other users and health professionals. Websites targeting lunch provision (n = 15) were developed primarily by credible sources and included information-based content consistent with dietary guidelines and limited interactive features. Lunchbox apps (n = 6), developed mostly by commercial organisations, were more interactive but provided less credible information. CONCLUSIONS Digital nutrition promotion interventions targeting parents can be effective for improving nutrition-related outcomes in children and parents. As demonstrated from the lunchbox context and user-testing with parents, they need to go beyond just providing information about positive dietary changes, to include the user-desired features supporting interactivity and personalisation.","output":"A systematic evaluation of digital nutrition promotion websites and apps for supporting parents to influence children's nutrition."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico City has been sharp, as several social inequalities at all levels coexist. Here, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of the impact of individual and municipal-level social inequalities on the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico City. METHODS: We analyzed suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases, from the Mexico City Epidemiological Surveillance System from February 24th, 2020, to March 31 st, 2021. COVID-19 outcomes included rates of hospitalization, severe COVID-19, invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality. We evaluated socioeconomic occupation as an individual risk, and social lag, which captures municipal-level social vulnerability, and urban population density as proxies of structural risk factors. Impact of reductions in vehicular mobility on COVID-19 rates and the influence of risk factors were also assessed. Finally, we assessed discrepancies in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 excess mortality using death certificates from the General Civil Registry. RESULTS: We detected vulnerable groups who belonged to economically unfavored sectors and experienced increased risk of COVID-19 outcomes. Cases living in marginalized municipalities with high population density experienced greater for COVID-19 outcomes. Additionally, policies to reduce vehicular mobility had differential impacts modified by social lag and urban population density. Finally, we report an under-registry of COVID-19 deaths along with an excess mortality closely related to marginalized and densely populated communities in an ambulatory setting. This could be attributable to a negative impact of modified hospital admission criteria during the pandemic.

Our study aims to describe changes in air pollution levels during the lockdown measures in the city of Barcelona (NE Spain), by studying the time evolution of atmospheric pollutants recorded at the urban background and traffic air quality monitoring stations. After two weeks of lockdown, urban air pollution markedly decreased but with substantial differences among pollutants. The most significant reduction was estimated for BC and NO2 (?45 to ?51%), pollutants mainly related to traffic emissions. A lower reduction was observed for PM10 (?28 to ?31.0%). By contrast, O3 levels increased (+33 to +57% of the 8 h daily maxima), probably due to lower titration of O3 by NO and the decrease of NOx in a VOC-limited environment. Relevant differences in the meteorology of these two periods were also evidenced. The low reduction for PM10 is probably related to a significant regional contribution and the prevailing secondary origin of fine aerosols, but an in-depth evaluation has to be carried out to interpret this lower decrease. There is no defined trend for the low SO2 levels, probably due to the preferential reduction in emissions from the least polluting ships. A reduction of most pollutants to minimal concentrations are expected for the forthcoming weeks because of the more restrictive actions implemented for a total lockdown, which entered into force on March 30th. There are still open questions on why PM10 levels were much less reduced than BC and NO2 and on what is the proportion of the abatement of pollution directly related to the lockdown, without meteorological interferences.","output":"Changes in air quality during the lockdown in Barcelona (Spain) one month into the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new Coronavirus (2019-nCov, renamed SARS-CoV-2) was identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, on March 11, 2020 As it is a highly infectious disease, major regional and national changes have been made,&amp;nbsp;social isolation was recommended, which led to the interruption of various services, including elective dental treatments This review aimed to identify the changes that occurred in the post-COVID-19 orthodontic practice scenario For such, a search was made for articles published in the bibliographic bases PubMed, Scopus and SciELO, using the keywords &quot;Orthodontics&quot;and &quot;Covid-19&quot; From the eligibility criteria, 11 articles were selected for analysis It was found that social isolation impacted the scheduling of orthodontic appointments and patient&#039;s anxiety about the duration of treatments The use of teleodontology proved to be an ally in screening and in patient care Preventive infection control must be adopted for safe orthodontic practice","output":"Panorama of Orthodontics after Covid-19: a Critical Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.

The guideline recommendations were developed by a consensus process with structured independent moderation. RESULTS 30 systematic reviews and 8 randomized controlled trials were analyzed. Among the study patients treated with either hysterectomy (by any technique) or an organ-preserving alternative, at least 75-94% were satisfied with their treatment. Vaginal hysterectomy was associated with lower complication rates, shorter procedure duration, and more rapid recovery than abdominal hysterectomy and is therefore the preferred technique. If vaginal hysterectomy is not possible, a laparoscopic approach should be considered. Abdominal hysterectomy should be reserved for special indications. In 2012, the frequency of abdominal hysterectomy in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland was lower than elsewhere in the world, at 15.7% , 28.0% , and 23.9% , respectively. Uterus-preserving techniques were associated with higher reintervention rates compared to hysterectomy (11-36% vs 4-10% ). CONCLUSION The main objective is to reduce the frequency of abdominal hysterectomy. Patients should be counseled and made aware of uterus-sparing alternatives to hysterectomy so that they are able to make informed decisions.","output":"Hysterectomy for Benign Uterine Disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to determine the association between chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), sociodemographic aspects, and health conditions with COVID-19 mortality in Colombia. METHODS: We performed an ecological study using data at the municipality level. We used COVID-19 data obtained from government public reports up to and including July 17th, 2020. We defined PM2.5 long-term exposure as the 2014-2018 average of the estimated concentrations at municipalities obtained from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service Reanalysis (CAMSRA) model. We fitted a logit-negative binomial hurdle model for the mortality rate adjusting for sociodemographic and health conditions. RESULTS: Estimated mortality rate ratios (MRR) for long-term average PM2.5 were not statistically significant in either of the two components of the hurdle model (i.e., the likelihood of reporting at least one death or the count of fatal cases). We found that having 10% or more of the population over 65 years of age (MRR = 3.91 95%CI 2.24-6.81), the poverty index (MRR = 1.03 95%CI 1.01-1.05), and the prevalence of hypertension over 6% (MRR = 1.32 95%CI1.03-1.68) are the main factors associated with death rate at the municipality level. Having higher hospital beds capacity is inversely correlated to mortality. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of an association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and COVID-19 mortality rate at the municipality level in Colombia. Demographics, health system capacity, and social conditions did have evidence of an ecological effect on COVID-19 mortality. The use of model-based estimations of long-term PM2.5 exposure includes an undetermined level of uncertainty in the results, and therefore they should be interpreted as preliminary evidence.","output":"Air pollution, sociodemographic and health conditions effects on COVID-19 mortality in Colombia: An ecological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Visualizing and comprehending 3-dimensional (3D) neuroanatomy is challenging. Cadaver dissection is limited by low availability, high cost, and the need for specialized facilities. New technologies, including 3D rendering of neuroimaging, 3D pictures, and 3D videos, are filling this gap and facilitating learning, but they also have limitations. This proof-of-concept study explored the feasibility of combining the spatial accuracy of 3D reconstructed neuroimaging data with realistic texture and fine anatomical details from 3D photogrammetry to create high-fidelity cadaveric neurosurgical simulations. METHODS: Four fixed and injected cadaver heads underwent neuroimaging. To create 3D virtual models, surfaces were rendered using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans, and segmented anatomical structures were created. A stepwise pterional craniotomy procedure was performed with synchronous neuronavigation and photogrammetry data collection. All points acquired in 3D navigational space were imported and registered in a 3D virtual model space. A novel machine learning-assisted monocular-depth estimation tool was used to create 3D reconstructions of 2-dimensional (2D) photographs. Depth maps were converted into 3D mesh geometry, which was merged with the 3D virtual models brain surface anatomy to test its accuracy. Quantitative measurements were used to validate the spatial accuracy of 3D reconstructions of different techniques. RESULTS: Successful multilayered 3D virtual models were created using volumetric neuroimaging data. The monocular-depth estimation technique created qualitatively accurate 3D representations of photographs. When 2 models were merged, 63% of surface maps were perfectly matched (mean [SD] deviation 0.7  1.9 mm; range ?7 to 7 mm). Maximal distortions were observed at the epicenter and toward the edges of the imaged surfaces. Virtual 3D models provided accurate virtual measurements (margin of error <1.5 mm) as validated by cross-measurements performed in a real-world setting. CONCLUSION: The novel technique of co-registering neuroimaging and photogrammetry-based 3D models can (1) substantially supplement anatomical knowledge by adding detail and texture to 3D virtual models, (2) meaningfully improve the spatial accuracy of 3D photogrammetry, (3) allow for accurate quantitative measurements without the need for actual dissection, (4) digitalize the complete surface anatomy of a cadaver, and (5) be used in realistic surgical simulations to improve neurosurgical education.","output":"Development and Validation of a Novel Methodological Pipeline to Integrate Neuroimaging and Photogrammetry for Immersive 3D Cadaveric Neurosurgical Simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we report the coding complete genome sequences of 23 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) strains from the Philippines.

BACKGROUND Optic neuritis is a common presenting feature of both NMO and MS. Distinguishing between NMO and RRMS is important in guiding treatment, but biomarkers of NMO and MS can be absent early in the disease process. We looked for differences in MRI characteristics of optic neuritis associated with NMO and MS that provide an early clue in the diagnostic workup. DESIGN/METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of 26 NMO and 26 RRMS patients presenting to the Johns Hopkins Hospital with MRI-confirmed acute optic neuritis. Magnetic resonance images were assessed to identify the location and longitudinal extent of each contrast enhancing lesion. For the purposes of this study, the optic nerve was divided into intraorbital, canalicular, prechiasmal, chiasmal, and optic tract. RESULTS There are distinct differences in MRI characteristics between NMO-associated and RRMS-associated optic neuritis. The majority of NMO lesions were longitudinally extensive measuring at least 17.6 mm in length and involving at least 3 optic nerve segments. At a cut-off of 17.6 mm of lesion length, the specificity for NMO is 76.9% with a sensitivity of 80.8% and a positive likelihood ratio of 3.50. Conversely, MS lesions were more commonly focal in 1 optic nerve segment localized anteriorly. CONCLUSIONS Optic neuritis in NMO has a distinct pattern on MRI as compared with RRMS and can help differentiate these 2 neuroinflammatory diseases at presentation.","output":"Literature Commentary."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vietnam's automobile industry is undergoing transformational change as the country is pursuing global and regional economic integration.

The fabrication of a hybrid catalyst based on reduced graphene oxide-titania (rGO-TiO2), was first achieved in a single mode microwave cavity by reducing the precursor consisting of graphene oxide (GO) and titania. Catalytic performance was then assessed in both microwave assisted and conventional heat treatment conditions. The hybrid catalyst showed significant improvement under microwave irradiation, with more than 88% dye degradation after 20 minutes of treatment at 120 C. The microwave effect was found to be more dominant in the early stages of the catalysis - the hybrid catalyst decomposed a65% of the dye in just 5 minutes of microwave treatment compared to only 18% degradation obtained during conventional heating. The improved performance with microwaves is mainly attributed to the formation of the hot spots at the surface of the hybrid catalyst which ultimately results in higher degradation rates. The morphological and catalytic properties of the hybrid catalyst are investigated using High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) and UV-Vis Spectroscopy, respectively. Successful reduction of GO to rGO was confirmed using Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The outstanding performance of microwave irradiated hybrids offers a viable low energy, low carbon footprint process with a new catalyst for wastewater treatment and for highly polluted wastewater conditions where photocatalysis is deemed not feasible.","output":"Enhanced catalytic performance of reduced graphene oxide-TiO2 hybrids for efficient water treatment using microwave irradiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monadic decomposability is a notion of variable independence, which asks whether a given formula in a first-order theory is expressible as a Boolean combination of monadic predicates in the theory. Recently, Veanes et al. showed the usefulness of monadic decomposability in the context of SMT (i.e. the input formula is quantifier-free), and found various interesting applications including string analysis. However, checking monadic decomposability is undecidable in general. Decidability for certain theories is known (e.g. Presburger Arithmetic, Tarskis Real-Closed Field), but there are very few results regarding their computational complexity. In this paper, we study monadic decomposability of integer linear arithmetic in the setting of SMT. We show that this decision problem is coNP-complete and, when monadically decomposable, a formula admits a decomposition of exponential size in the worst case. We provide a new application of our results to string constraint solving with length constraints. We then extend our results to variadic decomposability, where predicates could admit multiple free variables (in contrast to monadic decomposability). Finally, we give an application to quantifier elimination in integer linear arithmetic where the variables in a block of quantifiers, if independent, could be eliminated with an exponential (instead of the standard doubly exponential) blow-up.","output":"Monadic Decomposition in Integer Linear Arithmetic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The authors describe a method by which they easily and atraumatically navigate a large-bore reperfusion catheter of the Penumbra system to an embolus by using a coaxial system with a compliant balloon catheter in patients with tortuous arteries. METHODS A retrospective review of the prospective endovascular database was performed to identify cases in which a coaxial system with a compliant balloon catheter (Scepter C, MicroVention/Terumo; or TransForm C, Stryker Neurovascular) and a large-bore reperfusion catheter of the Penumbra system (Penumbra, Inc.) was used. The authors achieved a stable guiding sheath position and delivered the coaxial system with a compliant balloon catheter and a large-bore reperfusion catheter. Then, the balloon was inflated somewhat when the distal tip of the balloon was slightly advanced from the tip of the reperfusion catheter, and together the coaxial system was advanced to an embolus over a 0.014-in guidewire, even around the corner. When the distal tip of the balloon catheter reached the embolus, the authors deflated the balloon and navigated the large-bore reperfusion catheter to the embolus. Finally, the aspiration of the embolus with the Penumbra MAX pump was begun. RESULTS Between May 2014 and September 2015, the authors used this technique in 17 cases: 16 cases of middle cerebral artery occlusion (including 5 cases of internal carotid artery occlusion) and 1 case of basilar artery occlusion (age range 36-88 years, mean age 74.7 years, 13 men). For the reperfusion catheter of the Penumbra system, the 5MAX ACE was used in 15 cases, and the 5MAX was used in 2 cases. As a compliant balloon catheter, the Scepter C was used in 16 cases, and the TransForm C was used in 1 case. The technique was successful in 16 cases (94.1%). No parent artery dissections were noted in any cases. Catheter-induced vasospasm was noted in 1 case, but the vasospasm was transient.

Current living practices, in particular, have exposed the weaknesses of specific sectors, such as mobility, public spaces, the health care system and the welfare system. The present study reflects on the fragility of the health care system caused by an excessive fragmentation of policies and inconsistent regional setups, which have had repercussions on the administration of swab tests. We examine two regions, namely Lombardy and Veneto, where such differences stand out. In Lombardy, testing was limited and sluggish, which left the epidemic spread largely unchecked and forced Covid-19 testing to be carried out exclusively on patients with symptoms in hospitals. In addition to overburdening hospitals, this resulted in very limited swab-testing of the population: only the elderly. Veneto, on the other hand, adopted different swab-testing procedures, carried out not only among hospital patients but also on asymptomatic and non-hospitalized persons. This depends on the different organization and setup of the regional health care system. It follows that even a national-scale comparison of regional data in the three epidemic phases, which suggests an overall lowering of the average age for infected persons with great regional variations, ought to be taken with caution, given the dissimilar regional implementation of swab-testing.","output":"Chapter 5.3 The Italian health care system and swab testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic is a stressful experience that is particularly likely to negatively affect cancer patients.

METHODS: This population-based retrospective cohort study used de-identified health administrative database housed at ICES and included residents of Ontario, younger than 18 years of age, who underwent ambulatory surgery between 2014 and 2018. Patients were not involved in the design of this study. The proportion of ED visit and HA were calculated for the total cohort, and the type of surgery.

DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real time analysis. SETTING: 208 acute care hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland between 6 February and 19 April 2020. A case report form developed by ISARIC and WHO was used to collect clinical data. A minimal follow-up time of two weeks (to 3 May 2020) allowed most patients to complete their hospital admission. PARTICIPANTS: 20 133 hospital inpatients with covid-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Admission to critical care (high dependency unit or intensive care unit) and mortality in hospital. RESULTS: The median age of patients admitted to hospital with covid-19, or with a diagnosis of covid-19 made in hospital, was 73 years (interquartile range 58-82, range 0-104). More men were admitted than women (men 60%, n=12 068; women 40%, n=8065). The median duration of symptoms before admission was 4 days (interquartile range 1-8). The commonest comorbidities were chronic cardiac disease (31%, 5469/17 702), uncomplicated diabetes (21%, 3650/17 599), non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease (18%, 3128/17 634), and chronic kidney disease (16%, 2830/17 506); 23% (4161/18 525) had no reported major comorbidity. Overall, 41% (8199/20 133) of patients were discharged alive, 26% (5165/20 133) died, and 34% (6769/20 133) continued to receive care at the reporting date. 17% (3001/18 183) required admission to high dependency or intensive care units; of these, 28% (826/3001) were discharged alive, 32% (958/3001) died, and 41% (1217/3001) continued to receive care at the reporting date.

Case series suggest that patients with COVID-19 have more severe strokes; however, no large series have compared stroke outcomes with contemporary non-COVID-19 patients. Purpose was to analyze the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in stroke care and to evaluate stroke outcomes according to the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective multicenter cohort study including consecutive acute stroke patients admitted to 7 stroke centers from February 25 to April 25, 2020 (first 2 months of the COVID-19 outbreak in Madrid). The quality of stroke care was measured by the number of admissions, recanalization treatments, and time metrics. The primary outcome was death or dependence at discharge. RESULTS: A total of 550 acute stroke patients were admitted. A significant reduction in the number of admissions and secondary interhospital transfers was found. COVID-19 was confirmed in 105 (19.1%) patients, and a further 19 patients were managed as suspected COVID-19 (3.5%). No differences were found in the rates of reperfusion therapies in ischemic strokes (45.5% non-COVID-19, 35.7% confirmed COVID-19, and 40% suspected COVID-19; P=0.265). However, the COVID-19 group had longer median door-to-puncture time (110 versus 80 minutes), which was associated with the performance of chest computed tomography.

The country has also experienced the worst economic recession in its history, with real GDP contracting 7% in 2020. This paper describes Colombia's pre-pandemic context and the overall effect of the pandemic on health and economic indicators and examines the government's response to COVID-19. Methods Descriptive chronologic policy analysis on the COVID-19 pandemic in Colombia and the measures and interventions implemented, using publicly available secondary data from Colombia's government and international sources published from March 2020 to February 2022. Results The Colombian healthcare system increased its capacity in terms of infrastructure and human resources (from 8.6 ICU beds per 100,000 pre-pandemic to 21.9 in 2020, from 1.7 and 1.3 per 1,000 doctors and nurses, respectively in 2019 to 1.8 and 1.5 per 1,000 in 2020). The government started the National Vaccination Strategy on February 17, 2021, despite a slow start it managed to achieve 65.1% of its population, including Venezuelan immigrants, fully vaccinated by February 2022. Conclusions Colombia's response to the pandemic combines hits and misses. The country organized an early and robust response;increased its healthcare system capacity;designed a risk-based, equitable, and inclusive national vaccination strategy;and introduced a flexible and responsive vaccine rollout. However, the government chose the wrong timing for reform, implemented a long and unpredictable lockdown, was late to procure COVID-19 vaccines and has not appropriately tackled vaccine hesitancy. PUBLIC INTEREST SUMMARY Colombia has been hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 138,000 COVID-19 deaths and over 6 million cases by the end of February 2022. According to number of deaths per 100,000 people, Colombia ranks 22nd in the world, amongst 187 countries. The country has also experienced the worst economic recession in its history. The Colombian healthcare system has been able to cope with a high number of COVID-19 cases without collapsing, but some public health indicators deteriorated. Colombia's response to the pandemic combines hits and misses. The country organized an early and robust response;increased its healthcare system capacity;designed a risk-based, equitable, and inclusive national vaccination strategy;and introduced a flexible and responsive vaccine rollout. As of February, 2022, Colombia has fully vaccinated 65.1% of its population. However, the government chose the wrong timing for a tax reform, implemented a long and unpredictable lockdown, was late to procure COVID-19 vaccines and has not appropriately tackled vaccine hesitancy, which certainly contributed to its undesirable position in the mortality world raking.","output":"Covid-19 Response in Colombia: Hits and Misses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by a novel betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), similar to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which cause acute respiratory distress syndrome and case fatalities. COVID-19 disease severity is worse in older obese patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung disease. Cell binding and entry of betacoronaviruses is via their surface spike glycoprotein; SARS-CoV binds to the metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), MERS-CoV utilizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and recent modeling of the structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein predicts that it can interact with human DPP4 in addition to ACE2. DPP4 is a ubiquitous membrane-bound aminopeptidase that circulates in plasma; it is multifunctional with roles in nutrition, metabolism, and immune and endocrine systems. DPP4 activity differentially regulates glucose homeostasis and inflammation via its enzymatic activity and nonenzymatic immunomodulatory effects. The importance of DPP4 for the medical community has been highlighted by the approval of DPP4 inhibitors, or gliptins, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This review discusses the dysregulation of DPP4 in COVID-19 comorbid conditions; DPP4 activity is higher in older individuals and increased plasma DPP4 is a predictor of the onset of metabolic syndrome. DPP4 upregulation may be a determinant of COVID-19 disease severity, which creates interest regarding the use of gliptins in management of COVID-19. Also, knowledge of the chemistry and biology of DPP4 could be utilized to develop novel therapies to block viral entry of some betacoronaviruses, potentially including SARS-CoV-2.","output":"COVID-19 and comorbidities: A role for dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) in disease severity?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Large-scale development interventions have long failed to accommodate the needs and preferences of pastoralists or the systems of resource governance and land tenure upon which they rely. However, advocates of rights-based approaches to development emphasise the importance of community participation in planning and agenda-setting, and in Kenya, public participation is a formal constitutional requirement for government decision-making processes. In 2015, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees concluded negotiations with local stakeholders about the use of 15 km(2) of communal rangelands to build a new refugee settlement in Turkana County, Kenya. Negotiations entailed a community dialogue process involving local people living in the vicinity of the proposed settlement. This paper retrospectively examines the inclusivity of the dialogue process, with particular attention to the involvement of pastoralists and the representation of their interests. Interviews and focus groups conducted with a range of key informants and community stakeholders highlighted two key problems. First, negotiations relied upon a simplistic approach to communal land tenure that overlooked the complexity of overlapping and often contested access rights. Second, there was an over-reliance on urban professionals and politicians as intermediaries between rural communities and development actors. Even where elite intermediaries act in good faith, they may introduce an oppidan bias into development policies, thereby marginalising the viewpoints of non-urban, non-sedentary demographics, such as pastoralists. I conclude with recommendations for the UNHCR to develop a more explicit strategy for direct engagement with host community stakeholders in Turkana and with increased attention to the interests of livestock producers and the nuances of pastoralist land use.","output":"Community engagement in pastoralist areas: Lessons from the public dialogue process for a new refugee settlement in Turkana, Kenya"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of new nanomaterials and nanotechnologies has -provided many new opportunities for (bio)sensing systems.

This immune response leads to excessive production and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause clinical signs characteristic of COVID-19 such as decreased oxygen saturation, alteration of hemoglobin properties, decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, vasoconstriction, elevated cytokines, cardiac and/or renal injury, enhanced D-dimer, leukocytosis, and an increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio. Particularly, neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO) is thought to be especially abundant and, as a result, contributes substantially to oxidative stress and the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Conversely, melatonin, a potent MPO inhibitor, has been noted for its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, and neuroprotective actions. Melatonin has been proposed as a safe therapeutic agent for COVID-19 recently, having been given with a US Food and Drug Administration emergency authorized cocktail, REGEN-COV2, for management of COVID-19 progression.

The sera of 23 confirmed COVID-19 patients were processed for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM detection. Three different immunoassays, viz. Abbott Architect(?) SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, and two quantitative tests, ANSH(?) SARS-CoV-2 and AESKULISA(?) SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein (NP), were performed and the results pooled, from diagnosis to serum collection. Seroconversion rates were computed for all 3 assays, and possible correlations were tested using the Pearson correlation coefficient and Cohens kappa coefficient. Overall, 70 combinations of qualitative and quantitative IgG and IgM results were pooled and analyzed. In the early phase (0-4 days after diagnosis), in all tests, IgG seroconversion rates were 43%-61%, and increased in all tests gradually to 100% after 15 days. The Pearson correlation coefficient showed a strong positive relationship between the qualitative IgG test results and both quantitative IgG tests. IgM detection was inconsistent, with maximal concentrations and seroconversion rates between 10-15 days after diagnosis and slight-to-fair agreement between the two quantitative immunoassays. There was no significant association between mortality with IgG or IgM seroconversion or concentrations. Patients with severe COVID-19 develop an early, robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral immune response involving IgG immunoglobulins.

With the impact being less than predicted, on May 26, 2020, elective surgeries and non-essential activities were permitted to resume. OBJECTIVES: To examine outcomes following elective aesthetic surgery and the impact on the Canadian health care system with the resumption of these services during the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic. METHODS: Data was collected in a prospective manner on consecutive patients undergoing elective plastic surgery procedures in six accredited ambulatory surgery facilities. Data included patient demographics, procedural characteristics, COVID-19 PCR test status, airway management and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: 368 patients underwent elective surgical procedures requiring a general anesthetic. All 368 patients that underwent surgery were negative on pre visit screening. A COVID-19 PCR test was completed by 352 patients (95.7%) and all were negative. In the postoperative period, seven patients (1.9%) had complications, three patients (0.8%) required a hospital visit, and one patient (0.3%) required hospital admission. No patients or health care providers developed COVID-19 symptoms or had a positive test for COVID-19 within 30 days of surgery. CONCLUSIONS: With appropriate screening and safety precautions, elective aesthetic plastic surgery can be performed in a manner that is safe for patients and health care providers and with a very low risk for accelerating virus transmission within the community.","output":"The Safe Resumption of Elective Plastic Surgery in Accredited Ambulatory Surgery Facilities During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spreading of epidemics is very much determined by the structure of the contact network, which may be impacted by the mobility dynamics of the individuals themselves.

Here, we present a discrete-time, metapopulation-based model to describe the transmission of susceptible-infected-susceptible-like diseases that take place in confined scenarios where the mobilities of the individuals are not random but, rather, follow clear recurrent travel patterns. This model allows analytical determination of the onset of epidemics, as well as the ability to discern which contact structures are most suited to prevent the infection to spread.

He received an ABOi living donor liver graft followed by a course of plasma exchange and rituximab after which standard immunosuppression was used.

However, vaccination takes place in a dynamic environment. For example, new variants of the disease may occur where the effectiveness of a vaccine lies below that of the original target of the vaccine, while changes in the behaviour of a population are accompanied by a changed basic reproduction number. Here, we aim to understand how changes in values of basic parameters affect the benefits of vaccination at the direct level, of the individuals vaccinated, and at the indirect level, of the wider, unvaccinated community. We work within the framework of a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model, and produce a metric for the benefits of vaccination, at both direct and indirect levels, in terms of the number of avoided deaths. Taking into account the initial prevalence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, the mortality rate of the disease, the basic reproduction number, the vaccination rate, and the effectiveness of a vaccine, we explore how these basic parameters affect the benefits of vaccination. We find a range of situations where indirect benefits of vaccination outweigh direct benefits. This especially occurs at lower rates of vaccination (20% C [Formula: see text] ) and intermediate values of the basic reproduction number (1C1.5). The indirect benefits can be substantial, in some cases being more than 400% of the direct benefits.

Despite this, trials reporting anxiety-related outcomes in this population are uncommon, particularly with regards to monotherapies. METHODS: Patients (n = 31) with both bipolar I or II disorder in current depressive episodes were enrolled in a six-week, open-label, single-center trial assessing the efficacy of lithium monotherapy in treating symptoms depression and comorbid anxiety. Patients were mostly medication-free and lithium-na?ve at baseline. RESULTS: Significant improvements in depression (HAMD) and anxiety (HAM-A) were observed at the six-week endpoint, with remission and response rates greater than 50%. There was a positive correlation between endpoint HAM-A scores and HAM-D scores, r = 0.80, (p < 0.01). Improvements were realized at low serum lithium concentrations (0.49  0.20 mEq/L). LIMITATIONS: Lack of placebo control and small sample size warrants validation in larger randomized studies.

To investigate the introduction, spread, and epidemiology of COVID-19 in the Boston area, we sequenced and analyzed 772 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the region, including nearly all confirmed cases within the first week of the epidemic and hundreds of cases from major outbreaks at a conference, a nursing facility, and among homeless shelter guests and staff. The data reveal over 80 introductions into the Boston area, predominantly from elsewhere in the United States and Europe. We studied two superspreading events covered by the data, events that led to very different outcomes because of the timing and populations involved. One produced rapid spread in a vulnerable population but little onward transmission, while the other was a major contributor to sustained community transmission, including outbreaks in homeless populations, and was exported to several other domestic and international sites. The same two events differed significantly in the number of new mutations seen, raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 superspreading might encompass disparate transmission dynamics. Our results highlight the failure of measures to prevent importation into MA early in the outbreak, underscore the role of superspreading in amplifying an outbreak in a major urban area, and lay a foundation for contact tracing informed by genetic data.","output":"Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in the Boston area highlights the role of recurrent importation and superspreading events."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There are increasing numbers of reports of cognitive activity, consciousness, awareness and recall related to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and interventions such as the use of sedative and analgesic drugs during CPR.

METHODS: A literature search was conducted of Medline, Embase and CINAHL from inception to 21 October 2021. We included case studies, observational studies, review studies and grey literature. RESULTS: We identified 8 observational studies including 40,317 patients and 464 rescuers, and 26 case reports including 33 patients. The reported prevalence of CPR-induced consciousness was between 0.23% to 0.9% of resuscitation attempts, with 48C59% of experienced professional rescuers surveyed estimated to have observed CPR-induced consciousness. CPR-induced consciousness is associated with professional rescuer CPR, witnessed arrest, a shockable rhythm, increased return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and survival to hospital discharge when compared to patients without CPR-induced consciousness. Few studies of sedation for CPR-induced consciousness were identified. Although local protocols for treating CPR-induced consciousness exist, there is no widely accepted guidance.

Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in patients with respiratory diseases, and patients who receive vitamin D have significantly larger improvements in inspiratory muscle strength and maximal oxygen uptake. Studies have provided an opportunity to determine which proteins link vitamin D to respiratory pathology, including the major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, vitamin D receptor, vitamin D-binding protein, chromosome P450, Toll-like receptors, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, and the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Vitamin D also exerts its effect on respiratory diseases through cell signaling mechanisms, including matrix metalloproteinases, mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway, prostaglandins, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide synthase. In conclusion, vitamin D plays a significant role in respiratory diseases.

METHODS From January 2011 until August 2012, all operable patients were scheduled to undergo minimally invasive oesophagectomy (MIE) with intrathoracic anastomosis. Patient characteristics, complications, morbidity and mortality were prospectively registered and analysed. RESULTS Forty-five patients underwent MIE with intrathoracic stapled end-to-side anastomosis. Major changes in operative technique were made 2 times due to non-satisfactory results, dividing the patients into 3 groups. One patient in group 1 died. The anastomotic leakage rate decreased from 44% in group 1 to 0% in groups 2 and 3 (p = 0.007). The pulmonary complication rate decreased from 67% in group 1 to 44% in group 2 (not significant, NS) and 22% in group 3 (p = 0.04). The median hospital stay decreased from 17 days in group 1 to 14 days in group 2 (NS) and 8 days in group 3 (p < 0.001). There were no stenoses, no dilatations and no patients with recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. CONCLUSIONS The introduction of the intrathoracic anastomosis led to favourable functional results but was initially associated with considerable morbidity.

In Colombia, forecasts are not yet counted. OBJECTIVE: To assess the factors associated with the development of severe disease in hospitalized patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the prognostic factors for the outcome of mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an ambispective cohort study in hospitalized patients at the Fundacin Cadioinfantil from March to June, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 104 patients analyzed, 31.7% (n=33) had a severe presentation and 9.6% (n=10) had a mortality outcome. For mortality, the most important prognostic factor was the development of severe disease followed by age over 60 years and malnutrition. For the development of the severe disease, prognostic factors were a history of hemodialysis (HR=135), diabetes (HR=4.4), and an increased level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (HR=1,004), while the lymphocyte count over 1,064 was a protective factor (HR=0.9). In the classification of patients, the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) score in the high and low-risk categories corresponded to the best performance. There was no difference between the treatments administered. CONCLUSIONS: The most important prognostic factors for mortality were being over 60 years of age, hypertension, diabetes, and cirrhosis, while for the development of severe disease they were chronic kidney disease with hemodialysis, NEWS2 with high risk at admission, increased levels of LDH and C reactive protein (CRP), and leukocytosis.","output":"Factores pronsticos en pacientes hospitalizados con diagnstico de infeccin por SARS-CoV-2 en Bogot, Colombia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because of the evolutionary variants of SARS-CoV-2, development of broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies resilient to virus escape is urgently needed.

The structures show that NB1A7 targets the highly conserved cryptic epitope shared by SARS-CoV-2 variants and some other coronaviruses and blocks ACE2 receptor attachment of the spike protein, and NB1B11 epitope overlaps with the contacting surface of ACE2 and is different from the binding site of NB1A7. These two nanobodies were covalently linked into multivalent and bi-paratopic formats, which significantly improved the avidity and neutralization potency and may further inhibit viral escape.

In related fields, technology acceptance models have been employed to explain users' adoption of technology and to inform the advancement of empirically supported technological resources. AIMS: To determine the factors that influence SLTs' use of technology for clinical practice by testing a model of their technology acceptance and use. METHODS & PROCEDURES: We surveyed 209 practising SLTs in the United States representative of the speech and language membership of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA). Participants completed a 38-item electronic survey representing four categories: (1) technology use, (2) technology attitudes and factors influencing technology use, (3) employment information and (4) demographics. Items measuring technology attitudes served as indicators of the research model, which mapped the primary relationships of a technology acceptance model. Survey data were collected before the Covid-19 pandemic. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: The research model accounted for 66% of the variance in SLTs' behavioural intention to use technology, which significantly and positively predicted the amount of time they reportedly spent using technology in the workplace. Subjective norms and attitudes towards technology use directly predicted the intention to use technology. Perceived usefulness and ease of use indirectly predicted intention to use technology. Survey respondents reported using technology during 48% (SD = 24%) of their overall weekly work hours on average, with a large majority reporting using technology at least once per week for planning (89% of respondents), assessment (66% of respondents) or intervention (90% of respondents). CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: These findings statistically explain the relationships between SLTs' attitudes and their intention to use technology for clinical practice, contributing to our understanding of why SLTs adopt certain technologies. We also detail the nature and frequency of technology use in the clinical practice of SLTs. Future directions for this work include further exploring use categories, employing direct measurements of technology use and exploring the impact of recent changes in SLT service delivery due to the Covid-19 pandemic on SLTs' technology attitudes. What this paper adds What is already known on the subject Existing research about the adoption and use of technological resources by SLTs indicates that they select tools based on convenience, cost and recommendations by others. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This study is the first to develop and test a research model of SLTs' technology attitudes. The findings from model testing demonstrate the significant predictors of SLTs' behavioural intention to use technology for clinical purposes. Intent of use is related to how much SLTs use technology in the workplace. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work?

Special attention is paid to near-patient surfaces but less so for sites outside the patient zone. This paper presents data on keyboard contamination and the risk of pathogen transmission from keyboards. METHODS Keyboards from nursing stations in three hospitals and a dental practice were analysed for bacterial contamination. Surfaces were pre-treated to remove planktonic bacteria so that any remaining bacteria were presumed to be associated with biofilm. Bacterial transfer from keyboard keys was studied following wiping with sterile water or sodium hypochlorite. The presence of multidrug resistant organisms (MDRO) was sought using selective culture. RESULTS Moist swabbing did not detect bacteria from any keyboard samples. Use of enrichment broth, however, demonstrated MDRO from most samples. Gram-negative bacteria were recovered from almost half (45%) samples, with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus and MDR-Acinetobacter from 72%, 31% and 17% of samples, respectively. Isolates were transferred from 69% samples after wiping with sterile water, and from 54% samples after wiping with 1,000 ppm sodium hypochlorite. DISCUSSION While moist swabbing failed to detect bacteria from keyboards, pathogens were recovered using enrichment culture. Use of water or NaOCl-soaked wipes transferred bacteria from most samples tested. Our study implies that hospital keyboards situated outside the patient zone, commonly harbour dry surface biofilms (DSB) that offer a potential reservoir for transferable pathogens. While the role of keyboards in transmission is uncertain, we should pursue effective solutions for eliminating DSB from keyboards.","output":"How dirty is your QUERTY?

Coping with mental and physical stressors amidst the global lockdown is especially strenuous for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and more (LGBT+) community, who are frequently subjected to social stigma and minority stress. Systematic stigma and discrimination place LGBT+ individuals at higher risk for deleterious behaviors, such as substance abuse (e.g., injection drug use, smoking, alcohol) and risky sexual practices (e.g., anal/vaginal/oral sex). Maladaptive coping behaviors consequently increase the chances of HIV/AIDS risk among LGBT+ individuals, compared to heterosexual individuals.

The purpose of our research is to examine the relations between the competences of crisis management in healthcare facilities and the performance of employees, measured during the acute stage of the crisis by their feeling of satisfaction, safety and creation of conditions for work, whereby we assume that these variables are mutually interlinked by the sharing of information, teamwork and cognitive diversity of the work teams. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire survey was created and used based on a sample of 216 mid-level managers of health care facilities in Slovakia, which took place during the first month after the outbreak of the crisis (during the month of March/April 2020). The Baron and Kenny mediator model has been used for research purposes and the FreedmanCSchatzkin test has been used to test the mediator effect. Regression analysis has been used to verify the hypotheses. The control variables were the size of the healthcare facility based on the number of employees, gender and age of the manager, his position in the management hierarchy and the duration of practice in a management position. The ANOVA analysis of variance was used to analyze multiple dependencies. The level of significance was 5%. The research sample consisted of 216 managers at different types of healthcare facilities. RESULTS: The hypothesis for the dependency between the crisis competences of management and performance of teams during the acute stage of the crisis, facilitated by sharing information, teamwork and cognitive diversity of crisis management was confirmed. It is a multilateral incomplete mediation, where almost two thirds of the total effect are facilitated by mediators, of which the sharing of information has the greatest effect (35%).

However, there are a few of reports on its application in the prevention and treatment of obesity. And the molecular mechanism on the anti-obesity of mulberry leaf are unknown till now. PURPOSE: The present study aimed to evaluate the potential ingredients and targets of mulberry leaf and uncover the anti-obesity mechanisms by using the network pharmacology tactics and verify its effect by biological experiments. STUDY DESIGN: Active ingredients and key targets of mulberry leaf, genes related to obesity were screened through public database. Based on the results of network pharmacology, the flavonoids-enriched fraction of mulberry leaf (MLF) was extracted and composition of this fraction was identified. After that, HepG2 cells model of lipid accumulation was established for verifying the effect of MLF and related mechanisms. RESULTS: A total of 37 active ingredients in mulberry leaf, 192 predicted biological targets and 8813 obesity-related targets were determined, of which 180 overlapping targets might have obvious curative effects on obesity. The networks showed that mulberry leaf might play a role through key targets, such as AKT, MAPK and IL-6, and regulated PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Based on HPLC-ESI-QQQ-MS analysis, 13 constituents of MLF were identified, including 9 flavonoids. Furthermore, HepG2 cells model of lipid accumulation was established. The results indicated that MLF treatment could down-regulate the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, as well as clearly inhibited lipid droplets formation and alleviated TC, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C levels. Positive effect was observed on hypolipidemic efficacy due to the regulation of PI3K/Akt/Bcl-xl pathway, as indicated by the amelioration of PI3K, Akt and Bcl-xl gene and protein expression. CONCLUSION: This study firstly systematically disclose the multi-ingredients, multi-targets mechanisms of mulberry leaf on obesity by using network pharmacology approach, and validate in HepG2 cells that the protective effect of MLF against obesity involved both inflammation response and lipid metabolism involving PI3K/Akt/Bcl-xl signaling pathway.

However, research mainly originates in resource-rich settings in high-income countries. Often, it is impractical to apply recommendations based on these investigations to resource-constrained settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We report on a set of pragmatic recommendations for tracheostomy, discharge, and rehabilitation measures in hospitalized patients recovering from severe COVID-19 in LMICs. We recommend that tracheostomy be performed in a negative pressure room or negative pressure operating room, if possible, and otherwise in a single room with a closed door. We recommend using the technique that is most familiar to the institution and that can be conducted most safely. We recommend using fit-tested enhanced personal protection equipment, with the fewest people required, and incorporating strategies to minimize aerosolization of the virus. For recovering patients, we suggest following local, regional, or national hospital discharge guidelines. If these are lacking, we suggest deisolation and hospital discharge using symptom-based criteria, rather than with testing. We likewise suggest taking into consideration the capability of primary caregivers to provide the necessary care to meet the psychological, physical, and neurocognitive needs of the patient","output":"Pragmatic Recommendations for Tracheostomy, Discharge, and Rehabilitation Measures in Hospitalized Patients Recovering From Severe COVID-19 in Low- and Middle-Income Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explains the extent to which the export-led growth strategies deployed in Germany and Italy turn out to be self-defeating The problem lies in the impact of those strategies on the banking systems of the two countries The German banks become more international;the Italian banks become more locally oriented In turn, these changes create tensions that cannot be reconciled easily within the institutional framework that made the export-led growth model successful in the first place The paper also seeks to explain why tensions in export-led growth models today do not always resemble those it experienced in the pastCand it examines what are the implications both for how the two countries responded to the economic and financial crisis and how they are responding to the economic consequences of the novel coronavirus pandemic ? 2021 Association for the Study of German Politics","output":"The Financial Consequences of Export-led Growth in Germany and Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kurzarbeit (KA), Germanys short-time work program, is widely credited with saving jobs and supporting domestic demand during the COVID-19 recession.

Once the disease progressed to severe phase, clinical prognosis of patients will significantly deteriorate. Methods: : This was a multicenter retrospective study on patients of all adult inpatients (18 years old) from Tianyou Hospital (Wuhan, China) and the Fourth Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine. All 139 patients had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in their early stage, which is defined as within 7 days of clinical symptoms or within 7 days of positive viral nucleic acid test for asymptomatic patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the predictive factors in the early detection of patients who may subsequently develop into severe cases. Results: : Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the higher level of hypersensitivity C-reactive protein (OR=4.77, 95% CI:1.92-11.87, P =0.001), elevated alanine aminotransferase (OR=6.87, 95%CI:1.56-30.21, P =0.011) and chronic comorbidities (OR=11.48, 95% CI:4.44-29.66, P <0.001) are the determining risk factors for the progression into severe pneumonia in COVID-19 patients.

What is added by this report?Data from nine mechanistic models project substantial resurgences of COVID-19 across the US resulting from the more transmissible Delta variant. These resurgences, which have now been observed in most states, were projected to occur across most of the US, coinciding with school and business reopening. Reaching higher vaccine coverage in July--December 2021 reduces the size and duration of the projected resurgence substantially. The expected impact of the outbreak is largely concentrated in a subset of states with lower vaccination coverage. What are the implications for public health practice?Renewed efforts to increase vaccination uptake are critical to limiting transmission and disease, particularly in states with lower current vaccination coverage. Reaching higher vaccination goals in the coming months can potentially avert 1.5 million cases and 21,000 deaths and improve the ability to safely resume social contacts, and educational and business activities.

'Venetian blinds' technique of plication in combination with mesh reinforcement, is totally intra-corporeal, with hernia defect and sac plication to reduce seroma formation. While laparoscopic suturing of the abdominal wall can represent a technical challenge, pre-operative botulinum toxin A (BTA) injections as an adjunct can assist. This study aims to demonstrate feasibility and efficacy of this technique in abdominal wall hernia repair, with BTA adjunct in midline hernias. METHODS A single-centre case series was conducted using minimally invasive 'Venetian blinds' technique for repair of complex ventral abdominal hernias. Twelve patients (seven midline, five non-midline) underwent repair (11 laparoscopic; one robotic). Midline hernias received BTA (200-300 units Botox) 4-6 weeks prior to surgery. Repairs were mesh-reinforced following fascial closure. RESULTS Twelve (10 female, two male) patients, with a median age 72 years (range 31-83) and body mass index of 27.3 kg/m2 (range 22.8-61.7) were included. The median length of operation was 133 min (range 45-290) and length of hospital stay 3 days (range 1-28). To date there has been no recurrence of hernia. A single symptomatic seroma was treated with antibiotics and did not require mesh removal. One patient developed hospital-acquired pneumonia and pseudomembranous colitis.

Despite the increased risk, the best surveillance strategy and management of exposed HWs are not yet well known. The aim of this review was to summarize and critically analyze the existing evidence related to this topic in order to support public health strategies aimed at protecting HWs in the hospital setting. MAIN TEXT: A comprehensive computerized literature research from 1 January 2020 up to 22 May 2020 was made to identify studies analyzing the burden of infection, risk assessment, surveillance and management of HWs exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Among 1623 citation identified using MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar and manual search, we included 43 studies, 14 webpages and 5 ongoing trials. Health workers have a high risk of acquiring infection while caring for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. In particular, some types exposures and their duration, as well as the inadequate or non-use of personal protective equipment (PPE) are associated with increased infection risk. Strict infection prevention and control procedures (IPC), adequate training programs on the appropriate use of PPE and close monitoring of HWs with symptom surveillance and testing are essential to significantly reduce the risk. At the moment there is not enough evidence to provide precise indications regarding pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). CONCLUSIONS: During the spread of COVID-19 outbreak, numerous published papers investigated the epidemiology, risk assessment and prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2. However, more high-quality studies are needed to provide valid recommendations for better management and for the clinical and microbiological surveillance of healthcare personnel.","output":"Burden, risk assessment, surveillance and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health workers: a scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Self-reported chemosensory dysfunction in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 patients is common.

Addressing TB, COVID-19 and migration from a syndemic perspective, not only draws systematic attention to comorbidity and the relevance of social and structural context, but also helps to find solutions: the true reality of syndemic interactions can only be fully understood by considering a particular population and bio- social context, and ensuring that they receive the comprehensive care that they need.

CPS are increasingly involved as partners in research studies. However, most research ethics training in the protection of human subjects is designed for people who, unlike CPS, have had exposure to prior formal research training. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the perspectives of CPS in completing the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative Social and Behavioral Responsible Conduct of Research online training. METHODS: A total of 5 CPS were recruited using a convenience sample framework through the parent study, a patient-centered outcomes research study that examined the comparative effectiveness of two chronic health disease management programs for people with serious mental illness. Participants independently completed the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative Social and Behavioral Responsible Conduct of Research online training. All participants completed 15 online modules in approximately 7-9 hours and also filled out a self-report measure of executive functioning (the Adult Executive Functioning Inventory [ADEXI]). Qualitative data were collected from a 1-hour focus group and qualitative analysis was informed by the grounded theory approach. The codebook consisted of codes inductively derived from the data. Codes were independently assigned to text, grouped, and checked for themes. Thematic analysis was used to organize themes. RESULTS: Passing scores for each module ranged from 81%-89%, with an average of 85.4% and a median of 86%. The two themes that emerged from the focus group were the following: comprehension (barrier) and opportunity (facilitator). Participants had a mean score of 27.4 on the ADEXI.

The analysis was further focused on the impact of quarantine measures in state provided facilities on contacts probability of infection. FINDINGS: 15.6% of 1108 high-risk contacts were found to be infected, and they accounted for 80% of 214 confirmed cases in Phuket till 29th April 2020. Moreover, 10.68% of all high-risk contacts were confirmed to be infected before the quarantine, and 4.55% after the policy was enforced. In addition, a contact who lived within the same household with a confirmed case was 25% more exposed to infection when compared to a contact who did not share a household. INTERPRETATION: Results confirmed that the quarantine policy, which mandated individual isolation in the state provided facilities for all high-risk contacts, diminished contact's chance of infection from the confirmed cases, especially in the epicenter districts. Our findings confirmed that sharing accommodation with an infected case, and exposure to a case with several documented secondary transmission, generally increased the SARS-CoV-2 infection probability. Finally, some confirmed cases do exhibit a higher risk of spreading SARS-CoV-2 to their contacts compared to a typical confirmed case.

Pediatric RCTs frequently recruit from a smaller pool of patients making adequate recruitment difficult. One factor which influences recruitment and retention in pediatric trials is patient and parent preferences for treatment. Purpose To systematically review pediatric RCTs reporting treatment preference. Methods Database searches included: MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and COCHRANE.Qualitative or quantitative papers were eligible if they reported: pediatric population, (0-17 years) recruited to an RCT and reported treatment preference for all or some of the participants/parents in any clinical area. Data extraction included: Number of eligible participants consenting to randomisation arms, number of eligible patients not randomised because of treatment preference, and any further information reported on preferences (e.g., if parent preference was different from child). Results Fifty-two studies were included. The number of eligible families declining participation in an RCT because of preference for treatment varied widely (between 2 and 70%) in feasibility, conventional and preference trial designs. Some families consented to trial involvement despite having preferences for a specific treatment. Data relating to 'participant flow and recruitment' was not always reported consistently, therefore numbers who were lost to follow-up or withdrew due to preference could not be extracted. Conclusions Families often have treatment preferences which may affect trial recruitment. Whilst children appear to hold treatment preferences, this is rarely reported.

METHODS: We did an electronic search of COVID-19 related clinical studies registered between December 1, 2019 and February 21, 2020 (updated to May 28, 2020) from the ClinicalTrials.gov, and collected registration information, study details, recruitment status, characteristics of the subjects, and relevant information about the trial implementation process. RESULTS: A total of 1,706 studies were included 10.0% of which (n=171) were from France, 943 (55.3%) used an interventional design, and 600 (35.2%) used an observational design. Most of studies (73.6%) aimed to recruit fewer than 500 people. Interferon was the main prevention program, and antiviral drugs were the main treatment program. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine (230/943, 24.4%) were widely studied. Some registered clinical trials are incomplete in content, and 37.4% of the 1,706 studies may have had insufficient sample size.

METHODS: Here, we present an optimized freeze-drying procedure that allows SARS-CoV-2 PCR mixes to be transported and stored at ambient temperatures, without loss of activity. Additive-supplemented PCR mixes were freeze-dried. The residual moisture of the freeze-dried PCR mixes was measured by Karl-Fischer titration. RESULTS: We found that the freeze-dried PCR mixes with ~1.2% residual moisture are optimal for storage, transport, and reconstitution. The sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability of the freeze-dried reagents were similar to those of freshly prepared, wet reagents. The freeze-dried mixes retained activity at room temperature (18 ~ 25 C) for 28 days, and for 14 and 10 days when stored at 37 C and 56 C, respectively.

The analysis proves the effectiveness of vaccination strategy employed and helps public health services to control or to reduce the burden of corona virus pandemic. We first prove the existence and uniqueness and then boundedness and positivity of solutions. Threshold parameter for the vaccination model is computed analytically. Stability of the proposed model at fixed points is investigated analytically with the help of threshold parameter to examine epidemiological relevance of the pandemic.

Aged population with cardiovascular diseases are more likely be to infected with SARS-CoV-2 and result in more severe outcomes and elevated case-fatality rate. Meanwhile, cardiovascular diseases have a high prevalence in the middle-aged and elderly population. However, despite of several researches in COVID-19, cardiovascular implications related to it still remains largely unclear. Therefore, a specific analysis in regard to cardiovascular implications of COVID-19 patients is in great need. METHODS: In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, 116 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled, who admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command (Wuhan, China) from January 20 to March 8, 2020. The demographic data, underlying comorbidities, clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography, treatment measures, and outcome data were collected from electronic medical records. Data were compared between non-severe and severe cases. RESULTS: Of 116 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 58.5 years (IQR, 47.0C69.0), and 36 (31.0%) were female. Hypertension (45 [38.8%]), diabetes (19 [16.4%]), and coronary heart disease (17 [14.7%]) were the most common coexisting conditions. Common symptoms included fever [99 (85.3%)], dry cough (61 [52.6%]), fatigue (60 [51.7%]), dyspnea (52 [44.8%]), anorexia (50 [43.1%]), and chest discomfort (50 [43.1%]). Local and/or bilateral patchy shadowing were the typical radiological findings on chest computed tomography. Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 1.0  10(9)/L [IQR, 0.7C1.3]) was observed in 66 patients (56.9%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (245.5 U/L [IQR, 194.3C319.8]) in 69 patients (59.5%). Hypokalemia occurred in 24 (20.7%) patients. Compared with non-severe cases, severe cases were older (64.0 years [IQR, 53.0C76.0] vs 56.0 years [IQR, 37.0C64.0]), more likely to have comorbidities (35 [63.6%] vs 24 [39.3%]), and more likely to develop acute cardiac injury (19 [34.5%] vs 4 [6.6%]), acute heart failure (18 [32.7%] vs 3 [4.9%]), and ARDS (20 [36.4%] vs 0 [0%]). During hospitalization, the prevalence of new onset hypertension was significantly higher in severe patients (55.2% vs 19.0%) than in non-severe ones. CONCLUSIONS: In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we found that the infection of SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to occur in middle and aged population with cardiovascular comorbidities. Cardiovascular complications, including new onset hypertension and heart injury were common in severe patients with COVID-19. More detailed researches in cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19 are urgently needed to further understand the disease.","output":"Clinical characteristics of 116 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a current pandemic of viral infection which mainlyinvolves respiratory system and may progress into severe multiple organ dysfunction and mortality Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is a disease marked by increased mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance due to pulmonary panvascular remodeling Although rare, the prevalence of PAH is currently escalating in Indonesia due to increased diagnostic capacity and referral, treatment availability and improved survival Despite chronic cardiac and pulmonary diseases are at increased risk to develop severe COVID-19, patients with PAH are considered to be not in higher risk to develop severe COVID-19 However, whether this population is protected from severe COVID-19 is unclear There are protective and offensive factors need to be considered in PAH patients in respect to COVID-19","output":"Pulmonary Artery Hypertension Patients And The Coronavirus Disease Of 2019 (COVID-19): Are They Protected From Severe Disease?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Thalictrum minus L., which is widespread across Eurasia, is utilized as a folk medicine for treating dysentery, bedsore, fungal infection and lung inflammation in China, Mongolia and Iran. AIM OF THE STUDY A Mongolian folk medicinal plant named Thalictrum minus L. (TML) has been extensively used for the treatment of lung inflammation, bacterial and fungal infection and tuberculosis. Our present study aims to investigate the effectiveness of TML against particulate matter (PM)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and the potential underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Initially, HPLC-Q-TOF was applied for the qualitative analysis and HPLC was used for quantitative analysis of main components in TML. Then, the mice model of ALI was induced by PM via intratracheally instilled with 50 mg/kg body weight of Standard Reference Material1648a (SRM1648a), and TML (10, 20, 40 mg/kg) were administered orally 1 h prior to PM. The efficacy and molecular mechanisms in the presence or absence of TML were elucidated. RESULTS Eleven main ingredients were detected in TML and the contents of homoorientin and berberine were quantified. Additionally, the results demonstrated that TML profoundly inhibited weight loss in mice and ameliorated lung pathological injury induced by PM. Furthermore, we also found that TML significantly decreased the lung wet to dry weight (W/D) ratios, reduced total protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and effectively attenuated PM-induced increased leukocyte and macrophages in BALF. Meanwhile, TML could pronouncedly inhibited myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lung tissues, decreased the PM-induced inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), reduced nitric oxide (NO) and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) in BALF. In addition, TML markedly facilitated the expression of p-AMPK-Nrf2 and suppressed the expression of KEAP, prohibited the activation of the MAPKs-NLRP3/caspase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), and inhibited apoptotic pathways. CONCLUSION These findings indicated that TML attenuated PM-induced ALI through suppressing the release of inflammatory cytokines and alleviating oxidative damage correlated with the AMPK-Nrf2/KEAP signaling pathways, MAPKs-NLRP3/caspase-1 signaling pathways, as well as apoptotic pathways.","output":"Thalictrum minus L. ameliorates particulate matter-induced acute lung injury in mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article examined the impact of the unanticipated outbreak of global public health crisis, COVID-19 pandemic, on the equity market performances and on the degree of integration of these markets in BRICS bloc.

METHODS In 46 pediatric patients with AVM, demographic factors, clinical presentation, angioarchitectural features, and treatment regimens as well as clinical and radiologic outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. First-line treatment option was microsurgical resection of the disease, with or without preoperative embolization. RESULTS Twenty-four boys (52.2%) and 22 girls (47.8%) with a mean age on admission of 12.4 years (4-18 years) were included. Mean follow-up was 4 years (median, 1.5; range, 0.1-16.4). Thirty-one children presented with intracerebral hemorrhage (67.4%). Small AVMs (<3 cm) ruptured in 83.3% (n = 25) and were shown to be more prone to hemorrhage than larger ones (P < 0.01).

Most shoulder models rely on line-segment approximation of muscles with potential limitations. Comprehensive shoulder models based on continuum-mechanics are scarce due to their complexity in both modeling and computation. In this paper, we present a surface-based modeling approach for muscles, which simplifies the modeling process and is efficient for computation. We propose to use surface geometries for modeling muscles, and devise an automatic approach to generate such models, given the locations of the origin and insertion of tendons. The surfaces are expressed as higher-order tensor B-splines, which ensure smoothness of the geometrical representation. They are simulated as membrane elements within a finite element simulation. This is demonstrated on a comprehensive model of the upper limb, where muscle activations needed to perform desired motions are obtained by using inverse dynamics. In synthetic examples, we demonstrate our proposed surface elements both to be easy to customize (e.g., with spatially varying material properties) and to be substantially (up to 12 times) faster in simulation compared to their volumetric counterpart. With our presented automatic approach of muscle wrapping around bones, the humeral head is exemplified to be wrapped physiologically consistently with surface elements. Our functional simulation is shown to successfully replicate a tracked shoulder motion during activities of daily living. We demonstrate surface-based models to be a numerically stable and computationally efficient compromise between line-segment and volumetric models, enabling anatomical correctness, subject-specific customization, and fast simulations, for a comprehensive simulation of musculoskeletal motion.","output":"Surface-based modeling of muscles: Functional simulation of the shoulder."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This quality improvement study examines the effects of sterilization with hydrogen peroxide and chlorine dioxide on the filtration efficiency of N95, KN95, and surgical face masks.","output":"Effects of Sterilization With Hydrogen Peroxide and Chlorine Dioxide on the Filtration Efficiency of N95, KN95, and Surgical Face Masks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gas turbine generator sets are widely used in IGCC system, gas-steam combine cycle, distributed energy system et al. for its advantages of low pollution, high efficiency, quick start and stop. The structure of gas turbine rotor can be divided into integral rotor and rod-fastened rotor. Experimental study shows that the vibration signal, especially the displacement signal, of the rod-fastened rotor will increase/decrease greatly in a small interval of rotating speed. The reason for this phenomenon is the unique structure of the rod-fastened rotor, namely the interfaces between discs. In this paper, based on the Lagrange equation, the equation of motion of a rod-fastened rotor-bearing system considering the damping of the contact interface is established. The bistable behaviour and hysteretic cycle, also called the jumping phenomenon in engineering, are revealed. In addition, a test bench of the rod-fastened rotor-bearing system is built. The bistable behaviour and hysteretic cycle are experimentally proven, and the effect of the eccentric distance of the rotor on the bistable behaviour is experimentally explored.","output":"Study on the bistable vibration behaviour of a rod-fastened rotor-bearing system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged as a health problem worldwide.

However, the demand for transfusions in a general hospital designated to deal with COVID-19 patients has not been analysed before. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate blood transfusion practices from 15 March to 14 April 2020 at Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor (Madrid, Spain). During this month, with few exceptions, the hospital became a 'COVID-19' centre. In addition, transfusion rates during this time frame and the same period over the last 4 years were compared. RESULTS From 15 March to 14 April 2020, only 254 blood components were transfused, resulting in a 493% reduction over the previous year. Interestingly, in critically ill patients, the red blood cell (RBC) transfusion/bed ratio significantly decreased during this period (092) compared to the same ratio over the past 4 years (270) (P = 002). Of note, 106 blood components (95 RBC; 11 platelet concentrates) were transfused to only 36 out of 1348 COVID-19 patients (27%). The main reason for RBC transfusion in COVID-19 patients was a previous underlying disease (44%) followed by bleeding (25%) and inflammatory anaemia (25%). CONCLUSION This is the first study to report a decrease in blood transfusions during the COVID-19 pandemic in a general hospital and especially in the intensive care unit. The results of this study suggest that COVID-19 does not generally induce transfusion requiring anaemia, being the main causes for transfusion in these patients underlying conditions or bleeding.","output":"Blood transfusion activity in a general hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE In the current pandemic, Health Care Workers (HCWs) are at a high risk of developing COVID-19. Preventive methods like the use of personal protective equipment, isolation, social distancing, and chemoprophylaxis show limited benefit. Despite standard prophylaxis, many of the HCWs develop COVID-19. Medical ozone therapy has immunomodulatory, antioxidant and antiviral effect, and, therefore, it can be explored as prophylaxis for COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective controlled cohort study. IV ozonized saline was administered once a day for a total of 4 days in one month in addition to standard prophylaxis for COVID-19 to HCWs in a dedicated COVID hospital. Fresh ozonized saline was prepared for every administration and was given over 1 hour. RESULTS There were 235 HCWs, 64 received the ozone prophylaxis and 171 did not. The incidence of COVID-19 was significantly (p=0.04) lesser in HCWs that received ozone prophylaxis (4.6%) as compared to those who did not (14.03%). The benefit was seen irrespective of the risk of exposure. In the red zone, 8.69% of the HCWs who received ozone prophylaxis tested positive as opposed to 15.3% of those who did not. In the orange zone, 4.34% of the HCWs who received ozone prophylaxis tested positive, remarkably lesser than those who did not (20%). In the green zone, none of the HCWs who received ozone prophylaxis tested positive; however, 3.4% of the HCWs who did not receive ozone prophylaxis tested positive. No major adverse events were noted. CONCLUSIONS IV ozonized saline can be used in addition to the standard prophylactic regimen for the prevention of COVID-19 in HCWs.

We present three approaches to mine news-sharing networks for detecting information polluters at scale, which is critical to mitigate their impact. Each hinges on an assumption about how credibility flows in different kinds of information diffusion networks: the retweet network captures the spread of misinformation among accounts, the account-source bipartite network focuses on the credibility of the sources shared by an account, and the news co-sharing network considers the similarity between content shared by different accounts. We apply or extend several network centrality and embedding algorithms to calculate account credibility. We then systematically evaluate these methods on empirical networks constructed from Twitter data. We find that some of our proposed extensions of centrality measures work well for retweet and bipartite networks.

This narrative, non-systematic review will be based on studies from the COVID-19 period in association with more general literature on the characteristics of mature gratitude related to good mental health. RESULTS: The results from the literature suggest that a confrontation with our existential vulnerability during a pandemic is not only a crisis but also an opportunity to view our lives in a different way. Mature gratitude, as proposed in this perspective, can help us in coping with the threats and boundaries that are part of our lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This time of crisis gives us the opportunity to self-reflect on our current life and plans for the future and to reframe them through a positive lens which can encourage individuals to actively strengthen their psychological resilience and coping skills. CONCLUSION: Cultivating an attitude of mature gratitude through actions of kindness, expressing being thankful for life and God, and enjoying all the small things in life helps in coping with the current threats of COVID-19 and building lifelong resilience for the future.

Very early reports from Spanish and French registry recorded fatality rates of 18.6% and 13%, respectively, in renal patients which suggests a moderately worse outcome compared to the general population. In patients with positive PCR test but not showing clinical signs, the reduction of immunosuppression is not advised. In the case of gastrointestinal or respiratory signs with fever, the discontinuation of mycophenolate or mTOR inhibitors is recommended with decrease of the trough levels of calcineurin inhibitors to the lowest effective limit. Stop (kidney transplanted patients) or decrease (liver transplanted patients) immunosuppression and maintain corticosteroids when pulmonal injury develops and consider anti-IL1 and anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody use when hyperinflammatory syndrome is evolving. No proven effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 exists currently. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir should be avoided because of the severe drug interaction with calcineurin inhibitors. The efficacy and tolerability of hidroxychloroquin remains to be also questionable; enroll patients into clinical trial with remdesivir or favipiravir if available.

METHODS: We used data from established systems of \\"real time surveillance\\" (RTS) of suspected suicides, in areas covering a total population of around 13 million, to test the hypothesis that the suicide rate rose after the first national lockdown began in England. FINDINGS: The number of suicides in April-October 2020, after the first lockdown began, was 121?3 per month, compared to 125?7 per month in January-March 2020 (-4%; 95% CI-19% to 13%, p = 0?59). Incidence rate ratios did not show a significant rise in individual months after lockdown began and were not raised during the 2-month lockdown period April-May 2020 (IRR: 1?01 [0?81C1?25]) or the 5-month period after the easing of lockdown, June-October 2020 (0?94 [0?81C1?09]).

Design/methodology/approach Following a netnographic approach, the authors studied the computer-mediated social interactions of internet-based virtual innovation communities. Findings This study found that the SE business models contribute to overcome the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic by redistributing idle resources to lessen the impacts of confinement. This was achieved through process innovations and an innovative use of the network, which enabled fast-open and decentralized innovation processes, and quick implementation of innovations. This innovation process is based on a decentralized decision-making approach, clear rules, informal relationship among community members and open communication channels, as well as in evasive strategies to avoid facing challenges, institutional restrictions and barriers in the adoption of innovations. Research limitations/implications This study was limited to a virtual innovation community of highly specialized and educated experts and nine community projects focused on institutional contexts of a developed country. Future research should focus on the institutional contexts of less specialized communities and developing countries and study other community innovation projects in pandemics to understand the processes of fast-open, decentralized and evasive innovation and the importance of relational capabilities for innovation in digital contexts.

After docking against their targets, all anti-SCV2 designed peptides bonded with the HR1 3-helical bundle's hydrophobic crevice, while AntiSCV2P1, AntiSCV2P3, AntiSCV2P7, and AntiSCV2P8 expected to form coiled coils with at least one of the HR1 strands. Four of the designed anti-IAV peptides were cell-penetrating (AntiIAVP2, AntiIAVP3, AntiIAVP4, AntiIAVP7). All of them interacted with the fusion peptide of HA and some of the residues in the conserved hydrophobic pocket of HA2 in H1N1, H3N1, and H5N1 subtypes of IAV. AntiIAVP3 and AntiIAVP4 peptides had the best binding to HA2 conserved hydrophobic pocket, while, AntiIAVP2 and AntiIAVP6 showed the best binding to the fusion peptide region. According to analyses for in-vivo administration, AntiSCV2P1, AntiSCV2P7, AntiIAVP2, and AntiIAVP7 were the best candidates. AntiSCV2 and AntiIAV peptides were also conjugated using an in vivo cleavable linker sensitive to TMPRSS2 applicable as a single therapeutic in coinfections or uncertain diagnosis.

Although nucleic acid testing is widely deployed for the detection of antibiotic resistant bacteria, the current techniquesmainly based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)are time-consuming and laborious. There is an urgent need to develop new strategies to control bacterial infections and the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The CRISPR-Cas system is an adaptive immune system found in many prokaryotes that presents attractive opportunities to target and edit nucleic acids with high precision and reliability. Engineered CRISPR-Cas systems are reported to effectively kill bacteria or even revert bacterial resistance to antibiotics (resensitizing bacterial cells to antibiotics). Strategies for combating antimicrobial resistance using CRISPR (i.e., Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14) can be of great significance in detecting bacteria and their resistance to antibiotics. This review discusses the structures, mechanisms, and detection methods of CRISPR-Cas systems and how these systems can be engineered for the rapid and reliable detection of bacteria using various approaches, with a particular focus on nanoparticles. In addition, we summarize the most recent advances in applying the CRISPR-Cas system for virulence modulation of bacterial infections and combating antimicrobial resistance.

Vaccine hesitancy and global warming denial share much in common: (1) both are threats to personal, community and global health, (2) action is contingent on co-operation and social policy, and (3) public support relies on trust in science. The irony is, however, as the science has become more convincing, public opinion has become more divided. A number of early polls showed that ~70% of people supported COVID-19 vaccine use and global warming, ~20% adopted a wait-and-see approach, and ~10% were staunch objectors. Although these percentages are approximate, what factors are responsible for the differences in engagement, doubt and distrust? How can we reduce the consensus gap? One approach is to return to grass roots and provide a brief history of the issues, understand the difference between fact and opinion, truth and falsehood, the problem of certainty, and how scientific consensus is reached. To doubt is a healthy response to new information, and it too has a scientific basis. Doubt and distrust reside in that region of the brain called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for suppressing unwanted representations. Bridging the consensus gap requires shifting human thinking patterns from doubt to belief, and belief to action. Education and improved public messaging are key, and social media providers require urgent oversight or regulation to remove false and harmful/dangerous content from our digital lives.

METHODS: An anonymous survey including questions about COVID-19 and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System profile (PROMIS-29, version 2.0) was hosted on the ThyCa:Thyroid Cancer Survivors Association, Inc. website. PROMIS scores were compared to previously published data. Factors associated with greater anxiety were evaluated with univariable and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: From 5/6/2020 C 10/8/2020, 413 participants consented to take the survey; 378 (92%) met inclusion criteria: diagnosed with thyroid cancer or NIFTP, within the United States, and completing all sections of the survey. Mean age was 53 years; 89% were female, and 74% had papillary thyroid cancer. Most respondents agreed/strongly agreed (83%) that their lives were very different during COVID-19, as was their interaction with doctors (79%). A minority (43%) were satisfied with information from their doctor regarding COVID-19 changes. Compared to pre-COVID-19, PROMIS scores were higher for anxiety (57.8 vs. 56.5, p<0.05) and lower for ability to participate in social activities (46.2 vs. 48.1, p<0.01), fatigue (55.8 vs. 57.9, p<0.01), and sleep disturbance (54.7 vs. 56.1, p<0.01).

Due to the rapid rate of disease outbreaks and the severe shortages of medical resources, predicting COVID-19 disease severity continues to be a challenge for healthcare systems. Accurate prediction of severe patients plays a vital role in determining treatment priorities, effective management of medical facilities, and reducing the number of deaths. Various methods have been used in the literature to predict the severity prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Despite the different appearance of the methods, they all aim to achieve generalizable results by increasing the accuracy and reducing the errors of predictions. In other words, accuracy is considered the only effective factor in the generalizability of models. In addition to accuracy, reliability and consistency of results are other critical factors that must be considered to yield generalizable medical predictions. Since the role of reliability in medical decisions is significant, upgrading reliable medical data-driven models requires more attention. METHODS: This paper presents a new modeling technique to specify and maximize the reliability of results in predicting the severity prognosis of COVID-19 patients. We use the well-known classic regression as the basic model to implement our proposed procedure on it. To assess the performance of the proposed model, it has been applied to predict the severity prognosis of COVID-19 by using a dataset including clinical information of 46 COVID-19 patients. The dataset consists of two types of patients outcomes including mild (discharge) and severe (ICU or death). To measure the efficiency of the proposed model, we compare the accuracy of the proposed model to the classic regression model. RESULTS: The proposed reliability-based regression model, by achieving 98.6% sensitivity, 88.2% specificity, and 93.10% accuracy, has better performance than classic accuracy-based regression model with 95.7% sensitivity, 85.5% specificity, and 90.3% accuracy. Also, graphical analysis of ROC curve showed AUC 0.93 (95% CI 0.88C0.98) and AUC 0.90 (95% CI 0.85C0.96) for classic regression models, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Maximizing reliability in the medical forecasting models can lead to more generalizable and accurate results. The competitive results indicate that the proposed reliability-based regression model has higher performance in predicting the deterioration of COVID-19 patients compared to the classic accuracy-based regression model. The proposed framework can be used as a suitable alternative for the traditional regression method to improve the decision-making and triage processes of COVID-19 patients.","output":"A novel reliability-based regression model to analyze and forecast the severity of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with first presentation of atypical pneumonia, has spread rapidly from Wuhan, China, on December 12, 2019 to over 200 countries, caused 2 310 572 infected individuals and 158 691 mortalities, updated on April 19, 2020.

For strengthening these natural fibers, they may reinforce with some substances such as nanomaterials. Natural or biofiber-reinforced bio-composites and nanoCbio-composites are considered better than conventional composites. The sustainable application of nanofibers in agricultural sectors is a promising approach and may involve plant protection and its growth through encapsulating many bio-active molecules or agrochemicals (i.e., pesticides, phytohormones, and fertilizers) for smart delivery at the targeted sites. The food industry and processing also are very important applicable fields of nanofibers, particularly food packaging, which may include using nanofibers for activeCintelligent food packaging, and food freshness indicators. The removal of pollutants from soil, water, and air is an urgent field for nanofibers due to their high efficiency. Many new approaches or applicable agro-fields for nanofibers are expected in the future, such as using nanofibers as the indicators for CO and NH3.

These masks can be viewed as inflexible barriers to communication, contributing to the traditional authoritarian relationship between doctor and patient and concealing the authenticity and vulnerability of physicians. COVID masks, by contrast, offer a more nuanced and morally complex metaphor for thinking about protecting people from harm, authentic and trustworthy communication, and attention to potential inequities both in and beyond medical settings.

Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified a novel beta-coronavirus called 2019-nCoV, now officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) that is responsible for the pandemic. The coronavirus COVID-19 affected 215 countries and territories around the world and more than 99 hundred thousand people at present (Nature Nanotechnology, 2020). At present, there are no specific vaccines or treatments available for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. At this time the experts recommend precautions such as social distancing, hand washing, and wearing face masks to reduce disease transmission. This review article aims to improve the readers awareness towards the important role of mobile technology for SARS-CoV-2. METHODOLOGY: To achieve this objective, we performed a COVID-19 literature review from various sources that include data from the published articles as well as World Health Organization reports on coronavirus disease and how mobile technology is useful to fight against this disease. RESULTS: Mobile technology can be helpful in mapping disease spread and provides an easy way to provide awareness that promotes safety and adoption of necessary precautions to mitigate and stop community transmission. CONCLUSION: The spread rate of COVID-19 is very high and until now no vaccines are available to control this disease. To this end we should leverage other avenues such as digital technologies to protect ourselves from this disease.

Peer mentorship, which does not adhere to traditional hierarchies, is perhaps more accessible for underrepresented groups, including women and minorities. In this article, we review various models of peer mentorship, highlighting their respective advantages and disadvantages. Structured peer mentorship groups exist in different settings, such as those created under the auspices of formal career development programs, part of training grant programs, or through professional societies. Social media has further enabled the establishment of informal peer mentorship through participatory online groups, blogs, and forums that provide platforms for peer-to-peer advice and support. Such groups can evolve rapidly to address changing conditions, as demonstrated by physician listserv and Facebook groups related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Peer mentorship can also be found among colleagues brought together through a common location, interest, or goal, and typically these relationships are informal and fluid. Finally, we highlight here our experience with intentional formation of a small peer mentoring group that provides structure and a safe space for professional and social-emotional growth and support. In order to maximize impact and functionality, this model of peer mentorship requires commitment among peers and a more formalized process than many other peer mentoring models, accounting for group dynamics and the unique needs of members.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective, consecutive, observational study of adult patients from a tertiary referral center with confirmed COVID-19. All patients were screened daily for neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms during admission and discharge. Three-month follow-up data were collected using electronic health records. We classified complications as caused by SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, immune-mediated or critical illness-related. RESULTS: From April to September 2020, we enrolled 61 consecutively admitted COVID-19 patients, 35 (57%) of whom required intensive care (ICU) management for respiratory failure. Forty-one CNS/PNS complications were identified in 28 of 61 (45.9%) patients and were more frequent in ICU compared to non-ICU patients. The most common CNS complication was encephalopathy (n = 19, 31.1%), which was severe in 13 patients (GCS  12), including 8 with akinetic mutism. Length of ICU admission was independently associated with encephalopathy (OR = 1.22). Other CNS complications included ischemic stroke, a biopsy-proven acute necrotizing encephalitis, and transverse myelitis. The most common PNS complication was critical illness polyneuromyopathy (13.1%), with prolonged ICU stay as independent predictor (OR = 1.14). Treatment-related PNS complications included meralgia paresthetica. Of 41 complications in total, 3 were para/post-infectious, 34 were secondary to critical illness or other causes, and 4 remained unresolved. Cerebrospinal fluid was negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in all 5 patients investigated. CONCLUSION: CNS and PNS complications were common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, particularly in the ICU, and often attributable to critical illness. When COVID-19 was the primary cause for neurological disease, no signs of viral neurotropism were detected, but laboratory changes suggested autoimmune-mediated mechanisms.

IVC has been classified into three grades in previous studies. Grade II IVC is defined by >50% stenosis without the development of collateral circulation. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the outcomes of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for patients with VVs combined with grade II IVC. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 339 patients who had undergone RFA for VVs of the left leg from March 2017 to January 2019. Duplex ultrasonography, computed tomography venography, and venography were performed to evaluate for grade II IVC. All the patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 included patients with VVs only, and group 2, patients with VVs combined with grade II IVC. Propensity score matching was used to ensure an even distribution of confounding factors between groups. The venous clinical severity score (VCSS) and chronic venous insufficiency questionnaire (CIVIQ) score were recorded during the 12-month follow-up. Occlusion of the truncal veins was evaluated using duplex ultrasound scans. RESULTS: Using 1:1 propensity score matching, 50 pairs of patients were enrolled in the present analysis. The average age of groups 1 and 2 was 58.7  13.1 and 60.1  7.1 years, respectively. The VCSS had decreased significantly from baseline to 12 months postoperatively (group 1, from 5 to 1; group 2, from 4 to 1; P < .01). A significant increase in the CIVIQ score was found between the baseline and 12-month evaluations for both groups (group 1, from 62.5 to 69; group 2, from 63 to 70; P < .01). The truncal occlusion rate was 98% in both groups at 12 months.

In the 13 years from Jan. 2003 to Dec. 2015, this prospective cohort study included consecutive pediatric patients under 12 years old, who presented either emergently or electively with any variety of CLM. The lesions encompassed in this assortment were congenital lobar emphysema (CLE), congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), bronchogenic cysts (BC), and bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS). RESULTS: Sixty-eight pediatric patients with CLM were operated at our institution; 18 CPAMs, 22 CLEs, 19 BPSs (17 intralobar and 2 extralobar), and 9 patients with BCs. The patients age ranged from 1 to 54 months (mean age of 10.73  9.73 months), with overall male gender predominance (61.76%). Both CLE and CPAM had a male predominance, while BC and BPS had equivocal gender distribution.

The study was reported according to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Studies (COREQ) checklist for qualitative research. RESULTS: Two themes emerged from the analysis and each theme had several subthemes: a) PUSH FACTORS i.e. factors that may push nurses to consider leaving the profession included limited career prospects, generational barriers, poor public image of nursing, and workplace pressures; b) PULL FACTORS i.e. factors that nurses wished for and could keep them in the profession included professional pride, improved remuneration, recognition of nursing, professionalisation, and improving the image of nursing as a profession. CONCLUSION: The decision to leave or stay in nursing is influenced by a complex range of dynamic push and pull factors. Nurse Managers responsible for stabilizing the workforce and maintaining their health system will continue to have to navigate challenges until working conditions, appropriate wages and career development opportunities are addressed. A key to tackling nursing shortages may be focusing on pull factors and nurse managers listening in particular to the perspectives of junior nurses directly involved in patient care, as giving them opportunity to further develop professionally, reinforcing a strong and supportive workplace relationships, paying an appropriate salary, and improving the public image of nursing profession. REGISTRATION NUMBER: The study has been prospectively registered (27 June 2019) at the German Clinical Trial Register (DRKS00017465).","output":"Keeping nurses in nursing: a qualitative study of German nurses perceptions of push and pull factors to leave or stay in the profession"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Persistent policy failures have been examined in recent years with a focus on the role of political systems. We evaluate the growth of dysfunctional policymaking in the U.S. and propose a countering approach. Policy failures often reflect partisan policy stalemate, errors or unintended consequences, polarized extremism or imbalance, or partisan reversals with changes in power. Extremes in partisanship are not new historically, but growing policy failures due to negative partisanship have now severely damaged public trust. More party blind conditions in policy formulation may be able to renew a more productive social contract. We propose a disruptive presidential leadership approach of bipartisan inclusion to seek to reframe the partisan divides, counter negative partisanship and extremes, re-establish better policymaking interactions, and improve governance and policy outcomes. Dysfunctional policymaking has been attributed to Republicans and Democrats in a Prisoners Dilemma. Iterated Prisoners Dilemmas often lead to higher rates of cooperation, and similarly, historical policymaking included greater cooperation, but in recent decades the bipartisan norms of governance have substantially eroded. We describe three complementary explanations, which suggest that non-cooperative partisan policymaking has become self-reinforcing, and institutional changes to promote cooperation should focus on lowering the risk-adjusted costCbenefit ratio, making cooperation safer and more attractive for policymakers.","output":"Reframe policymaking dysfunction through bipartisan-inclusion leadership"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Paul Ehrlich's concept of the magic bullet, by which a single drug induces pharmacological effects by interacting with a single receptor has been a strong driving force in pharmacology for a century.

Even in the current pandemic, we should not reduce our attention towards the diagnosis and treatment of GDM. The purpose of this document is to provide a temporary guide for GDM screening, replacing the current guidelines when it is not possible to implement standard GDM screening because of an unfavorable risk/benefit ratio for pregnant women or when usual laboratory facilities are not available. DATA SYNTHESIS: At the first visit during pregnancy, we must exclude the presence of \\"Overt diabetes\\" in all women. The criteria for the diagnosis of overt diabetes are either fasting plasma glucose &#8805;126 mg/dL, or random plasma glucose &#8805;200 mg/dL, or glycated hemoglobin &#8805;6.5%. When the screening procedure (OGTT) cannot be safely performed, the diagnosis of GDM is acceptable if fasting plasma glucose is &#8805; 92 mg/dL. In order to consider the impaired fasting glucose as an acceptable surrogate for the diagnosis of GDM, the fasting glucose measurement should be performed within the recommended time windows for the risk level (high or medium risk). CONCLUSIONS: The changes to the screening procedure for GDM reported below are specifically produced in response to the health emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, these recommended changes should cease to be in effect and should be replaced by current national guidelines when the healthcare authorities declare the end of this emergency.","output":"Italian recommendations for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes during COVID-19 pandemic: Position statement of the Italian Association of Clinical Diabetologists (AMD) and the Italian Diabetes Society (SID), diabetes, and pregnancy study group"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES There are many studies investigating implementation of advance care planning (ACP) in aged care around the world, but few studies have investigated Australian settings.

Since the occurrence and development of cancer usually accompany with inflammation, and tumor signaling shares many components with inflammation signaling, the agents with anti-tumor activity are likely to possess anti-inflammation potential. Thus, the current study aims to demonstrate the anti-inflammatory activity along with the underlying mechanism of IDET in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed macrophages. By using Griess method and ELISA, we found that in both bone marrow derived macrophages and alveolar macrophage cell line, IDET, at relatively low concentrations (0.75, 1.5 and 3 M), could inhibit LPS-induced expression of various pro-inflammatory mediators including nitric oxide (NO) generated by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and IL-1?. Meanwhile, in activated MH-S cells, the inhibitory action of IDET on mRNA expression levels of these cytokines was also detected using qPCR. Mechanistically, the effects of IDET on two key inflammatory signalings, nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) pathways, were determined in LPS-activated MH-S cells by reporter gene along with western blot assays. On the one hand, IDET suppressed NF-&#954;B signaling via down-regulating phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor of NF-&#954;B (I&#954;B)-&#945; and the subsequent p65 translocation. On the other hand, IDET dampened AP-1 signaling through attenuating phosphorylation of both c-jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2) and extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2).

The magnitude of these disruptions and their association with childhood vaccination coverage are unclear. Objectives: To compare trends in pediatric vaccination before and during the pandemic and to evaluate the proportion of children up to date (UTD) with vaccinations by age, race, and ethnicity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This surveillance study used a prepandemic-postpandemic control design with data from 8 health systems in California, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Minnesota, and Wisconsin in the Vaccine Safety Datalink. Children from age groups younger than 24 months and 4 to 6, 11 to 13, and 16 to 18 years were included if they had at least 1 week of health system enrollment from January 5, 2020, through October 3, 2020, over periods before the US COVID-19 pandemic (January 5, 2020, through March 14, 2020), during age-limited preventive care (March 15, 2020, through May 16, 2020), and during expanded primary care (May 17, 2020, through October 3, 2020). These individuals were compared with those enrolled during analogous weeks in 2019. Exposures: This study evaluated UTD status among children reaching specific ages in February, May, and September 2020, compared with those reaching these ages in 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Weekly vaccination rates for routine age-specific vaccines and the proportion of children UTD for all age-specific recommended vaccines. Results: Of 1a?399a?708 children in 2019 and 1a?402a?227 in 2020, 1a?371a?718 were female (49.0%) and 1a?429a?979 were male (51.0%); 334a?216 Asian individuals (11.9%), 900a?226 were Hispanic individuals (32.1%), and 201a?619 non-Hispanic Black individuals (7.2%). Compared with the prepandemic period and 2019, the age-limited preventive care period was associated with lower weekly vaccination rates, with ratios of rate ratios of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.80-0.85) among those younger than 24 months, 0.18 (95% CI, 0.16-0.20) among those aged 4 to 6 years, 0.16 (95% CI, 0.14-0.17) among those aged 11 to 13 years, and 0.10 (95% CI, 0.08-0.13) among those aged 16 to 18 years. Vaccination rates during expanded primary care remained lower for most ages (ratios of rate ratios: <24 months, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.93-0.98]; 11-13 years, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.76-0.86]; 16-18 years, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.51-0.63]). In September 2020, 74% (95% CI, 73%-76%) of infants aged 7 months and 57% (95% CI, 56%-58%) of infants aged 18 months were UTD vs 81% (95% CI, 80%-82%) and 61% (95% CI, 60%-62%), respectively, in September 2019. The proportion UTD was lowest in non-Hispanic Black children across most age groups, both during and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (eg, in May 2019, 70% [95% CI, 64%-75%] of non-Hispanic Black infants aged 7 months were UTD vs 82% [95% CI, 81%-83%] in all infants aged 7 months combined). Conclusions and Relevance: As of September 2020, childhood vaccination rates and the proportion who were UTD remained lower than 2019 levels.

METHODS A study was conducted of 484 consecutive patients seen in the emergency department (ED) of our tertiary care center during the SARS outbreak in Taiwan. The scoring system was divided into triage and screening station stages. Data were analysed with multivariable and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Of 737 patients who presented to our ED for possible SARS from March to June 2003, we enrolled 484 patients with a temperature >38.0 degrees C (>100.3 degrees F) (age >18 years). Dyspnoea, diarrhoea, travel, close contact, hospital exposure, and household history were identified as predictive indicators in the triage stage. The triage score was the total of six items. With a one-point cutoff value, the sensitivity and specificity were 81.8% (18/22) and 73.6% (340/462). Leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and CXR were identified as predictive indicators in the fever screening stage. Screening station scores (the sum of 10 items) consisted of triage scores, white blood cell count, and CXR. With a three-point cutoff value, the sensitivity and specificity were 95.5% (21/22) and 87.2% (403/462).

In Israel, healthcare personnel (HCP) were initially prioritized for Covid-19 vaccination, creating an ideal setting to evaluate early real-world VE in a closely monitored population. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study among HCP in 6 hospitals to estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants filled out weekly symptom questionnaires, provided weekly nasal specimens, and three serology samples C at enrollment, 30 days and 90 days. We estimated VE against PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection using the Cox Proportional Hazards model and against a combined PCR/serology endpoint using Fishers exact test. RESULTS: Of the 1567 HCP enrolled between December 27, 2020 and February 15, 2021, 1250 previously uninfected participants were included in the primary analysis; 998 (79.8%) were vaccinated with their first dose prior to or at enrollment, all with Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. There were four PCR-positive events among vaccinated participants, and nine among unvaccinated participants. Adjusted two-dose VE against any PCR-confirmed infection was 94.5% (95% CI: 82.6%-98.2%); adjusted two-dose VE against a combined endpoint of PCR and seroconversion for a 60-day follow-up period was 94.5% (95% CI: 63.0%-99.0%). Five PCR-positive samples from study participants were sequenced; all were alpha variant. CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective VE study of HCP in Israel with rigorous weekly surveillance found very high VE for two doses of Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection in recently vaccinated HCP during a period of predominant alpha variant circulation.

In this study, however, we show that a single layer of a surgical mask can atomize a cough droplet into numerous tiny droplets, thereby significantly increasing the total population of aerosols ejected during a single human cough. Although droplets of a broader size distribution are ejected during coughs, we focused our attention towards a relatively large droplet size (~ 620 {\\\\mu}m), which shows great affinity to undergo atomization during its penetration through the mask layers. The entire phenomenon was captured using a high-speed shadowgraphy imaging technique at a recording rate of 6500 fps. The single-layer masks were found to be ineffective in restraining cough droplets while no penetration could be noticed for a triple-layer mask. This is because a single-layer or double-layer face mask causes atomization of the droplets resulting in the formation of larger number of droplets with smaller sizes (<100 {\\\\mu}m). These tiny droplets can aerosolize in the immediate environment and can remain suspended for a longer time. Thus, it is recommended to avoid the use of a single-layer or double-layer surgical face mask as a physical obstruction to the ejected cough droplets for controlling the spread of the COVID-19 virus.","output":"Secondary Atomization and Possible Aerosolization of Cough Droplets through Single and Multi-layer Face Masks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This study aims to determine the clinical characteristics and prognosis of COVID-19 patients with comorbidities and to identify survival factors Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in Wuhan, China, between February 8, 2020, and March 9, 2020 Based on underlying diseases, patients were assigned to either the comorbidity group or the non-comorbidity group The clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 were analyzed and a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to evaluate the prognosis predictive value of each comorbidity Results: During the study period, 278 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, 175 (62 95%) were assigned to the comorbidity group, and 103 (37 05%) to the non-comorbidity group Of the patients in the comorbidity group, 34 86% were classified as critical Further, patients in the comorbidity group had lower lymphocyte cell counts, and higher concentrations of D-dimer, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and serum ferritin as well as higher critical illness severity scores than patients in the non-comorbidity group (P2=4 202, P=0 040) and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (log-rank test: chi2=4 839, P=0 028) or diabetes mellitus (log-rank test: chi2=4 377, P=0 036) had shorter survival than those without comorbidities Conclusions: Patients with comorbidities were more severely affected and had a higher mortality rate Age, COPD and diabetes mellitus were the main factors affecting the survival of patients","output":"The clinical characteristics and prognosis of COVID-19 patients with comorbidities: a retrospective analysis of the infection peak in Wuhan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study in which case study -- one of the qualitative research methods -- was used, it was aimed to assess the effects of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on preschool education by teachers.

Of these, 196 patients underwent surgical resection via a retrosigmoid approach. INTERVENTION At our institution, internal auditory canal (IAC) reconstruction following a retrosigmoid approach was performed with bone wax and muscle plug or Norian hydroxyapatite bone cement from 2005 to 2013. Starting in 2014, a newer model of bone cement, Cranios hydroxyapatite, was used exclusively for reconstruction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Rates of CSF leak were evaluated across different methods of IAC reconstruction and types of bone cement. Patients whose leaks were attributable to the craniectomy site were excluded from analysis. RESULTS The postoperative CSF leak rate among patients who did not receive bone cement for IAC reconstruction was 15.6% (n.5). The leak rate amongst patients who received Norian bone cement was 6.3% (n.4). After introduction of Cranios bone cement, the total leak rate decreased to 1% (n.1). Compared with all other types of closure, Cranios had a significantly reduced rate of postoperative CSF leak (p < 0.005).

The concept was developed in reaction to the recent AI surge and corresponding demand for foundational teaching on the subject to a broad and diverse audience, with on-site teaching of small classes in mind and designed to build on the specific strengths in motivational public speaking of the lecturers. The research question and focus of our evaluation is to what extent the concept serves this purpose, specifically taking into account the necessary but unforeseen transfer to ongoing hybrid and fully online teaching since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our contribution is two-fold: besides (i) presenting a general didactic concept for tertiary engineering education in AI and ML, ready for adoption, we (ii) draw conclusions from the comparison of qualitative student evaluations (n = 24-30) and quantitative exam results (n = 62-113) of two full semesters under pandemic conditions with the result of previous years (participants from Zurich, Switzerland).

With abdominoplasty and umbilicoplasty, placement of the umbilicus is essential and often left at the surgeon's discretion. This study aims to investigate the ideal male umbilical shape and location by examining photographs of top male models in 2019. METHODS: In this observational study, we examined 81 photographs of top male models to assess different ratios based on anatomical landmarks and umbilical appearance. RESULTS: The ratio of the distance from the xiphoid to the center of umbilicus (XU) and corresponding distance from center of umbilicus to abdominal crease (UC) had the most reliability (ratio XU/UC, with average measurement: 1.68  0.38), which placed the male navel at a similar position but marginally below the average female umbilicus. Our findings revealed that an oval horizontal is the ideal umbilical shape in males, which differs from what is most aesthetically pleasing in females (oval vertical). In addition, we introduced the SHAPE (Shape, Hood, Adiposity, Protrusion & Position, External piercing) classification for navel appearance to better define the umbilicus and its direct management. CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes that the ideal male umbilicus differs from that of females; it should be placed at the XU/UC ratio of 1.68  0.38 and aim for a horizontal shape with hooding (SHAPE: H II). The SHAPE classification facilitates a logical stepwise approach for the surgeon to refashion the umbilicus.

Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) is the gold-standard treatment for sleep apnea, but success requires substantial clinical support, which has traditionally been provided in-person. In this quality analysis, we examined the impact of PAP initiation (PAPI) via telemedicine on adherence and subsequent health care utilization, compared to the conventional, in-person model. METHODS: Patients who completed PAPI and initial adherence period between April-August 2020 were included. During this window, telemedicine visits were encouraged, but not required. Adequate adherence status was considered met if 21/30 consecutive days with use >4h was achieved by day 90 therapy. Health care utilization was represented by the number of follow-up visits, stratified by provider type (Physician, Physician Assistant (PA), or PAP Technologist). RESULTS: 839 patients (54% telemedicine, 46% in-person), 38.0% female, aged 54.20.5 years, BMI 32.40.3 (SEM) were included. Adherence was similarly achieved following both initiation methods: 78.8% (telemedicine) and 76.4% (in-person) (p>0.4). Clinical follow-up was lower after in-person PAPI compared to telemedicine, regardless of adherence status (p<0.05). Non-adherent patients also had less clinical follow-up than adherent patients after both initiation methods (p<0.0001), though this differed by provider type. Non-adherent patients in both initiation methods were less likely to follow-up with a PA or PAP Technologist (p<0.01), though follow-up rate with Physician providers was similar (p>0.1). Clinical follow-up with PAP Technologist was increased after telemedicine compared to in-person PAPI (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Implementation of a telemedicine PAP initiation protocol during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in similar rates of adherence compared to the conventional in-person method, which suggests that telemedicine is an appropriate alternative to in-person PAPI. However, clinical follow-up was lower after in-person PAPI compared to telemedicine regardless of adherence status. Further, non-adherent patients had less follow-up with PAs and PAP Technologists, but similar follow-up with Physicians. This may indicate that provider type plays a role in supporting patients through the adherence process and should be considered. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between care teams, adherence, and healthcare utilization in the age of telemedicine.

Yet, modern online information systems do not incorporate narratives in their representation of events occurring over time. This article aims to bridge this gap, combining the theory of narrative representations with the data from modern online systems. We make three key contributions: a theory-driven computational representation of narratives, a novel extraction algorithm to obtain these representations from data, and an evaluation of our approach. In particular, given the effectiveness of visual metaphors, we employ a route map metaphor to design a narrative map representation. The narrative map representation illustrates the events and stories in the narrative as a series of landmarks and routes on the map. Each element of our representation is backed by a corresponding element from formal narrative theory, thus providing a solid theoretical background to our method. Our approach extracts the underlying graph structure of the narrative map using a novel optimization technique focused on maximizing coherence while respecting structural and coverage constraints. We showcase the effectiveness of our approach by performing a user evaluation to assess the quality of the representation, metaphor, and visualization.

Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate the clinical relevance of trochanteric pain syndrome compared to patient reported outcome measures. 3D-CT scans of 90 patients were analyzed after minimalinvasive total hip arthroplasty and leg length, femoral and acetabular offset differences were measured. Clinical evaluation was performed three years after THA regarding the presence of trochanteric pain syndrome and using outcome measures. Furthermore, the patients' expectation were evaluated. Patients with trochanteric pain syndrome showed a higher absolute discrepancy of combined leg length, femoral and acetabular offset restoration compared to the non-operated contralateral side with 11.8  6.0 mm than patients without symptoms in the trochanteric region with 7.8  5.3 mm (p = 0.01).

As for now, data on the efficacy of NIV in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are lacking, and for this reason it is extremely important to accurately determine the outcomes of this strategy. This study aimed to evaluate clinical data and outcomes of NIV in patients with COVID-19 ARDS. MATHERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-nine consecutive patients with sudden worsening of respiratory failure were evaluated. All patients (71% male) had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and signs, symptoms and radiological findings compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia and all of them underwent a trial of NIV. Primary outcomes were NIV success and failure defined by intubation and mortality rate. Secondary outcome was the duration of NIV. RESULTS: NIV was successful in 38 (48.1%) patients (Table 1). EOT was necessary in 21 patients (26.6%). Death occurred in 20 patients (25.3%). In the group of patients having failed a trial with NIV and then being intubated, compared to those who continued NIV, there was no higher mortality rate. By evaluating the ICU survival outcome of the subgroup of patients intubated after NIV, 57% of the patients were discharged and 43% died. CONCLUSION: Previous studies conducted on patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation showed higher mortality rate than the present study.

This is particularly important in the rapidly changing healthcare context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite recognition of its importance in the United Kingdom, minimum required hours for re-registration, and related investment, have been small compared to other countries. The aim of this review is to understand the factors that optimise continuing professional development impact for learning, development and improvement in the workplace. DESIGN: A rapid evidence review was undertaken using Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) framework; identifying a research question, developing a search strategy, extracting, collating and summarising the findings. REVIEW METHODS: In addressing the question 'What are the factors that enable or optimise CPD impact for learning, development and improvement in the workplace at the individual, team, organisation and system level?' the British Nursing Index, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, HTA database, King's Fund Library, and Medline databases were searched for key terms. A total of 3790 papers were retrieved and 39 were included. RESULTS: Key factors to optimising the impact of nursing and inter-professional continuing development are; self-motivation, relevance to practice, preference for workplace learning, strong enabling leadership and a positive workplace culture. The findings reveal the interdependence of these important factors in optimising the impact of continuing professional development on person-centred care and outcomes.

Until now, vaccination in its different forms proves to be the most effective measure to control the outbreak and lower the burden of the disease on healthcare systems. This arena has become a prime target to criminal networks that spread counterfeit Covid-19 vaccines across the supply chain mainly for profit. Counterfeit vaccines provide false sense of security to individuals, heightens the risk of exposure and outbreak of the virus, and increase the risk of harm linked to Covid-19 infection. Moreover, the increase in counterfeit vaccines feeds hesitancy towards vaccination and erodes the trust in mass immunisation programmes. It is therefore of paramount importance to work on rapid and reliable methods for vaccine authentication. Subsequently this work utilised a portable and non-destructive near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic method for authentication of Covid-19 vaccines. A total of 405 Covid-19 vaccines samples, alongside their main constituents, were measured as received through glass vials. Spectral quality and bands were inspected by considering the raw spectra of the vaccines. Authentication was explored by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to the multiplicative scatter correction-first derivative spectra. The results showed that NIR spectra of the vaccine featured mainly bands corresponding to the mRNA active ingredient. Fewer bands corresponded to the excipients and protein spectra. The vaccines NIR spectra were strongly absorbing with maximum absorbances up to 2.7 absorbance units and that differentiated them from samples containing normal saline only (constituent reported for counterfeit Covid-19 vaccines). Clustering based on PCA offered optimal authentication of Covid-19 vaccines when applied over the range of 9000C4000 cm(-1)These findings shed light on the potential of using NIR for analysing Covid-19 vaccines and presents a rapid and effective initial technique for Covid-19 vaccine authentication.","output":"Evaluation of portable near-infrared spectroscopy for authentication of mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunocompromised patients have an increased risk of persistent COVID\\\\19 disease.

METHODS: To assess the causal impact of COVID-19 on psychological changes in China, we constructed a city-level panel data set based on the expressed sentiment in the contents of 13 million geotagged tweets on Sina Weibo, the Chinese largest microblog platform. RESULTS: Applying a difference-in-differences approach, we found a significant deterioration in mental health status after the occurrence of COVID-19. We also observed that this psychological effect faded out over time during our study period and was more pronounced among women, teenagers and older adults. The mental health impact was more likely to be observed in cities with low levels of initial mental health status, economic development, medical resources and social security.

We examine the continued effect of the pandemic on cardiovascular hospitalizations and the associated mortality rates during the first year of the pandemic in Israel. Methods We conduct a retrospective cohort study using the data of Clalit Health Services, the largest healthcare organization in Israel. We divide the Corona year into six periods (three lockdowns and three post-lockdowns) and compare the incidence rates of cardiovascular hospitalizations and their 30-day mortality during each period to the previous three years. Results The number of non-STEMI hospitalizations during the first year of the pandemic was 13.7% lower than the average of the previous three years (95% CI 11%-17%);STEMI hospitalizations were 15.7% lower (95% CI 13%-19%);and CHF hospitalizations were 23.9% lower (95%, CI 21%-27%). No significant differences in 30-day mortality rates were observed for AMI patients during most of the periods, whereas the annual 30-day all-cause mortality rate of CHF was 23% higher. Conclusions Hospitalizations for AMI and CHF were significantly lower during the first year of the pandemic relative to 2017C9. Mortality rates were higher in the case of CHF patients but not in the case of AMI patients, possibly due a change in the clinical acuity of patients arriving at the hospitals. We conclude that targeted public health messaging should be implemented, together with proactive monitoring in order to identify residual disability in patients that may have received non-optimal treatment during the pandemic.","output":"Continuous Decline in Myocardial Infarction and Heart Failure Hospitalizations During the First 12 Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Israel (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world over, more than one-third of women have been victims of either physical or sexual violence, or both, most of which are perpetrated by intimate partners. Intimate partner violence (IPV) has negative consequences for women's health, socio-economic and psychological wellbeing. Similarly, acceptance of IPV has negative implications for its spread, sympathy for victims, and utilisation of antenatal and postnatal healthcare services among women. This study investigates the influence of age, education, location, religion, marriage type, employment, wealth level, extramarital sex, smoking, internet use, media exposure and decision making on the justification of IPV, and how the associations vary between men and women. The study utilised the 2018 Nigeria's Demographic and Health Survey. The data analysed was comprised of 8,018 men and 28,888 women who were married or living with a partner. It was found that women are more likely to accept IPV than men (AOR: 1.627). Educational difference between spouses influences women's experience of and acceptance of IPV. Overall, being young, being uneducated, living in the north, being Muslim, being polygamous, being employed, being poor, having extra-marital sex, being a smoker, not having access to internet, and not being exposed to the media increased the odds of IPV justification. However, while Muslim women had higher odds of accepting IPV than Christians (AOR: 1.587), Muslim men have lower likelihood of IPV justification than Christian men (AOR: 0.759). Gender differences also exist in the influence of age, marriage type, employment, extra-marital sex, smoking, media exposure and decision making.

The 2009 H1N1 virus spread initially to the United States and Canada, with subsequent rapid global dissemination, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare \\"a public health emergency of international concern\\" in April 2009, and upgrading the viral threat to pandemic status in June 2009. Despite initial fears, the severity of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic overall did not differ significantly from that of seasonal influenza. However, the demographics of those at risk of severe illness did differ (affecting children and young adults, rather than the very young and the very old). The 2009 H1N1 pandemic led to rapid implementation of health care initiatives, including the provision of critical care services, to limit the effect of the influenza outbreak on the community.

Animal models are currently one of the important methods to study RA, but there are very few animal models for studying the pre-clinical phase of RA (Pre-RA). This study aimed to evaluate the similarity of different collagen-induced arthritis models to Pre-RA in rats. Three types of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were as follows: (i) standard collagen-induced group (Std-CIA), injected with 200 g type II collagen at day 0 and 100 g type II collagen at day 7; (ii) single collagen-induced group (Mono-CIA), injected with 200 g type II collagen at day 0; (iii) half-dose collagen-induced group (Half-CIA), injected with 100 g type II collagen at day 0 and 50 g type II collagen at day 7. Arthritis score, hind paw swelling, serum antibodies, and inflammatory cytokines were measured every 7 days. Gut microbiota analyses were performed on days 0, 11, 21, 28, and 35. Pain threshold measurement, digital radiography, and joint pathology were also assessed. Both Std-CIA and Mono-CIA could successfully cause RA symptoms, including joint swelling and bone erosion, Half-CIA induced only mild swelling in rats. Serum autoantibodies (anti-CCP and anti-CoII) showed no difference among the three types of CIA models, and so did the pain threshold at day 42. In addition, the pathological changes of joint tissues in the Mono-CIA group were the slightest among the collagen-immunized groups. Gut microbiota analysis demonstrated that Half-CIA could impose similar effects on upregulating genus Prevotella as Std-CIA, but Mono-CIA was weaker than them in rats. According to the characteristics of pre-RA, the Half-CIA model is the best suitable animal model for pre-RA among three types of CIA models in rats and can be a valuable model for pre-RA research.","output":"Evaluating the Similarity of Different Collagen-Induced Arthritis Models to the Pre-Clinical Phase of RA in Female Rats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Although COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory infection, mounting evidence suggests that the GI tract is involved in the disease, with gut barrier dysfunction and gut microbiota alterations being related to disease severity. Whether these alterations persist and could be related to long-term respiratory dysfunction is unknown. Design: From the NOR-Solidarity trial (n=181), plasma was collected during hospital admission and after three months, and analyzed for markers of gut barrier dysfunction and inflammation. At the three-month follow-up, pulmonary function was assessed by measuring diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and rectal swabs for gut microbiota analyses were collected (n= 97) and analysed by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Results: Gut microbiota diversity was reduced in COVID-19 patients with persistent respiratory dysfunction, defined as DLCO below lower limit of normal three months after hospitalization. These patients also had an altered global gut microbiota composition, with reduced abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 and increased abundance of Flavonifractor and Veillonella, the latter potentially being linked to fibrosis. During hospitalization, increased plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) were strongly associated with respiratory failure, defined as pO2/fiO2-(P/F-ratio)<26.6 kPa. LBP levels remained elevated during and after hospitalization, and was associated with low-grade inflammation and persistent respiratory dysfunction after three months. Conclusion: Persistent respiratory dysfunction after COVID-19 is associated with reduced biodiversity and gut microbiota alterations, along with persistently elevated LBP levels.

A large percentage of the patients are asymptomatic and hospitals around the world are struggling to restart routine services. We report the results of a universal testing protocol of all patients who underwent orthopaedic surgery in the month of July 2020 in a large orthopaedic speciality hospital in Bangalore, India. Methods: A retrospective study of all patients who underwent orthopaedic surgery in the month of July 2020 at a tertiary care orthopaedic speciality hospital in Bangalore, India. All patients underwent nasopharyngeal swab test before surgery. A questionnaire was used to assess the patient before the RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab test. Data regarding imaging, investigations and follow up was recorded. Results: In the month of July 2020, 168 patients underwent routine nasopharyngeal RT-PCR swab test for COVID-19 prior to planned orthopaedic surgical procedure (Both trauma and elective cases). 16 of the RT-PCR tests were positive. However vascular cases and absolute emergencies were done without a RT-PCR test with PPE and all universal precautions. 11 patients underwent emergency surgery without a RT-PCR test. All 16 cases who were positive were asymptomatic. The asymptomatic positive rate was 9.52%. Of the 11 patients who underwent emergency surgery without a RT-PCR test, only one patient had a positive test post-operatively. Conclusions: Routine nasopharyngeal RT-PCR testing revealed a high rate of asymptomatic cases. If the RT-PCR test is positive, it is best to defer the case till the test returns negative.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS In May and June 2020, Australian residents who believed themselves eligible to donate blood responded to measures assessing constructs from an integrated protection motivation theory, organizational trust, and theory of planned behavior framework, with donor status also assessed. RESULTS A total of 507 residents (47% male, mean age 28.69 years; 272 had donated/attempted to donate) participated. A revised structural equation model was a good fit to these data. In this model, perceived risk, severity, anxiety, and response cost associated with donating during the COVID-19 pandemic underpinned threat appraisals, while response efficacy, self-efficacy, and attitude toward donating during COVID-19 informed coping appraisals. Trust in the BCA predicted lower threat and higher coping appraisals, and higher coping appraisals predicted stronger subjective norms. Intention to donate during the COVID-19 pandemic was positively predicted by subjective norm and self-efficacy. Donation-related behavior was positively predicted by intention, with this relationship stronger for nondonors than donors. CONCLUSION Self-efficacy and approval from others, underpinned by coping appraisals and organizational trust, play a critical role in intentions to donate.

METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial at ten hospitals in Hubei, China. Eligible patients were adults (aged &#8805;18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days or less, oxygen saturation of 94% or less on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2-10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of placebo infusions for 10 days. Patients were permitted concomitant use of lopinavir-ritonavir, interferons, and corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement up to day 28, defined as the time (in days) from randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status (from 1=discharged to 6=death) or discharged alive from hospital, whichever came first. Primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and safety analysis was done in all patients who started their assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04257656. FINDINGS: Between Feb 6, 2020, and March 12, 2020, 237 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (158 to remdesivir and 79 to placebo); one patient in the placebo group who withdrew after randomisation was not included in the ITT population. Remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 123 [95% CI 087-175]). Although not statistically significant, patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less (hazard ratio 152 [095-243]). Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 remdesivir recipients versus 50 (64%) of 78 placebo recipients. Remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse events in 18 (12%) patients versus four (5%) patients who stopped placebo early.

The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of visitors and to measure the degree of seasonality of visitor flow in one of the most visited national park in Poland, named Sto?owe Mountains National Park (SMNP). The analysis in the study includes variability of daily visitor flow over a 4-year study period based on a determination of tourist seasons and sub-seasons. In order to accomplish this goal two indices were determined: Visitor Index (VI), Seasonality Index (SI). The relevant data were collected daily over a 4-year time period (2017C2019;1095 daily visitors) and preprocessed data during Covid-19 period in 2020, from a system of 39 pyroelectric sensors part of a Monitoring System of tourist traffic (MSTT).

The greatest advantage of the proposed indices make it possible to define tourist season periods regardless of the division into months and/or weeks. Presented seasons and sub-seasons last regardless of the monthly and weekly division, and taking into account the daily resolution data, these seasons can be precisely defined.

Amongst the 69 patients with severe COVID-19 that have been discharged from the intensive care units in our hospital, we have seen 11 individuals (16%) with such a mononeuritis multiplex. In many instances, the multi-focal nature of the weakness in these patients was initially unrecognised as symptoms were wrongly assumed to relate simply to critical illness neuromyopathy. While mononeuropathy is well recognised as an occasional complication of intensive care, our experience suggests that such deficits are surprisingly frequent and often disabling in patients recovering from severe COVID-19.","output":"Mononeuritis multiplex: an unexpectedly frequent feature of severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Post-acute and long-term care (PALTC) residents are disproportionately affected by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). We describe a health system approach that incorporated PALTC stakeholders to treat residents effectively and efficiently with monoclonal antibodies during the pandemic. DESIGN: Retrospective observational. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Integrated health system headquartered in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, with urban hub and surrounding rural communities. Patients of the health system include PALTC and assisted living (AL) residents of facilities. METHODS: Monoclonal Data Registry captured time to infusion after a positive COVID-19 test, residency (independent or PALTC), and site of infusion (PALTC, hospital outpatient, infusion center). AL residents are included in PALTC data. Registry limited to patients living in SD. Communication and operational resources were tailored to support PALTC infusions. The monoclonal antibody therapy administered to PALTC residents during the first 6 weeks after emergency use authorization (EUA) of monoclonal antibodies was bamlanivimab. The EUA for bamlanivimab was revoked due to lack of effectiveness against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants on April 16, 2021. RESULTS: The results are analyzed for the 6 weeks after bamlanivimab EUA. In PALTC, there was a median of 3 days between positive test and infusion. The total number of monoclonal antibody infusions captured in the registry during this time was 87 PALTC on-site infusions. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: A collaborative approach between health system executives and PALTC experts quickly enabled access to potentially life-saving therapy to a vulnerable population. PALTC settings should be routinely included in health system investment and planning to improve the capacity of the system to achieve optimal outcomes, prevent unnecessary mortality, and preserve health care resources.","output":"Health System Success in Delivering Bamlanivimab Within Post-acute and Long-Term Care Facilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Postnatal/postpartum depression (PND/PPD) had a pre-COVID-19 estimated prevalence ranging up to 23% in Europe, 33% in Australia, and 64% in America, and is detrimental to both mothers and their infants Low social support is a key risk factor for developing PND From an evolutionary perspective this is perhaps unsurprising, as humans evolved as cooperative childrearers, inherently reliant on social support to raise children The coronavirus pandemic has created a situation in which support from social networks beyond the nuclear family is likely to be even more important to new mothers, as it poses risks and stresses for mothers to contend with;whilst at the same time, social distancing measures designed to limit transmission create unprecedented alterations to their access to such support Using data from 162 mothers living in London with infants aged =11 cut-off for PND Quasi-Poisson regression modelling found that the number of network members seen in-person, and remote communication with a higher proportion of those not seen, was negatively associated with depressive symptoms;however, contact with a higher proportion of relatives was positively associated with symptoms, suggesting kin risked seeing mothers in need Thematic qualitative analysis of open text responses found that mothers experienced a burden of constant mothering, inadequacy of virtual contact, and sadness and worries about lost social opportunities, while support from partners facilitated family bonding While Western childrearing norms focus on intensive parenting, and fathers are key caregivers, our results highlight that it still \\"takes a village\\" to raise children in high-income populations and mothers are struggling in its absence","output":"Communication Across Maternal Social Networks During England's First National Lockdown and Its Association With Postnatal Depressive Symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Passive immunotherapy using whole blood or plasma from recovered patients is a potential therapeutic strategy for infections with no known drug therapy or prophylactic vaccines Much before, the concept of transfusing neutralizing antibodies through convalescent blood or plasma was established;this modality demonstrated its effectiveness in containing the havoc caused by diphtheria and tetanus during the early 20th century Convalescent blood products were effective in reducing the mortality risk when administered early in the disease course during the deadliest pandemic of Spanish flu in 1918 Even in the antibiotic era, the use of passive immunization strategy continued to expand with promising results against measles, Ebola, Argentine hemorrhagic fever, and Zika viruses It was also effective in reducing the mortality and viral load in severe acute respiratory syndrome, H5N1, H1N1, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Convalescent plasma administration carries the risk of anaphylactic reactions, transfusion-related acute lung injury, and transfusion-associated circulatory overload, but these are extremely rare The impact of the recent coronavirus disease 2019 is enormous with significant morbidity and mortality Until, a specific antiviral therapy or an effective vaccine is made available, the consideration for use of convalescent blood products, especially plasma, is warranted Conceptual and observational wisdom often blossoms among therapeutic penury ? 2020 Indian Journal of Rheumatology Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow","output":"Convalescent plasma therapy in severe coronavirus disease-2019: A narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic broke out in 2019, it is highly contagious, and the infection rate among medical staff is high.

With the instantaneous change in work environment forcing Americans to adapt to working at home, many theorize that women will be more adversely affected due to traditional concepts of women being more responsible for the home in addition to work responsibilities. Objective: Understand how women contributed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) literature early in the pandemic. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of manuscripts published in three high-impact U.S. medical journals from February to May 2020 was performed. We used log-binomial regression to examine for an association between COVID-19 status and likelihood of having at least one female first author, and evaluated for effect modification according to whether the manuscript was invited. Results: Among 980 manuscripts, 313 (31.9%) listed at least one female first author, 203 were written on COVID-19 (20.7%), and 144 (14.7%) were invited. There was no association between COVID-19 status and having at least one female first author overall (adjusted risk ratio [RR] 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72-1.19). The relationship between COVID-19 status and first-author sex was 0.23 (95% CI 0.06-0.92) for invited manuscripts and 1.04 (95% CI 0.81-1.35) for noninvited manuscripts (p for interaction 0.02). Discussion: We demonstrate that women were not less likely to be first authors on COVID-19 manuscripts but were less likely to be first authors on invited COVID-19 manuscripts. Early career female researchers are the most vulnerable for inability to meet metrics for promotion, accounting for the continued under-representation of women in senior academic roles.

Complications occurred in 62% of cases, mostly related to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation disorders. New cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) disturbances occurred in 8 patients undergoing free flaps and shunt dysfunction occurred in 5 patients undergoing local axial flaps. Four patients died shortly after the surgical procedure (perioperative mortality 10.8%). Combined scalp and skull deficiency present a challenging task.

Some anticancer treatments have been reported to have negative influences on COVID-19-infected patients while other studies did not support this hypothesis. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in WOS, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI and VIP between Dec 1, 2019 and Sept 23, 2020 for studies on anticancer treatments in patients with COVID-19. Cohort studies involving over 20 patients with cancer were included. The characteristics of the patients and studies, treatment types, mortality, and other additional outcomes were extracted and pooled for synthesis. RRs and forest plots were adopted to present the results. The literature quality and publication bias were assessed using NOS and Egger's test, respectively. RESULTS: We analyzed the data from 29 studies, with 5121 cancer patients with COVID-19 meeting the inclusion criteria. There were no significant differences in mortality between patients receiving anticancer treatment and those not (RR 1.17, 95%CI: 0.96-1.43, I2 =66%, p = 0.12). Importantly, in patients with hematological malignancies, chemotherapy could markedly increase the mortality (RR 2.68, 95% CI: 1.90-3.78, I2 =0%, p < 0.00001). In patients with solid tumors, no significant differences in mortality were observed (RR 1.16, 95% CI: 0.57-2.36, I2 =72%, p = 0.67). In addition, our analysis revealed that anticancer therapies had no effects on the ICU admission rate (RR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.70-1.09, I2 =25%, p = 0.23), the severe rate (RR 1.04, 95% CI: 0.95-1.13, I2 =31%, p = 0.42), or respiratory support rate (RR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.70-1.21, I2 =32%, p = 0.55) in COVID-19-infected patients with cancer.

While anticipating escape could aid rational therapeutic design, the complex rules governing viral escape are challenging to model. Here, we demonstrate an unprecedented ability to predict viral escape by using machine learning algorithms originally developed to model the complexity of human natural language. Our key conceptual advance is that predicting escape requires identifying mutations that preserve viral fitness, or grammaticality, and also induce high antigenic change, or semantic change. We develop viral language models for influenza hemagglutinin, HIV Env, and SARS-CoV-2 Spike that we use to construct antigenically meaningful semantic landscapes, perform completely unsupervised prediction of escape mutants, and learn structural escape patterns from sequence alone.

Furthermore, the optimal concentration of M. alba oil vapour for enhancing consumer preference and acceptance of cooked brown rice was 300-600 L/L with a rejection threshold of 2,052 L/L. Moreover, it was found that linalool was the main key component and caryophyllene and ?-elemene were the minor components affecting the sensory quality enhancement. Interestingly, the EEG results showed that fragrant cooked brown rice could increase the power of alpha and beta waves in the human brain, indicating anti-stress effects and a relaxed mood. Therefore, M. alba oil vapour demonstrated good potential to enhance consumer acceptance and preference for cooked brown rice while controlling the significant growth of moulds in brown rice.","output":"The effects of Michelia alba oil against mould on brown rice and assessing the brain response using electroencephalogram (EEG)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The present study intends to investigate COVID-19 by targeting their main proteins with 17 selected drugs used for treating Oral Lichen Planus (OLP) which is a chronic muco-cutaneous disorder. Here, an attempt is made to gain better insight into the structure of various drugs targeting specific proteins which will be helpful in developing drugs useful for therapeutic and preventive measures. METHOD: In silico studies, molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulations were performed to repurpose the therapeutic drugs (n = 17) which were used to treat OLP against COVID-19. In addition, the maximum binding affinities of the key protein spike glycoprotein, main-protease (M(pro)) of coronavirus, and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) in the human body were evaluated with the selected drugs. RESULTS: Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) showed the highest docking values among the drugs selected for repurposing. Among the target proteins, EGCG has shown maximum binding affinity with ACE-2 receptor. Further, according to the molecular dynamic simulation studies, EGCG has shown the least conformational fluctuations with M(pro). CONCLUSION: EGCG can be a potential inhibitor drug which can bind with ACE-2 receptor thus inhibiting the interaction of mainly M(pro) protein and spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. RELEVANCE FOR PATIENTS: EGCG, a natural compound shows antiviral potential having considerably high affinity and stability with SARS-CoV-2. It might be further employed as a lead drug against selective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 for the therapeutic management of COVID-19 patients after necessary clinical trials.","output":"Lichen planus drugs re-purposing as potential anti COVID-19 therapeutics through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Integrated epidemiological-economics models have recently appeared to study optimal government policy, especially stay-at-home orders (mass quarantines).

Materials and methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted from July 15, 2020, to September 15, 2020, in Dehradun, Haridwar, and Nainital districts of Uttarakhand, India. A total of 333 pregnant women were surveyed through an online platform. The psychological impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic was measured using the Impact of Event-Revised (IES-R) scale, and anxiety levels were measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results The survey results revealed that around three-fourths (73.6%) of the pregnant women reported minimal psychological impact, with a mean IES-R score of 16.9311.23, whereas 69.4% of respondents had a minimal level of anxiety, with a mean GAD-7 score of 3.093.73. Multivariate linear regression found a positive association between psychological impact and gestational age, occupation, religion, locality, conception, history of abortion (p<0.05). Also, the level of anxiety was significantly associated with education, occupation, monthly income, religion, marital and family support, history of mental illness (p<0.01), conception type, and awareness regarding COVID-19 (p<0.05).

In this study, siRNA-mediated silencing of Pin1 expression markedly suppressed the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. In addition, several recently generated Pin1 inhibitors showed strong inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 proliferation, measured by both viral mRNA and protein synthesis, and alleviated the cytopathic effect (CPE) on VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. One compound, termed H-77, was found to block SARS-CoV-2 proliferation at an EC 50 below 5 M regardless of whether it was added to the culture medium prior to or after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The inhibition of viral N protein mRNA synthesis by H-77 implies that the molecular mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-2 inhibition is likely to be associated with viral gene transcription or earlier steps. Another Pin1 inhibitor, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)a commercially available drug used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and which both activates the retinoic acid receptor and inhibits the activity of Pin1similarly reduced the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of underlying CVD and CVD risk factors with cancer history on in-hospital mortality in those with COVID-19. METHODS: Data from symptomatic adults hospitalized with COVID-19 at 86 hospitals in the US enrolled in the American Heart Associations COVID-19 CVD Registry was analyzed. The primary exposure was cancer history. The primary outcome was in-hospital death. Multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted for demographics, CVD risk factors, and CVD. Interaction between history of cancer with concomitant CVD and CVD risk factors were tested. RESULTS: Among 8222 patients, 892 (10.8%) had a history of cancer and 1501 (18.3%) died. Cancer history had significant interaction with CVD risk factors of age, body mass index (BMI), and smoking history, but not underlying CVD itself. History of cancer was significantly associated with increased in-hospital death (among average age and BMI patients, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.07C6.24; p < 0.0001 in those with a smoking history and aOR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.011.76; p = 0.04 in non-smokers). Among the cancer subgroup, prior use of chemotherapy within 2 weeks of admission was associated with in-hospital death (aOR = 1.72, 95%CI: 1.05C2.80; p = 0.03). Underlying CVD demonstrated a numerical but statistically nonsignificant trend toward increased mortality (aOR = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.991.41; p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, cancer history was a predictor of in-hospital mortality. Notably, among cancer patients, recent use of chemotherapy, but not underlying CVD itself, was associated with worse survival.

The survey was deployed to a sample of 238 and 218 customers of 20 Vietnamese commercial banks via email in 2018Q4 and 2020Q2, respectively. FP is measured using banks quarterly financial statements before Covid-19 and during the lockdown. Findings: CE with DB had a significant and positive impact on FP via customer satisfaction before Covid-19, while the other two intermediate variables (word-of-mouth [WoM] and trust) had no considerable impact. During the lockdown, only WoM had a positive impact on FP. These findings indicate that before Covid-19, when customers could easily interact with their bank through many touchpoints, customer satisfaction with DB services created higher FP for the bank.

AREAS COVERED: Although a massive endothelial disruption is a rare condition, caused by acute and uncontrolled inflammatory responses (e.g., the cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection), more frequently the vascular tree is the first target of slowly progressive inflammatory processes which affect the integrity of endothelium and its \\"barrier\\" function, supporting the onset of atherosclerotic plaque and spreading inflammation. This endothelial dysfunction leads to decrease NO biosynthesis, impaired regulation of vascular tone and increased platelet aggregation. Such a chronic sub-clinic inflammation leads to macrophage infiltration in atherosclerotic lesions. Therefore, many efforts should be addressed to find useful approaches to preserve vascular endothelium from inflammation. In this review, the authors have evaluated the most recent strategies to counteract this pathological condition. EXPERT OPINION: The therapeutic and nutraceutical approaches represent useful tools to treat, slow down or prevent different phases of vascular inflammation. In particular, the pharmacological approach should be used in advanced phases characterized by clinical signs of vascular disease, whilst the nutraceutical approach may represent a promising preventive strategy to preserve the integrity of the endothelial tissue.","output":"Recent efforts in drug discovery on vascular inflammation and consequent atherosclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The uses of antiviral agents are increasing in the new era along with the development of vaccines for the effective control of viral diseases.

STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed 4 state policies, 2 COVID-related state executive orders, and clinic-level survey data on medication abortion provision from fourteen abortion facilities in Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia from December 2019 to December 2020. We calculated the percent of medication abortions provided at these facilities during the study period by state, to assess changes in medication abortion use during the pandemic. RESULTS: We ascertained that COVID-19-executive orders in Ohio and West Virginia that limited procedural abortion in Spring 2020 coincided with an increase in the overall number and proportion of medication abortions in this region, peaking at 1613 medication abortions (70%) in April 2020. Ohio and West Virginia, which had executive orders limiting procedural abortion, saw relatively greater increases in April compared to Kentucky. Despite temporary lifting of the mifepristone REMS, prepandemic regulations banning telemedicine abortion in Kentucky and West Virginia and requiring in-person clinic visits for medication abortion distribution in Ohio limited clinics' ability to adapt to offer medication abortion by mail. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings illustrate how restrictive medication and telemedicine abortion policies in Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia created additional obstacles for patients seeking medication abortion during the pandemic. Permanently lifting federal regulations on in-clinic distribution of mifepristone would only advantage abortion seekers in states without restrictive telehealth and medication abortion policies. State policies that limit access to comprehensive abortion services should be central in larger efforts toward dismantling barriers that impinge upon reproductive autonomy. IMPLICATION STATEMENT: We find that abolishing the REMS on mifepristone would not be enough to expand access to patients in abortion-restrictive states with telemedicine and medication abortion laws.

SARS-CoV-2 contains genes encoding non-structural proteins (NSPs), structural proteins, and accessory proteins. The NSPs are mainly involved in replication of the virus within the host and inhibition of the host defence system. Structural proteins are involved in viral entry and attachment to host cells, preservation of the core virion and elicit the majority of the immune response. The functions of the accessory proteins are largely unknown. Most focus has been given to structural proteins, especially the spike protein as the strongest vaccine candidate. However, the recent emergence of spike variants and their ability to rapidly transmit and escape neutralisation by vaccine-induced antibodies has threatened the global community.

We conducted a systematic scoping review to explore the complexity of pain recognition, assessment and treatment for residents living in care homes, and to understand the contexts that might influence its management. METHODS: Scoping review using the methodological framework of Levac and colleagues. Articles were included if they examined pain assessment and/or management, for care or nursing home residents. We searched Medline, CINAHL, ASSIA, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar; reference lists were also screened, and website searches carried out of key organisations. Conversations with 16 local care home managers were included to gain an understanding of their perspective. RESULTS: Inclusion criteria were met by 109 studies. Three overarching themes were identified: Staff factors and beliefs - in relation to pain assessment and management (e.g. experience, qualifications) and beliefs and perceptions relating to pain.

METHODS: We systematically review available information on the environmental inactivation of influenza A viruses and employ information on infectious dose and results from mathematical models to assess transmission modes. RESULTS: Daily inactivation rate constants differ by several orders of magnitude: on inanimate surfaces and in aerosols daily inactivation rates are in the order of 1C10(2), on hands in the order of 10(3). Influenza virus can survive in aerosols for several hours, on hands for a few minutes. Nasal infectious dose of influenza A is several orders of magnitude larger than airborne infectious dose. CONCLUSIONS: The airborne route is a potentially important transmission pathway for influenza in indoor environments. The importance of droplet transmission has to be reassessed. Contact transmission can be limited by fast inactivation of influenza virus on hands and is more so than airborne transmission dependent on behavioral parameters. However, the potentially large inocula deposited in the environment through sneezing and the protective effect of nasal mucus on virus survival could make contact transmission a key transmission mode.","output":"Inactivation of influenza A viruses in the environment and modes of transmission: A critical review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way many people live.

Broad-spectrum antivirals could be deployed as first-line interventions during an outbreak while virus-specific drugs and vaccines are developed and rolled out. Viruses depend on the host's protein synthesis machinery for replication. Several natural compounds that target the cellular DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A, a key component of the eukaryotic translation initiation complex eIF4F, have emerged as potential broad-spectrum antivirals. Rocaglates, a group of flavaglines of plant origin that clamp mRNAs with highly structured 5' untranslated regions (5'UTRs) onto the surface of eIF4A through specific stacking interactions, exhibit the largest selectivity and potential therapeutic indices among all known eIF4A inhibitors. Their unique mechanism of action limits the inhibitory effect of rocaglates to the translation of eIF4A-dependent viral mRNAs and a minor fraction of host mRNAs exhibiting stable RNA secondary structures and/or polypurine sequence stretches in their 5'UTRs, resulting in minimal potential toxic side effects. Maintaining a favorable safety profile while inducing efficient inhibition of a broad spectrum of RNA viruses makes rocaglates into primary candidates for further development as pan-antiviral therapeutics.","output":"Targeting the DEAD-Box RNA Helicase eIF4A with Rocaglates-A Pan-Antiviral Strategy for Minimizing the Impact of Future RNA Virus Pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent high-resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies have detected persistent flow instability in intracranial aneurysms (IAs) that was not observed in previous in silico studies. These flow fluctuations have shown incidental association with rupture in a small aneurysm dataset. The aims of this study are to explore the capabilities and limitations of a commercial cfd solver in capturing such velocity fluctuations, whether fluctuation kinetic energy (fKE) as a marker to quantify such instability could be a potential parameter to predict aneurysm rupture, and what geometric parameters might be associated with such fluctuations. First, we confirmed that the second-order discretization schemes and high spatial and temporal resolutions are required to capture these aneurysmal flow fluctuations. Next, we analyzed 56 patient-specific middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms (12 ruptured) by transient, high-resolution CFD simulations with a cycle-averaged, constant inflow boundary condition. Finally, to explore the mechanism by which such flow instabilities might arise, we investigated correlations between fKE and several aneurysm geometrical parameters. Our results show that flow instabilities were present in 8 of 56 MCA aneurysms, all of which were unruptured bifurcation aneurysms. Statistical analysis revealed that fKE could not differentiate ruptured from unruptured aneurysms. Thus, our study does not lend support to these flow instabilities (based on a cycle-averaged constant inflow as opposed to peak velocity) being a marker for rupture. We found a positive correlation between fKE and aneurysm size as well as size ratio. This suggests that the intrinsic flow instability may be associated with the breakdown of an inflow jet penetrating the aneurysm space.","output":"Flow Instability Detected by High-Resolution Computational Fluid Dynamics in Fifty-Six Middle Cerebral Artery Aneurysms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Chest CT may be used as a tool for rapid coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) detection. Our aim was to investigate the value of additional chest CT for detection of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) in patients who undergo head CT for suspected stroke or head trauma in a COVID-19-endemic region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 27 patients (mean age, 74 years; range, 54-90 years; 20 men) who underwent head CT for suspected stroke (n = 21) or head trauma (n = 6), additional chest CT for COVID-19 detection, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing in a COVID-19-endemic region. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 were calculated. RESULTS: Final neurologic diagnoses were ischemic stroke (n = 11), brain contusion (n = 5), nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage (n = 2), brain metastasis (n = 1), and no primary neurologic disorder (n = 8). Symptoms of possible COVID-19 infection (ie, fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath) were present in 20 of 27 (74%) patients. Seven of 27 patients (26%) had real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed-COVID-19 infection. Chest CT results were 6 true-positives, 15 true-negatives, 5 false-positives, and 1 false-negative. Diagnostic performance values of chest CT were a sensitivity of 85.7%, specificity of 75.0%, negative predictive value of 93.8%, and positive predictive value of 54.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of additional chest CT is fairly high. However, a negative result does not exclude COVID-19. The positive predictive value is poor.

When clinical suspicion of new VTE during the 30-day follow-up, additional ultrasound or thoracic CT were performed. Global VTE frequency, major bleeding events and survival were collected, and their predictors were studied. RESULTS: We included 230 patients. After 30 days of follow-up, there were 95 VTE events in 86 patients (37,4%). 13 patients (5,7%) developed major bleeding complications and 42 patients (18,3%) died. None of the comorbidities or previous treatments were related with bleeding events. D-dimer at admission was significantly related with VTE development and mortality. Independent predictors of mortality in the regression model were an older age (>66 years), D-dimer at admission (>1 500ng/mL) and low lymphocyte count (<0,45x109/L) with an AUC in the ROC curve of 0,81 (95%CI: 0,73-0,89).

It seeks to evaluate whether certain job functions are associated with a higher risk of being infected and to clarify if such association is mediated by the number of individuals that employees meet during a workday. In addition, we investigate regional and national differences in seroprevalence.

RESULTS: Of the 3272 Falck employees participating in this study, 159 (4.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroprevalence was lower among Danish Falck employees than among those from Sweden (2.8% in Denmark and 8.3% in Sweden). We also found that the number of customer or patient contacts during a workday was the most prominent predictor for seropositivity and that ambulance staff was the most vulnerable staff group.

Due to the rapid spread, strong contagion, high incidence of lethality in severe cases, and the lack of a pharmaceutical prevention or cure, COVID-19 has posed a serious threat to human life and health. It has also had a tremendous impact on mental health, including fear and worry, difficulty sleeping or concentrating, and increased use of poor coping mechanisms. Osteopathic medical students have had additional concerns regarding the interruption of their studies, closing of clinical rotations, and postponed licensing exams. To date, few reports have focused on osteopathic medical students and their reactions to the outbreak. OBJECTIVES To assess resilience, coping, health behaviors, and emotional wellbeing of osteopathic medical students during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, we distributed an anonymous online survey to all medical students enrolled at Nova Southeastern University in May 2020 (n=1,310) via an e-mail invitation using the institution's student listservs. Our major study variables were based on published reports and anecdotal evidence; we subsequently developed the Emotional Wellbeing in Healthcare Professions Students Questionnaire (EWB-Q). This EWB-Q contained validated scales to assess the contribution of levels of coping strategies used, personal resilience, and health behaviors on the emotional wellbeing of osteopathic medical students. Multiple linear regression and other statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS v0.26. RESULTS Of the 1,310 students invited to participate, 335 (25.5%) surveys were returned. Of those, 133 had more than 33% of the necessary data missing and were removed, resulting in 202 (15.4%) completed questionnaires. The mean age of the participants was 26.7 years. About half (n=92; 45.5%) were in the clinical phase (years 3 and 4) of their medical school training (in rotations). A significant regression equation was found (F[4,171]=17.481, p<0.000, R 2 =0.290, R 2adjusted=0.274), indicating that levels of coping, personal resilience, and health behaviors (i.e., not sleeping more than usual, not exercising less than usual) accounted for a significant amount of the variance in emotional wellbeing scores in osteopathic medical students. Higher levels of resilience, greater use of coping strategies, not sleeping more than usual, and not exercising less than usual were predictors of emotional wellbeing. CONCLUSIONS Cultivating positive mental health should be a high priority for medical educators as they develop and implement curriculum-based initiatives to help medical students bolster their personal resilience and to encourage healthy coping behaviors during times of crisis and beyond. A proactive position that assists with building personal resilience and developing stress management habits is paramount in assisting students who are grappling not only with the challenges of rigorous medical training, but also with the uncertainty and stress that exists during any major global health or socioeconomic crisis.","output":"Predictors of emotional wellbeing in osteopathic medical students in a COVID-19 world."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Economic evaluations of public health interventions to prevent malaria should consider the adoption of wider perspectives and the inclusion of non-health impacts, particularly economic development outcomes, such as education.

On the other hand, even without acute kidney injury, COVID-19 was a major cause of death globally in the year 2020, but the occurrence of acute kidney injury among COVID-19 patients is an independent risk factor of increased mortality. Continuous renal replacement therapy has been recommended to treat acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients instead of conventional intermittent hemodialysis. Moreover, its use might have another beneficial role in stopping the progression of severe COVID-19 by removing pro-inflammatory cytokines during cytokine storm syndrome, which is postulated as the pathophysiology behind severe and critically severe cases of COVID-19.

Recent conflict escalation between China and western countries gives rise to widespread concern over the possibility of delinking China from global trade and supply chain. By drawing on utility theory, we suggest that the political relationship is a key determinant of collective emotions of consumers and trading companies and consequently the interactions between importers and exporters. We hypothesize that warmer relations lead to larger increases (or smaller decreases) in trade while cooler relations have the opposite effect. Based on monthly data of China and her twelve trading partners from 1981 to 2019, our study provides an empirical investigation into the association between political relationship and bilateral trade flows. Our results show that shocks to relations are highly persistent and frequently cause changes in trade. However, relations themselves are little influenced by changes in trade, changes that show little persistence. We also address the US-China trade war and the observation that innovations to Chinas exports to the US improve Chinas relations with the US while shocks to American exports to China worsen relations from Chinas perspective.","output":"Do political relations affect international trade?

However, despite the fact that this pandemic airborne disease has been with us for two full years, many restaurants are still not successfully prioritising air renovation as a key tool for reducing infection risk. We demonstrate this in the run-up to the 2021 Christmas celebrations by reporting on CO2 concentration data obtained from a hotel breakfast room and restaurants during the 5-day Spanish holiday period of 4th-8th December. In the case of the breakfast room, inadequate ventilation resulted in average CO2 levels ranging from 868 to 1237ppm on five consecutive days, with the highest levels coinciding with highest occupancy numbers. Inside the five restaurants, three of these were well ventilated, maintaining stable average CO2 concentrations below 700ppm. In contrast, two restaurants failed to keep average CO2 levels below 1000ppm, despite sporadic, but ineffective, attempts by one of them to ventilate the establishment. More effort needs to be made to foster in both restaurant managers and the general public an improved awareness of the value of CO2 concentrations as an infection risk proxy and the relevance of ventilation issues to the propagation of respiratory diseases.","output":"Carbon dioxide, COVID-19 and the importance of restaurant ventilation: a case study from Spain approaching Christmas 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transcriptomic methods are set to revolutionize the study of the immune system in naturally occurring nonmodel organisms. With this in mind, the present article focuses on ways in which the use of nonmodel rodents (not the familiar laboratory species) can advance studies into the classical, but ever relevant, epidemiologic triad of immune defence, infectious disease and environment. For example, naturally occurring rodents are an interesting system in which to study the environmental stimuli that drive the development and homeostasis of the immune system and, by extension, to identify where these stimuli are altered in anthropogenic environments leading to the formation of immunopathological phenotypes. Measurement of immune expression may help define individual heterogeneity in infectious disease susceptibility and transmission and facilitate our understanding of infection dynamics and risk in the natural environment; furthermore, it may provide a means of surveillance that can filter individuals carrying previously unknown acute infections of potential ecological or zoonotic importance. Finally, the study of immunology in wild animals may reveal interactions within the immune system and between immunity and other organismal traits that are not observable under restricted laboratory conditions. Potentiating much of this is the possibility of combining gene expression profiles with analytical tools derived from ecology and systems biology to reverse engineer interaction networks between immune responses, other organismal traits and the environment (including symbiont exposures), revealing regulatory architecture. Such holistic studies promise to link ecology, epidemiology and immunology in natural systems in a unified approach that can illuminate important problems relevant to human health and animal welfare and production.","output":"Immunology in wild nonmodel rodents: an ecological context for studies of health and disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus infection is a rapidly spreading infectious disease that primarily affects the respiratory system and vascular endothelium and has a serious negative impact on healthcare economy and system around the world.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on the incidence and case fatality rate (CFR) of OHCA. We also evaluated the impact on intermediate outcomes and clinical characteristics. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception to May 3, 2021. Studies were included if they compared OHCA processes and outcomes between the pandemic and historical control time periods. Meta-analyses were performed for primary outcomes [annual incidence, mortality, and case fatality rate (CFR)], secondary outcomes [field termination of resuscitation (TOR), return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to hospital admission, and survival to hospital discharge], and clinical characteristics (shockable rhythm and etiologies). This study was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42021253879). RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a 39.5% increase in pooled annual OHCA incidence (p < 0.001). Pooled CFR was increased by 2.65% (p < 0.001), with a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 1.95 for mortality [95% confidence interval (95%CI) 1.51C2.51]. There was increased field TOR (OR = 2.46, 95%CI 1.62C3.74). There were decreased ROSC (OR = 0.65, 95%CI 0.55C0.77), survival to hospital admission (OR = 0.65, 95%CI 0.48C0.89), and survival to discharge (OR = 0.52, 95%CI 0.40C0.69).

In this study, we investigated the risk factors associated with local recurrence of HCC after single-session RFA with a single electrode insertion. From April 2003 to December 2007, we treated 138 HCC lesions by single-session RFA with a single electrode insertion using the Cool-tip RFA, RTC 2000 and RTC 3000 Systems. Risk factors for the local recurrence of these lesions and complications after RFA were analyzed. The mean size of the 138 lesions was 16.95.4 mm in diameter (range 7-33 mm). Local recurrence rates were 6.6 and 22.0% at 1 and 2 years, respectively, during the mean follow-up period of 16.4 months. Univariate analysis showed that tumor diameter (20 mm), tumor location, pre-treatment AFP-L3 fraction level and ablation pattern were significant variables. Multivariate analysis of these four variables identified only the tumor diameter as an independent risk factor for local recurrence. Complications occurred in 2.2% of the lesions (3/138). Single-session RFA is an effective treatment for HCC in that it reduces serious complications.

Currently, experimental characterization of these properties is the most accurate method, however, this is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. A number of computational methods have been developed in this context but most of the existing PLI prediction heavily depends on 2D protein sequence data. Here, we present a novel parallel graph neural network (GNN) to integrate knowledge representation and reasoning for PLI prediction to perform deep learning guided by expert knowledge and informed by 3D structural data. We develop two distinct GNN architectures: [Formula: see text] is the base implementation that employs distinct featurization to enhance domain-awareness, while [Formula: see text] is a novel implementation that can predict with no prior knowledge of the intermolecular interactions. The comprehensive evaluation demonstrated that GNN can successfully capture the binary interactions between ligand and proteins 3D structure with 0.979 test accuracy for [Formula: see text] and 0.958 for [Formula: see text] for predicting activity of a proteinCligand complex.

Corona composition is known to be influenced by the chemical composition of nanoparticles. In contrast, the possible effects of variations in the human blood proteome between healthy individuals on the formation of the corona and its subsequent interactions with immune cells in blood are unknown. Herein, we prepared and examined a matrix of 11 particles (including organic and inorganic particles of three sizes and five surface chemistries) and plasma samples from 23 healthy donors to form donor-specific biomolecular coronas (personalized coronas) and investigated the impact of the personalized coronas on particle interactions with immune cells in human blood. Among the particles examined, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-coated mesoporous silica (MS) particles, irrespective of particle size (800, 450, or 100 nm in diameter), displayed the widest range (up to 60-fold difference) of donor-dependent variance in immune cell association. In contrast, PEG particles (after MS core removal) of 860, 518, or 133 nm in diameter displayed consistent stealth behavior (negligible cell association), irrespective of plasma donor. For comparison, clinically relevant PEGylated doxorubicin-encapsulated liposomes (Doxil) (74 nm in diameter) showed significant variance in association with monocytes and B cells across all plasma donors studied. An in-depth proteomic analysis of each biomolecular corona studied was performed, and the results were compared against the nanoparticle-blood cell association results, with individual variance in the proteome driving differential association with specific immune cell types. We identified key immunoglobulin and complement proteins that explicitly enriched or depleted within the corona and which strongly correlated with the cell association pattern observed across the 23 donors.

Complex webs of factors- sociodemographic, clinical, genetic, environmental- intersect, rendering causality difficult to decipher. We aimed to demonstrate the ability of Mendelian Randomization (MR) to overcome the issues posed by confounding and reverse causality to determine the causal risk factors for the acquisition of infectious diseases, using Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) as a model pathogen. Methods We mapped the complex evidence from the literature prior to this study factors associated with EBV serostatus (as a proxy for infection) into a causal diagram to determine putative risk factors for our study. Using data from the UK Biobank of 8,422 individuals genomically deemed to be of white British ancestry between the ages of 40 and 69 at recruitment between the years 2006 and 2010, we performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) of EBV serostatus, followed by a Two Sample MR to determine which putative risk factors were causal. Results Our GWAS identified two novel loci associated with EBV serostatus. In MR analyses, we confirmed educational attainment, number of sexual partners, and smoking as causal risk factors for EBV serostatus. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the power of MR to decipher complex webs of putative risk factors and determine which are causal for the acquisition of an infectious disease.

There have been some success stories such as in China, South Korea and our ASEAN member fellow, Vietnam, which exhibited extremely fallen numbers of COVID-19 cases post the enforcement of lockdown. Indonesia, however, remains in the crux of dispute whether or not the lockdown is opted to force COVID-19 transmission down under control. We, in this respect, employ the most popular model which has been broadly applied in the field of epidemiology, referred to as SEIRD (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered, and Death), the extension form of an age-structured SEIR, where the Death (D) is included to provide more factual situation. We modify the I (Infectious) fraction as symp-tomatic (Is) and asymptomatic (Ia) infectives. There are three lockdown scenarios simulated in our modified SEIRD with the starting date are 26 April 2020 when the immediate lockdown was enacted-and a-week and two-week-gaps, respectively. We figured out that by stipulating the lockdown without delay (26 April 2020), the new cases could be kept below 10,000. A week delay escalates case number to 5,000 and delay for one more week results in beyond 20,000 new cases. Furthermore, when the intervention is delayed following the delayed lockdown, normalization would demand a longer period within which dealing with more critical and dying patients is unavoidable and should be more anticipated.","output":"Lockdown strategy worth lives: The SEIRD modelling in COVID-19 outbreak in Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following up large numbers of candidates in continuous gravitational wave searches presents a challenge, particularly in regard to computational power and the time required to manually scrutinize each of the candidates.

The most common NHL subtypes are diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), including primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and follicular lymphoma (FL). Although a majority of patients respond to standard-of-care therapy, many patients with NHL eventually relapse, highlighting the need for additional treatments. Real-world data regarding the safety and efficacy of emerging therapies in the relapsed/refractory (R/R) population, and the association between treatment patterns and patient outcomes, are limited. These data could provide unique insights to clinical and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes in patients with DLBCL, FL, or PMBCL treated with emerging therapies, especially novel options such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies. Methods: The Connect ? Lymphoma Disease Registry (NCT04982471) is a US-based, multicenter, prospective observational cohort study of patients with R/R NHL (DLBCL, FL, and PMBCL). Approximately 2100 patients  18 years of age from ~200 community oncology (~80%) or academic (~20%) sites will be enrolled over a ~3-year period. Patients with histologically confirmed NHL subtypes will be enrolled into 1 of 4 cohorts: first R/R DLBCL, second R/R DLBCL, first R/R FL, or first R/R PMBCL (Figure). Patients will be required to have begun second- (first R/R) or third- (second R/R) line systemic treatment within 60 days prior to enrollment. Patients receiving treatment for any active malignancy other than DLBCL, FL, or PMBCL at the time of enrollment, or who are diagnosed with any other malignancy in the 6 months prior to enrollment, will be excluded. All treatment and management decisions will be determined by the practicing clinicians. Patients may undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, CAR T cell therapy, or other treatments at other sites while participating in this study. Patients will be followed from enrollment for up to 5 years or until death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or study termination, whichever occurs first. Data collection will occur at enrollment (baseline) and then every ~3 months. The main objectives of the Connect ? Registry are to describe patient characteristics, practice patterns, and factors associated with treatment choice, sequencing, and effectiveness in NHL subtypes. Secondary objectives include describing treatment regimen safety, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) including HRQoL, and healthcare resource utilization outcomes. Exploratory objectives include tumor and blood biomarker evaluation and understanding the availability of social support and its impact on long-term treatment decision-making. Case report forms will be used to collect clinical and treatment data, including baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment details and response, and socioeconomic factors. Outcome measures for efficacy will be progression-free survival, event-free survival, objective response rate, time to next treatment, and overall survival. The availability of social support will be assessed via a specific questionnaire administered at baseline. General (EQ-5D-5L) and disease-specific (FACT-Lym) questionnaires will also be administered. Patients may also optionally agree to release tumor biopsies and blood samples for biomarker analysis. Clinicians will be required to report serious adverse events (AEs), secondary primary malignancies, and confirmed COVID-19 infections within 24 hours. Non-serious AEs of interest include grade 1-3 cytokine release syndrome, grade 1-3 neurotoxicity, grade 3 colitis, grade 3 arrhythmia, grade 3 hemorrhage. Other AEs of interest to be collected include grade 3 hypogammaglobulinemia, prolonged grade 3 cytopenia, and grade 3 infections. Data collected in the Connect ? Registry will increase understanding of the association between emerging therapies and patient outcomes for R/R DLBCL, FL, and PMBCL.

This paper analyzes the tax law changes adopted in the TCJA that impact cross-border investment within the context of several decades of policy proposals that recognized the flaws and deficiencies of the prior system and attempted to develop proposals that balanced creating incentives for the efficient use of capital and the benefits of US investment overseas while minimizing incentives for profit shifting. Reviewing the various provisions of the law in the context of a series of reform proposals made over the previous decade shows the extent to which most of the international law changes introduced by the TCJA closely followed these well-developed ideas. And yet, there appears to be a disconnect between the goals of the law change and the extent to which the laws as enacted have effectuated that change. The divergence provides a cautionary tale for public finance economists wishing to engage in international tax regime change.","output":"Designing international tax reform: lessons from TCJA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection can involve many organs, such as central nervous system, including in relapse. We describe the case of a 64-year-old woman with microbiologically confirmed COVID-19-induced respiratory distress whose treatment resulted in a negative nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) result for COVID-19. However, after a few weeks, relapse occurred, as indicated by symptoms of acute meningoencephalitis. Results of COVID-19 RT-PCR testing from her cerebrospinal fluid, nasopharyngeal and tracheal aspiration specimens became positive again, but COVID-19 serum antibodies were negative. We therefore note that symptoms with neurologic involvement can be one of COVID-19's first presentations, or they can appear at relapse.

In experimental studies, Bactrian camels are susceptible to MERS-CoV infection similar to dromedary camels; however, neither the virus, viral RNA, nor virus-specific antibodies were detected in Bactrian camel field samples so far. The aim of our study was to survey Mongolian camels for MERS-CoV-specific antibodies. A total of 180 camel sera, collected in 2016 and 2017, were involved in this survey: 17 of 180 sera were seropositive with an initial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test performed at the State Central Veterinary Laboratory in Mongolia. These 17 positive sera plus 53 additional negative sera were sent to the Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIAID/NIH, and tested for the presence of antibodies with a similar ELISA, an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and a virus neutralization test (VNT). In these additional tests, a total of 21 of 70 sera were positive with ELISA and 10 sera were positive with IFA; however, none was positive in the VNT.

Over the years, migrants remittances have played an important role in the social and economic development of Albania and Albanian families. The health emergency caused by the Covid-19 pandemic is expected to reshape our economy and could be devastating for migrants too. This pandemic is expected to change the context for international migration and potentially cause a decrease in remittances from Albanian migrants. And yet, surprisingly, there is a lack of effective mechanisms, policies, and recovery paths for increasing the positive impact of remittances on the country's development. The paper suggests that the way remittances are managed is important. Based on the context of Albania, remittances can be encouraged and facilitated through developing private-public-people partnerships, lowering costs, and using them for entrepreneurial initiatives rather than consumption. The key contributions of the paper lie in extending discussions of value of collecting data on remittances, providing a dynamic view of the multiplicity of factors behind remittances and giving some predictions for whats to come next in regards to remittances after coronavirus. ? 2013-2021 Transnational Press London, All Rights Reserved.","output":"Remittances to Albania: Before and after the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is pandemic (October 2020), opening up many research opportunities.

Here, we used EMG data gathered during mouse locomotion to investigate the effects of calculation parameters and data quality on two metrics for fractal analysis: the Higuchis fractal dimension (HFD) and the Hurst exponent (H). A curve is fractal if it repeats itself at every scale or, in other words, if its shape remains unchanged when zooming in the curve at every zoom level. Many linear and nonlinear analysis methods are available, each of them aiming at the explanation of different data features. In recent years, fractal analysis has become a powerful nonlinear tool to extract information from physiological data not visible to the naked eye. It can present, however, some dangerous pitfalls that can lead to misleading interpretations. To calculate the HFD and the H, we have extracted muscle synergies from normal and mechanically perturbed treadmill locomotion from the hindlimb of adult mice. Then, we used one set per condition (normal and perturbed walking) of the obtained time-dependent coefficients to create surrogate data with different fluctuations over the original mean signal. Our analysis shows that HFD and H are exceptionally sensitive to the presence or absence of perturbations to locomotion. However, both metrics suffer from variations in their value depending on the parameters used for calculations and the presence of quasi-periodic elements in the time series. We discuss those issues giving some simple suggestions to reduce the chance of misinterpreting the outcomes. New & Noteworthy Despite the lack of consensus on how to perform fractal analysis of physiological time series, many studies rely on this technique. Here, we shed light on the potential pitfalls of using the Higuchis fractal dimension and the Hurst exponent.

In this review, we narrated the available data, from credible publishers, regarding the possible role of polyphenols and natural extracts-containing polyphenols in the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and their immune-boosting properties. It was revealed that polyphenols could be considered as promising biologically active substances for the prevention of COVID-19. The underlying potential mechanism behind this action is mostly due to the antiviral activities and the immune-regulation functions of polyphenols against COVID-19-infections. Antivirus polyphenolic-based medications can mitigate SARS-CoV-2-enzymes, which are vital for virus duplication and infection. It was also found that triterpenoid, anthraquinone, flavonoids, and tannins are possible keys to scheming antiviral therapies for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2-proteases. The identified pharmacophore structures of polyphenols could be utilized in the explanation of novel anti-COVID-19 designs.

We aimed to analyze the underlying ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam resistance mechanisms in all MDR/XDR P. aeruginosa isolates recovered during one year (2020) from patients with a documented P. aeruginosa infection. Fifteen isolates showing ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam resistance were evaluated. Clinical conditions, previous positive cultures and -lactams received in the previous month were reviewed for each patient. MICs were determined by broth microdilution. MLSTs and resistance mechanisms were determined using short- and long-read WGS. The impact of PDCs on -lactam resistance was demonstrated by cloning into an ampC-deficient PAO1 derivative (PAOC) and construction of 3D models. Genetic support of acquired -lactamases was determined in silico from high-quality hybrid assemblies. In most cases, the isolates were recovered after treatment with ceftolozane/tazobactam or ceftazidime/avibactam. Seven isolates from different STs owed their -lactam resistance to chromosomal mutations and all displayed specific substitutions in PDC: Phe121Leu and Gly222Ser, Pro154Leu, Ala201Thr, Gly214Arg, Gly203-Glu219 and Glu219Lys. In the other eight isolates, the ST175 clone was overrepresented (6 isolates) and associated with IMP-28 and IMP-13, whereas two ST1284 isolates produced VIM-2. The cloned PDCs conferred enhanced cephalosporin resistance. 3D PDC models revealed rearrangements affecting residues involved in cephalosporin hydrolysis. Carbapenemases were chromosomal (VIM-2) or plasmid-borne (IMP-28, IMP-13), and associated with class-1 integrons located in Tn402-like transposition modules.

LL-37 is formed by cleavage of the propeptide hCAP18 coded with CAMP gene.

We previously failed to demonstrate in a clinical trial that supplementation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) improves LL-37 serum levels. The aim of this work was to evaluate the impact of 25(OH)D supplementation on intracellular expression of CAMP and secretion of LL-37 in an ex vivo model using the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). PBMC collected from healthy donors and incubated with different concentrations of 25(OH)D (0 ng/ml: control (D0); 25 ng/ml: deficient (D25); 75 ng/ml: physiological (D75); 125 ng/ml: supraphysiological (D125)) were stimulated or not with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 ng/ml) or synthetic double-stranded RNA Poly (I: C) (PIC, 10 g/ml). The intracellular expressions of the CAMP gene and the hCAP18 peptide were measured respectively after 24-h and 48-h incubation periods. The concentration of LL-37 was determined in the culture medium after 48-h incubation. 25(OH)D significantly induced CAMP gene expression at 24 h with a maximum effect at a dose of D125 in either unstimulated (tenfold expression) or stimulated (LPS: 100-fold expression; PIC: 15-fold expression) conditions. Intracellular hCAP18 peptide was overexpressed at 48 h under unstimulated (1.5-fold, D125) and stimulated conditions, LPS (twofold, D125) and PIC (2.5-fold, D125). The secretion of LL-37 in the culture medium was significantly induced by 25(OH)D only in both stimulated (LPS and PIC) conditions in a dose-dependent manner.

However, there is uncertainty in the effectiveness of such measures for specific regions with varying population demographics and different levels of adherence to social distancing. The objective of this paper is to determine the impact of social distancing measures in unique regions. METHODS: We developed COVid-19 Agent-based simulation Model (COVAM), an agent-based simulation model (ABM) that represents the social network and interactions among the people in a region considering population demographics, limited testing availability, imported infections from outside of the region, asymptomatic disease transmission, and adherence to social distancing measures. We adopted COVAM to represent COVID-19-associated events in Dane County, Wisconsin, Milwaukee metropolitan area, and New York City (NYC). We used COVAM to evaluate the impact of three different aspects of social distancing: 1) Adherence to social distancing measures; 2) timing of implementing social distancing; and 3) timing of easing social distancing. RESULTS: We found that the timing of social distancing and adherence level had a major effect on COVID-19 occurrence. For example, in NYC, implementing social distancing measures on March 5, 2020 instead of March 12, 2020 would have reduced the total number of confirmed cases from 191,984 to 43,968 as of May 30, whereas a 1-week delay in implementing such measures could have increased the number of confirmed cases to 1,299,420.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the level of awareness, perception, and attitude regarding the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and infection control among Jordanian dentists. METHODS: The study population consisted of dentists who worked in private clinics, hospitals, and health centers in Jordan. An online questionnaire was sent to a sample of Jordanian dentists in March 2020. The questionnaire was comprised of a series of questions about dentists demographic characteristics; their awareness of the incubation period, the symptoms of the disease, mode of transmission of COVID-19 and infection control measures for preventing COVID-19; and their attitude toward treating patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: This study included a total of 368 dentists aged 22-73 years (mean 32.9 years, SD 10.6 years). A total of 112 (30.4%) dentists had completed a master or residency program in dentistry, 195 (53.0%) had received training in infection control in dentistry, and 28 (7.6%) had attended training or lectures regarding COVID-19. A total of 133 (36.1%) dentists reported that the incubation period is 1-14 days. The majority of dentists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms and ways of identifying patients at risk of having COVID-19, were able to correctly report known modes of transmission, and were aware of measures for preventing COVID-19 transmission in dental clinics.

METHODS: Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), Connor-Davidson Resilience scale (CD-RISC) and Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) were administrated among 1472 health care workers from Jiangsu Province, China during the peak period of COVID-19 outbreak. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the mediation effect of resilience on the relation between social support and mental health, whereas moderated mediation analysis was performed by Hayes PROCESS macro. RESULTS: The findings showed that resilience could partially mediate the effect of social support on mental health among health care workers. Age group moderated the indirect relationship between social support and mental health via resilience. Specifically, compared with younger health care workers, the association between resilience and mental health would be attenuated in the middle-aged workers. CONCLUSIONS: The results add knowledge to previous literature by uncovering the underlying mechanisms between social support and mental health. The present study has profound implications for mental health services for health care workers during the peak period of COVID-19.","output":"Social support and mental health among health care workers during Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak: A moderated mediation model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vesicovaginal fistula (VVF) is the nonphysiological communication between the bladder and vagina, and surgical closure is the gold treatment standard.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein binds to ACE2 to initiate the process of replication. This enzyme is widely present in human organ tissues, such as the heart and lung. The pathophysiology of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection is complex and may be associated with several factors and conditions that are more severe in COVID-19 patients, such as age, male gender, and comorbidities, namely, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, obesity, and diabetes. Here we present a comprehensive review that aims to correlate the levels of expression of the ACE2 in patients with comorbidities and with a poor outcome in COVID-19 disease. Significantly higher levels of expression of ACE2 were observed in myocardial and lung tissues in heart failure and COPD patients, respectively. An age-dependent increase in SARS2-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory epithelium may be also responsible for the increased severity of COVID-19 lung disease in elderly people.

DST determines whether Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria are susceptible or resistant to drugs. Xpert MTB/XDR is a rapid nucleic acid amplification test for detection of tuberculosis and drug resistance in one test suitable for use in peripheral and intermediate level laboratories. In specimens where tuberculosis is detected by Xpert MTB/XDR, Xpert MTB/XDR can also detect resistance to isoniazid, fluoroquinolones, ethionamide, and amikacin. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/XDR for pulmonary tuberculosis in people with presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis (having signs and symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis, including cough, fever, weight loss, night sweats). To assess the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/XDR for resistance to isoniazid, fluoroquinolones, ethionamide, and amikacin in people with tuberculosis detected by Xpert MTB/XDR, irrespective of rifampicin resistance (whether or not rifampicin resistance status was known) and with known rifampicin resistance. SEARCH METHODS: We searched multiple databases to 23 September 2021. We limited searches to 2015 onwards as Xpert MTB/XDR was launched in 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Diagnostic accuracy studies using sputum in adults with presumptive or confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. Reference standards were culture (pulmonary tuberculosis detection); phenotypic DST (pDST), genotypic DST (gDST),composite (pDST and gDST) (drug resistance detection). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently reviewed reports for eligibility and extracted data using a standardized form. For multicentre studies, we anticipated variability in the type and frequency of mutations associated with resistance to a given drug at the different centres and considered each centre as an independent study cohort for quality assessment and analysis. We assessed methodological quality with QUADAS\\\\2, judging risk of bias separately for each target condition and reference standard. For pulmonary tuberculosis detection, owing to heterogeneity in participant characteristics and observed specificity estimates, we reported a range of sensitivity and specificity estimates and did not perform a meta\\\\analysis. For drug resistance detection, we performed meta\\\\analyses by reference standard using bivariate random\\\\effects models. Using GRADE, we assessed certainty of evidence of Xpert MTB/XDR accuracy for detection of resistance to isoniazid and fluoroquinolones in people irrespective of rifampicin resistance and to ethionamide and amikacin in people with known rifampicin resistance, reflecting real\\\\world situations. We used pDST, except for ethionamide resistance where we considered gDST a better reference standard. MAIN RESULTS: We included two multicentre studies from high multidrug\\\\resistant/rifampicin\\\\resistant tuberculosis burden countries, reporting on six independent study cohorts, involving 1228 participants for pulmonary tuberculosis detection and 1141 participants for drug resistance detection. The proportion of participants with rifampicin resistance in the two studies was 47.9% and 80.9%. For tuberculosis detection, we judged high risk of bias for patient selection owing to selective recruitment. For ethionamide resistance detection, we judged high risk of bias for the reference standard, both pDST and gDST, though we considered gDST a better reference standard. Pulmonary tuberculosis detection \\\\ Xpert MTB/XDR sensitivity range, 98.3% (96.1 to 99.5) to 98.9% (96.2 to 99.9) and specificity range, 22.5% (14.3 to 32.6) to 100.0% (86.3 to 100.0); median prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis 91.3%, (interquartile range, 89.3% to 91.8%), (2 studies; 1 study reported on 2 cohorts, 1228 participants; very low\\\\certainty evidence, sensitivity and specificity).

AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Review findings suggest that, in people determined by Xpert MTB/XDR to be tuberculosis\\\\positive, Xpert MTB/XDR provides accurate results for detection of isoniazid and fluoroquinolone resistance and can assist with selection of an optimised treatment regimen. Given that Xpert MTB/XDR targets a limited number of resistance variants in specific genes, the test may perform differently in different settings. Findings in this review should be interpreted with caution. Sensitivity for detection of ethionamide resistance was based only on Xpert MTB/XDR detection of mutations in the inhA promoter region, a known limitation. High risk of bias limits our confidence in Xpert MTB/XDR accuracy for pulmonary tuberculosis. Xpert MTB/XDR's impact will depend on its ability to detect tuberculosis (required for DST), prevalence of resistance to a given drug, health care infrastructure, and access to other tests.","output":"Xpert MTB/XDR for detection of pulmonary tuberculosis and resistance to isoniazid, fluoroquinolones, ethionamide, and amikacin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose During the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the health care systems suspended their non-urgent activities This included the cancellation of consultations for patients with rare diseases, such as severe pulmonary hypertension (PH), accompanied by potential medication shortage and loss of follow-up Thus, the aim of the study was to evaluate PH patient health status evolution, access to health care and mental health experience during the early phase of the pandemic Methods We conducted an internet patient survey, available in 16 languages, between 22/05/2020 and 28/06/2020 The survey included questions corresponding to demographic, COVID-19 and PH related information Results 1073 patients (or relatives, 27%) from 52 countries all over the world participated in the survey Seventy-seven percent (77%) of responders reported a diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and 15% of chronic thromboembolic PH (CTEPH) The COVID-19 related events were few: only 1% of all responders reported a diagnosis of COVID-19 However, the PH related events during the early phase of the pandemic seemed far more frequent with 8% of patients reporting health deterioration possibly related to PH, and 4% requiring hospitalization for PH care 11% of the patients reported difficulties to have access to their PH expert center, and the reported rate of interruption of treatment due to shortage of medication was 3% Both general practitioners and specialized PH centers were contacted by equal proportions of patients to seek COVID-19 related information 67% of the participants reported anxiety or depression Conclusion Although COVID-19 incidence in PH patients was low during the early phase of the pandemic, PH related problems occurred frequently as the pandemic progressed with difficulties to have access to specialized care Primary health care as well as to information on the impact of COVID-19 on people with PH In addition to specialized care, primary health care was considered to be of importance by PH patients Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term consequences of COVID-related PH care disruption The evaluation of long-term consequences of COVID related care disruption in PH will require further studies","output":"PH Care COVID Survey: An International Patient Survey on the Care for Pulmonary Hypertension Patients during the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous rat toxicity studies of alpha-glycosyl isoquercitrin (AGIQ), a water-soluble flavonol glycoside derived from rutin, revealed systemic yellow bone discoloration.

Garcinol, a natural compound extracted from Gambogic genera, is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitor that has shown anticancer activities such as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. In this study, we investigated the effects of garcinol on the metastasis of esophageal cancer in vitro and in vivo. We found that garcinol (5C15 M) dose-dependently inhibited the migration and invasion of human esophageal cancer cell lines KYSE150 and KYSE450 in wound healing, transwell migration, and Matrigel invasion assays. Furthermore, garcinol treatment dose-dependently decreased the protein levels of p300/CBP (transcriptional cofactors and HATs) and p-Smad2/3 expression in the nucleus, thus impeding tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. Knockdown of p300 could inhibit cell metastasis, but CBP knockdown did not affect the cell mobility. It has been reported that TGF-1 stimulated the phosphorylation of Smad2/3, which directly interact with p300/CBP in the nucleus, and upregulating HAT activity of p300. We showed that garcinol treatment dose-dependently suppressed TGF-1-activated Smad and non-Smad pathway, inhibiting esophageal cancer cell metastasis. In a tail vein injection pulmonary metastasis mouse model, intraperitoneal administration of garcinol (20 mg/kg) or 5-FU (20 mg/kg) significantly decreased the number of lung tumor nodules and the expression levels of Ki-67, p300, and p-Smad2/3 in lung tissues. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that garcinol inhibits esophageal cancer metastasis in vitro and in vivo, which might be related to the suppression of p300 and TGF-1 signaling pathways, suggesting the therapeutic potential of Garcinol for metastatic tumors.","output":"Garcinol inhibits esophageal cancer metastasis by suppressing the p300 and TGF-1 signaling pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent discovery of Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus and another novel dromedary camel coronavirus UAE-HKU23 in dromedaries has boosted interest in search of novel viruses in dromedaries.

The U.S. saw a rapid escalation in laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and related deaths in March, 2020. The financial consequences of a virtual economic shutdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus are widespread and debilitating, with over 30 million Americans (about 20% of the labor force) filing for unemployment benefits since mid-March. During these unprecedented times, it is important to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological distress and overall fear associated with the virus. DATA To gain an understanding of the overall levels and predictors of psychological distress experienced in the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., a survey was administered online to over 2,000 individuals residing in the country. The survey instrument was administered between March 22-26, 2020, during which time the country was suffering through a period of exponential growth in COVID-19 cases and fatalities. It was administered via MTurk, a popular crowdsourcing platform increasingly used by social scientists to procure large samples over a brief period of time. A short, valid screening instrument to measure psychological distress in individuals, the Kessler 10 scale was developed in the U.S. in the 1990s as an easy-to-administer symptom assessment. The first dependent variable is the respondents' summated Kessler 10 score. The second dependent variable is a 7-category measure of how afraid the subject is about the novel coronavirus. The final dependent variable is also a 7-category scale, this time measuring self-reported likelihood of contracting the coronavirus. A variety of socio-demographic variables and health status were collected to analyze factors associated with psychological distress and mental health. METHODS Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) multiple regression was employed to analyze these data. RESULTS We find that protective factors against psychological distress include age, gender (male), and physical health. Factors exacerbating psychological distress include Hispanic ethnicity and a previous mental illness diagnosis. Similar factors are significantly related to fear of the virus and self-assessed likelihood of contracting it. DISCUSSION The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with high levels of psychological distress in the U.S. The Kessler 10 mean value in our sample is 21.12, which falls in the likely to experience mild mental illness category, yet is considerably higher compared to one of the largest and earliest benchmark studies validating the scale. Psychological distress is one element of overall mental health status that could be influenced by the COVID-10 pandemic. Other mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders could also be affected by the pandemic. We encourage researchers to examine these and other mental health disorders in future research on the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION The relatively high mean score (21.12) for psychological distress during early stages of the pandemic suggests government officials, policy-makers, and public health advocates should act quickly to address emerging mental health problems.","output":"Psychological Distress and Coronavirus Fears During the Initial Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diarrhea, resulting from gastrointestinal infection by pathogens, is a common cause of the high mortality and morbidity of neonatal calves.

Sadly, youth with internalizing disorders often avoid seeking clinical help and rarely receive adequate treatment. Current methods of assessing internalizing disorders usually rely on subjective symptom ratings, but internalizing symptoms are frequently underreported, which creates a barrier to the accurate assessment of these symptoms in youth. Therefore, novel assessment tools that use objective data need to be developed to meet the highest standards of reliability, feasibility, scalability, and affordability. Mobile sensing technologies, which unobtrusively record aspects of youth behaviors in their daily lives with the potential to make inferences about their mental health states, offer a possible method of addressing this assessment barrier. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore whether passively collected smartphone sensor data can be used to predict internalizing symptoms among youth in Canada. METHODS: In this study, the youth participants (N=122) completed self-report assessments of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Next, the participants installed an app, which passively collected data about their mobility, screen time, sleep, and social interactions over 2 weeks. Then, we tested whether these passive sensor data could be used to predict internalizing symptoms among these youth participants. RESULTS: More severe depressive symptoms correlated with more time spent stationary (r=0.293; P=.003), less mobility (r=0.271; P=.006), higher light intensity during the night (r=0.227; P=.02), and fewer outgoing calls (r=?0.244; P=.03). In contrast, more severe anxiety symptoms correlated with less time spent stationary (r=?0.249; P=.01) and greater mobility (r=0.234; P=.02). In addition, youths with higher anxiety scores spent more time on the screen (r=0.203; P=.049). Finally, adding passively collected smartphone sensor data to the prediction models of internalizing symptoms significantly improved their fit. CONCLUSIONS: Passively collected smartphone sensor data provide a useful way to monitor internalizing symptoms among youth. Although the results replicated findings from adult populations, to ensure clinical utility, they still need to be replicated in larger samples of youth. The work also highlights intervention opportunities via mobile technology to reduce the burden of internalizing symptoms early on.","output":"A Mobile Sensing App to Monitor Youth Mental Health: Observational Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly across the world in 2020, affecting both adults and, to a lesser extent, children.

Governmental measures to reduce physical contact range from the closing of public facilities and schools to restrictions on mobility, lockdowns, quarantines, and curfews. These extreme measures though necessary, should be used as last resources, due to the their economical and personal negative impacts. Of great help in these situations are the physical and psychological benefits of physical exercises, walking included[1, 2]. On the other hand, physical contact and proximity should be avoid to reduce the spread of pathogens such as Covid-19[3]. This paper studies how organizing the traffic of pedestrians affects the number of walking or running people passing by each other. One example is the traffic of pedestrians on sidewalks. Another is the use of walking or running tracks in parks. As it will be demonstrated, the number of people crossing each other can be drastically reduced if one-way traffic is enforced and runners are separated from walkers.","output":"Pedestrian traffic must be regulated in contagious epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This interview between Sunaura Taylor and Sara E S Orning took place digitally, over the course of several months in the spring of 2020, during the time that the COVID-19 pandemic exploded around the world The exchanges have been edited into the four conversations presented here, dealing with human and nonhuman life, death and vulnerability, racial and environmental justice, and extinction Sunaura Taylor is the author of Beasts of Burden: Animal and Disability Liberation, which won the 2018 American Book Award She is Assistant Professor of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management at the University of California, Berkeley Her work, which argues for the need to bring animal and disability activism together, has been influential and pioneering in both the academy and broader public contexts Sara E S Orning is Postdoctoral Fellow for BIODIAL: The Biopolitics of Disability, Illness, and Animality, a three-year research project funded by the Research Council of Norway","output":"Being Human, Being Animal: Species Membership in Extraordinary Times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the most serious complications of COVID-19 is the development of uncontrolled production of cytokines that poses a major factor contributing to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality The exact effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on clinical and biochemical course of in patients with underlying immune compromised conditions is not well known with recent available data The present letter aimed to draw attention to COVID-19 in immune deficiency [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of European Journal of Inflammation (Sage Publications, Ltd ) is the property of Sage Publications, Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"COVID-19 and immunocompromised conditions: Ongoing challenging issue"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"E-health offers great potential in the field of traumatic stress to deliver training, assessment, prevention, and treatment of adverse outcomes after trauma worldwide.

'Vaccine hesitancy' is common in the population and in HCWs, and like COVID-19 itself, hesitancy is more frequent in ethnic minority groups. UK-REACH (United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity and COVID-19 outcomes) is a large-scale study of COVID-19 in UK HCWs from diverse ethnic backgrounds, which includes measures of vaccine hesitancy. The present study explores predictors of vaccine hesitancy using a 'phenomic approach', considering several hundred questionnaire-based measures. Methods UK-REACH includes a questionnaire study encompassing 12,431 HCWs who were recruited from December 2020 to March 2021 and completed a lengthy online questionnaire (785 raw items; 392 derived measures; 260 final measures). Ethnicity was classified using the Office for National Statistics' five (ONS5) and eighteen (ONS18) categories. Missing data were handled by multiple imputation. Variable selection used the islasso package in R, which provides standard errors so that results from imputations could be combined using Rubin's rules. The data were modelled using path analysis, so that predictors, and predictors of predictors could be assessed. Significance testing used the Bayesian approach of Kass and Raftery, a 'very strong' Bayes Factor of 150, N=12,431, and a Bonferroni correction giving a criterion of p<4.02 x 10-8 for the main regression, and p<3.11 x 10-10 for variables in the path analysis. Results At the first step of the phenomic analysis, six variables were direct predictors of greater vaccine hesitancy: Lower pro-vaccination attitudes; no flu vaccination in 2019-20; pregnancy; higher COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs; younger age; and lower optimism the roll-out of population vaccination. Overall 44 lower variables in total were direct or indirect predictors of hesitancy, with the remaining 215 variables in the phenomic analysis not independently predicting vaccine hesitancy. Key variables for predicting hesitancy were belief in conspiracy theories of COVID-19 infection, and a low belief in vaccines in general. Conspiracy beliefs had two main sets of influences: i) Higher Fatalism, which was influenced a) by high external and chance locus of control and higher need for closure, which in turn were associated with neuroticism, conscientiousness, extraversion and agreeableness; and b) by religion being important in everyday life, and being Muslim. ii) receiving information via social media, not having higher education, and perceiving greater risks to self, the latter being influenced by higher concerns about spreading COVID, greater exposure to COVID-19, and financial concerns. There were indirect effects of ethnicity, mediated by religion. Religion was more important for Pakistani and African HCWs, and less important for White and Chinese groups. Lower age had a direct effect on hesitancy, and age and female sex also had several indirect effects on hesitancy. Conclusions The phenomic approach, coupled with a path analysis revealed a complex network of social, cognitive, and behavioural influences on SARS-Cov-2 vaccine hesitancy from 44 measures, 6 direct and 38 indirect, with the remaining 215 measures not having direct or indirect effects on hesitancy. It is likely that issues of trust underpin many associations with hesitancy. Understanding such a network of influences may help in tailoring interventions to address vaccine concerns and facilitate uptake in more hesistant groups.","output":"Vaccine hesitancy for COVID-19 explored in a phenomic study of 259 socio-cognitive-behavioural measures in the UK-REACH study of 12,431 UK healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of the Big Five personality traits (extraversion, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness and neuroticism) on the adoption of augmented reality (AR), with a particular focus on the role AR may play in interactive marketing.Design/methodology/approachA quantitative-based approach was followed by a questionnaire survey, which was completed by 230 respondents comprising graduate and postgraduate students, using structural equation modelling.FindingsWhile the trait of openness was positively associated with the perceived ease of use of AR, the usefulness of AR and subjective norms, the trait of neuroticism was negatively associated with the perceived ease of use of AR.

Despite past and current intensive vaccination programs, IBV infections in the countrys poultry industry have not been effectively controlled. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the genotype of several isolates based on partial S1 gene sequences. In particular, the investigation is directed to focus on layer chickens in actively vaccinated farms indicating IBV symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples were isolated from ten different layer chicken flocks experiencing respiratory problem, drops in egg production, and a penguin-like stance, which were collected from commercial poultry farms in Central Java and Yogyakarta regions, Indonesia, within the periods of 2012-2018. Fragment of the S1 gene of IBV sampled from actively vaccinated commercial poultry farms was amplified using primer 5-aca tgg taa ttt ttc aga tgg-3 (forward) and 5-cag att gct tac aac cac c-3 (reverse) with the length of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product at 383 bp. The sequence of samples was then compared with the sequence of reference S1 gene nucleotides of IBV from NCBI GenBank database. The amino acid analysis and multiple alignment sequence were conducted using Mega X. RESULTS: During necropsy, enlargement of the oviduct and swollen kidney were observed. Reverse transcription-PCR diagnosis of their 383 bp S1 gene showed that all samples were IBV positive. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene discovered seven samples to be clustered as 4/91-like strains. Meanwhile, the remaining three samples were grouped in QX-like strain cluster. CONCLUSION: This study is a pioneering report providing molecular evidence of pathogenic QX-like and 4/91-like strains circulating in Indonesia. Findings discovered, in this study, strongly suggested the importance of improving protections by available IBV vaccines through updated circulating strain clusters.

In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in close collaboration with state, local, and territorial health departments, began a 5-year initiative to establish population-based mother-baby linked longitudinal surveillance, the Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Mothers and Babies Network (SET-NET). OBJECTIVES: The objective of this report is to describe an expanded surveillance approach that leverages and modernizes existing surveillance systems to address the impact of emerging health threats during pregnancy on pregnant women and their infants. METHODS: Mother-baby pairs are identified through prospective identification during pregnancy and/or identification of an infant with retrospective linking to maternal information. All data are obtained from existing data sources (e.g., electronic medical records, vital statistics, laboratory reports, and health department investigations and case reporting). RESULTS: Variables were selected for inclusion to address key surveillance questions proposed by CDC and health department subject matter experts. General variables include maternal demographics and health history, pregnancy and infant outcomes, maternal and infant laboratory results, and child health outcomes up to the second birthday. Exposure-specific modular variables are included for hepatitis C, syphilis, and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The system is structured into four relational datasets (maternal, pregnancy outcomes and birth, infant/child follow-up, and laboratory testing). DISCUSSION: SET-NET provides a population-based mother-baby linked longitudinal surveillance approach and has already demonstrated rapid adaptation to COVID-19. This innovative approach leverages existing data sources and rapidly collects data and informs clinical guidance and practice. These data can help to reduce exposure risk and adverse outcomes among pregnant women and their infants, direct public health action, and strengthen public health systems.","output":"A Preparedness Model for Mother-Baby Linked Longitudinal Surveillance for Emerging Threats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Motivation Recent efforts to computationally identify inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 proteins have largely ignored the issue of receptor flexibility.

We aimed to quantitatively assess the global change in surgical and oncological clinical practice in the early COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this cross-sectional observational study, we designed a 12-item online survey on the global effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical practice in urology. Demographic survey data, change of clinical practice, current performance of procedures, and current commencement of treatment for 5 conditions in medical urological oncology were evaluated. RESULTS: 235 urologists from 44 countries responded. Out of them, 93% indicated a change of clinical practice due to COVID-19. In a 4-tiered surgery down-escalation scheme, 44% reported to make first cancellations, 23% secondary cancellations, 20% last cancellations and 13% emergency cases only. Oncological surgeries had low cancellation rates (%): transurethral resection of bladder tumor (27%), radical cystectomy (21C24%), nephroureterectomy (21%), radical nephrectomy (18%), and radical orchiectomy (8%). (Neo)adjuvant/palliative treatment is currently not started by more than half of the urologists. COVID-19 high-risk-countries had higher total cancellation rates for non-oncological procedures (78% vs. 68%, p = 0.01) and were performing oncological treatment for metastatic diseases at a lower rate (35% vs. 48%, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected clinical practice of 93% of urologists worldwide.

METHODS Fellows attending the 2016 SAGES Flexible Endoscopy Course were invited to complete the FES manual skills examination. Participants also provided survey responses examining demographics, fellowship type, endoscopy curricula in residency, previous endoscopic case volume, confidence in performing endoscopy, and future practice plans. RESULTS Twenty-nine (age: 32.24  3.24; 72% men) fellows completed the FES skills examination. Reported fellowships were MIS/Bariatric (41.4%), MIS (24.1%), bariatric (13.8%), flexible endoscopy (6.9%), Advanced GI (6.9%), and MIS/bariatric/flexible endoscopy (6.9%). Almost half (41.4%) had previously participated in a simulation curricula, with 20.7% completing a didactic endoscopy curriculum.

Viruses have evolved various strategies to block autophagy and even subvert it for their replication and release. Here, we demonstrated that ORF3a of the COVID-19 virus SARS-CoV-2 inhibits autophagy activity by blocking fusion of autophagosomes/amphisomes with lysosomes. The late endosome-localized ORF3a directly interacts with and sequestrates the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) component VPS39, thereby preventing HOPS complex from interacting with the autophagosomal SNARE protein STX17. This blocks assembly of the STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8 SNARE complex, which mediates autophagosome/amphisome fusion with lysosomes. Expression of ORF3a also damages lysosomes and impairs their function. SARS-CoV-2 virus infection blocks autophagy, resulting in accumulation of autophagosomes/amphisomes, and causes late endosomal sequestration of VPS39. Surprisingly, ORF3a from the SARS virus SARS-CoV fails to interact with HOPS or block autophagy.

Here, we assess phylogenetic relationships for the SARS-CoV lineage as well as the history of host-species shifts for SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses. We used a Bayesian phylogenetic inference approach with sliding window analyses of three SARS-CoV proteins: RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S). Conservation of RDRP allowed us to use a set of Arteriviridae taxa to root the Coronaviridae phylogeny. We found strong evidence for a recombination breakpoint within SARS-CoV RDRP, based on different, well supported trees for a 5 fragment (supporting SARS-CoV as sister to a clade including all other coronaviruses) and a 3 fragment (supporting SARS-CoV as sister to group three avian coronaviruses). These different topologies are statistically significant: the optimal 5 tree could be rejected for the 3 region, and the optimal 3 tree could be rejected for the 5 region. We did not find statistical evidence for recombination in analyses of N and S, as there is little signal to differentiate among alternative trees. Comparison of phylogenetic trees for 11 known host-species and 36 coronaviruses, representing coronavirus groups 1C3 and SARS-CoV, based on N showed statistical incongruence indicating multiple host-species shifts for coronaviruses. Inference of host-species associations is highly sensitive to sampling and must be considered cautiously. However, current sampling suggests host-species shifts between mouse and rat, chicken and turkey, mammals and manx shearwater, and humans and other mammals.

Here, we describe an important role of Rtt105 in high-fidelity DNA replication and recombination and demonstrate that these functions of Rtt105 primarily depend on its regulation of RPA. The deletion of RTT105 causes elevated spontaneous DNA mutations with large duplications or deletions mediated by microhomologies.

In contrast, Rtt105 attenuates DSB repair by the mutagenic single-strand annealing or alternative end joining pathway. Thus, Rtt105-mediated regulation of RPA promotes high-fidelity replication and recombination while suppressing repair by deleterious pathways.

Pressure pulses, based on the principle of vibration in pipes are used for pipeline monitoring in this study. The principle of time delay between pulse arrivals at sensor positions is also adopted in this study. An Arduino and a Wi-Fi module were combined, programmed and used to produce a wireless communication device which communicates with the ThingSpeak internet of things (IoT) analytics platform. A total of five channels were created on the platform to collect data from the five sensors that were used in the experimental test rig that made use of wireless communication device. Signal data was collected once every 15 s and all the channels were updated every 2 min. ThingSpeak provided instant visualizations of data posted by the wireless communication device. Online analysis and processing of the data was performed as it came in. A second test rig was built that made use of a data logger for processing of data. The measured velocity of pulse propagation using the data logger and air as transport fluid was 355 m/s. The computed estimates of event location for the 50 measurements taken ranged between 4.243 m and 4.246 m. This had a scatter of just 3 mm against the actual measured event location of 4.23 m. The experimental results obtained showed that the performance of the wireless communication device compared satisfactorily with the data logger and is capable of detecting the location of damage on real pipelines when used for real time monitoring. Using this communication device and an analytics platform, real-time monitoring of pipelines can be carried out from any location in the world on any internet-enabled device.","output":"Petroleum pipeline monitoring using an internet of things (IoT) platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lyttleton hypothesized long ago that Triton and Pluto originated as adjacent prograde satellites of Neptune(1). With the presently accepted masses of Triton and PlutoCCharon(2,3), however, the momentum and energy exchange that would be required to set Triton on a retrograde trajectory is impossible. The mass of Triton has probably been seriously overestimated(4,5), but not by enough to relax this restriction. It is implausible that the present angular momentum state of PlutoCCharon has been significantly influenced by Neptune(6). It could not acquire such angular momentum during an ejection event unless a physical collision was involved, which is quite unlikely. The simplest hypothesis is that Triton and Pluto are independent representatives of large outer Solar System planetesimals. Triton is simply captured, with potentially spectacular consequences that include runaway melting of interior ices and release to the surface of clathrated CH(4), CO and N(2) (ref. 7). Condensed remnants of this proto-atmosphere could account for features in Triton's unique spectrum(8C11).","output":"On the origin of Triton and Pluto"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Multiple vaccines have been granted emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Of the currently available vaccines, none have been systematically studied for efficacy or toxicity in patients with immunodeficiency or with immunosuppressed states, such as B cell malignancy. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the immune response to currently available vaccines against COVID-19 in patients with hematologic and solid organ malignancies. Methods This prospective study enrolled 53 patients;12 with CLL, 10 with multiple myeloma (MM), 11 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 21 with a solid organ malignancy. Using a quantitative assay, IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein by enzyme immunoassay were measured at baseline prior to vaccination and at 2 weeks after completion of vaccination. A fourfold increase in IgG was considered a positive response to vaccination. Through a predesigned survey, patients also self-reported side effects from each dose of vaccination. Results Seroconversion with vaccination was seen in 9/10 (90%) patients with MM, 5/12 (41.7%) patients with CLL, 6/11 (54.1%) patients with NHL, and 17/21 (80.9%) patients with solid organ malignancy. Per univariate analysis, CLL (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.05-0.88;p= 0.033) was associated with lower odds of seroconversion while NHL (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.12-1.8;p =0.291), MM (OR 5.33, 95% CI 0.61-46.08;p= 0.128) and solid organ malignancy (OR 2.90, 95% CI 0.79-10.64;p= 0.107) were not. Among patients with hematological malignancies, 5/13 (38.3%) patients treated with rituximab and 2/7 (28.5%) patients on immunoglobulin replacement (IgR) therapy responded to vaccination. This corresponded to reduced odds of seroconversion, 0.18 (95% CI 0.047-0.69;p = 0.013) in patients treated with rituximab and 0.14 (95% CI 0.024-0.826;p=0.030) in patients on IgR. Among patients with solid organ malignancies, treatment with chemotherapy (OR 2.05, 95% CI 0.48-8.61;p=0.320), immunotherapy (OR 4.57, 95% CI 0.52-39.9;p=0.169) or endocrine therapy (OR 1.0) did not lower odds of seroconversion with vaccination. Multivariate analysis revealed patients who received rituximab were less likely to respond to vaccination as compared to patients not previously treated with rituximab (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05-0.955;p=0.044). Injection site soreness was the most commonly reported side effect. The only severe side effect occurred in a patient with solid organ malignancy who developed Parsonage Turner syndrome. Conclusion Our study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first study comparing pre and post vaccination IgG titers against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Majority of patients with MM and solid organ malignancies, including those receiving active treatment, responded adequately to immunization. Patients with CLL appear less likely to respond to vaccination against COVID-19 as compared to patients with NHL, MM or solid organ malignancies. Previous treatment with rituximab was the most significant risk factor for suboptimal response to vaccination, regardless of underlying hematologic malignancy. These data highlight the importance of continuing risk mitigation strategies against COVID-19 in individuals with hematologic malignancy, particularly those with CLL or on treatment with rituximab. Future research is needed to investigate approaches to provide protective IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in this at-risk population.

METHODS: In this population-based study in the Veneto Region, we retrospectively reviewed all patients aged 65 years or older, with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. We compared, after propensity score matching, those who received chronic anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation with those who did not. RESULTS: Overall, 4697 COVID-19 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria, and the propensity score matching yielded 559 patients per arm. All-cause mortality rate ratio was significantly higher among non-anticoagulated patients (32.2% vs 26.5%, p = 0.036). On time to event analysis, all-cause mortality was found lower among anticoagulated patients, although the estimate was not statistically significant. (HR 0.81, 95%CI 0.65-1.01, p = 0.054).

The essential nature of public transport puts into focus the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in this sector; rapid and diverse work has been done to attempt to understand how transmission happens in this context and what factors influence risk. OBJECTIVES: This review aimed to provide a narrative overview of the literature assessing transmission, or potential for transmission, of SARS-CoV-2 on ground-based public transport, as well as studies assessing the effectiveness of control measures on public transport during the early part of the pandemic (up to May 2021). METHODS: An electronic search was conducted using Web of Science, Ovid, the Cochrane Library, ProQuest, Pubmed, and the WHO global COVID database. Searches were run between December 2020 and May 2021. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 734 papers, of which 28 papers met the inclusion criteria for the review; 10 papers assessed transmission of SARS-CoV-2, 11 assessed control measures, and seven assessed levels of contamination. Eleven papers were based on modelling approaches; 17 studies were original studies reporting empirical COVID-19 data. CONCLUSIONS: The literature is heterogeneous, and there are challenges for measurement of transmission in this setting. There is evidence for transmission in certain cases, and mixed evidence for the presence of viral RNA in transport settings; there is also evidence for some reduction of risk through mitigation. However, the routes of transmission and key factors contributing to transmission of SARS-CoV-2 on public transport were not clear during the early stage of the pandemic. Gaps in understanding are discussed and six key questions for future research have been posed. Further exploration of transmission factors and effectiveness of mitigation strategies is required in order to support decision making.","output":"Transmission and control of SARS-CoV-2 on ground public transport: A rapid review of the literature up to May 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) pandemic has led to the design and development of multiple reverse\\\\transcription polymerase chain reaction kits aimed to facilitate the rapid scale\\\\up of molecular testing for massive screening.

The angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein is the major receptor for the virus, and sequence and structural analysis of the protein has been performed to determine its cross-species conservation. Based on these analyses, cattle have been implicated as a potential susceptible species to SARS-CoV-2 and have been reported to have increased ACE2 receptor distribution in the liver and kidney, and lower levels in the lungs. The goal of the current study was to determine the susceptibility of cattle to SARS-CoV-2 utilizing inoculation routes that facilitated exposure to tissues with increased ACE2 receptor distribution. For this, colostrum-deprived calves approximately 6 weeks of age were inoculated via the intratracheal or intravenous routes. Nasal and rectal swab samples, as well as blood and urine samples, were collected over the course of the study to evaluate viral shedding, viremia, and seroconversion. Pyrexia was used as the primary criteria for euthanasia and tissue samples were collected during necropsy. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in only two nasal swab samples collected on days 3 and 10 post-inoculation (pi) in two calves; one calf in the intratracheal group and the other calf in the intravenous group, respectively. Additionally, the calf in the intratracheal group that was positive on the nasal swab on day 3 pi also had a positive tracheobronchial lymph node on day 9 pi. Viral nucleic acid load on these samples, based on PCR cycle threshold values, were low and infectious virus was not recovered from the samples.

METHODS: We extended and optimized our previous recombinant adenovirus 5 (rAd5)Cbased vaccine platform characterized by in vivo amplified and CD40-mediated specific responses to generate MERS-CoV S1 subunit-based vaccine. We generated rAd5 constructs expressing CD40-targeted S1 fusion protein (rAd5-S1/F/CD40L), untargeted S1 (rAd5-S1), and Green Fluorescent Protein (rAd5-GFP), and evaluated their efficacy and safety in human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 transgenic (hDPP4 Tg(+)) mice. RESULTS: Immunization of hDPP4 Tg(+) mice with a single dose of rAd5-S1/F/CD40L elicited as robust and significant specific immunoglobulin G and neutralizing antibodies as those induced with 2 doses of rAd5-S1. After MERS-CoV challenge, both vaccines conferred complete protection against morbidity and mortality, as evidenced by significantly undetectable/reduced pulmonary viral loads compared to the control group. However, rAd5-S1C but not rAd5-S1/F/CD40LCimmunized mice exhibited marked pulmonary perivascular hemorrhage postCMERS-CoV challenge despite the observed protection.

Studies have shown that patients with COVID-19 are prone to thrombotic disease resulting in increased mortality. We present a case of COVID-19 pneumonia in a warehouse worker with a giant thrombus-in-transit involving the right ventricle and tricuspid valve. We also describe the associated diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. CASE REPORT A 54-year-old man with recent COVID-19 exposure presented with fever, cough, dyspnea, and syncope and was found to be in hypoxic respiratory failure requiring supplemental oxygen. The clinical course deteriorated with worsening respiratory failure and septic shock, requiring mechanical ventilation and pressor support. Further evaluation revealed a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 and an S1Q3T3 pattern on electrocardiogram. A bedside transthoracic echocardiogram was performed due to clinical deterioration and hemodynamic instability, which showed a large thrombus-in-transit through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. The patient was treated with low-molecular-weight heparin, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and supportive care. A repeat echocardiogram after 1 week did not show any thrombus. The patient slowly improved over the following weeks but required tracheostomy due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. He was discharged on oral anticoagulation. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the presence of significant COVID-19-related hemostatic disturbances and the importance of associated diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. A bedside echocardiogram can provide valuable information in patients with suspected high-risk pulmonary embolism and hemodynamic instability.

In 2016, the PCSC Program expanded to BC Cancer Victoria and in 2017 to other BC Cancer sites. In 2018, medical oncologists (MDS) in Victoria (JR, SP) developed an Education Module addressing treatment options for men with metastatic hormone sensitive (mHSPC) and metastatic castration resistant (mCRPC) disease. MDS delivered in-person ES in Victoria in 2018 and, in 2019, added a virtual platform (VP) option. From 3-5/2020, the ESs were on hold due to the COVID pandemic and parental leaves. In 6/2020, the ESs resumed only on VP, and the PCSC Oncology Nurse Practitioner (NP), NI, gave the presentations for the MDS on leave. In 10/2020, due to a changing standard of care for mHSPC, the PCSC team consolidated the two ESs into one. We report on the evolution of this Education Module in response to both the changing standard of care and the COVID pandemic. Methods: We prospectively collected attendance and patient characteristic metrics from all ES for men with mPC. We tracked presenter type (MD vs. NP) and prospectively collected anonymous patient satisfaction questionnaires. Results: From 1/2018 to 1/2021, 100 men registered for 27 ES;81 men, 41 partners, and 2 family members actually attended. 48/75 (64%) men were white, 39/75 (52%) retired, and 56/75 (74.7%) married. 47 men attended 12 mHSPC ES, 13 men attended ten mCRPC ES, and 17 attended four consolidated ES. MDS presented 15 ES, and the NP presented 12 ES. Responses to questions on 70 satisfaction surveys were similar for MD vs. NP presenters. 9 responders to the recently added VP-specific questions said they agreed (4) or strongly agreed (5) that it was beneficial to watch the ES at home on a computer. The Table below shows attendance per site per year. Conclusions: The ESs for men with mPC were well-received. Although there was a VP option before COVID, attendance increased significantly after the lockdown as patients and providers became more familiar with VPs. Satisfaction surveys confirmed that an NP could deliver the ES rather than MD. Consolidation of the mHSPC and mCRPC ES reflected the changing standard of care and resulted in more efficient use of presenter time.

Second, it learns a generic model for graph cascade tasks via self-supervised contrastive pre-training using both unlabeled and labeled data. Third, CCGL learns a task-specific cascade model via fine-tuning using labeled data.

Such perceptions of polarization are widespread, but we do not know enough about their effects, especially those unrelated to political variables. This study examines the consequences of perceived polarization for levels of social trust in the United States. Trust in fellow citizens is the backbone of a well-functioning democracy, given its role in promoting social cohesion and facilitating collective action. Using nationally representative panel data, as well as an original survey experiment, I find that perceived polarization directly undermines Americans trust in each other. A belief that members of society share common values fosters social trust, but perceptions of partisan divisions and polarization make people less trusting of their fellow citizens. Due to perceived polarization, people are less likely to believe that others can be trusted to do the right thing, which in turn decreases their willingness to cooperate for good causes. I discuss the implications of these findings for societys ability to work together toward common goals.

Here, we address these questions and find that the sarbecoviruses C the viral subgenus responsible for the emergence of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 C exhibit frequent recombination, but the SARS-CoV-2 lineage itself is not a recombinant of any viruses detected to date. In order to employ phylogenetic methods to date the divergence events between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir, recombinant regions of a 68-genome sarbecovirus alignment were removed with three independent methods. Bayesian evolutionary rate and divergence date estimates were consistent for all three recombination-free alignments and robust to two different prior specifications based on HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV evolutionary rates. Divergence dates between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir were estimated as 1948 (95% HPD: 1879-1999), 1969 (95% HPD: 1930-2000), and 1982 (95% HPD: 1948-2009). Despite intensified characterization of sarbecoviruses since SARS, the lineage giving rise to SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating unnoticed for decades in bats and been transmitted to other hosts such as pangolins. The occurrence of a third significant coronavirus emergence in 17 years together with the high prevalence and virus diversity in bats implies that these viruses are likely to cross species boundaries again. In Brief The Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the sarbecovirus subgenus which shows frequent recombination in its evolutionary history. We characterize the extent of this genetic exchange and identify non-recombining regions of the sarbecovirus genome using three independent methods to remove the effects of recombination. Using these non-recombining genome regions and prior information on coronavirus evolutionary rates, we obtain estimates from three approaches that the most likely divergence date of SARS-CoV-2 from its most closely related available bat sequences ranges from 1948 to 1982. Key Points RaTG13 is the closest available bat virus to SARS-CoV-2; a sub-lineage of these bat viruses is able to infect humans. Two sister lineages of the RaTG13/SARS-CoV-2 lineage infect Malayan pangolins. The sarbecoviruses show a pattern of deep recombination events, indicating that there are high levels of co-infection in horseshoe bats and that the viral pool can generate novel allele combinations and substantial genetic diversity; the sarbecoviruses are efficient explorers of phenotype space. The SARS-CoV-2 lineage is not a recent recombinant, at least not involving any of the bat or pangolin viruses sampled to date. Non-recombinant regions of the sarbecoviruses can be identified, allowing for phylogenetic inference and dating to be performed. We constructed three such regions using different methods. We estimate that RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 diverged 40 to 70 years ago. There is a diverse unsampled reservoir of generalist viruses established in horseshoe bats. While an intermediate host responsible for the zoonotic event cannot be ruled out, the relevant evolution for spillover to humans very likely occurred in horseshoe bats.","output":"Evolutionary origins of the SARS-CoV-2 sarbecovirus lineage responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In May 2015 in United Arab Emirates, asymptomatic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection was identified through active case finding in 2 men with exposure to infected dromedaries.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AKI, and some miRNAs have shown promise as therapeutic tools in animal models of AKI. However, less is known about the role of miRNAs in human AKI. Objective To evaluate the role of miRNAs in human subjects with AKI. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Measurements Quantification of miRNA levels from human blood, urine, or kidney biopsy samples, and measures of renal function as defined in the study protocol. Methods A comprehensive search strategy for Ovid MEDLINE All, Embase, Web of Science, and CENTRAL will be developed to identify investigational studies that evaluated the relationship between miRNA levels and human AKI. Primary outcomes will include measurements of kidney function and miRNA levels. Study screening, review and data extraction will be performed independently by 2 reviewers. Study quality and certainty of evidence will be assessed with validated tools. A narrative synthesis will be included and the possibility for meta-analysis will be assessed according to characteristics of clinical and statistical heterogeneity between studies. Limitations These include (1) lack of randomized trials of miRNAs for the prevention or treatment of human AKI, (2) quality of included studies, and (3) sources of clinical and statistical heterogeneity that may affect strength and reproducibility of results. Conclusion Previous studies of miRNAs in different animal models of AKI have generated strong interest on their use for the prevention and treatment of human AKI.

We present a novel and simple algorithm to extract the number of these mild cases by correlating a COVID-line phone calls to reported cases in given districts. The key assumption is to realize that, being a highly contagious disease, the number of calls by mild cases should be proportional to the number of reported cases. Whereas a background of calls not related to infected people should be proportional to the district population.

A proportion of this burden has been attributed to factors that occur during the first 1000 days of life such as genetic predisposition, breast feeding and complementary feeding. Although the mechanisms by which these factors affect weight and adiposity are less well understood, appetite and satiety regulation may be a key to understanding them. This cohort study aims to investigate the role of appetite and satiety regulation as a mediator in the association between infant feeding practices and genetic polymorphisms with childrens growth, adiposity and metabolic risk factors. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: MAS-Lactancia (the first word means more and is also an acronym in Spanish for Appetite and Satiety Mechanisms, the second word is breastfeeding) is an open, ongoing, prospective birth cohort that began the enrolment in 2016 of motherCchild pairs affiliated to the Mexican Social Security Institute and that live in the city of Cuernavaca, Mexico. Pregnant women between 16-week and 22-week gestation are followed during the second half of their pregnancies, at birth and throughout their infants first 48 months of life (at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 36 months and 48 months) at the clinic and at-home visits that include questionnaires, anthropometric measurements and biospecimen collection. The main exposure variables are infant feeding (breast feeding and complementary feeding) and genetic polymorphisms (fat mass and obesity-associated, leptin and adiponectin genes). Outcome variables include infants growth, adiposity and metabolic risk factors. We will conduct longitudinal models and path analyses to identify the potential mediating role of satiety and appetite indicators (leptin, adiponectin, insulin concentrations, appetite and satiety perception).

Comparison of the genomic sequences showed that the genome of isolate I1101/16 was similar to that of strain ck/CH/LJL/140901 from the 5 end of the genome to the 5 end of the S2 gene and from the 5 end of the 3a gene to the end of the genome, whereas the remaining parts of the genome sequences were more closely related to those of strain 4/91 than those of ck/CH/LJL/140901, thereby suggesting that recombination might have occurred during the origin of the virus. SimPlot and Bootscan analysis of the complete genomic sequence confirmed this hypothesis, where it showed that isolate I1101/16 arose through recombination events between ck/CH/LJL/140901- and 4/91-like viruses. Isolate I1101/16 and strain ck/CH/LJL/140901 shared identical amino acids in almost all five of their B cell epitopes, but the two viruses had a serotype relatedness value of 65, which is well below 80, i.e., the lower cutoff value for viruses of the same serotype.

Feature selection is known to be particularly difficult in unsupervised learning because different subgroups of features can yield useful insights into the same dataset. In other words, many theoretically-right answers may exist for the same problem. Furthermore, designing algorithms for unsupervised feature selection is technically harder than designing algorithms for supervised feature selection because unsupervised feature selection algorithms cannot be guided by class labels. As a result, previous work attempts to discover intrinsic structures of data with heavy computation such as matrix decomposition, and require significant time to find even a single solution. This paper proposes a novel algorithm, named Explainability-based Unsupervised Feature Value Selection (EUFVS), which enables a paradigm shift in feature selection, and solves all of these problems. EUFVS requires only a few tens of milliseconds for datasets with thousands of features and instances, allowing the generation of a large number of possible solutions and select the solution with the best fit. Another important advantage of EUFVS is that it selects feature values instead of features, which can better explain phenomena in data than features. EUFVS enables a paradigm shift in feature selection. This paper explains its theoretical advantage, and also shows its applications in real experiments. In our experiments with labeled datasets, EUFVS found feature value sets that explain labels, and also detected useful relationships between feature value sets not detectable from given class labels.","output":"Unsupervised Feature Value Selection Based on Explainability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel Coronavirus from Wuhan China discovered in December 2019 (nCOV-2019) has since developed into a global epidemic with major concerns about the possibility of the virus evolving into something even more sinister.

DESIGN: A mixed methods survey including questions about exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation service provision, programme diversity, patient complexity, technology use, barriers to using technology, and safety. SETTING: International survey of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes. PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare professionals working in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes worldwide. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportion of programmes that continued providing exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation and which technologies had been used to deliver home-based cardiac rehabilitation. RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty eligible responses were received; 89.7% were from the UK. Approximately half (49.3%) of respondents reported that cardiac rehabilitation programmes were suspended due to COVID-19. Of programmes that continued, 25.8% used technology before the COVID-19 pandemic. Programmes typically started using technology within 19 days of COVID-19 becoming a pandemic. 48.8% did not provide cardiac rehabilitation to high-risk patients, telephone was most commonly used to deliver cardiac rehabilitation, and some centres used sophisticated technology such as teleconferencing.

However, the exclusion of certain patient groups and programme suspension could worsen clinical symptoms and well-being, and increase hospital admissions. Refinement of current practices, with a focus on improving inclusivity and addressing safety concerns around exercise support to high-risk patients, may be needed.","output":"How has technology been used to deliver cardiac rehabilitation during the COVID-19 pandemic?

This study aims to examine whether allostatic load (AL) prior to the pandemic was predictive of poor mental health during the pandemic, and if any associations were moderated by neuroticism. METHODS: Data were extracted from Waves 2 (2011, allostatic load), 3 (2012, neuroticism), and the COVID-19 study (April 2020) of the Understanding Society database in the UK; data were available for 956 participants. RESULTS: Mental health increased from 2012- to during the pandemic. Neuroticism and AL were positively associated with poorer mental health during COVID-19, such that those who had scored higher on neuroticism and had higher AL prior to the pandemic reported poorer mental health during the pandemic. Neuroticism was also a significant moderator; the effect of AL on mental health during the pandemic was exacerbated in those with high and moderate levels of neuroticism but not lower. Moreover, this was driven by the immune-related indices of AL. This withstood adjustment for age, gender, employment status and prior mental health.

In order to discover features of the financial network, the pairwise interaction of stocks has been considered in many research, but the existence of the strong correlation of stocks and their collective behavior in crisis made us address higher-order interactions. Hence, in this study, we investigate financial networks by triplet interaction in the framework of balance theory. Due to detecting the contribution of higher-order interactions in understanding the complex behavior of stocks we take the advantage of the orders parameters of the higher-order interactions. Looking at real data of financial market obtained from $S\\\\&P500$ through the lens of balance theory for the quest of network structure in different periods of time near and far from crisis reveals the existence of a structural difference of the network that corresponds to different periods of time. Here, we address two well-known crises the Great regression (2008) and the Covid-19 recession (2020). Results show an ordered structure forms on-crisis in the financial network while stocks behave independently far from a crisis. The formation of the ordered structure of stocks in crisis makes the network resistant against disorder. The resistance of the ordered structure against applying a disorder (temperature) can measure the crisis strength and determine the temperature at which the network transits. There is a critical temperature, $T_{c}$, in the language of statistical mechanics and mean-field approach which above, the ordered structure destroys abruptly and a first-order phase transition occurs. The stronger the crisis, the higher the critical temperature.","output":"Financial Crisis in the Framework of Non-zero Temperature Balance Theory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covalent post-translational modification of proteins by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like factors has emerged as a general mechanism to regulate myriad intra-cellular processes.

It is thus, timely to evaluate the potential for ubiquitin pathway enzymes as DDR drug targets for therapeutic intervention. The synthetic lethal approach provides exciting opportunities for the development of targeted therapies to treat cancer: most tumours have lost critical DDR pathways, and thus rely more heavily on the remaining pathways, while normal tissues are still equipped with all DDR pathways.

However, recent studies show that the cytoskeletal scaffold, anillin, supports contractile signaling by a novel, non-tethering mechanism that controls the membrane dissociation kinetics of RhoA.

Interestingly, recent studies demonstrated that platelets contain both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecules, equipping platelets with immunoregulatory function in both innate and adaptive immunity. In the context of infectious diseases, platelets are involved in early detection of invading microorganisms and are actively recruited to sites of infection. Platelets exert their effects on microbial pathogens either by direct binding to eliminate or restrict dissemination, or by shaping the subsequent host immune response. Reciprocally, many invading microbial pathogens can directly or indirectly target host platelets, altering platelet count or/and function. In addition, microbial pathogens can impact the host auto- and alloimmune responses to platelet antigens in several immune-mediated diseases, such as immune thrombocytopenia, and fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms that contribute to the bidirectional interactions between platelets and various microbial pathogens, and how these interactions hold relevant implications in the pathogenesis of many infectious diseases.

Childhood survival rates have significantly improved within the last 40 years due to a rapid advancement in therapeutic interventions. However, in high-risk groups, survival rates remain poor. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data of cancer medications in children are limited and thus current dosing regimens are based on studies with small sample sizes. In adults, large variability in PK is observed and dose individualisation (plasma concentration guided dosing) has been associated with improved clinical outcomes; whether this is true for children is still unknown. This provides an opportunity to explore this strategy in children to potentially reduce toxicities and ensure optimal dosing. This paper will provide a protocol to systematically review studies that have used dose individualisation of drugs used in the treatment of childhood leukaemias. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Systematic review methodology will be applied to identify, select and extract data from published plasma guided dosing studies conducted in a paediatric leukaemia cohort. Databases (eg, Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Cochrane) and clinical trial registries (CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov and ISRCTN) will be used to perform the systematic literature search (up until February 2021). Only full empirical studies will be included, with primary clinical outcomes (progression-free survival, toxicities, minimal residual disease status, complete cytogenetic response, partial cytogenetic response and major molecular response) being used to decide whether the study will be included. The quality of included studies will be undertaken, with a subgroup analysis where appropriate.

METHODS Clinical data, treatment and outcome were analysed in this retrospective study of 101 consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to a regional Danish hospital from 2 March 2020, based on data from electronic medical records. RESULTS The mean age was 71.8 years, 33% were never smokers and 82% had one or more predefined chronic diseases. In-hospital mortality was 30%, and 20% of the patients were offered ICU care. In ICU patients, we found a male preponderance (88% versus 44%, p = 0.006), but death (50% versus 25%, p = 0.053) and other pre-defined co-morbidities did not differ significantly from non-ICU patients. The source of infection was unknown in 74% of patients, related to endemic travel in 10%, hospital acquired in 6% and related to close acquaintances in 11%. COVID-19-related symptoms were initially observed from February 21 (week 8 and week 9) in the first three patients who had no known source of infection. We found that 7% of cases had an increased risk of in-hospital transmission, based on a 7-16 days delay in coronavirus testing. CONCLUSIONS The frequency of co-morbidity in hospital-admitted COVID-19 patients and the correlation to death and ICU attendance were analysed. In all, 74% of the infection cases were of unknown source during the first weeks of the epidemic, which points to considerable community transmission and possibly pre- or asymptomatic transmission, also several weeks before 21 February 2020.

METHODS Fifty-six community-dwelling women were pair-matched by age. Heart disease was defined using criteria from the US Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Body composition was measured using multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis. Relative LM was calculated against height (kg/m2) as the lean mass index (LMI). Sarcopenia was defined as an LMI <15.0 kg/m2. Strength was measured with a handgrip dynamometer, arm curl test, and chair stand test. RESULTS Those with HD had significantly less absolute (38.2  0.8 vs 43.5  1.0 kg; P < .001) and relative (15.3  0.3 vs 16.2  0.3 kg/m2, P = .015) LM compared with those without HD. Body mass was significantly greater for those without HD (76.1  2.1 vs 68.4  2.1 kg; P = .013) and there were no differences in fat mass. Upper body strength was significantly less and lower body strength was diminished but not significantly different in those with HD compared to those without HD (handgrip: P = .016; arm curl: P < .001; chair stand: P = .066). CONCLUSIONS In this group of community-dwelling women, those who reported a diagnosis of HD had significantly less LM than those without HD. Although neither group was classified as sarcopenic, women with HD were at greater risk due to lower relative LM.

One frequently proposed method is ultraviolet (UV)-C irradiation. UV-C doses necessary to achieve inactivation of high-titre SARS-CoV-2 are poorly defined. Aim: We investigated whether short exposure of SARS-CoV-2 to UV-C irradiation sufficiently reduces viral infectivity and doses necessary to achieve an at least 6-log reduction in viral titres. Methods: Using a box and two handheld systems designed to decontaminate objects and surfaces, we evaluated the efficacy of 254 nm UV-C treatment to inactivate surface dried high-titre SARS-CoV-2. Results: Drying for 2 hours did not have a major impact on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, indicating that exhaled virus in droplets or aerosols stays infectious on surfaces for at least a certain amount of time. Short exposure of high titre surface dried virus (3C5*10^6 IU/ml) with UV-C light (16 mJ/cm(2)) resulted in a total inactivation of SARS-CoV-2. Dose-dependency experiments revealed that 3.5 mJ/cm(2) were still effective to achieve a > 6-log reduction in viral titres, whereas 1.75 mJ/cm(2) lowered infectivity only by one order of magnitude. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly inactivated by relatively low doses of UV-C irradiation and the relationship between UV-C dose and log-viral titre reduction of surface residing SARS-CoV-2 is nonlinear. Our findings emphasize that it is necessary to assure sufficient and complete exposure of all relevant areas by integrated UV-C doses of at least 3.5 mJ/cm(2) at 254 nm.

This study is to understand COVID-19s imposed HR of fatality while controlling for covariates, such as age, sex, metastasis status and cancer type. METHODS: We conducted survival analyses of 4606 cancer patients with COVID-19 test results from 16 March to 11 October 2020 in UK Biobank and estimated the overall HR of fatality with and without COVID-19 infection. We also examined the HRs of 13 specific cancer types with at least 100 patients using a stratified analysis. RESULTS: COVID-19 resulted in an overall HR of 7.76 (95% CI 5.78 to 10.40, p<10(?10)) by following 4606 patients with cancer for 21 days after the tests. The HR varied among cancer type, with over a 10-fold increase in fatality rate (false discovery rate 0.02) for melanoma, haematological malignancies, uterine cancer and kidney cancer. Although COVID-19 imposed a higher risk for localised versus distant metastasis cancers, those of distant metastases yielded higher overall fatality rates due to their multiplicative effects. DISCUSSION: The results confirmed prior reports for the increased risk of fatality for patients with COVID-19 plus hematological malignancies and demonstrated similar findings of COVID-19 on melanoma, uterine, and kidney cancers. CONCLUSION: The results highlight the heightened risk that COVID-19 imposes on localised and haematological cancer patients and the necessity to vaccinate uninfected patients with cancer promptly, particularly for the cancer types most influenced by COVID-19.

In order to explore the willingness to e-grocery, and delivery preferences (self-delivery, home delivered grocery or collected in a specific place) - and estimate their market shares - a stated preference survey was carried in Rome and Milan. Respondents were asked about their grocery shopping habits and to choose among different shopping and delivery options. Discrete choice modelling allows investigating preference heterogeneity and estimating willingness to pay measures. Main results indicate that respondents, characterised by distinct socio-economic, attitudinal, and geographical elements, react differently to attribute variations for alternative grocery shopping channels. Scenario simulations can help in defining successful business-strategies and possible solutions to external costs.

The studies addressed a wide range of problems and solutions. Twelve items and four items were classified with moderate quality (AMSTER score 5C8) and high quality (AMSTER score 9C11), respectively. Half of the studies (n = 8) dealt with mental and psychological problems resulting from crises as the most important factor in the decline of health system staff's durability in organizations. They also provided different solutions such as mental health counselling during and after the crisis, flexible work schedule, promoted trust in the organization, support of staff's family, and enhanced awareness to support employees. And the other articles addressed managerial problems as the most critical factor in the decline of health system staff's durability in organizations and proposed solutions such as suitable planning before, during, and after the crisis and the use of material and spiritual incentives to increase the employees' motivation and organizational resilience to maintain the staff. CONCLUSION: In the present review study, three dimensions (namely, resilience, motivation-hygiene measures, and development of manager's soft skills) are considered as the main factors reinforcing and maintaining human resources in the health systems in long-term crises and disasters.","output":"Reinforcement and Maintenance of Human Resources for Health Systems during Long-Term Crises: A Systematic Review of Systematic Reviews"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Meals, chores, entertainment, Lockdown brings families closer Lockdown has come with its fair share of advantage Families that mostly live apart now find grace in getting to spend quality time with other members of the house In this study,A survey-based self-structured questionnaire was prepared with 15 questions using a random sampling method and was circulated among 100 people through an online portal link The results were collected and then analysed through SPSS software Descriptive statistical analysis was carried out and chi square test was used and p value was calculated The results thus obtained in the form of pie charts and graphs These graphs are then discussed The results show that 96 46% of the people spend their lockdown period at home and 35 40% of the people are extremely happy in the lockdown within the family But some develop anxiety and mental illness in the lockdown while 73 45% feels comfortable to be quarantined From this study, it was concluded that since the p value was more than 0 05, there is no significant statistical difference that has been analysed Thus,it was observed that lockdown helps us to build more and quality time within the family with the preventive measures to be followed against the pandemic COVID-19 without any anxiety or stress","output":"Does the lockdown helps to build quality time within family"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A crucial bacterial strategy to avoid killing by antibiotics is to enter a growth arrested state, yet the molecular mechanisms behind this process remain elusive. The conditional overexpression of mazF, the endoribonuclease toxin of the MazEF toxin-antitoxin system in Staphylococcus aureus, is one approach to induce bacterial growth arrest, but its targets remain largely unknown. We used overexpression of mazF and high-throughput sequence analysis following the exact mapping of non-phosphorylated transcriptome ends (nEMOTE) technique to reveal in vivo toxin cleavage sites on a global scale. We obtained a catalogue of MazF cleavage sites and unearthed an extended MazF cleavage specificity that goes beyond the previously reported one. We correlated transcript cleavage and abundance in a global transcriptomic profiling during mazF overexpression. We observed that MazF affects RNA molecules involved in ribosome biogenesis, cell wall synthesis, cell division and RNA turnover and thus deliver a plausible explanation for how mazF overexpression induces stasis. We hypothesize that autoregulation of MazF occurs by directly modulating the MazEF operon, such as the rsbUVW genes that regulate the sigma factor SigB, including an observed cleavage site on the MazF mRNA that would ultimately play a role in entry and exit from bacterial stasis.","output":"Insights into the global effect on Staphylococcus aureus growth arrest by induction of the endoribonuclease MazF toxin."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The introduction of molecular techniques has enabled better understanding of the etiology of respiratory tract infections in children. The objective of the study was to analyze viral coinfection and its relationship to clinical severity. METHODS: Hospitalized pediatric patients with a clinical diagnosis of respiratory infection were studied during the period between 2009-2010. Clinical and epidemiological data, duration of hospitalization, need for oxygen therapy, bacterial coinfection and need for mechanical ventilation were collected. Etiology was studied by multiplex PCR and low-density microarrays for 19 viruses. RESULTS: A total of 385 patients were positive, 44.94% under 12 months. The most frequently detected viruses were RSV-B: 139, rhinovirus: 114, RSV-A: 111, influenza A H1N1-2009: 93 and bocavirus: 77. Coinfection was detected in 61.81%, 36.36% with 2 viruses, 16.10% and 9.35% with 3 to 4 or more. Coinfection was higher in 2009 with 69.79 vs. 53.88% in 2010. Rhinovirus/RSV-B on 10 times and RSV-A/RSV-B on 5 times were the most detected coinfections. Hospitalization decreased with greater number of viruses (P < 0,001). Oxygen therapy was required by 26.75% (one virus was detected in 55.34% of cases). A larger number of viruses resulted in less need for oxygen (P < 0,001). Ten cases required mechanical ventilation, 4 patients with bacterial coinfection and 5 with viral coinfection (P = 0,69). CONCLUSIONS: An inverse relationship was found between the number of viruses detected in nasopharyngeal aspirate, the need for oxygen therapy and hospitalization days. More epidemiological studies and improved quantitative detection techniques are needed to define the role of viral coinfections in respiratory disease and its correlation with the clinical severity.","output":"Coinfeccin vrica en las infecciones respiratorias infantiles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current COVID-19 global pandemic presents a major challenge and unprecedented pressures on health systems.

Methods We identified a non-COVID-19 cohort and patients with suspected COVID-19 with chest CT scans from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020. Lungs were segmented, and a mean normal Hounsfield Unit (HU) histogram was generated for the non-COVID-19 CT scans; these were used to define thresholds for designating the COVID-19-suspected histograms as normal or abnormal. Statistical measures were computed and compared to the threshold levels, and density maps were generated to examine the difference between lungs with and without COVID-19 qualitatively. Results The non-COVID-19 cohort consisted of 70 patients with 70 CT scans, and the cohort of suspected COVID-19 patients consisted of 59 patients with 80 CT scans. Sixty-two patients were positive for COVID-19. The mean HUs and skewness of the intensity histogram discriminated between COVID-19 positive and negative cases, with an area under the curve of 0.948 for positive and 0.944 for negative cases. Skewness correctly identified 57 of 62 positive cases, whereas mean HUs correctly identified 17 of 18 negative cases. Density maps allowed for visualization of the temporal evolution of COVID-19 disease. Conclusions The statistical measures and density maps evaluated here could be employed in an automated screening algorithm for COVID-19 infection. The accuracy is high enough for a simple and rapid screening tool for early identification of suspected infection in patients treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy already receiving CT scans as part of clinical care. This screening tool could also identify other infections that present critical risks for patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy, such as pneumonitis.","output":"Using Statistical Measures and Density Maps Generated From Chest Computed Tomography Scans to Identify and Monitor COVID-19 Cases in Radiation Oncology Rapidly"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, many organizations (e.g. businesses, companies, government facilities, etc.) have attempted to reduce infection risk by employing partial home office strategies. However, working from home can also reduce productivity for certain types of work and particular employees. Over the long term, many organizations therefore face a need to balance infection risk against productivity. Motivated by this trade-off, we model this situation as a bi-objective optimization problem and propose a practical approach to find trade-off (Pareto optimal) solutions. We present a new probabilistic framework to compute the expected number of infected employees as a function of key parameters including: the incidence level in the neighborhood of the organization, the COVID-19 transmission rate, the number of employees, the percentage of vaccinated employees, the testing frequency, and the contact rate among employees. We implement the model and the optimization algorithm and perform several numerical experiments with different parameter settings.

During virus infection, autophagy is triggered both in parenchymal and in immune cells with different finalistic objectives: in parenchymal cells, the goal is to destroy the virion particle while in macrophages and dendritic cells the goal is to expose virion-derived fragments for priming the lymphocytes and initiate the immune response. However, some viruses have developed a strategy to subvert the autophagy machinery to escape the destructive destiny and instead exploit it for virion assembly and exocytosis. Coronaviruses (like SARS-CoV-2) possess such ability. The autophagy process requires a set of proteins that constitute the core machinery and is controlled by several signaling pathways. Here, we report on natural products capable of interfering with SARS-CoV-2 cellular infection and replication through their action on autophagy. The present study provides support to the use of such natural products as adjuvant therapeutics for the management of COVID-19 pandemic to prevent the virus infection and replication, and so mitigating the progression of the disease.","output":"Targeting autophagy with natural products to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Adolescents play a significant role in SARS-CoV-2 spread.

Multistage random sampling selected 24 high schools in the Lubuskie region then 51 classes. Students' practices were assessed by an anonymous questionnaire. Significance was tested by Chi-square test. RESULTS: Response rate was 72.3%; 638 students (360 females) participated (mean age 18.40.6 years); 68.7% attended schools in the cities with <100,000 inhabitants; 31.5% were in the science program. Most (81.3%) declared they always used masks in public spaces in the last month (74.3% males vs 86.1% females, p < 0.001; 77.2% of those living in smaller vs 90.5% in larger cities, p < 0.001; 89.6% in the science program vs 77.6% - in the other programs, p < 0.001); 35% always avoided crowded areas (26.9% males vs 39.4% females, p = 0.001; 29.5% living in smaller vs 47% in larger cities, p < 0.001; 43.8% in the science program vs 30.9% - in the other programs, p = 0.002); 24.3% declared always keeping social distance (19.4% males vs 27.2% females, p = 0.02), 29.9% stated they did not touch their faces (25% males vs 33.3% females, p = 0.02; 27.2% living in smaller vs 36% in larger cities, p = 0.02; 37.8% in the science program vs 26.3% - in the other programs, p = 0.003).

The Swine Health Monitoring Project (SHMP) monitors and reports weekly new PRRS cases in 766 sow herds across the US. The time-dependent reproduction number (TD-R) is a measure of a pathogens transmissibility. It may serve to capture and report PRRS virus (PRRSV) spread at the regional and system levels. The primary objective of the study here was to estimate the TD-R values for PRRSV using regional and system-level PRRS data, and to contrast it with commonly used metrics of disease, such as incidence estimates and spaceCtime clusters. The second objective was to test whether the estimated TD-Rs were homogenous across four US regions. Retrospective monthly incidence data (2009C2016) were available from the SHMP. The dataset was divided into four regions based on location of participants, and demographic and environmental features, namely, South East (North Carolina), Upper Midwest East (UME, Minnesota/Iowa), Upper Midwest West (Nebraska/South Dakota), and South (Oklahoma panhandle). Generation time distributions were fit to incidence data for each region, and used to calculate the TD-Rs. The KruskalCWallis test was used to determine whether the median TD-Rs differed across the four areas. Furthermore, we used a spaceCtime permutation model to assess spatialCtemporal patterns for the four regions. Results showed TD-Rs were right skewed with median values close to 1 across all regions, confirming that PRRS has an overall endemic nature. Variation in the TD-R patterns was noted across regions and production systems. Statistically significant periods of PRRSV spread (TD-R > 1) were identified for all regions except UME. A minimum of three spaceCtime clusters were detected for all regions considering the time period examined herein; and their overlap with spreader events identified by the TD-R method varied according to region. TD-Rs may help to measure PRRS spread to understand, in quantitative terms, disease spread, and, ultimately, support the design, implementation, and monitoring of interventions aimed at mitigating the impact of PRRSV spread in the US.","output":"Estimation of Time-Dependent Reproduction Numbers for Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome across Different Regions and Production Systems of the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article investigates the impact of the coronavirus pandemic COVID-19 on marketing within cultural institutions, specifically in the field of digital marketing. The aim is to examine how the pandemic has affected digital strategies, marketing communication, and the performance itself - the presentation of cultural programs.

A qualitative descriptive analysis was performed to answer the question of how cultural institutions have adapted to the crisis, especially when it comes to the marketing and the performance of cultural programs. The results show a certain degree of flexibility in adapting to the new conditions, in a way that marketing communication after the crisis turned more strongly towards digital media and was followed by adjustments to the cultural programs and their performance, as well as the budget for cultural activities. The marketing digital communication played a key role in this, which proves that cultural management in the era of the pandemic adopted the so-called digital-first paradigm, modeled on the for-profit companies.

However, we lack insights into local communities' experiences in coping with the current COVID-19 pandemic. This study explored both the impact of, and response to, COVID-19 within the Orthodox Jewish communities of Antwerp (Belgium) during the first lockdown period (March 2020 - May 2020). METHODS: We conducted an explorative qualitative study using a participatory approach. First, we performed a community mapping to identify relevant stakeholders. Through the active involvement of a community advisory board and based on qualitative interviews with key-informants and community members, we elicited lived experiences, attitudes, and perceptions towards COVID-19. Interviews were conducted both face-to-face and using online web conferencing technology. Data were analyzed inductively according to the principles of thematic analysis. RESULTS: Government-issued outbreak control measures presented context-specific challenges to the Orthodox Jewish communities in Antwerp. They related mainly to the remote organization of religious life, and practicing physical distancing in socially and culturally strongly connected communities. Existing community resources were rapidly mobilized to adapt to the outbreak and to self-organize response initiatives within communities. The active involvement of community and religious leaders in risk communication proved to be of great importance to facilitate the coverage and uptake of pandemic control measures while protecting essential community values and traditions. Creating bottom-up and community-adapted communication strategies, including addressing language barriers and involving Rabbis in the dissemination of prevention messages, fostered a feeling of trust in government's response measures. However, unmet information and prevention needs were also identified, such as the need for inclusive communication by public authorities and the need to mitigate the negative effects of stigmatization. CONCLUSION: The experiences of Orthodox Jewish communities in Antwerp demonstrate a valuable example of a feasible community-centered approach to health emergencies.

This study seeks to develop and validate a data-driven personalized mortality risk calculator for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: De-identified data was obtained for 3,927 COVID-19 positive patients from six independent centers, comprising 33 different hospitals. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were collected at hospital admission. The COVID-19 Mortality Risk (CMR) tool was developed using the XGBoost algorithm to predict mortality. Its discrimination performance was subsequently evaluated on three validation cohorts. Findings: The derivation cohort of 3,062 patients has an observed mortality rate of 26.84%. Increased age, decreased oxygen saturation ([] 93%), elevated levels of C-reactive protein ([] 130 mg/L), blood urea nitrogen ([] 18 mg/dL), and blood creatinine ([] 1.2 mg/dL) were identified as primary risk factors, validating clinical findings. The model obtains out-of-sample AUCs of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87-0.94) on the derivation cohort. In the validation cohorts, the model obtains AUCs of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88-0.95) on Seville patients, 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.91) on Hellenic COVID-19 Study Group patients, and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.85) on Hartford Hospital patients.

Some of the first actions taken by governments are the closing of schools. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce the number of cases and, ultimately, mortality comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the effect of school closure on the health-care labour force. The potential benefits from school closures need to be weighed against costs of health-care worker absenteeism associated with additional child-care obligations. In this study, we aimed to measure child-care obligations for US health-care workers arising from school closures when these are used as a social distancing measure. We then assessed how important the contribution of health-care workers would have to be in reducing mortality for their absenteeism due to child-care obligations to undo the benefits of school closures in reducing the number of cases. METHODS: For this modelling analysis, we used data from the monthly releases of the US Current Population Survey to characterise the family structure and probable within-household child-care options of US health-care workers. We accounted for the occupation within the health-care sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the health-care workforce that are most exposed to child-care obligations from school closures. We used these estimates to identify the critical level at which the importance of health-care labour supply in increasing the survival probability of a patient with COVID-19 would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. FINDINGS: Between January, 2018, and January, 2020, the US Current Population Survey included information on more than 31 million individuals across 13 million households. We found that the US health-care sector has some of the highest child-care obligations in the USA, with 288% (95% CI 285-291) of the health-care workforce needing to provide care for children aged 3-12 years. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling aged 13 years or older can provide child care, 150% (148-152) of the health-care workforce would still be in need of child care during a school closure. We observed substantial variation within the health-care system. We estimated that, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 150% case reduction from school closings and 20% baseline mortality rate, a 150% decrease in the health-care labour force would need to decrease the survival probability per percent health-care worker lost by 176% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. Our model estimates that if the infection mortality rate of COVID-19 increases from 200% to 235% when the health-care workforce declines by 150%, school closures could lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. INTERPRETATION: School closures come with many trade-offs, and can create unintended child-care obligations. Our results suggest that the potential contagion prevention from school closures needs to be carefully weighted with the potential loss of health-care workers from the standpoint of reducing cumulative mortality due to COVID-19, in the absence of mitigating measures. FUNDING: None.","output":"Impact of school closures for COVID-19 on the US health-care workforce and net mortality: a modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the first human homologue of ACE to be described.

PURPOSE: The aim was to investigate the possibility of airborne transmission of COVID-19 during Humphrey visual field testing in a real-world scenario. METHODS: A particle counter was placed within the bowl of Humphrey visual field analyzer (HFA) before and after turning on the machine to ascertain the effect of the air current produced by the ventilation system on aerosols. A second experiment was run where the particle counter was placed in the bowl and recorded particulates, in the air, as a 24-2 SITA standard was performed by a mock patient and then again immediately after the patient had moved away. We measured aerosol particle counts sized &#8804;0.3 m, >0.3&#8804;0.5 m, >0.5&#8804;1 m, >1&#8804;2.5 m, >2.5&#8804;5 m, and >5&#8804;10 m. RESULTS: Particulates of all sizes were shown to be significantly reduced within the bowl after turning the machine on, demonstrating that the air current produced by the HFA pushes air out of the bowl and it cannot stagnate. There was no significant difference in measurement of aerosol while there was a patient performing the test and immediately after they had moved away, suggesting that aerosols breathed out by the patient are not able to remain in suspension in the bowl because of the ventilation current. CONCLUSION: There is no significant difference between aerosol count in the bowl of a HFA before, during and after testing. This suggests the risk of airborne transmission of COVID-19 is low between subsequent patients.

In-depth phenotyping demonstrated expansion of CD8 effector memory T cells, enhanced T cell activation, and impaired plasmablast induction in ICI-treated COVID-19 patients. The evaluation of specific adaptive immunity in convalescent patients showed higher spike (S), nucleoprotein (N), and membrane (M) antigen-specific T cell responses and similar induction of spike-specific antibody responses.

We report on insights gained during rapid development of a pandemic vaccine based on recombinant haemagglutinin (rHA) formulated with Advax? delta inulin adjuvant (Panblok-H1/Advax). Panblok-H1/Advax was designed and manufactured within 1 month of the pandemic declaration by WHO and successfully entered human clinical testing in under 3 months from first isolation and sequencing of the novel pandemic virus, requiring several major challenges to be overcome. Panblok-H1/Advax successfully induced neutralising antibodies against the pandemic strain, but also induced cross-neutralising antibodies in a subset of subjects against an H1N1 strain (A/Puerto Rico/8/34) derived from the 1918 Spanish flu, highlighting the possibility to use Advax to induce more broadly cross-protective antibody responses. Interestingly, the rHA from H1N1/2009pdm exhibited variants in the receptor binding domain that had a major impact on receptor binding and hemagglutination ability.

Corticosteroids are given to attenuate the inflammation, but they are associated with thrombosis. The aims of this study were to determine the risk of venous thromboembolism between no methylprednisolone and methylprednisolone (dose versus duration) and to evaluate any synergistic dose-dependent association of heparin and methylprednisolone to 30 days in hospital survival. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a retrospective cohort. Patients included in this study were  18 years of age and admitted for severe COVID-19 pneumonia between March and June 2020 in 13 hospitals in New Jersey, United States. A propensity score analysis between administration of methylprednisolone and no methylprednisolone was fitted for 11 variables and Youden Index Method was used to determine cut-off between low dose and high dose methylprednisolone. Multivariate cox regression was to assess risk. RESULTS: In 759 patients, the incidence of venous thromboembolism was 9% of patients who received methylprednisolone and 3% of patients who did not receive methylprednisolone with a [RR 2.92 (95% CI 1.54, 5.55 P < 0.0001)]. There was a higher incidence of mechanical ventilation in the methylprednisolone group. The median d-dimer between patients with venous thromboembolism was higher compared to those without (P < 0.0003). However, the d-dimer was not statistically significant between those who had venous thromboembolism between methylprednisolone and no methylprednisolone groups (P = 0.40). There was no higher risk in high dose versus low dose [RR = 0.524 (95% CI 0.26, 1.06 P 0.4)]; however, the risk for venous thromboembolism between methylprednisolone for > 7 days and  7 days was statistically significant (RR 5.46 95% CI 2.87, 10.34 P < 0.0001). Patients who received low dose methylprednisolone and therapeutic heparin had a trend towards higher risk of mortality compared to prophylactic heparin (HR 1.81 95% CI 0.994 to 3.294) (P = 0.0522). There was no difference in 30 days in hospital survival between high dose methylprednisolone with prophylactic or therapeutic heparin (HR 0.827 95% CI 0.514 to 1.33) (P = 0.4335).

The 624/I and Q1 genotypes, now recognized to be part of the GI-16 lineage, represent an excellent example of the practical consequences of IBV molecular epidemiology limited knowledge. In fact, being their common origin unrecognized for a long time, independent epidemiological pictures were drawn for the two genotypes. To fix this misinterpretation, the present study reconstructs the history, population dynamics and spreading patterns of GI-16 lineage as a whole using a phylodynamic approach. A collection of worldwide available hypervariable region 1 and 2 (HVR12) and 3 (HVR3) sequences of the S1 protein was analysed together with 258 HVR3 sequences obtained from samples collected in Italy (the country where this genotype was initially identified) since 1963. The results demonstrate that after its emergence at the beginning of the XX century, GI-16 was able to persist until present days in Italy. Approximately in the late 1980s, it migrated to Asia, which became the main nucleus for further spreading to Middle East, Europe and especially South America, likely through multiple introduction events. A remarkable among-country diffusion was also demonstrated in Asia and South America. Interestingly, although most of the recent Italian GI-16 strains originated from ancestral viruses detected in the same country, a couple were closely related to Chinese ones, supporting a backward viral flow from China to Italy. Besides to the specific case-study results, this work highlights the misconceptions that originate from the lack of a unified nomenclature and poor molecular epidemiology data generation and sharing.

However, there is one shortcoming of LSG in the long-term follow-up, and this is the onset of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) and erosive esophagitis (EE). Conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is considered an option in patients unresponsive to medical therapy. Currently, there is no evidence of EE improvement or resolution after conversion surgery. In this study, we objectively evaluate the effectiveness of RYGB in management of EE with upper endoscopy (EGD) to identify the significant variables in patients with GERD symptoms post LSG refractory to medical therapy and require conversion surgery. METHODS: Over a period of 11 years (2008-2019) at Singapore General Hospital, we retrospectively reviewed a prospectively collected database of a cohort of patients whom had conversion surgery to RYGB for refractory GERD and EE after LSG. Patient's endoscopic findings and demographic and anthropometric data were analyzed. RESULTS: We identified a total of 14 patients who underwent LSG to RYGB conversions for endoscopic proven erosive esophagitis in our unit during the study period. Eight patients (57.1%) had concurrent hiatal hernia repaired. Nine (64.3%) patients were females. The median age of patients in this cohort was 44 (range 30-61) years. Mean weight and BMI were 87.7 kg ( 19.2) and 32.8 ( 3.09) kg/m2, respectively, on the day of conversion surgery. The median time between LSG and revision to RYGB was 36 (range 6-68) months. Seven patients (50%) had complete resolution of GERD symptoms after conversion, and 6 patients (42.9%) had partial resolution. Six out of 7 patients had complete resolution of EE. There were 4 anastomotic strictures (28.6%). Older patients, Indian ethnicity, present of hiatal hernia and lower weight loss after initial LSG were more likely to undergo conversion surgery. CONCLUSION: Conversion to RYGB after LSG is clinically relevant and may be a feasible solution if patients have ongoing GERD refractory to medical therapy. Ninety-three percent of our patients achieved complete resolution of their GERD symptoms and significant improvement of erosive esophagitis with significant weight loss after conversion. This study has important implications as LSG is increasingly being performed and a proportion of these will need revision surgery for various reasons, particularly GERD which is extremely prevalent.","output":"Resolution of Erosive Esophagitis After Conversion from Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy to Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New COVID-19 diagnoses have dropped faster than expected in the United States.

However, we may suppose that some families may also experience positive aspects of the COVID-19 lockdown such as increased emotional closeness and more time for free play and creativity in parent-child relationships. The aim of the current study was to investigate predictors of the positive experiences in parent-child relationship in Polish mothers and fathers during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: 228 mothers and 231 fathers completed the Brief version of the Empathic Sensitivity Questionnaire, The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale Short Form, Social Support Scale, Parenting Self-Agency Measure, as well as The Scale of Positive Experiences in Parent-Child Relationship during the COVID-19 lockdown. Results: Our results show that parenting self-efficacy and social support are the best predictors of the positive experiences in parent-child relationships in both mothers and fathers during the lockdown. Additionally, perspective taking is a positive predictor of the positive experiences in mothers, whereas increased affective components of empathy (empathic concern and personal distress) are predictors of the positive experiences in the parent-child relationship in fathers. Conclusions: Our study emphasizes a need to focus not only on negative, but also on positive consequences of COVID-19 lockdown for children and parents, and shows which factors could be important targets for preventive and therapeutic interventions for mothers and fathers during the epidemic.","output":"Factors related to positive experiences in parent-child relationship during the COVID-19 lockdown.

Kidney transplant recipients have an increased risk for infectious diseases, including viral infections. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of population-wide infection control measures on the mood statuses of kidney transplant recipients. MATERIALS AND METHODS We used an electronic survey tool to collect demographic and sociocultural data. Additionally, in the same survey, we used 2 questionnaires (the Profile of Mood States and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) to measure mood statuses of kidney transplant recipients. We also examined a control group and selected eligible participants according to age- and sex-based propensity score matching. RESULTS We analyzed the data of 308 participants: 154 kidney transplant recipients (mean age of 39.9  10.6 years; 57.1% male) and 154 control participants (mean age of 39.1  10.5; 57.1% male). With regard to the Profile of Mood States questionnaire, total scores and all subscale scores, excluding vigor, were significantly lower in kidney transplant recipients than in the control group, a finding consistent with a better mood status. We found similar findings in anxiety and depression scores for the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS Kidney transplant recipients seem to be resilient to the psychological stress induced by social distancing and lockdown periods. Strict adherence to infection control measures is purposefully suggested in this infection-prone population.","output":"Coronavirus Pandemic: Mood Statuses of Renal Transplant Recipients During Social Isolation and Lockdown Periods."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Paulinella photosynthetic species are unicellular, silica shell-forming amoebas classified into the supergroup Rhizaria. They crawl at the bottom of freshwater and brackish environments with the help of filose pseudopodia. These protists have drawn the attention of the scientific community because of two photosynthetic bodies, called chromatophores, that fill up their cells permitting fully photoautotrophic existence. Paulinella chromatophores, similarly to primary plastids of the Archaeplastida supergroup (including glaucophytes, red algae as well as green algae and land plants), evolved from free-living cyanobacteria in the process of endosymbiosis. Interestingly, these both cyanobacterial acquisitions occurred independently, thereby undermining the paradigm of the rarity of endosymbiotic events. Chromatophores were derived from &#945;-cyanobacteria relatively recently 60-140 million years ago, whereas primary plastids originated from ?-cyanobacteria more than 1.5 billion years ago. Since their acquisition, chromatophore genomes have undergone substantial reduction but not to the extent of primary plastid genomes. Consequently, they have also developed mechanisms for transport of metabolites and nuclear-encoded proteins along with appropriate targeting signals. Therefore, chromatophores of Paulinella photosynthetic species, similarly to primary plastids, are true cellular organelles. They not only show that endosymbiotic events might not be so rare but also make a perfect model for studying the process of organellogenesis.

Tocilizumab reduced progression to mechanical ventilation and death in a trial population enriched for racial and ethnic minorities. We aimed to investigate whether tocilizumab treatment could prevent COVID-19 progression in the first multicentre randomised controlled trial of tocilizumab done entirely in a lower-middle-income country. METHODS: COVINTOC is an open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial done at 12 public and private hospitals across India. Adults (aged 18 years) admitted to hospital with moderate to severe COVID-19 (Indian Ministry of Health grading) confirmed by positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result were randomly assigned (1:1 block randomisation) to receive tocilizumab 6 mg/kg plus standard care (the tocilizumab group) or standard care alone (the standard care group). The primary endpoint was progression of COVID-19 (from moderate to severe or from severe to death) up to day 14 in the modified intention-to-treat population of all participants who had at least one post-baseline assessment for the primary endpoint. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients. The trial is completed and registered with the Clinical Trials Registry India (CTRI/2020/05/025369). FINDINGS: 180 patients were recruited between May 30, 2020, and Aug 31, 2020, and randomly assigned to the tocilizumab group (n=90) or the standard care group (n=90). One patient randomly assigned to the standard care group inadvertently received tocilizumab at baseline and was included in the tocilizumab group for all analyses. One patient randomly assigned to the standard care group withdrew consent after the baseline visit and did not receive any study medication and was not included in the modified intention-to-treat population but was still included in safety analyses. 75 (82%) of 91 in the tocilizumab group and 68 (76%) of 89 in the standard care group completed 28 days of follow-up. Progression of COVID-19 up to day 14 occurred in eight (9%) of 91 patients in the tocilizumab group and 11 (13%) of 88 in the standard care group (difference ?371 [95% CI ?1823 to 1119]; p=042). 33 (36%) of 91 patients in the tocilizumab group and 22 (25%) of 89 patients in the standard care group had adverse events; 18 (20%) and 15 (17%) had serious adverse events. The most common adverse event was acute respiratory distress syndrome, reported in seven (8%) patients in each group. Grade 3 adverse events were reported in two (2%) patients in the tocilizumab group and five (6%) patients in the standard care group. There were no grade 4 adverse events. Serious adverse events were reported in 18 (20%) patients in the tocilizumab group and 15 (17%) in the standard care group; 13 (14%) and 15 (17%) patients died during the study. INTERPRETATION: Routine use of tocilizumab in patients admitted to hospital with moderate to severe COVID-19 is not supported. However, post-hoc evidence from this study suggests tocilizumab might still be effective in patients with severe COVID-19 and so should be investigated further in future studies.

Safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the developed vaccine were evaluated in vivo. Five 10-week-old beagle pups were administered (three weeks apart) two vaccine doses, whereas two animals served as unvaccinated controls. The vaccine was shown to be safe as no local neither systemic reactions were observed after first and second dose administration. Serum antibodies against CCoV were detected in vaccinates starting from study day 14 (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) or 28 (by virus neutralisation test). Subsequent challenge with virulent CCoV-IIb resulted in the development of mild gastroenteric disease in control pups, whereas vaccinates did not display clinical signs. Faecal shedding of the challenge virus occurred in both treatment groups, but vaccinated dogs were found to shed very low viral titres in comparison to controls.

MicroRNA (miRNA) plays an important role in this genetic regulation and contributes to the enhancement of viral RNA binding through the host mRNA. OBJECTIVE: This research is aimed to detect miRNA targets of SARS-CoV-2 and examines their role in Indonesia cases against Wuhan cases. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 sequences were obtained from GISAID ( https://www.gisaid.org/ ), NCBI ( https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ), and National Genomics Data Center ( https://bigd.big.ac.cn/gwh/ ) databases. MiRDB ( https://github.com/gbnegrini/mirdb-custom-target-search ) was used to annotate and predict target human mature miRNAs. For statistical analysis, we utilized a series chi-square test to obtain significant miRNA. DIANA-miRPath v3.0 ( http://www.microrna.gr/miRPathv3 ) analyzed the Gene Ontology of mature miRNAs. RESULT: The statistical results detected five significant miRNAs. Two miRNAs: hsa-miR-4778-5p and hsa-miR-4531 were consistently found in the majority of Wuhan samples, while they were only found in less than half of the Indonesia samples. The other three miRNA, hsa-miR-6844, hsa-miR-627-5p, and hsa-miR-3674, were discovered in most samples in both groups but with a significant difference ratio. Among these five significant miRNA targets, hsa-miR-6844 is the only miRNA that has an association with the ORF1ab gene of SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: The Gene Ontology analysis of five significant miRNA targets indicates a significant role in inflammation and the immune system.

Due to its intuitive definition in terms of tree clades and bipartitions and its computational efficiency, the Robinson-Foulds (RF) distance is the most widely used for trees with unweighted edges and labels restricted to leaves (representing the genetic elements being compared). However, in the case of gene trees, an important information revealing the nature of the homologous relation between gene pairs (orthologs, paralogs, xenologs) is the type of event associated to each internal node of the tree, typically speciations or duplications, but other types of events may also be considered, such as horizontal gene transfers. This labeling of internal nodes is usually inferred from a gene tree/species tree reconciliation method. Here, we address the problem of comparing such event-labeled trees. The problem differs from the classical problem of comparing uniformly labeled trees (all labels belonging to the same alphabet) that may be done using the Tree Edit Distance (TED) mainly due to the fact that, in our case, two different alphabets are considered for the leaves and internal nodes of the tree, and leaves are not affected by edit operations. RESULTS: We propose an extension of the RF distance to event-labeled trees, based on edit operations comparable to those considered for TED: node insertion, node deletion and label substitution. We show that this new Labeled Robinson Foulds (LRF) distance can be computed in linear time, in addition of maintaining other desirable properties: being a metric, reducing to RF for trees with no labels on internal nodes and maintaining an intuitive interpretation. The algorithm for computing the LRF distance enables novel analyses on event-label trees such as reconciled gene trees. Here, we use it to study the impact of taxon sampling on labeled gene tree inference, and conclude that denser taxon sampling yields trees with better topology but worse labeling.","output":"A Linear Time Solution to the Labeled Robinson-Foulds Distance Problem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Older adults are at higher risk for death and infirmity from COVID-19 than younger and middle-age adults.

STUDY DESIGN A descriptive cross-sectional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Department of Pediatrics, Kastamonu Training and Research Hospital, Kastamonu, Turkey from March to December 2020. METHODOLOGY Seventy-nine children, hospitalised with the diagnosis of COVID-19, were included in the study and were divided into two groups as symptomatic and asymptomatic. The demographic data, laboratory results and clinics of the patients of the two groups were compared. RESULTS The mean age of participants was 10.43  5.91 (0-17) years, and 57% (n=45) of them were girls. Five patients in the symptomatic group had comorbidities (2 allergic asthma, cerebral palsy, type-1 diabetes mellitus and anorexia nervosa). The most common symptom was fever (36.7%, n=29). It was noteworthy that everyone with an NLR >3.13 (high-NLR) was symptomatic. Significantly more patients in the high-NLR group were symptomatic compared with the low-NLR group (p=0.005). On the other hand, symptomatic children had significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein (2.8 (IQR: 1.2-10.0) mg/L vs. 1.4 (IQR: 0.4-2.0) mg/L, p=0.011); and procalcitonin (0.05 (IQR: 0.02-0.10) ng/mL vs. 0.01 (IQR: 0.00-0.03) ng/mL, p<0.001) than those without symptoms.

A recent meta-analysis of observational studies of adjuvant corticosteroids in influenza found an association with increased mortality but there were important concerns regarding the risks of bias. OBJECTIVES To (1) evaluate whether or not low-dose corticosteroids given as an adjunct to standard treatment is beneficial in patients who are hospitalised with severe pandemic influenza and (2) develop an 'off-the-shelf' clinical trial that is ready to be activated in a future pandemic. DESIGN Multicentre, pragmatic, blinded, randomised placebo-controlled trial. SETTING Thirty to 40 hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS Adults ( 16 years) admitted to hospital with an influenza-like illness during a pandemic. INTERVENTION Five-day course of dexamethasone (Dexsol?, Rosemont Pharmaceuticals Ltd) 6 mg daily, started within 24 hours of admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Admission to Intensive Care Unit, or death, within 30 days of admission to hospital. RESULTS This trial has not yet been activated. It is currently set up with full ethics and regulatory approvals in place, ready for rapid activation at the onset of the next pandemic. Hurdles to setting up a pandemic trial include planning for pandemic-level pressures on UK NHS resources and co-enrolment of patients to multiple pandemic studies, ensuring adequate geographical distribution of participating sites, maintaining long-term low-level engagement with site investigators, addressing future trial-specific training needs of local investigators and resilience planning in trial management. Identified threats to trial delivery include changes to research capabilities or policies during the hibernation phase, lack of staff resources during a pandemic and the influence of media at the time of a pandemic. A mismatch in the approach to informed consent required by current regulations to that preferred by patients and the public was identified.

Median MS, VAS\\\\symptom, and TSS\\\\6 scores of Group 3 patients during the pandemic were higher than the pre\\\\pandemic scores (p = 0.005, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively), whereas median VAS\\\\QoL scores of Group 3 during the pandemic were lower than the pre\\\\pandemic scores (p < 0.001). Median TSS\\\\6 and VAS\\\\symptom scores were the highest in Group 3 compared with other groups (p < 0.001 for each comparison). Median VAS\\\\QoL scores were the lowest in Group 3 compared with Group 1 and Group 2 (p < 0.001, p = 0.043, respectively). CONCLUSION: When precautions in allergy clinics are carefully applied, adherence to SCIT can be high during a pandemic. Patients must be encouraged to regularly adhere to SCIT injections since delays in SCIT administration can deteriorate clinical symptoms.","output":"Adherence to subcutaneous immunotherapy with aeroallergens in real\\\\life practice during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The thermodynamic consistency of linear viscoelastic models is investigated.

The consistency is found to hold if the stress functional involves the strain history, not the strain-rate history. The stress is next taken to be given by a fractional order derivative of the strain.

The recent study intends to estimate the climate change mitigation factor for a cleaner environment with the GDP of E7 countries and G7 countries from 2010 to 2018. For long-run estimation, second-generation panel data techniques including augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), Phillip-Peron technique and fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) techniques are applied to draw the long-run inference. The results of the study are robust with VECM technique. The outcomes of the study revealed that climate change mitigation indicators significantly affect the GDP of G7 countries than that of E7 countries. The GDP of both E7 and G7 countries is found depleting due to less clean environment. However, green financing techniques helps to clean the environment and reinforce the confidence of policymakers on the elevation of green economic growth in G7 and E7 countries. Furthermore, study results shown that a 1% rise in green financing index improves the environmental quality by 0.375% in G7 countries, while it purifies 0.3920% environment in E7 countries.

This study aimed to analyse the impact of COVID-19 on the spread of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in China. A mathematical model was established to fit the reported data of HFMD in six selected cities in mainland China from 2015 to 2020. The absolute difference (AD) and relative difference (RD) between the reported incidence in 2020, and simulated maximum, minimum, or median incidence of HFMD in 2015-2019 were calculated. The incidence and Reff of HFMD have decreased in six selected cities since the outbreak of COVID-19, and in the second half of 2020, the incidence and Reff of HFMD have rebounded. The results show that the total attack rate (TAR) in 2020 was lower than the maximum, minimum, and median TAR fitted in previous years in six selected cities (except Changsha city). For the maximum, median, minimum fitted TAR, the range of RD (%) is 42?20-99?20%, 36?35-98?41% 48?35-96?23% (except Changsha city) respectively.

Participants responded to daily questions regarding ruminations they engaged in and PTG they experienced that day for a total of 29 days. RESULTS As expected, there was no significant association between intrusive rumination and PTG, but a significant positive association was found between deliberate rumination and PTG. In addition, a person of color and those who reported as religious experienced higher levels of PTG. Furthermore, there was a significant between-person variability on the effect of deliberate rumination on PTG. CONCLUSIONS The current study supports previous findings between rumination and PTG.

It was suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted on attendances for reduced fetal movements. Thus, we sought to ascertain the impact of the pandemic on attendances for reduced fetal movements (RFM) in our unit, ultrasound provision for reduced fetal movements, and the stillbirth rate. METHODS: This was a single site retrospective cohort study involving all women complaining of a 1(st) episode of reduced fetal movements between 01/03/2020-30/04/2020 (COVID) to 01/03/2019-30/04/2019 (Pre-COVID). Data were retrieved from computerised hospital records and statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism and SPSS. RESULTS: 22% (179/810) of women presented with a 1(st) episode of reduced fetal movements Pre-COVID compared to 18% (145/803) during COVID (p = 0.047). Primiparous women were significantly over-represented in this population with a 1.4-fold increase in attendances during COVID (67% vs 48%, p = 0.0005). Neither the total stillbirth rate nor the stillbirth rate amongst women who presented with reduced fetal movements changed during COVID. Ultrasound provision was not impacted by COVID with 95% of the scans performed according to local guidelines, compared to Pre-COVID (74%, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant decrease in 1(st) attendances for reduced fetal movements during COVID-19 pandemic. Primiparous women were 1.4 times more likely to attend with RFM. Women should be reassured that COVID-19 has not resulted in a decreased provision of care for RFM, and has not impacted on the stillbirth rate.","output":"Impact of Covid-19 on attendances for a 1(st) episode of reduced fetal movements: A retrospective observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As prefabricated buildings play a significant role in the global fight against the new coronavirus COVID-19, they attract more global attention than other types of buildings Lean construction helps to improve the benefits of enterprises and the working environment of workers However, prefabricated buildings are encountering various challenges in implementing on-site lean construction According to a cause-and-effect relationship, it will be more meaningful to explore the critical causes hindering on-site lean construction, namely, the critical barriers Hence, this paper establishes a research methodology framework based on multimethod collaboration, including the exploratory factor analysis model regarding critical barriers, the exploratory factor evaluation model regarding organizational capabilities, and the important findings and suggestions Thirty-one critical barriers of on-site lean construction for prefabricated buildings are identified via literature analysis, field survey, and semistructured interview After pre-exploratory factor analysis, thirty critical barriers are finally retained and prioritized, and six common components are extracted and nominated A large-scale project using the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) mode is selected as a case study to evaluate its construction organizational capability to deal with the six common components The important findings indicate that the inadequate professional management capability of managers is the most critical barrier, and the construction organization from the project case is fully capable of dealing with the common components during on-site lean construction Six corresponding substantive suggestions are also proposed according to domain experts, and the most prioritized one of them is that an internal training or external recruitment is suggested to solve the inadequate professional management capability of managers The internal training should take the form of seminars and training courses that invite senior prefabricated project management experts to participate The external recruitment needs to focus on the management experience, lean skills, and leadership of managers in prefabricated projects The established methodology framework proposes a new idea for the barrier analysis and corresponding organizational capability evaluation of on-site lean construction from the perspective of the specific prefabricated construction industry rather than the entire construction industry Due to the special construction mode of prefabricated buildings, it further expands the current boundary of lean construction methodology The findings and suggestions will provide a valuable reference and guidance for the prefabricated construction industry to solve the barriers regarding on-site lean construction","output":"Cause Analysis of Hindering On-Site Lean Construction for Prefabricated Buildings and Corresponding Organizational Capability Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Urine from eight normal controls in whom an influenza-like illness developed contained high concentrations of fibrin-degradation products (F.D.P.), IgG, and C(3).

Odorant receptors (ORs) allow the detection and discrimination of a myriad of odorant molecules and therefore mediate the first step of the olfactory signaling cascade. To date, odorant (or agonist) information for the majority of these receptors is still unknown, limiting our understanding of their functional relevance in odor-induced behavioral responses. In this study, we introduce OdoriFy, a Web server featuring powerful deep neural networkCbased prediction engines. OdoriFy enables (1) identification of odorant molecules for wildtype or mutant human ORs (Odor Finder); (2) classification of user-provided chemicals as odorants/nonodorants (Odorant Predictor); (3) identification of responsive ORs for a query odorant (OR Finder); and (4) interaction validation using OdorantCOR Pair Analysis. In addition, OdoriFy provides the rationale behind every prediction it makes by leveraging explainable artificial intelligence. This module highlights the basis of the prediction of odorants/nonodorants at atomic resolution and for the ORs at amino acid levels. A key distinguishing feature of OdoriFy is that it is built on a comprehensive repertoire of manually curated information of human ORs with their known agonists and nonagonists, making it a highly interactive and resource-enriched Web server. Moreover, comparative analysis of OdoriFy predictions with an alternative structure-based ligand interaction method revealed comparable results.

We believe that education is crucial for people to make informed decisions regarding nuclear energy. With a science-technology-society (STS) approach, a seminar-style educational module on Radiation and Society was formulated at Tembusu College, National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2015. This primarily aimed to equip students with the necessary analytical tools to assess evidence and thus, evaluate existing assumptions on radiation/nuclear power/nuclear energy, the effects on mankind and societal perception of radiation. METHODS Radiation and Society was a seminar-style module which consisted of weekly 3-hour interactive sessions for 13 weeks. Throughout the semester, students were acquainted with themes and concepts related to radiation and society, such as the historical dimensions, radiation science, role in medicine, the psychology of radiation fear, existing radiation myths, complexities in radiation disaster response, communication of risks and emergency preparedness. Discussions during the sessions covered a variety of topics, including ionizing radiation as a result of nuclear fall-out, historical contextualization of nuclear fear, and uses of radiation in (bio)medicine, STS and science communication. Field visits to research reactors and cancer centers were arranged to showcase the diverse applications of nuclear radiation. Experts involved in various related spheres of influence shared their perspectives on matters such as technological developments in emergency preparedness, nuclear reactors, and societal impacts. RESULTS The interactive facilitator-student sessions helped educate young minds about nuclear radiation. A post-course survey was conducted to obtain opinions of students on their perceptions of reliability and safety of nuclear energy, effectiveness of the seminar, and where radiation ranked relative to alternative energy sources. Overall findings of the survey indicated that although nuclear energy was perceived as a safe and reliable substitute, renewable energy was considered a better option. Participants felt that, as per the learning objectives, the sessions were effective in improving awareness regarding nuclear energy. CONCLUSION This seminar-style module equipped students with the analytical tools required to critically assess sources of knowledge and social perceptions of radiation. In addition to the concluding perceptions toward nuclear energy from the post-course survey, a pre-module/course survey to reveal changes in student attitudes is planned to aid refinement of the course in future iterations. Such educational efforts will allow students to be aware of both the pros and cons of nuclear radiation and thus, construct informed opinions.","output":"Educational dialogue on public perception of nuclear radiation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent improvements in next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled clinical laboratories to increasingly pursue pathogen genomics for infectious disease diagnosis.

I begin by outlining the standard Aristotelian view of friendship, according to which there are certain necessary conditions which x must meet in order to be a friend. I explain how the current literature typically uses this Aristotelian view to object to humanCrobot friendships on theoretical and ethical grounds. Theoretically, a robot cannot be our friend because it cannot meet the requisite necessary conditions for friendship. Ethically, humanCrobot friendships are wrong because they are deceptive (the robot does not actually meet the conditions for being a friend), and could also make it more likely that we will favour perfect robots, and disrespect, exploit, or exclude other human beings. To argue against the above position, I begin by outlining and assessing current attempts to reject the theoretical argumentthat we cannot befriend robots. I argue that the current attempts are problematic, and do little to support the claim that we can be friends with robots now (rather than in some future time). I then use the standard Aristotelian view as a touchstone to develop a new degrees-of-friendship view. On my view, it is theoretically possible for humans to have some degree of friendship with social robots now.

Treatment of cells with IFN activates genes encoding several double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent synthetases. These enzymes generate 5-triphosphorylated, 2,5-phosphodiester-linked oligoadenylates (2C5A) from ATP. The effects of 2C5A in cells are transient since 2C5A is unstable in cells due to the activities of phosphodiesterase and phosphatase. 2C5A activates the endoribonuclease 2C5A-dependent RNase L, causing degradation of single-stranded RNA with moderate specificity. The human 2C5A-dependent RNase is an 83.5 kDa polypeptide that has little, if any, RNase activity, unless 2C5A is present. 2C5A binding to RNase L switches the enzyme from its off-state to its on-state. At least three 2,5-linked oligoadenylates and a single 5-phosphoryl group are required for maximal activation of the RNase. Even though the constitutive presence of 2C5A-dependent RNase is observed in nearly all mammalian cell types, cellular amounts of 2C5A-dependent mRNA and activity can increase after IFN treatment. One well-established role of the 2C5A system is as a host defense against some types of viruses. Since virus infection of cells results in the production and secretion of IFNs, and since dsRNA is both a frequent product of virus infection and an activator of 2C5A synthesis, the replication of encephalomyocarditis virus, which produces dsRNA during its life cycle, is greatly suppressed in IFN-treated cells as a direct result of RNA decay by the activated 2C5A-clependent RNase. This review covers the organic chemistry, enzymology, and molecular biology of 2C5A and its associated enzymes. Additional possible biological roles of the 2C5A system, such as in cell growth and differentiation, human immunodeficiency virus replication, heat shock, atherosclerotic plaque, pathogenesis of Type I diabetes, and apoptosis, are presented.","output":"The 2C5 A system: Modulation of viral and cellular processes through acceleration of RNA degradation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors use the COVID-19 crisis as an example to highlight two dimensions of beta instability that have been largely overlooked: First, the relative order in stock betas could change drastically when entering a crisis as the nature of market risk shifts.

In this paper, we present the use of wastewater-based epidemiology in monitoring COVID-19 infection dynamics in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa, focusing on four wastewater treatment plants for 14 weeks. The SARS-CoV-2 viral load in influent wastewater was determined using droplet digital PCR, and the number of people infected was estimated using published models as well as using a modified model to improve efficiency. On average, viral loads ranged between 0 and 2.73  105 copies/100 ml, 0-1.52  105 copies/100 ml, 3  104-7.32  105 copies/100 ml and 1.55  104-4.12  105 copies/100 ml in the four wastewater treatment plants studied. The peak in viral load corresponded to the reported COVID-19 infections within the districts where these catchments are located. In addition, we also observed that easing of lockdown restrictions by authorities corresponded with an increase in viral load in the untreated wastewater. Estimation of infection numbers based on the viral load showed that a higher number of people could potentially be infected, compared to the number of cases reported based on clinical testing.

METHOD A literature search was conducted in PubMed, the Spanish Official State Gazette and Eudralex. The websites of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism and of the Ministry of Health, as well as the relevant UNE standards were also reviewed. RESULTS The different types of face masks available on the market meet different regulatory requirements. Community masks are not considered medical devices or personal protective equipment and do not require marketing authorization. They do not carry a CE mark and need not comply with the general regulations applicable to consumer products. Surgical masks, for their part, must meet the quality criteria defined in UNE-EN standard 14683: 2019. According to Regulation (EU) 745/2017 they are class I devices, subject to an EU declaration of conformity, and must bear a CE mark. Filtering masks are considered category III personal protective equipment, regulated by Regulation (EU) 2016/425, and must also bear a CE mark.

SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND DATA: Increased firearm injuries have been reported during the early peaks of the COVID-19 pandemic despite shelter-in-place restrictions. However, these data are overwhelmingly from singlecenter studies, during the initial phase of the pandemic prior to lifting of shelter-in-place restrictions, or do not account for seasonal trends. METHODS: An interrupted time-series analysis (ITSA) of all firearm injuries presenting to 5 adult level 1 trauma centers in Northern California was performed (January 2016to February 2021). ITSA modeled the association of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020) with monthly firearm injuries using the ordinary least-squares method, included month indicators to adjust for seasonality, and specified lags of up to 12 months to account for autocorrelation. RESULTS: Prior to the start of COVID-19, firearm injuries averaged (SD) of 86 (16) and were decreasing by 0.5/month (P < 0.01). The start of COVID- 19 (March 2020) was associated with an alarming increase of 39 firearm injuries/month (P < 0.01) followed by an ongoing rise of 3.5/mo (P < 0.01). This resulted in an average of 130 (26) firearm injuries/month during the COVID-19 period and included 8 of the 10 highest monthly firearm injury rates in the past 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: These data highlight an alarming escalation in firearm injuries in the 12 months following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern California.

Multivariate mixed-effects regression models were constructed to investigate the relationship between pollution exposure, windows of susceptibility, and semen quality, while controlling for biographic and meteorologic confounders. RESULT(S): The results indicated multiple windows of susceptibility for semen quality, especially sperm motility, due to ambient pollution exposure. Exposure to particulate matters (PM(2.5) and PM(10)), O(3) and NO(2) during late stages of spermatogenesis appeared to have weak but positive association with semen quality. Exposure to CO late in sperm development appeared to have inverse relationship with sperm movement parameters. Exposure to SO(2) appeared to influence semen quality throughout spermatogenesis. CONCLUSION(S): Potential windows of susceptibility for semen quality varied depending on air pollutants. Sperm motility was sensitive to pollution exposure.

Using data from electronic medical records (EMR) allows evaluation of potential predictors without selecting specific features a priori for a model. We evaluated different machine learning models for predicting outcomes among COVID-19 inpatients using raw EMR data. Materials and Methods: In Premier Healthcare Data Special Release: COVID-19 Edition (PHD-SR COVID-19, release date March, 24 2021), we included patients admitted with COVID-19 during February 2020 through April 2021 and built time-ordered medical histories. Setting the prediction horizon at 24 hours into the first COVID-19 inpatient visit, we aimed to predict intensive care unit (ICU) admission , hyperinflammatory syndrome (HS), and death. We evaluated the following models: L2-penalized logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting classifier, deep averaging network, and recurrent neural network with a long short-term memory cell. Results: There were 57,355 COVID-19 patients identified in PHD-SR COVID-19. ICU admission was the easiest outcome to predict (best AUC=79%), and HS was the hardest to predict (best AUC=70%). Models performed similarly within each outcome. Discussion: Although the models learned to attend to meaningful clinical information, they performed similarly, suggesting performance limitations are inherent to the data. Conclusion: Predictive models using raw EMR data are promising because they can use many observations and encompass a large feature space; however, traditional and deep learning models may perform similarly when few features are available at the individual patient level.","output":"Evaluation of machine learning for predicting COVID-19 outcomes from a national electronic medical records database"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of the study is 2-fold.

Many institutions lack infrastructure to facilitate the personalized mentoring that supports students' integration of new professional identities with their personal identities and values. APPROACH: The authors developed a novel mentorship platform called Weave via a multistep, iterative design process, incorporating in-person and survey-based student and faculty feedback. Features of Weave include clear communication of mentorship offerings and expectations, plus opportunities to engage mentors based on professional and personal (identity-based) attributes. Faculty at Harvard Medical School who created a mentor profile within the first 3 months of launch and students who visited the website within the same period were invited to complete usability surveys in February 2019; students were invited to complete impact surveys in August 2020. OUTCOMES: Fifty-two of 132 invited faculty members (39.4%) and 80 of 185 students (43.2%) completed the usability surveys. Most of these faculty (86.5%) and students (73.8%) reported navigating the website was easy/very easy; 36 faculty (69.2%) created a mentor profile within 10 minutes. Key innovations highlighted by faculty and students were the listing of personal attributes and identities of diverse faculty; centralized, increased access to faculty mentors; ease of use; and provision of clear expectations. Nearly all students who completed the impact surveys agreed that Weave allowed them to connect with a faculty mentor whom they would not have found through other sources and to learn about the dimensions of diverse faculty. NEXT STEPS: Weave is a customizable online mentorship platform that fosters empowered vulnerability and increases dialogue between medical students and faculty based on professional and personal interests and identities. Weave may be expanded to other mentoring contexts and adapted for implementation at other institutions to help cultivate an institutional culture that values mentoring and to strengthen broader diversity and inclusion efforts.","output":"Development of a Novel Mentorship Platform to Foster Relational Mentoring, Empowered Vulnerability, and Professional Identity Formation in Undergraduate Medical Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Bronchiolitis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in early childhood worldwide. The presence of more than one pathogen may influence the natural history of acute bronchiolitis in infants. OBJECTIVE To investigate the relevance of dual viral infection in infants with severe bronchiolitis hospitalized in a short-term unit compared with those in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). STUDY DESIGN One hundred eighty infants <1 year old hospitalized with bronchiolitis in a short-term unit (n = 92) or admitted to the PICU (n = 88) during 2 consecutive winter seasons 2003/2004 and 2004/2005 were evaluated. Molecular biology and standard methods were used to diagnose human respiratory viruses in nasal/throat swabs and nasal aspirates. Clinical data related to host factors and viral prevalence were compared among infants requiring or not PICU support. RESULTS A viral agent was identified in 96.1% of infants with bronchiolitis. Respiratory syncytial virus (70.6% and 73.6%, respectively in the short-term unit and PICU) and rhinovirus (18.5% and 25.3%, respectively in the short-term unit and PICU) were the main detected respiratory viruses in infants hospitalized in both units. No significant difference in viral prevalence was observed between the populations studied. From multivariate analysis, infants with coinfections were 2.7 times (95% CI: 1.2-6.2) more at risk for PICU admission than those with a single infection. Respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus were the viruses most frequently identified in mixed infections in infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis.

Based on published experimental data, six homogeneous glycosylation patterns and two heterogeneous ones were used for the analysis. The glycan chains alter the accessible surface areas on the S-protein, impeding antibody-antigen recognition. In presence of glycan, epitopes on the S1 subunit, that notably contains the receptor binding domain, remain mostly accessible to antibodies while those present on the S2 subunit are predominantly inaccessible. We identify 28 B-cell epitopes in the Spike structure and group them as non-affected by the glycan cloud versus those which are strongly masked by the glycan cloud, resulting in a list of favourable epitopes as targets for vaccine development, antibody-based therapy and diagnostics.","output":"Impact of glycan cloud on the B-cell epitope prediction of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS : Balance between inflammatory and reparative leucocytes allows optimal healing after myocardial infarction (MI). Interindividual heterogeneity evokes variable functional outcome complicating targeted therapy. We aimed to characterize infarct chemokine CXC-motif receptor 4 (CXCR4) expression using positron emission tomography (PET) and establish its relationship to cardiac outcome. We tested whether image-guided early CXCR4 directed therapy attenuates chronic dysfunction. METHODS AND RESULTS : Mice (n = 180) underwent coronary ligation or sham surgery and serial PET imaging over 7 days. Infarct CXCR4 content was elevated over 3 days after MI compared with sham (%ID/g, Day 1:1.1  0.2; Day 3:0.9  0.2 vs. 0.6  0.1, P < 0.001), confirmed by flow cytometry and histopathology. Mice that died of left ventricle (LV) rupture exhibited persistent inflammation at 3 days compared with survivors (1.2  0.3 vs. 0.9  0.2% ID/g, P < 0.001). Cardiac magnetic resonance measured cardiac function. Higher CXCR4 signal at 1 and 3 days independently predicted worse functional outcome at 6 weeks (rpartial = -0.4, P = 0.04). Mice were treated with CXCR4 blocker AMD3100 following the imaging timecourse. On-peak CXCR4 blockade at 3 days lowered LV rupture incidence vs. untreated MI (8% vs. 25%), and improved contractile function at 6 weeks (+24%, P = 0.01). Off-peak CXCR4 blockade at 7 days did not improve outcome. Flow cytometry analysis revealed lower LV neutrophil and Ly6Chigh monocyte content after on-peak treatment. Patients (n = 50) early after MI underwent CXCR4 PET imaging and functional assessment. Infarct CXCR4 expression in acute MI patients correlated with contractile function at time of PET and on follow-up. CONCLUSION : Positron emission tomography imaging identifies early CXCR4 up-regulation which predicts acute rupture and chronic contractile dysfunction. Imaging-guided CXCR4 inhibition accelerates inflammatory resolution and improves outcome.

Simulated on-call programmes have been used to great effect in medicine and surgery to improve junior doctors skills in task prioritisation, interpersonal communication and confidence on-call. However, few psychiatry-specific programmes exist. We aimed to: i) Develop a psychiatry specific virtual-on-call programme, ii) Investigate if the virtual-on-call programme improved confidence amongst junior trainees in key areas of psychiatry practice. METHOD: The Psychiatry Virtual-On-Call programme commenced in December 2020. It involves attending an introductory on-call lecture, followed later in the rotation by a 2-hour simulated on-call shift. All trainees are expected to attend during their attachment and the simulated shifts are ongoing. During the shift, trainees are bleeped with different psychiatry specific tasks. They work through the tasks, using local intranet policies and telephone advice from the on-call psychiatry registrar. Due to COVID-19 the sessions were delivered virtually. Participants completed a questionnaire evaluating confidence in ten domains, rated on a Likert scale from 0C10. Questionnaires were completed at four time-points during the programme; pre- and post-introductory lecture and pre- and post-simulated shift. Scores were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests. Significance was defined as P < 0.05 with Bonferroni correction applied for multiple testing. RESULT: Twenty-nine trainees attended the introductory lecture, 25 and 21 trainees completed the pre- and post-lecture questionnaire respectively. A non-significant improvement in confidence was reported in three domains: seclusions reviews, prescribing, detention under the mental health act. At the time of writing, ten trainees had attended the on-call shift. All participants completed a pre- and post-session questionnaire. The on-call shift was a useful learning experience (median score 9), and significantly increased perceived preparedness for on-call work from 3/10 to 7/10 (p < 0.001). Confidence was significantly improved in seven domains, most markedly in seclusion reviews, prescribing and mental health act tasks. CONCLUSION: The psychiatry virtual-on-call programme fills a niche in the training curriculum and is perceived by trainees to be a useful learning experience. The introductory lecture improved confidence in several domains, but not as effectively as the on-call shift. The on-call shift was well received by participants and significantly improved confidence in 7/10 domains.

OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at developing and evaluating deep learning-based text classification models for classifying social media content posted during the COVID-19 outbreak, using the four key constructs of the HBM. We will specifically focus on content related to the physical distancing interventions put forth by public health authorities. We intend to test the model with a real-world case study. METHODS: The data set for this study was prepared by analyzing Facebook comments that were posted by the public in response to the COVID-19-related posts of three public health authorities: the Ministry of Health of Singapore (MOH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Public Health England. The comments made in the context of physical distancing were manually classified with a Yes/No flag for each of the four HBM constructs: perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, perceived barriers, and perceived benefits. Using a curated data set of 16,752 comments, gated recurrent unit-based recurrent neural network models were trained and validated for text classification. Accuracy and binary cross-entropy loss were used to evaluate the model. Specificity, sensitivity, and balanced accuracy were used to evaluate the classification results in the MOH case study. RESULTS: The HBM text classification models achieved mean accuracy rates of 0.92, 0.95, 0.91, and 0.94 for the constructs of perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers, respectively. In the case study with MOH Facebook comments, specificity was above 96% for all HBM constructs. Sensitivity was 94.3% and 90.9% for perceived severity and perceived benefits, respectively. In addition, sensitivity was 79.6% and 81.5% for perceived susceptibility and perceived barriers, respectively. The classification models were able to accurately predict trends in the prevalence of the constructs for the time period examined in the case study.

On bronchoalveolar lavage, high eosinophilia (>25 %, and preferably >40 % of differential cell count) is considered diagnostic of eosinophilic pneumonia in a compatible setting, obviating the need of video-assisted thoracic surgical lung biopsy, which is now performed only on very rare occasions with inconsistency between clinical, biological, and imaging features. Inquiry as to drug intake must be meticulous (www.pneumotox.com) and any suspected drug should be withdrawn. Laboratory investigations for parasitic causes must take into account the travel history or residence and the epidemiology of parasites. In patients with associated extrathoracic manifestations, the diagnosis of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis or of the hypereosinophilic syndromes should be raised. Presence of airflow obstruction can be found in hypereosinophilic asthma, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, idiopathic chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or in the recently identified syndrome of hyperosinophilic obliterative bronchiolitis. Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of symptomatic treatment for eosinophilic pneumonias, with a generally dramatic response. Relapses are common when tapering the doses or after stopping treatment especially in idiopathic chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. Cyclophosphamide is necessary only in patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and poor-prognostic factors.

Nanoparticle immunogens presenting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S) in repetitive arrays are being advanced as second-generation vaccine candidates, as they feature robust manufacturing characteristics and have shown promising immunogenicity in preclinical models. Here, we used previously reported deep mutational scanning (DMS) data to guide the design of stabilized variants of the RBD. The selected mutations fill a cavity in the RBD that has been identified as a linoleic acid binding pocket. Screening of several designs led to the selection of two lead candidates that expressed at higher yields than the wild-type RBD. These stabilized RBDs possess enhanced thermal stability and resistance to aggregation, particularly when incorporated into an icosahedral nanoparticle immunogen that maintained its integrity and antigenicity for 28 days at 35-40C, while corresponding immunogens displaying the wild-type RBD experienced aggregation and loss of antigenicity. The stabilized immunogens preserved the potent immunogenicity of the original nanoparticle immunogen, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase I/II clinical trial. Our findings may improve the scalability and stability of RBD-based coronavirus vaccines in any format and more generally highlight the utility of comprehensive DMS data in guiding vaccine design.","output":"Stabilization of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor-Binding Domain Using Deep Mutational Scanning and Structure-Based Design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Being highly unsaturated, n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) are prone to lipid peroxidation. In this study, zebrafish were fed with low-fat diet (LFD), high-fat diet (HFD), or 2% DHA-supplemented HFD (HFDHA2.0). To study the possible negative effects of the high level of dietary DHA, growth rates, blood chemistry, liver histology, hepatic oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammatory processes were assessed. The cell studies were used to quantify the effects of DHA and antioxidant on cellular lipid peroxidation and viability. The possible interaction between gut microbiota and zebrafish host was evaluated in vitro. HFDHA2.0 had no effect on hepatic lipid level but induced liver injury, oxidative stress, and hepatocellular apoptosis, including intrinsic and death receptor-induced apoptosis. Besides, the inclusion of 2% DHA in HFD increased the abundance of Proteobacteria in gut microbiota and serum endotoxin level. In the zebrafish liver cell model, DHA activated intrinsic apoptosis while the antioxidant 4-hydroxy-Tempo (tempo) inhibited the pro-apoptotic negative effects of DHA. The apoptosis induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was unaffected by the addition of tempo. In conclusion, the excess DHA supplementation generates hepatocellular apoptosis-related injury to the liver.

We hypothesised that sensory processing, in particular pain, differs in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic AF. METHODS Thirty individuals with permanent AF (15 symptomatic and 15 asymptomatic) completed the Atrial Fibrillation 6 (AF6) and short form 36 Health Survey questionnaires and underwent quantitative pain sensitisation testing using pressure algometry at the sternum (referred pain area) and the tibialis anterior muscle (generalised pain area). The primary objective was to assess differences in pressure pain thresholds (PPT), temporal summation of pain (TSP) and conditioned pain modulation (CPM) in the two groups. The secondary objective was to determine association of demographic and clinical parameters to measures of pain sensitisation. RESULTS The symptomatic group had lower PPTs at both tibialis (p=0.004) and sternum (p=0.01), and impaired CPM (p=0.025) and facilitated TSP (p=0.008) at the tibialis but not sternum, compared with the asymptomatic group. The AF6 sum score was negatively correlated to PPT on both tibialis (r=-0.50, p=0.005) and sternum (r=-0.42, p=0.02) and positively correlated to TSP on both tibialis (r=0.57, p=0.001) and sternum (r=0.45, p=0.01), but not to CPM.

Laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) nephrectomy is feasible to remove diseased kidneys. Most of such procedures previously reported were performed through a transperitoneal (trans-abdominal) approach. We report the feasibility, safety, and techniques of performing such operations without disturbing the bowels (a retroperitoneal LESS approach). This approach provides acceptable operative outcomes, and is especially valuable for patients who need to have an intact peritoneal envelope, or those with potentially abnormal or obliterated peritoneal space. OBJECTIVES ? To retrospectively review our experience with respect to evaluating the feasibility and safety of retroperitoneoscopic laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) nephrectomy. ? To present the technical details of such a procedure. PATIENTS AND METHODS ? In total, eight retroperitoneoscopic LESS nephrectomies (in seven patients) were completed for a variety of indications in a single centre. ? The GelPOINT apparatus (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA, USA) was used as an access platform through a flank incision (3-5 cm). ? Except for a bendable grasper and flexible vascular staplers, all instruments used were conventional straight laparoscopic instruments. ? Perioperative data were retrospectively obtained for all patients, including demographic data, operative indications, operative records, length of stay, complications, and pathological analysis. RESULTS ? All retroperitoneoscopic LESS nephrectomy procedures attempted were completed successfully without complications. No extra working port was required for any case. ? Median (range) operating time was 164 (87-198) min and median (range) estimated blood loss was 50 (10-200) cm(3) . Median (range) length of hospital stay was 2 (1-3) days. ? The median narcotic used was 34 mg of parental morphine sulphate equivalent. The median (range) visual analogue pain scale score at discharge was 2 (0-3) out of 10. ? The present single arm observation study is limited by the small patient number and the absence of a control cohort. CONCLUSIONS ? Retroperitoneoscopic LESS nephrectomy using the GelPOINT apparatus as an access platform is feasible and safe. ? It provides adequate flexibility and spacing of port placements as well as acceptable operative outcomes. ? It is especially valuable for those patients who need to maintain peritoneal integrity or those with an abnormal or obliterated peritoneal space.","output":"Feasibility and safety of retroperitoneoscopic laparoendoscopic single-site nephrectomy: technique and early outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a critical commentary on an earlier submission by Liu and Li: https://doi org/10 26434/chemrxiv 11938173 The preprint from Liu & L(https://doi org/10 26434/chemrxiv 11938173) puts forward hypotheses about a proposed role for proteins of SARS-CoV-2, the virus associated with Covid-19, in directly attacking haemoglobin in patientsa? blood Arguments for the hypotheses are based on computational methods: bioinformatics calculations searching for evidence that viral proteins share functional domains related to haem binding with human proteins, molecular modeling of viral proteins, and computational docking of these protein models with models of haem, porphyrin and haemoglobin No experimental evidence is provided to support any of the conclusions When interpreted according to accepted standards, these computational results do not hold uand do not provide support for the hypotheses The interpretation of the search for shared functional domains suffers from a fundamental error in how the significance of the results is judged;when interpreted correctly, there is no evidence for these shared functional domains Molecular modeling is carried out with tools that are easy to use but not best-in-class, and no allowance is made for uncertainty in the resulting atomic coordinates Finally, the docking results are invalidated by a catastrophic error in their interpretation: the authors choose the docking trials that have the highest energies, whereas the most stable complexes are actually the ones that have the lowest energies and are therefore least strained /div","output":"Flawed methods in a?COVID-19: Attacks the 1-Beta Chain of Hemoglobin and Captures the Porphyrin to Inhibit Human Heme Metabolisma?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has currently spread to over 100 countries, infecting over thirty million people and causing nearly one million deaths.

However, persons exist within contexts, and personality coherence emerges from persons in contexts. But persons and environments bidirectionally influence each other, with persons selecting into and modifying their contexts, which also have lasting influences on personality. Thus, environmental change should produce changes in personality. Alternatively, environmental changes may produce few changes. This paradoxical viewpoint is based on the idea that novel environments have no predefined appropriate way to behave, which allows preexisting personality systems to stay coherent (Caspi &Moffitt, 1993). We test these two perspectives by examining longitudinal consistency idiographic personality coherence using a quasi-experimental design (N = 50;total assessments = 5,093). Personality coherence was assessed up to one year before the COVID-19 pandemic and again during lockdown.

Methods: All the workers were invited to an online survey. In total, 657 workers were recruited, including 536 healthcare workers (HCWs) and 121 non-healthcare workers (nHCWs). General Health Questionnaire-12 items (GHQ-12) was used as a screening tool. Sociodemographic data, working environmental conditions, and health behaviors were also analyzed. Results: inadequate sleep, poor nutritional and social interaction habits, misuse of psychotropics, female gender, COVID-19 clinical diagnosis, and losing a relative by COVID-19 were variables associated with higher probability of GHQ-12 positive screening. Significant differences between frontline workers and the rest were not found, nor was higher the probability of psychological distress in healthcare workers compared to non-healthcare workers. After 3 months from the peak of the pandemic, 63.6% of participants screening positive in GHQ-12 reported remaining the same or worse. Limitations: Causal inferences cannot be established.

Local tumor progression-free survival (LTPFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS) at any organ, and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method from the time of ablation and compared between patients with (n = 49) and without (n = 33) prior hepatectomy. Cox regression models were used to identify LTPFS predictors. RESULTS Median overall follow-up period was 28 months (range, 4.5-132 months). Three-year actuarial LTPFS (patient level: 73% vs 34%, P < .001) was significantly higher in patients with than without prior hepatectomy, respectively. Similarly, 3-year RFS (23% vs 9.1%, P = .026) and OS (78% vs 48%, P = .003) were improved in patients with prior hepatectomy. At multivariate analysis, predictors of worse LTPFS were: no prior hepatectomy (hazard ratio [HR] 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-5.45; P = .045), minimal ablation margin < 5 mm (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.18-4.87; P = .016), and RAS-mutant tumor (HR 2.65, 95% CI 1.18-5.94; P = .019).

In order to understand the basis of the protective immune response in COVID-19, we performed a longitudinal follow-up, flow-cytometric and serological analysis of innate and adaptive immunity in 64 adults with a spectrum of clinical presentations: 28 healthy SARS-CoV-2-negative contacts of COVID-19 cases; 20 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected cases; eight patients with Mild COVID-19 disease and eight cases of Severe COVID-19 disease. Our data show that high frequency of NK cells and early and transient increase of specific IgA, IgM and, to a lower extent, IgG are associated with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. By contrast, monocyte expansion and high and persistent levels of IgA and IgG, produced relatively late in the course of the infection, characterize severe disease. Modest increase of monocytes and different kinetics of antibodies are detected in mild COVID-19. The importance of innate NK cells and the short-lived antibody response of asymptomatic individuals and patients with mild disease suggest that only severe COVID-19 may result in protective memory established by the adaptive immune response.","output":"Different Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Infection of Asymptomatic, Mild, and Severe Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 25-year-old patient underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery with an initially uneventful postoperative course.

First positive was reported on late January 2020. Mid March, with 7000 confirmed cases, nationwide lockdown was imposed. Mid May the epidemic was stabilized and government eased measures. Here we model the dynamics of the epidemic in Spain over the whole span, and study the effectiveness of control measures. The model is also applied to Italy and Germany. We propose formulas to easily estimate the size of the outbreak and the benefit of early intervention. A susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model was used to simulate the epidemic. The growth and transmission rates, doubling time, and reproductive number were estimated by least-mean-square fitting of daily cases. Time-series data were obtained from official government reports. We forecasted the epidemic curve after lockdown under different effectiveness scenarios, and nowcasted the trend by moving average sliding window. Exponential growth expressions were derived. Outbreak progression remained under the early growth dynamics. The basic reproductive number in Spain was 2.5  0.1 (95% CI 2.3C2.7), and the doubling time was 2.8  0.1 days (95% CI 2.6C3.0). Slight variations in measures effectiveness produce a large divergence in the epidemic size. The effectiveness in Spain was 68%, above control threshold (60%). During lockdown the reproductive number dropped to an average of 0.81  0.02 (95% CI 0.77C0.85). Estimated epidemic size is about 300,000 cases. A 7-days advance of measures yields a reduction to 38%. The dynamics in Spain is similar to other countries. Strong lockdown measures must be adopted if not compensated by rapid detection and isolation of patients, and even a slight relaxation would raise the reproductive number above 1. Simple calculations allow anticipating the size of the epidemic based on when measures are taken and their effectiveness. Spain acted late.

DESIGN: Antibody responses in participants treated with infliximab were compared with a reference cohort treated with vedolizumab, a gut-selective anti-integrin &#945;4?7 monoclonal antibody that is not associated with impaired vaccine responses or increased susceptibility to systemic infections. 6935 patients were recruited from 92 UK hospitals between 22 September and 23 December 2020. RESULTS: Rates of symptomatic and proven SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar between groups. Seroprevalence was lower in infliximab-treated than vedolizumab-treated patients (3.4% (161/4685) vs 6.0% (134/2250), p<0.0001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses confirmed that infliximab (vs vedolizumab; OR 0.66 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.87), p=0.0027) and immunomodulator use (OR 0.70 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.92), p=0.012) were independently associated with lower seropositivity. In patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroconversion was observed in fewer infliximab-treated than vedolizumab-treated patients (48% (39/81) vs 83% (30/36), p=0.00044) and the magnitude of anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity was lower (median 0.8 cut-off index (0.2-5.6) vs 37.0 (15.2-76.1), p<0.0001).

Methods: A total of 110 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who underwent chest CT from January 3 to February 29, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Pneumonia lesions were classified as four stages: early, progressive, peak, and absorption stages on chest CT. A computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system calculated the total lung volume (TLV), the percentage of low attenuation areas (LAA%), the volume of pneumonia, the volume of ground-glass opacities (GGO), the volume of consolidation plus the GGO/consolidation ratio. The CT score was visually assessed by radiologists. Comparisons of lung and pneumonia parameters among the four stages were performed by one-way ANOVA with post-hoc tests. The relationship between the CT score and the volume of pneumonia, and between LAA% and the volume of pneumonia in four stages was assessed by Spearman's rank correlation analysis. Results: A total of 534 chest CT scans were performed with a median interval of 4 days.

Patients 15 years and above who have survived an episode of moderate or severe COVID-19, have reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive for COVID 19 (nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal) will be included. Patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of obstructive or interstitial lung disease, lung fibrosis, lung cancers, connective tissue disorders, autoimmune conditions affecting the lungs, underlying heart disease, history of syncope and those who refuse to participate will be excluded from the study. Pulmonary function will be assessed using spirometry and diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) at 3- and 6-months interval from the time of discharge from the hospital. Additionally, a chest X-ray and CT-chest will be performed if clinically indicated after consultation with the study pulmonologist or Infectious Disease (ID) physician.

The COVID-STAR qualitative study demonstrated a perceived negative impact of COVID-19 on numerous aspects of surgical training across all specialties and training grades. The aim of this study is to investigate how COVID-19 has affected operative case exposure and work-based assessments for surgeons in training. METHODS: Anonymized data has been sought from the Intercollegiate Surgical Curriculum Programme (ISCP) database for operations and work-based assessments in each specialty, involving surgical trainees on an approved training programme at defined Pre-COVID (16/03/19 C 11/05/19) and COVID (16/03/2020 C 11/05/20) timepoints. Primary outcome measures are the percentage (%) difference in WBA and operative activity between time points respectively. Differences in training activity between time periods will be tested using Pearson 2 and KruskalCWallis tests for categorical and continuous variables respectively. RESULTS: This study has been approved by the ISCP Data Analysis, Audit and Research Group, and data will be managed in accordance with ISCP data governance.

The Korean government entrusted large-scale hospitals with the operation of living and treatment support centers (LTSCs) for the management for clinically healthy COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to introduce our experience implementing information and communications technology (ICT)-based remote patient management systems at a COVID-19 LTSC. METHODS: We adopted new electronic health record templates, hospital information system (HIS) dashboards, cloud-based medical image sharing, a mobile app, and smart vital sign monitoring devices. RESULTS: Enhancements were made to the HIS to assist in the workflow and care of patients in the LTSC. A dashboard was created for the medical staff to view the vital signs and symptoms of all patients. Patients used a mobile app to consult with their physician or nurse, answer questionnaires, and input self-measured vital signs; the results were uploaded to the hospital information system in real time. Cloud-based image sharing enabled interoperability between medical institutions. Korea's strategy of aggressive mitigation has \\"flattened the curve\\" of the rate of infection. A multidisciplinary approach was integral to develop systems supporting patient care and management at the living and treatment support center as quickly as possible. CONCLUSIONS: Faced with a novel infectious disease, we describe the implementation and experience of applying an ICT-based patient management system in the LTSC affiliated with Seoul National University Hospital.

These extreme measures are associated with extraordinary economic costs. Objective: To compare the cost-effectiveness of global isolation of the whole population to focused isolation of individuals at high risk of being exposed, augmented by thorough PCR testing. Design: We applied a modified Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Removed (SEIR) model to compare two different strategies in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 spread. Data sources and target population: We modeled the dynamics in Israel, a small country with ~ 9 million people. Time horizon: 200 days. Interventions: 1. Global isolation of the whole population (strategy 1) 2. Focused isolation of people at high risk of exposure with extensive PCR testing (strategy 2). Outcome measures: Number of deaths and the cost per one avoided death in strategy 1 vs 2. Results of Base-Case analysis: The number of expected deaths is 389 in strategy 1 versus 432 in strategy 2. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in case of adhering to global isolation will be $ 102,383,282 to prevent one case of death. Results of sensitivity analysis: The ICER value is between $ 22.5 million to over $280 million per one avoided death. Conclusions: According to our model, global isolation will save ~43 more lives compared to a strategy of focused isolation and extensive screening. This benefit is implicated in tremendous costs that might result in overwhelming economic effects. Limitations: Compartment models do not necessarily fit to countries with heterogeneous populations.

The United Kingdom remains one of the hardest hit countries from the pandemic. In January 2021 parliament announced that the UK will be entering a full national lockdown. This paper explores what effect lockdown measures had on rates of deliberate self-harm presentations to one NHS trust in Manchester UK. Methods: This paper compared the number of cases of deliberate self-harm which presented to the emergency department of Manchester Royal Infirmary for March-May in 2018, 2019 and 2020. This was achieved by utilising coding from emergency department data and reviewing hospital records surrounding each case. Results: 2018 recorded a total of 101 admissions as a result of DSH with all causes admissions of 8,514 making the proportions of admissions due to self-harm 1.19%. In 2019, 9,038 patients were admitted, of these, 130 (1.44%) were identified as DSH. In 2020 the total number of admissions fell to 5,676 with 118 admitted due to self-harm, representing 2.08% of admissions. The absolute number of admissions remained stable however the proportion of admissions due to self-harm was significantly higher in 2020 (p < 0.001). Other significant findings include a higher proportion of male admissions compared to females in 2020 (58.5%) and a decrease in the normal of cases relating to paracetamol overdose in 2020. Discussion: The findings demonstrated by this study do not indicate that lockdown is an absolute risk for DSH behaviours however it does illustrate the stable nature of these cases despite and dramatic decline in all cause admissions. The rate of increase of deliberate self-harm accelerated significantly between March and May in 2020. Steps must be taken to avoid a similar situation following the 2021 lockdown and beyond C focus on improving access to certain virtual services may help to achieve this goal.","output":"Covid-19, Lockdown and Self-Isolation: Evaluation of Deliberate Self-Harm Admissions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated vulnerabilities, social inequalities, especially in rural areas concerning certain groups.

Nevertheless, the development and distribution of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains in pathogenic bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella Typhi and Citrobacter koseri, has become a major society health hazard. Essential oils could serve as a promising tool as a natural drug in fighting the problem with these bacteria. The current study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial effectiveness of tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia (Maiden and Betche) Cheel), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.), eucalyptus (Eucalyptus obliqua LHr.), and lavender (Lavandula angustifolia Mill) essential oils. The antimicrobial properties of essential oils were screened against four pathogenic bacteria, E. coli, S. aureus, S. Tyhpi, and C. koseri, and two reference bacterial strains, while for the testing, the agar well diffusion method was used. Gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatographyCmass spectrometric (GCCMSD) analyses were performed on essential oils. The obtained results showed that M. alternifolia essential oil is the richest in terpinen-4-ol, R. officinalis and E. oblique essential oils in 1,8-cineole, and L. angustifolia essential oil in -terpinyl acetate. In addition, the main bioactive compounds present in the essential oil of tea tree are rich in -pinene (18.38%), limonene (7.55%) and -terpinene (14.01%). The essential oil of rosemary is rich in -pinene (8.38%) and limonene (11.86%); eucalyptus essential oil has significant concentrations of -pinene (12.60%), p-cymene (3.24%), limonene (3.87%), and -terpinene (7.37%), while the essential oil of lavender is rich in linalool (10.71%), linalool acetate (9.60%), -terpinyl acetate (10.93%), and carbitol (13.05%) bioactive compounds, respectively. The obtained results from the in vitro study revealed that most of the essential oils exhibited antimicrobial properties. Among the tested essential oils, tea tree was discovered to demonstrate the strongest antimicrobial activity. The recorded MIC of S. Typhi was 6.2 mg/mL, 3.4 mg/mL of C. koseri, 3.1 mg/mL of E. coli, and 2.7 mg/mL of E. coli ATCC 25922, compared to M. alternifolia. Similarly, only S. aureus ATCC 25923 showed antimicrobial activity towards R. officinalis (1.4 mg/mL), E. oblique (2.9 mg/mL), and L. angustifolia (2.1 mg/mL).

The second method, termed the two-step strategy, adopts the gradualist approach initially, but then, after a certain time, the SDI is stepped to its maximum value, which implies the immediate removal of all restrictions. It is found that, while vaccination-generated immunity makes a very valuable contribution to overall immunity, the other componentsprior T-cell immunity and immunity generated by infectionare just as important. Infection-generated immunity needs to be the largest component if all restrictions are to be removed, under both strategies.

In the literature hepatic alterations have been described in COVID-19 patients, and they are mainly represented by worsening of underlying chronic liver disease leading to hepatic decompensation and liver failure with higher mortality. Several potential mechanisms used by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to cause liver damage have been hypothesized. COVID-19 primary liver injury is less common than secondary liver injury. Most of the available data demonstrate how liver damage in SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely due to systemic inflammation, and it is less likely mediated by a cytopathic effect directed on liver cells. Moreover, liver alterations could be caused by hypoxic injury and drugs (antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, remdesivir, tocilizumab, tofacitinib and dexamethasone). SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce multiple vascular district atherothrombosis by affecting simultaneously cerebral, coronary and peripheral vascular beds. Data in the literature highlight how the virus triggers an exaggerated immune response, which added to the cytopathic effect of the virus can induce endothelial damage and a prothrombotic dysregulation of hemostasis. This leads to a higher incidence of symptomatic and confirmed venous thrombosis and of pulmonary embolisms, especially in central, lobar or segmental pulmonary arteries, in COVID-19. There are currently fewer data for arterial thrombosis, while myocardial injury was identified in 7%-17% of patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 22%-31% in the intensive care unit setting. Available data also revealed a higher occurrence of stroke and more serious forms of peripheral arterial disease in COVID-19 patients. Hemostasis dysregulation is observed during the COVID-19 course. Lower platelet count, mildly increased prothrombin time and increased D-dimer are typical laboratory features of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, described as COVID-19 associated coagulopathy. These alterations are correlated to poor outcomes. Moreover, patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection are characterized by high levels of von Willebrand factor with subsequent ADAMTS13 deficiency and impaired fibrinolysis. Platelet hyperreactivity, hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis during SARS-CoV-2 infection induce a pathological state named as immuno-thromboinflammation. Finally, liver dysfunction and coagulopathy are often observed at the same time in patients with COVID-19. The hypothesis that liver dysfunction could be mediated by microvascular thrombosis has been supported by post-mortem findings and extensive vascular portal and sinusoidal thrombosis observation. Other evidence has shown a correlation between coagulation and liver damage in COVID-19, underlined by the transaminase association with coagulopathy, identified through laboratory markers such as prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, fibrinogen, D-dimer, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products and platelet count. Other possible mechanisms like immunogenesis of COVID-19 damage or massive pericyte activation with consequent vessel wall fibrosis have been suggested.","output":"Impaired coagulation, liver dysfunction and COVID-19: Discovering an intriguing relationship"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this preliminary study, we investigate the case of COVID\\\\19 United States confirmed cases datasets, and perform experiments with aggregations of data by county, state, and different taxonomies for U.S. regions.

BACKGROUND ALI is both life and limb threatening disease with a reported 9-15% mortality and 15-25% limb loss in the first month after presentation. Pitfalls of current endovascular techniques include major bleeding, distal embolism, and prolonged thrombolytic infusion. IPMT isolates the thrombus between two balloons and utilizes wire oscillation to increase the thombus-lytic exposure surface area followed by aspiration. It decreases systemic lytic exposure, procedure time, and distal embolism. METHODS Technical aspects, success, and bleeding complications in 24 consecutive patients with ALI treated with IPMT between October 2009 and September 2010 were analyzed. In-hospital and 30-day mortality, amputation rates and treatment success rates were determined. RESULTS 24 patients constituted 32 arteries; 18 (56.25%) were suprainguinal including 3 grafts (9.4%) and 14 (43.75%) were infrainguinal native arteries. Substantial or complete response was seen in >90% vessels with 87.5% patients revealing TIMI three flow while none demonstrated TIMI 2 or 3 pretreatment. Only three patients required adjunctive post-IPMT thrombolysis. In-hospital and 30-day all cause mortality was 4.16%. One patient died in-hospital and no patient underwent amputation. CONCLUSION Besides being the largest series of ALI patients treated with IPMT, this is the first and largest series including 14 native infrainguinal arteries. These results suggest IPMT to be a promising and safer therapeutic option in ALI, likely due to its site-specific nature and limited thrombolysis exposure time.","output":"Percutaneous isolated pharmaco-mechanical thrombolysis-thrombectomy system for the management of acute arterial limb ischemia: 30-day results from a single-center experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mathematical models have become central to the public and policy debate about the recent COVID-19 pandemic.

Specifically, it discusses the complexity, validation, and communication of models informing the government decisions in the UK, US and Austria, and concludes that, although these models are useful in many ways, they currently lack a thorough validation and a clear communication of their uncertainties. Therefore, prediction claims of these models should be taken cautiously, and their merits on scenario analysis should be the basis for decision-making.

Coronaviruses have produced two pandemics and one epidemic in the last two decades. The current pandemic has created a worldwide catastrophe threatening the lives of over 15 million as of July 2020. Current research efforts have been focused on producing a vaccine or repurposing current drug compounds to develop a therapeutic. There is, however, a need to study the active site preferences of relevant targets, such as the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro), to determine ways to optimize these drug compounds. The ensemble docking and characterization work described in this article demonstrates the multifaceted features of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site, molecular guidelines to improving binding affinity, and ultimately the optimization of drug candidates. A total of 220 compounds were docked into both the 5R7Z and 6LU7 SARS-CoV-2 Mpro crystal structures. Several key preferences for strong binding to the four subsites (S1, S1', S2, and S4) were identified, such as accessing hydrogen binding hotspots, hydrophobic patches, and utilization of primarily aliphatic instead of aromatic substituents. After optimization efforts using the design guidelines developed from the molecular docking studies, the average docking score of the parent compounds was improved by 6.59 -log10(Kd) in binding affinity which represents an increase of greater than six orders of magnitude. Using the optimization guidelines, the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor cinanserin was optimized resulting in an increase in binding affinity of 4.59 -log10(Kd) and increased protease inhibitor bioactivity. The results of molecular dynamic (MD) simulation of cinanserin-optimized compounds CM02, CM06, and CM07 revealed that CM02 and CM06 fit well into the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro [Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession number 6LU7] and formed strong and stable interactions with the key residues, Ser-144, His-163, and Glu-166. The enhanced binding affinity produced demonstrates the utility of the design guidelines described.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis on Connecticut nursing home (n = 215) COVID-19 report, linked to other nursing home files and county counts of confirmed cases and deaths. Multivariable two-part models determined the associations of key nursing home characteristics with the likelihood of at least one confirmed case (or death) in the facility, and with the count of cases (deaths) among facilities with at least one confirmed case (death). SETTING: All Connecticut nursing homes (n = 215). PARTICIPANTS: None. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS: Numbers of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths among residents. RESULTS: The average number of confirmed cases was eight per nursing home (zero in 107 facilities), and the average number of confirmed deaths was 1.7 per nursing home (zero in 131 facilities). Among facilities with at least one confirmed case, every 20-minute increase in RN staffing (per resident day) was associated with 22% fewer confirmed cases (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = .78; 95% confidence interval [CI] = .68-.89; P < .001); compared with one- to three-star facilities, four- or five-star facilities had 13% fewer confirmed cases (IRR = .87; 95% CI = .78-.97; P < .015), and facilities with high concentration of Medicaid residents (IRR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.02-1.32; P = .025) or racial/ethnic minority residents (IRR = 1.15; 95% CI = 1.03-1.29; P = .026) had 16% and 15% more confirmed cases, respectively, than their counterparts.

By March 10th, 2020, the Italian Government has ordered a national lockdown to limit viral transmission of COVID-19 infection, which establishes home confinement, movement restriction, home (smart) working, and temporary closure of non-essential businesses and schools of every order and degree. The current study investigated how these restrictive measures impacted sleep quality, timing, and psychological difficulties in school-age children and their mothers during the lockdown.Methods. Using an online survey, 299 mothers reported their sleep habits (timing, quality, quantity), time experience, and psychological difficulties (emotional and behavioral) and of those of their children (6-10 yrs old) during the home confinement and, retrospectively, before the lockdown. Results. During the lockdown, children showed a marked delay in sleep timing, i.e., later bedtime and wake time, and a mild worsening in sleep quality. They were less prone to respect the daily routines and to keep track of the passage of time. We also observe increased emotional, conduct, and hyperactive symptoms, and the increase in these psychological difficulties was predicted by the change in sleep quality, boredom, and mothers psychological difficulties. Also, mothers showed a delayed sleep timing and worsening of sleep quality during the lockdown, which degree varied depending on their working conditions. Mothers who kept working regularly outside their home during the lockdown reported a more regular sleep pattern, whereas mothers who stopped working showed more emotional symptoms and relevant changes in their time perception. Conclusions. Overall, given the evidence of the adverse behavioral and psychological impact of home confinement and social restrictions, effective measures are needed to be in place to mitigate their long-term effects on children and their mothers, especially those in the smart working condition.","output":"Sleep quality, timing, and psychological difficulties in Italian school-age children and their mothers during COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to employ the existing theory on crisis management and corporate branding in a service context to explore how tourism businesses in Thailand can recover from the crisis caused by the impact of COVID-19.

Adolescence is a critical developmental stage for inhibitory control and working memory, and it is also a stage when individuals are most likely to initiate alcohol use. This study aimed to examine whether inhibitory control and working memory would predict alcohol use and involvement in a group of UK adolescents. METHODS: We recruited 220 (N = 178, female) adolescents, aged between 16 and 18, from eight higher education settings in the Merseyside region of the UK. Alcohol use was examined using the Timeline Follow-Back and involvement (and related problems) using the Adolescent Alcohol Involvement Scale. A reward-based inhibitory control task (Go/No-Go) was used to examine the inhibition and reward sensitivity, and a self-ordered pointing task was used to measure working memory. RESULTS: Multiple regression demonstrated that neither inhibitory control (b = 0.02 (95% confidence interval (CI): ?0.21, 0.24)) nor working memory (b = ?0.12 (95% CI: ?0.30, 0.07)) were significant predictors of alcohol use (units consumed).

As no active surveys had been undertaken since the initiation of the DOTS control program across all of NHAR. METHODS: A retrospective study was undertaken of all clinical records of TB patients registered from January 2005 to September 2009. Poisson regression was performed to investigate the change in incidence over time and accounted for age, sex and county. Length of time on treatment, disease severity and patient delay were assessed by county. RESULTS: More than 30% of patients had been on treatment for over 12 months and 10% for over 3 years, reflecting drug-resistance or failure of DOTS. More than 93% of patients had grade III disease at time of diagnosis and >15% of patients had severe disease grade IV-V in some NHAR counties. Further, 8.8% of patients were not diagnosed for over 6 months from the onset of symptoms; this was as high as 20% in some counties. The reported incidence of TB is most likely grossly underestimated and the data indicate TB is a major public health concern in NHAR.

Once admitted, LTOT patients were more likely to require intensive care (RR 3.65, 95% CI 3.10 to 4.29), mechanical ventilation (RR 3.47, 95% CI 2.89 to 4.15) and vasopressor support (RR 5.28, 95% CI 3.70 to 7.53) and die within 30 days (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.67 to 2.30). The LTOT group also showed increased risk (RRs from 2.06 to 3.98, all significant to 95% CI) of more-severe infection (eg, cough, dyspnoea, fever, hypoxaemia, thrombocytopaenia and acute respiratory distress syndrome). Statistically significant differences in several laboratory results and other vital signs appeared clinically negligible. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients on LTOT were at higher risk of increased morbidity, mortality and healthcare utilisation. Interventions to reduce the need for LTOT and to increase compliance with COVID-19 protective measures may improve outcomes and reduce healthcare cost in this population. Prospective studies need to confirm and refine these findings.","output":"COVID-19 outcomes among adult patients treated with long-term opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain in the USA: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious, respiratory disease caused by the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Given that inflammatory immune cells may induce severe lung injury, the involvement of immunological factors in the pathogenesis of the disease cannot be overestimated. It has been demonstrated that coronaviruses have developed mechanisms of immune evasion, making themselves invisible to the immune system at an early stage of infection. The mechanism relies on inhibiting the antiviral response of type I interferons, which enhances uncontrolled viral replication in epithelial cells. There has been a growing body of evidence showing that fatal hyperinflammation (cytokine storm) responsible for the severe course of COVID-19 is a consequence of massive SARS-CoV-2 replication rather than inappropriate hyperresponsiveness of the immune system. Therefore, the suppressed antiviral innate immune response seems to be the primary cause of the delayed critical cascade of uncontrolled immune events leading to fulminant systemic inflammation. The occurrence of virus transmission even in asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 clearly strengthens the evidence for the key role played by the sufficient immune control of viral replication in a subset of cases (eg, in children, a population with a highly effective innate immune response). Although administration of immunomodulatory drugs is recommended under certain conditions by the guidelines for COVID-19 management, controversies regarding treatment protocols in immunocompromised patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 still exist. Extending clinicians' knowledge on the dysregulated immune response, which is a driver of the COVID-19 outcome, may improve both therapeutic strategies and the prognosis of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Dysregulation of the immune system as a driver of the critical course of novel coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

How interpersonal competence develops during undergraduate medical education is thus a key issue. Literature on the topic consists predominantly of studies on empathy showing a trend of decline over the course of medical school. However, most existing studies have focused on narrow measures of empathy. The first aim of this project is to study medical students interpersonal competence with a comprehensive framework of empathy that includes self-reported cognitive and affective empathy, performance-based assessments of emotion recognition accuracy, and a behavioural dimension of empathy. The second aim of the present project is to investigate the evolution of mental health during medical school and its putative link to the studied components of interpersonal competence. Indeed, studies documented a high prevalence of mental health issues among medical students that could potentially impact their interpersonal competence. Finally, this project will enable to test the impact of mental health and interpersonal competence on clinical skills as evaluated by experts and simulated patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This project consists of an observational longitudinal study with an open cohort design. Each year during the four consecutive years of the project, every medical student (curriculum years 1C6) of the University of Lausanne in Switzerland will be asked to complete an online questionnaire including several interpersonal competence and mental health measures. Clinical skills assessments from examinations and training courses with simulated patients will also be included. Linear mixed models will be used to explore the longitudinal evolutions of the studied components of interpersonal competence and mental health as well as their reciprocal relationship and their link to clinical skills. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The project has received ethical approval from the competent authorities. Findings will be disseminated through internal, regional, national and international conferences, news and peer-reviewed journals.","output":"Study protocol for the ETMED-L project: longitudinal study of mental health and interpersonal competence of medical students in a Swiss university using a comprehensive framework of empathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Historically, pandemics have produced higher rates of infection and mortality among the most disadvantaged communities.

SETTING: England. DESIGN: Following the riskCbenefit analysis methodology carried out by the US Centers for Disease Control, we calculated historical rates of hospital admission, Intensive Care Unit admission and death for ascertained SARS-CoV-2 cases in children aged 12C17 in England. We then used these rates alongside a range of estimates for incidence of long COVID, vaccine efficacy and vaccine-induced myocarditis, to estimate hospital and Intensive Care Unit admissions, deaths and cases of long COVID over a period of 16 weeks under assumptions of high and low case incidence. PARTICIPANTS: All 12C17 year olds with a record of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in England between 1 July 2020 and 31 March 2021 using national linked electronic health records, accessed through the British Heart Foundation Data Science Centre. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospitalisations, Intensive Care Unit admissions, deaths and cases of long COVID averted by vaccinating all 12C17 year olds in England over a 16-week period under different estimates of future case incidence. RESULTS: At high future case incidence of 1000/100,000 population/week over 16 weeks, vaccination could avert 4430 hospital admissions and 36 deaths over 16 weeks. At the low incidence of 50/100,000/week, vaccination could avert 70 hospital admissions and two deaths over 16 weeks. The benefit of vaccination in terms of hospitalisations in adolescents outweighs risks unless case rates are sustainably very low (below 30/100,000 teenagers/week). Benefit of vaccination exists at any case rate for the outcomes of death and long COVID, since neither have been associated with vaccination to date. CONCLUSIONS: Given the current (as at 15 September 2021) high case rates (680/100,000 population/week in 10C19 year olds) in England, our findings support vaccination of adolescents against SARS-CoV2.","output":"Vaccinating adolescents against SARS-CoV-2 in England: a riskCbenefit analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the United States, underserved communities including Blacks and Latinx are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. This study sought to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, describe attitudes related to vaccination, and identify correlates among historically marginalized populations across 9 counties in North Carolina. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey distributed at free COVID-19 testing events in underserved rural and urban communities from August 27 CDecember 15, 2020. Vaccine hesitancy was defined as the response of no or dont know/not sure to whether the participant would get the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it became available. RESULTS: The sample comprised 948 participants including 27.7% Whites, 59.6% Blacks, 12.7% Latinx, and 63% female. 32% earned <$20K annually, 60% owned a computer and ~80% had internet access at home. The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was 68.9% including 62.7%, 74%, and 59.5% among Whites, Blacks, and Latinx, respectively. Between September and December, the largest decline in vaccine hesitancy occurred among Whites (27.5 percentage points), followed by Latinx (17.6) and only 12.0 points among Blacks. 51.2% of respondents reported vaccine safety concerns, 23.7% wanted others to get vaccinated first, and 63.1% would trust health care providers about the COVID-19 vaccine.

This is the first time a malaria vaccination programme has been implemented in any country. This paper describes the challenges faced, and lessons learned, during the planning and early implementation of the RTS,S/AS01(E) vaccine in three out of the six regions that implemented the programme in Ghana. METHODS: Twenty-one in-depth interviews were conducted with regional and district health service managers and frontline health workers three months after the start of MVIP in May 2019. Data were coded using NVivo software version 12 and a coding framework was developed to support thematic analysis to identify the challenges and lessons learned during the RTS,S/AS01(E) implementation pilot, which were also categorized into the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). RESULTS: Participants reported challenges related to the characteristics of the intervention, such as issues with the vaccine schedule and eligibility criteria, and challenges related to how it was implemented as a pilot programme. Additionally, major challenges were faced due to the spread of rumours leading to vaccine refusals; thus, the outer setting of the CFIR was adapted to accommodate rumours within the community context. Health service managers and frontline health workers also experienced challenges with the process of implementing RTS,S/AS01(E), including inadequate sensitization and training, as well as issues with the timeline. They also experienced challenges associated with the features of the systems within which the vaccine was being implemented, including inadequate resources for cold-chain at the health facility level and transportation at the district and health facility levels. This study identified the need for a longer, more intensive and sustained delivery of contextually-appropriate sensitization prior to implementation of a programme such as MVIP.

Measuring and understanding the drivers and impacts of this financial health hardship is an economic and public health priority, particularly in the time of COVID-19. This is the first study that measures the financial hardship and determines associated factors in Afghanistan. METHODS: Afghanistan Living Conditions Survey data for 2016C2017 was used for this study. We calculated incidence and intensity of catastrophic health expenditure by using different thresholds ranging from 5 to 40% of total and nonfood consumption and subsequent impoverishment due to OOPs. Logistic regression was used to assess the degree to which Afghan households are protected from the catastrophic household expenditure. RESULTS: Results revealed that 32% of the population in Afghanistan incurred catastrophic health expenditure (as 10% of total consumption) and when healthcare payments are netted out of household consumption, the Afghan population live in extreme poverty ($1.9 in 2011 PPP), increased from 29 to 36%. Based on our findings from logistic regression in Afghanistan, having an educated head or being employed are protective factors from financial hardship while having a female head, an elderly member, a disabled, or a sick member are the risk factors of facing catastrophic health expenditure. Moreover, the people living in rural/nomadic areas or facing an economic shock are more likely to face catastrophic health expenditure and hence to be impoverished due to direct OOPs on health. CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of poverty and catastrophic health expenditure in Afghanistan emphasizes the need to strengthen the health financing system. Although Afghanistan has made great efforts to support households against health expenditure burden during the pandemic, households are at higher risk of poverty and financial hardship due to OOPs. Therefore, there is need for more financial and supportive response policies by providing a better and easier access to primary health services, extending to all entitlement to health services particularly in the public sector, eliminating user fees for COVID-19 health services and suspending fees for other essential health services, expanding coverage of income support, and strengthening the overall health financing system.","output":"Measurement and determinants of financial protection in health in Afghanistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the world facing the new virus SARS-CoV-2, many countries have introduced instant Internet applications to identify people carrying the infection.

During May and June, the gradual lift of the stringent measures resulted in the recovery of these reductions with pollution concentrations approaching the levels before the lockdown by the end of June 2020. In the second part, this work examines the alleged correlations between the reported cases of COVID-19 and temperature, humidity and particulate matter for March and April 2020 in Europe. It was found that decreasing temperatures and relative humidity with increasing concentrations of particulate matter are correlated with an increase in the number of reported cases during these 2 months. However, when these calculations were repeated for May and June, we found a remarkable drop in the significance of the correlations which leads us to question the generally accepted inverse relation between pandemics and air temperature at least during the warmer months. Such a relationship could not be supported in our study for SARS-CoV-2 virus and the question remains open. In the third and last part of this work, we examine the question referring to the origin of pandemics. In this context we have examined the hypothesis that the observed climate warming in Siberia and the Arctic and the thawing of permafrost could result to the release of trapped in the permafrost pathogens in the atmosphere.

Specifically, viral models of chronic demyelination and axonal damage have been used to study the contribution of viruses in human MS, and they have led to important breakthroughs in our understanding of MS pathology. The Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) model is one of the most commonly used MS models, although other viral models are also used, including neurotropic strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) that induce chronic inflammatory demyelination with similar histological features to those observed in MS.

METHODS We included 37,379 Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries aged 65 years diagnosed with COVID-19 from April 1, 2020 through February 28, 2021 and AIS hospitalization from January 1, 2019 through February 28, 2021. We used a self-controlled case series design to examine the association between COVID-19 and AIS and estimated the incident rate ratios (IRR) by comparing incidence of AIS in risk periods (0-3, 4-7, 8-14, 15-28 days after diagnosis of COVID-19) vs. control periods. RESULTS Among 37,379 Medicare FFS beneficiaries with COVID-19 and AIS, the median age at diagnosis of COVID-19 was 80.4 (interquartile range 73.5-87.1) years and 56.7% were women. When AIS at day of exposure (day=0) included in the risk periods, IRRs at 0-3, 4-7, 8-14, and 15-28 days following COVID-19 diagnosis were 10.3 (95% confidence interval 9.86-10.8), 1.61 (1.44-1.80), 1.44 (1.32-1.57), and 1.09 (1.02-1.18); when AIS at day 0 excluded in the risk periods, the corresponding IRRs were 1.77 (1.57-2.01) (day 1-3), 1.60 (1.43-1.79), 1.43 (1.31-1.56), and 1.09 (1.01-1.17), respectively.

The sex, age, and cardiometabolic comorbidities have been considered risk factors for disease severity. To evaluate the association between risk factors with death as well the risk of death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: The present cross-sectional cohort study, includes hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases. Data analysis was performed using the National COVID-19 Cases Report Database. Pearson's c2 test and odds ratios (95% CI) were calculated to determine the association between variables. Thereafter, risk of death was evaluated by Cox proportional hazards model. Results: A total of 67 328 inpatients were included;mean age 55.29 years (15.97). Of total, 42 164 (62.62%) were men, 6 349 (9.43%) were intubated, and 23 873 (35.46%) died. Male sex, age older than 60 years, and cardiometabolic comorbidities were associated with death. Hazard ratio for death in older intubated patients was lower than in non-intubated (HR 1.242, 95%CI, 1.167e1.322;P &lt;0.001) and (HR 2.128, 95%CI, 2.066e2.193;P &lt;0.001) respectively. Conclusions: Tracheal intubation or not is the most important predictor for death in COVID-19 infected patients in this Mexican cohort.

Common responses to the pandemic have called for social distancing and national lockdowns. There is little evidence as to how public perception surrounding exposure to the virus may impact patient care. Here, we present a case of a patient who deferred medical treatment due to concerns regarding exposure to the virus. CASE REPORT: A 99-year-old female who presented to an emergency department of a community hospital on Long Island, New York, during the COVID-19 pandemic complaining of right ankle pain after a fall three 3 weeks ago. Fear of contracting COVID-19, led to initial avoidance of medical evaluation. On presentation, the patient presented with a Gustillo-Anderson Grade III A, bimalleolar ankle fracture with associated gangrene. After evaluation and a thorough discussion with the patient and her family, the patient underwent guillotine amputation. CONCLUSION: Public perception surrounding COVID-19 has created a sense of fear that can impact patient behaviors, such as prevent them from seeking medical care when necessary. As physicians, we need to make patients feel safe and increase availability to patient care during this time to prevent similar issues as demonstrated in this case.","output":"Delay in Treatment of a Bimalleolar Ankle Fracture during Coronavirus Disease-19 COVID-19 Pandemic Leading to Amputation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a huge challenge for gastric cancer chemotherapy. Therefore, MDR accurate monitoring is of great significance for the treatment of gastric cancer. GMBP1, an extracellular internalization peptide, can target MDR gastric cancer cells through specific binding to GRP78, which is an MDR-related protein that is overexpressed in gastric cancer cells. Herein, we constructed GMBP1 conjugated Mn3O4 nanoplates (Mn3O4@PEG-GMBP1 NPs) for in vivo monitoring of MDR gastric cancer through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The generated Mn3O4@PEG-GMBP1 NPs had a size of about 11 nm and exhibited a good colloidal stability in PBS and in 10% FBS medium. Serial in vivo MRI studies in mice demonstrated that the magnetic resonance signal intensity, at the tumor site, reached a peak at 3 h after tail vein injection of Mn3O4@PEG-GMBP1 NPs. The specific targeting ability of MDR gastric cancer cells (SGC7901/ADR) by Mn3O4@PEG-GMBP1 NPs was authenticated in vitro, in vivo and by immunofluorescence analysis experiments. The systematic safety evaluation indicated that the toxicity of Mn3O4@PEG-GMBP1 NPs in mice was negligible.

BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus epidemic continues to spread at a fast rate worldwide. The main protease (Mpro) is a gorgeous target for anti-COVID-19 agents. Triazoles are frequently found in many bioactive products such as coronavirus inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: Click reactions are facilitated via the activation of copper nanoparticles, different substrates have been tested using this adopted procedure given in all cases, in high yields and purity. Other interesting comparative docking analyzes will be the focus of this article. Calculations of quantitative structure-activity relationships will be studied. METHOD: Copper nanoparticles were produced by the reaction of cupric acetate monohydrate with oleylamine and oleic acid. To a solution 5-(azidomethyl)-2,2,7,7-tetramethyltetrahydro-5H-bis([1,3]dioxolo)[4,5-b:4',5'-d]pyran 2 (200 mg, 0.72 mmol, 1 eq.) in toluene (15 mL) was added (1.5 eq.) of N-(prop-2-yn-1-yl)benzamide derivatives 1a-d, copper nanoparticles (0.57 mg, 0.036 mmol, 0.05 eq.). RESULT: A novel series of 1,2,3-triazole carbohydrate skeletons were modeled and efficiently synthesized. Based on the observations of virtual screening established using molecular docking performed to identify novel compounds that can be able to bind with the protein structures of COVID-19 (PDB ID: 6LU7 and 6W41), we believed that the 1,2,3-triazole carbohydrate derivatives could aid in COVID-19 drug discovery. CONCLUSION: The formations of targeted triazoles were confirmed by different spectroscopic techniques (FT-IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and CHN analysis). The docking scores of the newly synthesized triazole are maybe attributed to the presence of hydrogen bonds together with many interactions between the ligands and the active amino acid residue of the receptor.

Systematic microbiological monitoring of deaths provides a fundamental basis to particularly assess underrecording of community-acquired mortality. It should be further elucidated whether a death cohort of previously unreported cases may be structurally different from the cohort of officially registered cases. Methods: A systematic reverse transcription (RT) qPCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 infections from nasopharyngeal swab samples was carried out. A representative sample of corpses from crematoria and the Institute of Legal Medicine of the Federal State of Hamburg were included. A comparative analysis of primarily reported and unreported fatalities in an 8-week period after occurrence of the first pandemic-related deaths in Hamburg was performed. Results: A total of 1231 deaths were included, all of which were previously unsuspicious for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thereof 29 cases of previously unknown infections were recorded. In the first phase of the pandemic, incidental findings predominantly occurred among younger people from domestic environments with unclear or unnatural manner of death at the Institute of Legal Medicine. Over time, incidental findings investigated at the crematoria increased, mostly related to nursing home residents. The overall cohort showed no significant sociodemographic differences to a comparative collective of known SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths. Primarily unreported cases showed a significantly lower proportion of COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death.

The primary drivers for these changes include the COVID-19 pandemic, our aging population, comorbid effects of unidentified hearing loss, and the critical need for effective communication between patients and providers. This review article highlights key features and technical specifications of boothless audiometry, provides an overview of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--approved boothless audiometry products, and describes how to leverage these products to increase access to hearing health services across the continuum of health care. Method: Boothless audiometry literature was reviewed using PubMed and audiometry technology websites. FDA-approved boothless audiometry products were reviewed, and audiological features were categorized. Civilian and Department of Defense subject matter experts were consulted. Conclusions: Boothless audiometry technology introduces opportunities for early audiometric assessment outside of the audiology clinic, in settings where traditional testing has been less possible, or even impossible, such as military environments, clinic waiting areas, schools, and nursing homes. This technology allows health care providers to identify individuals with significant hearing loss early and seek comprehensive services to prevent and treat hearing loss.

An infectious walker remains infectious during a certain characteristic time. If an infectious walker meets a susceptible one on the same node, there is a certain probability for the susceptible walker to get infected.

In this paper we study the impact of such interventions in the capital of a developing country, Santiago, Chile, that exhibits large socioeconomic inequality. A distinctive feature of our study is that we use granular geolocated mobile phone data to construct mobility measures that capture (1) shelter-in-place behavior, and (2) trips within the city to destinations with potentially different risk profiles. Using panel data linear regression models we first show that the impact of social distancing measures and lockdowns on mobility is highly heterogeneous and dependent on socioeconomic levels. More specifically, our estimates indicate that while zones of high socioeconomic levels can exhibit reductions in mobility of around 50\\\\% to 90\\\\% depending on the specific mobility metric used, these reductions are only 20\\\\% to 50\\\\% for lower-income communities. The large reductions in higher-income communities are significantly driven by voluntary shelter-in-place behavior. Second, also using panel data methods we show that our mobility measures are important predictors of infections: a 10\\\\% increase in mobility correlates with approximately a 5\\\\% increase in the rate of infection. Our results suggest that mobility is an important factor explaining differences in infections rates between high and low incomes areas within the city. Further, they confirm the challenges of reducing mobility in lower-income communities, where people generate their income from their daily work. To be effective, shelter-in-place restrictions in municipalities of low socioeconomic levels may need to be complemented by other supporting measures that enable their inhabitants to increase compliance.","output":"The Social Divide of Social Distancing: Shelter-in-Place Behavior in Santiago during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a new infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has reached a pandemic status. Although SARSCoV-2 causes primarily respiratory problems, concurrent cardiac injury cannot be ignored since it may be an independent predictor for adverse outcomes. To resolve these issues, we aim to summarize the prevalence and its underlying mechanisms of acute cardiac injury in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RECENT FINDINGS: The main clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is pneumonia, cardiovascular complications have also been identified in the earliest reported cases from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. Given the SARS-CoV-2 likely uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors as its host receptor, ACE2-related signaling pathways may play a key role in mediating myocardial injury. SARS-CoV-2 infection related acute cardiac injury cannot be ignored, and its underlying mechanisms remain speculated.

Residual P. acnes is found on the skin up to 29% of the time immediately after surgical skin preparation and in 70% of dermal biopsy specimens. These residual bacteria may be a source for infection. Identifying more ideal skin preparation may help reduce the risk of infection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect that topical benzoyl peroxide (BPO), with chlorhexidine skin preparation, would have on the presence of P. acnes cultured at the time of shoulder surgery. We hypothesized that adding topical BPO to our skin preparation would reduce the number of positive P. acnes cultures identified during surgery. METHODS Fifty patients undergoing first-time shoulder surgery were treated with topical 5% BPO cream 48 hours before surgery. After skin preparation, 13 samples per subject were obtained. Cultures were held for 14 days. RESULTS Fifty patients underwent arthroscopic shoulder surgery; 650 culture specimens were obtained. The skin was positive at the initiation of surgery in 6% of cases. Tissue samples were positive in 6%. The skin was positive in 10% at the end of surgery. None of these rates of positive culture were different from the 4% rate observed with a control swab. CONCLUSION Application of BPO is an effective way to reduce P. acnes on skin at the beginning and, importantly, at the end of a surgical procedure.

After having completed their 6-month-long projects, the 14-18 year-old school students report having substantially increased in confidence relating to relevant scientific topics and methods as well as having developed numerous skills, outcomes which are corroborated by teachers. There is evidence that the projects helped increase students' aspirations towards physics, whereas science aspirations (generally high to begin with) were typically maintained or confirmed through their involvement. Longitudinal evaluation 3 years later has revealed that these projects have been lasting experiences for students which they have benefited and drawn upon in their subsequent university education. Data on students' destinations suggests that their involvement in research projects has made them more likely to undertake physics and STEM degrees than would otherwise be expected. Cases of co-created novel physics research resulting from PRiSE also has seemed to have a powerful effect, not only on the student co-authors but participating students from other schools also. Teachers have also been positively affected through participating, with the programme having influenced their own knowledge, skills, and pedagogy, as well as having advantageous effects felt across their wider schools.

Dwindling supplies, such as face masks, gowns and goggles, and inadequate production to meet increasing demands, has left healthcare workers and patients at risk. The momentum of this Twitter hashtag resulted in a petition to urge public officials to address the PPE shortage through increased funding and production. Simultaneously, GetUsPPE.org was launched by a collaborative of physicians and software engineers to develop a digital platform for the donation, request, and distribution of multi-modal sources of PPE. GetUsPPE.org and #GetMePPE merged in an attempt to combine public engagement and advocacy on social media with the coordination of PPE donation and distribution. Within ten days, over 1800 hospitals and PPE suppliers were registered in a database that allowed for the rapid coordination and distribution of scarce and in-demand materials. One month after its launch, the organization has distributed hundreds of thousands of items of PPE and built a database of over 6,000 PPE requesters[1] The call for action on social media and the rapid development of this digital tool created a productive channel for the public to contribute to the healthcare response to COVID-19 in meaningful ways. #GetMePPE and GetUsPPE.org were able to mobilize individuals and organizations outside of the healthcare system to address the unmet needs of the medical community.

While big strides have been made in understanding the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the pathophysiology of long COVID is still largely unknown, and evidence-based, effective treatments for this condition remain unavailable. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of 10 mg oral montelukast every 24 h versus placebo in improving quality of life associated with mild to moderate respiratory symptoms in patients with long COVID as measured with the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) questionnaire. The secondary objectives will evaluate the effect of montelukast versus placebo on improving exercise capacity, COVID-19 symptoms (asthenia, headache, mental confusion or brain fog, ageusia, and anosmia), oxygen desaturation during exertion, functional status, and mortality. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Phase III, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. We will include 18- to 80-year-old patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild to moderate respiratory symptoms lasting more than 4 weeks. Participants will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention (experimental treatment with 10 mg/day montelukast) or the control group (placebo group), during a 28-day treatment. Follow-up will finish 56 days after the start of treatment. The primary outcome will be health-related quality of life associated with respiratory symptoms according to the COPD Assessment Test 4 weeks after starting the treatment. The following are the secondary outcomes: (a) exercise capacity and oxygen saturation (1-min sit-to-stand test); (b) Post-COVID-19 Functional Status Scale; (c) other symptoms: asthenia, headache, mental confusion (brain fog), ageusia, and anosmia (Likert scale); (d) use of healthcare resources; (e) mortality; (f) sick leave duration in days; and (g) side effects of montelukast.

Vaccine opponents often frame their opposition in terms of the rights of the unvaccinated. We sought to explore the impact of mixing of vaccinated and unvaccinated populations on risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinated people. METHODS: We constructed a simple susceptibleCinfectiousCrecovered compartmental model of a respiratory infectious disease with 2 connected subpopulations: people who were vaccinated and those who were unvaccinated. We simulated a spectrum of patterns of mixing between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups that ranged from random mixing to complete like-with-like mixing (complete assortativity), in which people have contact exclusively with others with the same vaccination status. We evaluated the dynamics of an epidemic within each subgroup and in the population as a whole. RESULTS: We found that the risk of infection was markedly higher among unvaccinated people than among vaccinated people under all mixing assumptions. The contact-adjusted contribution of unvaccinated people to infection risk was disproportionate, with unvaccinated people contributing to infections among those who were vaccinated at a rate higher than would have been expected based on contact numbers alone. We found that as like-with-like mixing increased, attack rates among vaccinated people decreased from 15% to 10% (and increased from 62% to 79% among unvaccinated people), but the contact-adjusted contribution to risk among vaccinated people derived from contact with unvaccinated people increased. INTERPRETATION: Although risk associated with avoiding vaccination during a virulent pandemic accrues chiefly to people who are unvaccinated, their choices affect risk of viral infection among those who are vaccinated in a manner that is disproportionate to the portion of unvaccinated people in the population.","output":"Impact of population mixing between vaccinated and unvaccinated subpopulations on infectious disease dynamics: implications for SARS-CoV-2 transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We previously found that polydatin could attenuate renal oxidative stress in diabetic mice and improve renal fibrosis. Recent evidence shows that NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4)-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to inflammatory and fibrotic processes in diabetic kidneys. In this study we investigated whether polydatin attenuated renal fibrosis by regulating Nox4 in vitro and in vivo. In high glucose-treated rat glomerular mesangial cells, polydatin significantly decreased the protein levels of Nox4 by promoting its K48-linked polyubiquitination, thus inhibited the production of ROS, and eventually decreasing the expression of fibronectin (FN) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), the main factors that exacerbate diabetic renal fibrosis. Overexpression of Nox4 abolished the inhibitory effects of polydatin on FN and ICAM-1 expression. In addition, the expression of Connexin32 (Cx32) was significantly decreased, which was restored by polydatin treatment. Cx32 interacted with Nox4 and reduced its protein levels. Knockdown of Cx32 abolished the inhibitory effects of polydatin on the expression of FN and ICAM-1. In the kidneys of streptozocin-induced diabetic mice, administration of polydatin (100 mgkg-1d-1, ig, 6 days a week for 12 weeks) increased Cx32 expression and reduced Nox4 expression, decreased renal oxidative stress levels and the expression of fibrotic factors, eventually attenuating renal injury and fibrosis. In conclusion, polydatin promotes K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of Nox4 by restoring Cx32 expression, thereby decreasing renal oxidative stress levels and ultimately ameliorating the pathological progress of diabetic renal fibrosis. Thus, polydatin reduces renal oxidative stress levels and attenuates diabetic renal fibrosis through regulating the Cx32-Nox4 signaling pathway.","output":"Polydatin attenuates renal fibrosis in diabetic mice through regulating the Cx32-Nox4 signaling pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic.

Subjects received LH capsules (4 capsules, three times daily) or the usual medical observation for 14 days. The primary endpoint was the rate of positive nucleic acid tests of nasal and pharyngeal swabs during the quarantine medical observation period. We included 1976 patients, including 1101 in the treatment group and 875 in the control group. The rate of positive nucleic acid tests in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the control group (0.27% vs. 1.14%, respectively; mean difference: ?0.87%; 95% CI: ?1.83 to ?0.13; p=0.0174) during the quarantine medical observation period (14 days).

Part of the diagnosis and follow-up includes medical imaging of the thorax for detection of lung metastases. A Python script was created and trained using a set of lung X-rays and concordant CT scans from a high-volume German-speaking sarcoma center. It is capable of detecting malignant metastasis in the lung with a precision of 71.2%, specificity of 90.5%, sensitivity of 94% and accuracy of 91.2%. Furthermore, the program was able to detect even small nodules with a size <1 cm in conventional X-rays of the thorax. This algorithm was implemented into our daily clinical practice alongside with the radiologists findings. With this tool we aim to improve the quality of our service and reduce the expenditure of time. ABSTRACT: Introduction: soft tissue sarcomas are a subset of malignant tumors that are relatively rare and make up 1% of all malignant tumors in adulthood. Due to the rarity of these tumors, there are significant differences in quality in the diagnosis and treatment of these tumors. One paramount aspect is the diagnosis of hematogenous metastases in the lungs. Guidelines recommend routine lung imaging by means of X-rays. With the ever advancing AI-based diagnostic support, there has so far been no implementation for sarcomas. The aim of the study was to utilize AI to obtain analyzes regarding metastasis on lung X-rays in the most possible sensitive and specific manner in sarcoma patients. Methods: a Python script was created and trained using a set of lung X-rays with sarcoma metastases from a high-volume German-speaking sarcoma center. 26 patients with lung metastasis were included. For all patients chest X-ray with corresponding lung CT scans, and histological biopsies were available. The number of trainable images were expanded to 600. In order to evaluate the biological sensitivity and specificity, the script was tested on lung X-rays with a lung CT as control. Results: in this study we present a new type of convolutional neural network-based system with a precision of 71.2%, specificity of 90.5%, sensitivity of 94%, recall of 94% and accuracy of 91.2%. A good detection of even small findings was determined. Discussion: the created script establishes the option to check lung X-rays for metastases at a safe level, especially given this rare tumor entity.","output":"A Highly Reliable Convolutional Neural Network Based Soft Tissue Sarcoma Metastasis Detection from Chest X-ray Images: A Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to explore differences in COVID-19 outcomes between male and female cases in the Apulian District of Foggia, Italy.

The proportion of cases who achieved virus clearance was higher in women (84.2%; days to clearance: 28.012.1) than in men (79.3%; days to clearance: 29.412.9; p<0.05). Men were associated with a significantly higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than women (case fatality rate 16.1% vs 10.4%; p<0.01). The mean time, from diagnosis to death, was 14.514.4 days in women compared with 10.610.7 days in men (p<0.01). The male sex, age 55 years and presence of at least one underlying comorbidity significantly raised the risk of hospitalisation, persistent infection and death (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that more attention should be paid to sex as a variable for the interpretation of COVID-19 data. Sex-disaggregated data will help clinicians to make appropriate patient-tailored medical decisions.","output":"Sex and gender differences in COVID-19: an Italian local register-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health education has long been concentrated in a core set of public health disciplines such as epidemiology, biostatistics, and environmental health.

We aimed to analyze clinical and epidemiological characteristics and comorbidities associated with COVID-19 inpatients in age-stratified populations of an elderly COVID-19 cohort. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study, using nationwide registry data of COVID-19 patients hospitalized before October 31, 2020 (major information entered in the registry as of December 28, 2020). Participants were divided by age according to the Japan Geriatrics Society and the Japan Gerontological Society: pre-old (65C74 years), old (75C89 years), and super-old (90 years). Multivariable logistic regression (MLR) analyses were conducted to identify stratified risk and relationships with comorbidities associated with worse outcomes in different age-groups of elderly patients. Demographics and supportive care were evaluated by category. RESULTS: Data of 4,701 patients from 444 hospitals were included. Most patients (79.3%) had at least one comorbidity; the proportion of patients with hypertension was high in all categories. The proportion of patients with dementia, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease increased with age. The percentage of patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was lower in the super-old group. In total, 11.5% of patients died (5.3%, pre-old; 15.2%, old; and 22.4%, super-old). MLR showed that the risk of critical illness differed among age-groups. Male sex was a significant RF in all ages. Collagen disease, moderate to severe renal disorder, and dialysis were significant RFs in older patients, while hematological malignancies and metastatic tumors were more important RFs for severe disease in relatively younger patients. Most of the RFs for critical illnesses were associated with death.

Little is known about how older survivors have experienced the consequences and how these have affected their lives. The aim of this study was to explore how older survivors experienced post-COVID-19 condition and life changes approximately 6 months after hospitalisation for COVID-19. METHODS: The study had an explorative and descriptive design. Semi-structured interviews were performed with 17 participants from two local hospitals, 11 men and 6 women, aged 60 years and older (age range 60C96), approximately 6 months after hospitalisation for COVID-19. A thematic descriptive analysis inspired by Braun and Clarke was used. RESULTS: Two main themes and seven subthemes were revealed. The main themes were: From few to various persistent symptoms and Existential thoughts and reflections. Most of the participants experienced various physical and/or cognitive symptoms, such as reduced physical fitness, heavy breathing, fatigue, and brain fog. On the other hand, they also experienced guilt and gratitude for having survived. The recognition of having achieved other life perspectives was also present. CONCLUSION: Six months after undergone COVID-19 the participants still experienced various distressing symptoms, which were in line with larger studies. The novel findings of this study were connected to the existential area, where the patients thoughts and reflections of guilt, gratitude, and new life perspectives were revealed.

Research Question Did hospital emergency responses to the COVID-19 pandemic differ depending on hospital setting; which strategies worked well to mitigate strain as perceived by intensivists? Study Design and Methods : Between August-November 2020, we performed semi-structured interviews of intensivists from tertiary and community hospitals across six regions in the United States (U.S.) that experienced early and/or large surges of COVID-19 patients. We identified themes of hospital emergency responses using the four S framework of acute surge planning (i.e., Space, Staff, Stuff, System). Results 33 intensivists from 7 tertiary and 6 community hospitals participated. Clinicians across both settings felt that canceling elective surgeries was helpful to increase ICU capabilities and that hospitals should establish clearly-defined thresholds at which surgeries are limited during future surge events. ICU staff was the most limited resource; staff shortages were improved by the use of tiered staffing models, just-in-time training for non-ICU clinicians, designated treatment teams, and deployment of trainees. Personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages and re-use were widespread, causing substantial distress among clinicians; hands-on PPE training was helpful to reduce clinicians anxiety. Transparency and involvement of frontline clinicians as stakeholders were important components of effective emergency responses and helped maintain trust among staff. Interpretation We identified several strategies to potentially mitigate strain as perceived by intensivists working in both tertiary and community hospital settings. Our study also demonstrates the importance of trust and transparency between frontline staff and hospital leadership as key components of effective emergency responses during public health crises.","output":"The Influence of the COVID-19 Pandemic on ICU Organization, Care Processes, and Frontline Clinician Experiences: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The innate immune system is the first line of the host defense program against pathogens and harmful substances.

METHODS: Sixty adolescents with T1D (30 on CSII and 30 on basal-bolus regimen), aged 12C17 years were studied focusing on diabetes-duration, insulin therapy, exercise, socioeconomic standard, hypoglycemic attacks/week and family history of psychiatric illness. Anthropometric measures, HbA1C, binge eating scale (BES), body image tool, patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ9) and the Mini-KID depression scale were assessed. RESULTS: Among the studied adolescents with T1D, six had DEB (10%), 14 had poor body-image perception (23.3%), 42 had moderate body-image perception (70%) and 22 had depression (36.7%). Adolescents with T1D on CSII had significantly lower BES (p = 0.022), Mini-KID depression (p = 0.001) and PHQ9 (p = 0.02) than those on basal-bolus regimen.

These systems use facial infrared emissions to detect individuals exhibiting an elevated core-body temperature, which is present in many symptomatic presentations of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite the rollout of these systems, there is little independent research supporting their efficacy. The primary objective of this study was to assess the precision and accuracy of IRT screening solutions in a real-world scenario. The method used was a single-centre, observational study investigating the agreement of three IRT systems compared to digital oral thermometer measurements of body temperature. Over 5 days, 107 measurements were taken from individuals wearing facial masks. During each entry, two measurements of the subject's body temperature were made from each system to allow for the evaluation of the measurement precision, followed by an oral thermometer measurement. Each participant also answered a short demographic survey. This study found that the precision of the IRT systems was wider than 0.3 C claimed accuracy of two of the systems. This study also found that the IRT measurements were only weakly correlated to those of the oral temperature. Additionally, it was found that demographic characteristics (age, gender, and mask-type) impacted the measurement error. This study indicates that using IRT systems in front-line scenarios poses a potential risk, where a lack of measurement accuracy could possibly allow febrile individuals to pass through undetected.

APPROACH: Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), charge storage capacity (CSC), charge injection limit (CIL), and voltage transient (VT) impedance were measured bench-top before and after implant and in vivo. Coated Pt-Ir and uncoated Pt electrode arrays were implanted into cochlea of normal hearing rats and stimulated for ~4 hours/day, 5 days/week for 5 weeks. Neural function was monitored using electrically-evoked auditory brainstem responses. After explant, the electrode surfaces were assessed, and cochleae examined histologically. MAIN RESULTS: When measured on bench-top before and after stimulation, Pt-Ir coated electrodes had significantly lower VT impedance (p < 0.001) and significantly higher CSC (p < 0.001) and CIL (p < 0.001) compared to uncoated Pt electrodes. In vivo, the CSC and CIL of Pt-Ir were significantly higher than Pt throughout the implantation period (p = 0.047 and p < 0.001, respectively); however, the VT impedance (p = 0.3) was not. There was no difference in foreign body response between material cohorts, although cochleae implanted with coated electrodes contained small deposits of Pt-Ir. There was no evidence of increased neural loss or loss of neural function in either group. Surface examination revealed no Pt corrosion on any electrodes. SIGNIFICANCE: Electrodeposited Pt-Ir electrodes demonstrated significant improvements in electrochemical performance on the bench-top and in vivo compared to uncoated Pt.

As part of these restrictions, schools were closed to all pupils in March (except for vulnerable and key worker children), before re-opening to certain year groups in June. Finally all school children returned to the classroom in September. In this paper, we analyse the data on school absences from September 2020 to December 2020 as a result of COVID-19 infection and how that varied through time as other measures in the community were introduced. We utilise data from the Educational Settings database compiled by the Department for Education and examine how pupil and teacher absences change in both primary and secondary schools. Our results show that absences as a result of COVID-19 infection rose steadily following the re-opening of schools in September. Cases in teachers were seen to decline during the November lockdown, particularly in those regions that had previously been in tier 3, the highest level of control at the time. Cases in secondary school pupils increased for the first two weeks of the November lockdown, before decreasing. Since the introduction of the tier system, the number of absences owing to confirmed infection in primary schools was observed to be significantly lower than in secondary schools across all regions and tiers. In December, we observed a large rise in the number of absences per school in secondary school settings in the South East and Greater London, but such rises were not observed in other regions or in primary school settings. We conjecture that the increased transmissibility of the new variant in these regions may have contributed to this rise in cases in secondary schools. Finally, we observe a positive correlation between cases in the community and cases in schools, with weak evidence suggesting that cases in schools lag behind cases in the surrounding community. We conclude that there is not significant evidence to suggest that schools are playing a significant role in driving spread in the community and that careful monitoring may be required as schools re-open to determine the effect associated with open schools upon community incidence.","output":"An analysis of school absences in England during the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify: (a) latent safety threats (LSTs) in a new neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) through simulation-based pre-occupancy operations testing, and (b) LSTs that remained unresolved 1-year post-occupancy.

We show that causal reasoning can enhance a broad class of LVM long established in the probabilistic modeling community, and demonstrate its effectiveness on several case studies. These include a machine learning model with multiple causes where there exists a set of latent confounders and a mediator between the causes and the outcome variable, a study where the identifiable causal query cannot be estimated using the front-door or back-door criterion, a case study that captures unobserved crosstalk between two biological signaling pathways, and a COVID-19 expert system that identifies multiple causal queries.","output":"Do-calculus enables causal reasoning with latent variable models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on the results of the monitoring and evaluation by the Central Information Commission, UM is a public body that won the 'informative' category in 2020.

Konya, located in central Anatolia, is the largest province of Turkey with a surface area of 40,838 km(2) and has different industrial activities. The lack of recent detailed studies limits our information on the underlying air pollution levels in Konya and obscuring policymakers to develop applicable mitigation measures. In this study, we used hourly monitored air quality data of CO, NO(2), NO(x), PM(10), PM(2.5), and SO(2) from five stations in Konya and investigated the temporal and spatial variabilities for the 2008C2018 period via statistical analysis. Upon analysis, particulate matter was found to be the dominant pollutant deteriorating the air quality of Konya. The highest 2008C2018 periodic mean value of PM(10) was found in Karatay Belediye as 70.5 g/m(3), followed by 67.4 g/m(3) in Meram, 58.7 g/m(3) in Sel?uklu, and 43.7 g/m(3) in Sel?uklu Belediye. The 24-h limit value of PM(10) given as 50 g/m(3) in the legislation was violated in all of the stations, mainly during winter and autumn. High positive correlations were found among the stations, and the highest correlation was obtained between Sel?uklu Belediye and Karatay Belediye with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.77. Long-term data showed a decreasing trend in PM(10) concentrations. Diurnal variability is found to be more pronounced than weekly variability. For almost all of the pollutants, except for photochemical pollutants like O(3), a prominent result was the nighttime and morning rush hours high-pollutant levels. A case study done for the January 29, 2018 to February 05, 2018 episode showed the importance of meteorology and topography on the high levels of pollution. Limitation of the pollutant transport and dilution by meteorological conditions and the location of Konya on a plain surrounded by high hills are believed to be the main reasons for having low air quality in the region.","output":"A holistic approach to the air quality of Konya City, Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected patients across all age groups, with a wide range of illness severity from asymptomatic carriers to severe multi-organ dysfunction and death Although early reports have shown that younger age groups experience less severe disease than older adults, our understanding of this phenomenon is in continuous evolution Recently, a severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), with active or recent COVID-19 infection, has been increasingly reported Children with MIS-C may demonstrate signs and symptoms of Kawasaki disease, but also have some distinct differences These children have more frequent and severe gastrointestinal symptoms and are more likely to present with a shock-like presentation Moreover, they often present with cardiovascular involvement including myocardial dysfunction, valvulitis, and coronary artery dilation or aneurysms Here, we present a review of the literature and summary of our current understanding of cardiovascular involvement in children with COVID-19 or MIS-C and identifying the role of a pediatric cardiologist in caring for these patients","output":"Role of a Pediatric Cardiologist in the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the existence of telemedicine since the late 1950s and early 1960s, it took a pandemic to bring this technology mainstream.

The current study examined whether this extract could inhibit the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to ACE2. Binding was quantified as cell-bound fluorescence intensity in live cell cultures in which canine kidney MDCK cells overexpressing ACE2 were incubated with fluorescein-labeled S1 spike protein. When indigo extract, together with S1 protein, was added at 8,650x and 17,300x dilutions, fluorescence intensity decreased in a dose- and S1 extract-dependent manner, without affecting cell viability. When 4.0-nM tryptanthrin was added instead of the indigo extract, fluorescence intensity also decreased, but to a lesser degree than with indigo extract. Docking simulation analyses revealed that tryptanthrin readily bound to the receptor-binding domain of the S1 protein, and identified 2- and 7-amino acid sequences as the preferred binding sites. The indigo extract appeared to inhibit S1-ACE2 binding at high dilutions, and evidently contained other inhibitory elements as well as tryptanthrin.

DESIGN: Data resource comprising linked person level records from national healthcare settings for the English population, accessible within NHS Digitals new trusted research environment. SETTING: EHRs from primary care, hospital episodes, death registry, covid-19 laboratory test results, and community dispensing data, with further enrichment planned from specialist intensive care, cardiovascular, and covid-19 vaccination data. PARTICIPANTS: 54.4 million people alive on 1 January 2020 and registered with an NHS general practitioner in England. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Confirmed and suspected covid-19 diagnoses, exemplar cardiovascular conditions (incident stroke or transient ischaemic attack and incident myocardial infarction) and all cause mortality between 1 January and 31 October 2020. RESULTS: The linked cohort includes more than 96% of the English population. By combining person level data across national healthcare settings, data on age, sex, and ethnicity are complete for around 95% of the population. Among 53.3 million people with no previous diagnosis of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, 98 721 had a first ever incident stroke or transient ischaemic attack between 1 January and 31 October 2020, of which 30% were recorded only in primary care and 4% only in death registry records. Among 53.2 million people with no previous diagnosis of myocardial infarction, 62 966 had an incident myocardial infarction during follow-up, of which 8% were recorded only in primary care and 12% only in death registry records. A total of 959 470 people had a confirmed or suspected covid-19 diagnosis (714 162 in primary care data, 126 349 in hospital admission records, 776 503 in covid-19 laboratory test data, and 50 504 in death registry records). Although 58% of these were recorded in both primary care and covid-19 laboratory test data, 15% and 18%, respectively, were recorded in only one. CONCLUSIONS: This population-wide resource shows the importance of linking person level data across health settings to maximise completeness of key characteristics and to ascertain cardiovascular events and covid-19 diagnoses. Although this resource was initially established to support research on covid-19 and cardiovascular disease to benefit clinical care and public health and to inform healthcare policy, it can broaden further to enable a wide range of research.","output":"Linked electronic health records for research on a nationwide cohort of more than 54 million people in England: data resource"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses have been present throughout human history, causing diseases due to infections and food poisoning;they have caused frequent public health problems worldwide.

To understand conflicting results in the literature, we performed a metasynthesis to determine whether intrinsic qualitative criteria within studies may predict apparent efficacy or ineffectiveness of HCQ and remdesivir. Methodology: Predictive criteria were identified through critical review of studies assessing HCQ and remdesivir for COVID-19 mortality from March to November 2020. Multiple correspondence analysis, comparative metaanalysis, and predictive value were used to explore and identify criteria associated with study outcomes. Results: Among the 61 included studies, potential conflict of interest, detailed therapeutic protocol, toxic treatment (overdose or use in contraindicated patients), known centers and doctors, and private data computing company were the most predictive criteria of the direction of effect of the studies. All 18 observational studies evaluating HCQ and reporting detailed therapeutic protocol without conflict of interest were Pro. Potential conflict of interest was a perfect predictor for remdesivir efficacy. RCTs were associated with HCQ inefficacy and potential conflict of interest.

This article describes the vaccination program developed by the Boston Medical Center (BMC) health system (New England's largest safety-net health system), its affiliated community health centers (CHCs), and community partners. The program was based on a conceptual framework for community interventions and aimed to increase equitable access to vaccination in the hardest-hit communities through community-based sites in churches and community centers, mobile vaccination events, and vaccination on the BMC campus. Key strategies included a communication campaign featuring trusted messengers, a focus on health equity, established partnerships with community leaders and CHCs, and strong collaboration with local health departments and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to ensure equitable allocation of the vaccine supply. Process factors involved the use of robust analytics relying on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). The vaccination program administered 109 938 first doses, with 94 703 (86%) given at community sites and 2466 (2%) given at mobile sites. Mobile vaccination events were key in reaching younger people living in locations with the highest SVIs. Challenges included the need for a robust operational infrastructure and mistrust of the health system given the long history of economic disinvestment in the surrounding community.

METHODS: Patients undergoing primary THA at our institution with an OHS both preoperatively and at least four years postoperatively were included. Rationing thresholds were explored to identify possible deprivation of OHS improvement. RESULTS: Overall, 2,341 patients were included. Mean OHS was 19.7 (SD 8.2) preoperatively and 39.7 (SD 9.8) at latest follow-up. An improvement of at least eight-points, the minimally important change (MIC), was seen in 2,072 patients (88.5%). The mean improvement was 20.0 points (SD 10.5). If a rationing threshold of OHS of 20 points had been enforced, 90.8% of those treated would have achieved the MIC, but only 54.3% of our cohort would have had access to surgery; increasing this threshold to 32 would have enabled 89.5% of those treated to achieve the MIC while only depriving 6.5% of our cohort. The rationed group of OHS > 20 had significantly better OHS at latest follow-up (42.6 vs 37.3; p < 0.001), while extending the rationing threshold above 32 showed postoperative scores were more significantly affected by the ceiling effect of the OHS. CONCLUSION: The OHS was not designed as a tool to ration healthcare, but if it had been used at our institution for this cohort, applying an OHS threshold of 20 to routine THA access would have excluded nearly half of patients from having a THA; a group in which over 85% had a significant improvement in OHS.

OBJECTIVES: We explored the type and nature of patient safety incidents in French primary care settings during the COVID-19 first wave to make tentative recommendations for improvement. METHODS: A national patient safety incident reporting survey was distributed to General Practitioners (GPs) in France on 28 April 2020. Reports were coded using a classification system aligned to the WHO International Classification for Patient Safety (incident types, contributing factors, incident outcomes and severity of harm). Analysis involved data coding, processing, iterative generation of data summaries using descriptive statistical analysis. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04346121. RESULTS: Of 132 incidents, 58 (44%) related to delayed diagnosis, assessments and referrals. Cancellations of appointments, hospitalisations or procedures was reported in 22 (17%) of these incidents. Home confinement-related incidents accounted for 13 (10%) reports and inappropriate medication stopping for five (4%). Patients delayed attending or did not consult their general practitioner or other healthcare providers due to their fear of contracting COVID-19 infection at an in-person visit in 26 (10%) incidents or fear of burdening their GPs in eight (3%) incidents.

TSN is related to improvement in psychological well-being and health, yet most American adults spend very little time in such settings. Theory-based interventions have been effective in increasing physical activity, a related behavior, and may be one mechanism to increase TSN. Self-efficacy and intentions have been shown to be strong predictors of health behaviors and are used across several theories. However, scales to measure these factors have not yet been developed and are needed to facilitate effective interventions. METHODS: TSN self-efficacy and intentions scales were developed using a sequential nine-step procedure: identification of the domain and item generation; content validity; pre-testing of questions; sampling and survey administration; item reduction; extraction of factors; tests of dimensionality; tests of reliability; and tests of validity. The 14-member multidisciplinary, researcher and practitioner investigative team generated 50 unique items for self-efficacy and 24 unique items for intentions. After subjecting items to content validity and pre-testing, item sets were reduced to 21 assessing self-efficacy and nine assessing intentions. A nationwide sample of 2109 adult participants (49.7% female, Mean Age = 58.1; 59.8% White, 18.4% Hispanic, 13.3% Black) answered these items via an on-line survey.

In the outbreak in Seoul, Incheon, and Gyeonggi province during August, the time to TB diagnosis was 4 days longer than in the previous 3 years (p=0.0303). In the outbreak in Daegu and Gyeongbuk province from February to March 2020, the compliance rate with the required timing for individual case investigations was 2.2%p lower than in other areas in 2020 (p=0.0148). For public health centers, the rate was 13%p lower than in other areas (80.3% vs. 93.3%, p=0.0003). CONCLUSION: TB diagnoses during the COVID-19 pandemic in the ROK were delayed nationwide, especially for patients notified by public-private mix TB control hospitals. TB individual case investigations were delayed in regional COVID-19 outbreak areas (Daegu and Gyeongbuk province), especially in public health centers. Developing strategies to address this issue will be helpful for sustainable TB management during future outbreaks.","output":"Delays in the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Republic of Korea in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most of the nations with deplorable health conditions lack rapid COVID-19diagnostic test due to limited testing kits and laboratories. The un-diagnosticmild cases (who show no critical sign and symptoms) play the role as a route that spread the infection unknowingly to healthy individuals. In this paper, we present a fractional order SIR model incorporating individual with mild cases as a compartment to become SMIR model. The existence of the solutions of the model is investigated by solving the fractional Gronwall's inequality using the Laplace transform approach. The equilibrium solutions (DFE & Endemic) are found to be locally asymptotically stable, and subsequently the basic reproduction number is obtained. Also the global stability analysis is carried out by constructing Lyapunov function. Lastly, numerical simulations that support analytic solution follow. It was also shown that when the rate of infection of the mild cases increases, there is equivalent increase in the overall population of infected individuals. Hence to curtail the spread of the disease there is need to take care of the Mild cases as well.","output":"Fractional Order Model for the Role of Mild Cases in the Transmission of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study investigated medical educators readiness for online teaching by exploring their perceived ability and importance of online teaching competencies and identified the highest priority of their educational needs.

The method achieves focal endothelial-selective transgenesis, thereby allowing an investigator to determine the biological roles of endothelial-expressed transgenes and to quantify the in vivo transcriptional activity of DNA sequences in large artery endothelial cells. The method uses surgical isolation of rabbit common carotid arteries and an arteriotomy to deliver a transgene-expressing viral vector into the arterial lumen. A short incubation period of the vector in the lumen, with subsequent aspiration of the lumen contents, is sufficient to achieve efficient and durable expression of the transgene in the endothelium, with no detectable transduction or expression outside of the isolated arterial segment. The method allows assessment of the biological activities of transgene products both in normal arteries and in models of human vascular disease, while avoiding systemic effects that could be caused either by targeting gene delivery to other sites (e.g. the liver) or by the alternative approach of delivering genetic constructs to the endothelium by germ line transgenesis. Application of the method is limited by the need for a skilled surgeon and anesthetist, a well-equipped operating room, the costs of purchasing and housing rabbits, and the need for expertise in gene-transfer vector construction and use. Results obtained with this method include: transgene-related alterations in arterial structure, cellularity, extracellular matrix, or vasomotor function; increases or reductions in arterial inflammation; alterations in vascular cell apoptosis; and progression, retardation, or regression of diseases such as intimal hyperplasia or atherosclerosis. The method also allows measurement of the ability of native and synthetic DNA regulatory sequences to alter transgene expression in endothelial cells, providing results that include: levels of transgene mRNA, levels of transgene protein, and levels of transgene enzymatic activity.","output":"In Vivo Gene Transfer to the Rabbit Common Carotid Artery Endothelium."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lockdown introduced in Georgia on November 28, 2020 contributed to positive trends in the spread of COVID-19 until February - the first half of March 2021. Then, in April-May 2021, the epidemiological situation worsened significantly, and from June to the end of December COVID - situation in Georgia was very difficult. In this work results of the next statistical analysis of the daily data associated with New Coronavirus COVID-19 infection of confirmed (C), recovered (R), deaths (D) and infection rate (I) cases of the population of Georgia in the period from September 01, 2021 to December 31, 2021 are presented. It also presents the results of the analysis of monthly forecasting of the values of C, D and I. As earlier, the information was regularly sent to the National Center for Disease Control & Public Health of Georgia and posted on the Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/Avtandil1948/. The analysis of data is carried out with the use of the standard statistical analysis methods of random events and methods of mathematical statistics for the non-accidental time-series of observations. In particular, the following results were obtained. Georgia's ranking in the world for Covid-19 monthly mean values of infection and deaths cases in investigation period (per 1 million population) was determined. Among 157 countries with population [] 1 million inhabitants in October 2021 Georgia was in the 4 place on new infection cases, and in September - in the 1 place on death. Georgia took the best place in terms of confirmed cases of diseases (thirteenth) in December, and in mortality (fifth) - in October. A comparison between the daily mortality from Covid-19 in Georgia from September 01, 2021 to December 31, 2021with the average daily mortality rate in 2015-2019 shows, that the largest share value of D from mean death in 2015-2019 was 76.8 % (September 03, 2021), the smallest 18.7 % (November 10, 2021). As in previous work [9,10] the statistical analysis of the daily and decade data associated with coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic of confirmed, recovered, deaths cases and infection rate of the population of Georgia are carried out. Maximum daily values of investigation parameters are following: C = 6024 (November 3, 2021), R = 6017 (November 15, 2021), D = 86 (September 3, 2021), I = 12.04 % (November 24, 2021). Maximum mean decade values of investigation parameters are following: C = 4757 (1 Decade of November 2021), R = 4427 (3 Decade of November 2021), D = 76 (2 Decade of November 2021), I = 10.55 % (1 Decade of November 2021). It was found that as in spring and summer 2021 [9,10], from September to December 2021 the regression equations for the time variability of the daily values of C, R, D and I have the form of a tenth order polynomial. Mean values of speed of change of confirmed -V(C), recovered - V(R), deaths - V(D) and infection rate V(I) coronavirus-related cases in different decades of months for the indicated period of time were determined. Maximum mean decade values of investigation parameters are following: V(C) = +139 cases/day (1 Decade of October 2021), V(R) = +124 cases/day (3 Decade of October 2021), V(D) = +1.7 cases/day (3 Decade of October 2021), V(I) = + 0.20 %/ day (1 decades of October 2021). Cross-correlations analysis between confirmed COVID-19 cases with recovered and deaths cases shows, that from September 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021 the maximum effect of recovery is observed on 12 and 14 days after infection (CR=0.77 and 0.78 respectively), and deaths - after 7, 9, 11, 13 and 14 days (0.70[]CR[]0.72); from October 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 - the maximum effect of recovery is observed on 14 days after infection (RC=0.71), and deaths - after 9 days (CR=0.43). In Georgia from September 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021 the duration of the impact of the delta variant of the coronavirus on people (recovery, mortality) could be up to 28 and 35 days respectively; from October 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 - up to 21 and 29 days respectively. Comparison of daily real and calculated monthly predictions data of C, D and I in Georgia are carried out. It was found that in investigation period of time daily and mean monthly real values of C, D and I practically fall into the 67% - 99.99% confidence interval of these predicted values.

METHODS We describe telemedicine onboarding and utilization across a statewide oncology practice, covering 221 sites of service and more than 650 practitioners. We describe qualitatively the onboarding process of a diverse set of administrative, technical, and clinical partners. We describe quantitatively utilization throughout the practice. We describe a survey conducted to enlighten barriers and opportunities for optimal utilization. RESULTS Multistakeholder education was directed to clinical teams, administrative and technical support staff, and patients through webinars and team meetings. Utilization was high from April through October 2020, representing 15% to 20% of new-patient visits and 20% to 25% of established-patient visits. In a survey offered to all clinicians, 96% of respondents indicated they are using telemedicine, with 33% using it for more than 25% of patient encounters. Among respondents, 59% reported that the use of telemedicine helps expedite diagnosis and treatment more than seeing patients in person in the clinic, 55% of respondents managed urgent issues by telemedicine, 80% believed that patients benefited From urgent assessment by telemedicine, and 57% believed an emergency department visit or a hospitalization was avoided because of a telemedicine visit. Most clinicians reported that patients enjoy benefits of telemedicine because of decreased exposure risk, decreased transportation requirements, and ease of including caregivers in the visit with the treating clinician. The most common barriers to patients accessing telemedicine were technical challenges and broadband access. Despite this, less than 5% of respondents routinely use telephone-only communication, as most typically use bimodal audio/video communication. Many clinicians have expansion ideas on how telemedicine can further expand the longitudinal care delivery for our patient population. CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine can be implemented successfully across a large statewide oncology practice and service a high volume of patients.

The infection in young rats is usually clinically silent. In older rats, there are nonspecific clinical signs such as snuffling, chromodacryorrhea, and face and ear rubbing. Several bacteria of the genus Streptococcus can cause clinical disease in rats. All of the streptococci of concern in rats are Gram-positive cocci, and are catalase-negative, nonfermentative, and generally nonmotile. Cilia-associated respiratory bacillus has been identified in rats. In rats, infection is usually asymptomatic although nonspecific clinical signs, such as weight loss and dyspnea, may be observed.","output":"Common Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic demanded rapid change in health care education, moving many students to online learning It is important to examine how this shift affected both student perceptions of learning and achievement of learning outcomes Snowball sampling strategy was used to reach and recruit nursing students, who had shifted to online learning during the pandemic, to participate in a research study survey This paper outlines the process of snowball sampling using social media, explores the relationship between social media posts and survey completion, describes the strategy's challenges and benefits, and provides recommendations to those who may consider using this novel sampling methodology","output":"Using Social Media and Snowball Sampling as an Alternative Recruitment Strategy for Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deterministic mathematical models (called Compartmental models) of disease propagation such as the SIR model and its variants (MSIR, Carrier state, SEIR, SEIS, MSEIR, MSEIRS models) are used to study the propagation of COVID19 in a large population with specific reference to India.","output":"Modelling and simulation of COVID-19 propagation in a large population with specific reference to India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To 1) analyze the short-term biochemical improvements and clinical outcomes following treatment of children with post-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 inflammatory syndrome (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children/pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) admitted to U.K. PICUs and 2) collate current treatment guidance from U.K. PICUs. DESIGN: Multicenter observational study. SETTING: Twenty-one U.K. PICUs. PATIENTS: Children (< 18 yr) admitted to U.K. PICUs between April 1, 2020, and May 10, 2020, fulfilling the U.K. case definition of pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Routinely collected, deidentified data were analyzed. Propensity score and linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the effect of steroids, IV immunoglobulin, and biologic agents on changes in C-reactive protein, platelet counts, and lymphocyte counts over the course of PICU stay. Treatment recommendations from U.K. clinical guidelines were analyzed. Over the 6-week study period, 59 of 78 children (76%) received IV immunoglobulin, 57 of 78 (73%) steroids, and 18 of 78 (24%) a biologic agent. We found no evidence of a difference in response in clinical markers of inflammation between patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children/pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 who were treated with IV immunoglobulin, steroids, or biologics, compared with those who were not. By the end of the study period, most patients had received immunomodulation. The 12 patients who did not receive any immunomodulators had similar decrease in inflammatory markers as those treated. Of the 14 guidelines analyzed, the use of IV immunoglobulin, steroids, and biologics was universally recommended. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to identify any short-term benefit from any of the treatments, or treatment combinations, administered. Despite a lack of evidence, treatment guidelines for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children/pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 have become very similar in advising step-wise treatments. Retaining clinical equipoise regarding treatment will allow clinicians to enroll children in robust clinical trials to determine the optimal treatment for this novel important condition.","output":"Association Between Treatments and Short-Term Biochemical Improvements and Clinical Outcomes in Post-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 Inflammatory Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The mortality rate of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the state of S?o Paulo is highly heterogeneous.

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Tertiary referral centre for ECMO. PATIENTS: 115 patients treated with ECMO for refractory heart failure and 57 patients treated with ECMO for refractory respiratory failure. METHODS: We analysed the association between early daily FB versus hospital and 90-day mortality using multivariable logistic regression model, Cox proportional-hazards model and propensity score. RESULTS: We obtained detailed demographic, clinical, and biochemical data, daily FB, and continuous renal replacement days. Fifty-seven per cent of patients had acute kidney injury (AKI) at ECMO initiation, and 60 % (n = 103) of patients received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) during ECMO course, beginning at a median of 1 (0C3.5) days after ECMO initiation. Overall 90-day mortality was 24 %. Survivors exhibited lower daily FB from day 3 to day 5. After adjustments, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III, CRRT during the first 3 days, major bleeding event at day 1 and positive FB on day 3 were independent predictors of 90-day mortality. Positive FB at ECMO day 3 remained an independent predictor of hospital and 90-day mortality, regardless of the statistical model used or the inclusion of a propensity score to have positive FB.

While do-not-resuscitate (DNR) decisions are made in advance in certain medical situations, in particular in the setting of poor prognosis like in advanced oncology, the discussion of DNR in relation to acute medical conditions, the COVID-19 pandemic in this example, might impose ethical dilemmas to the patient and family, healthcare providers (HCPs) including physicians and nurses, and to the institution. The literature on DNR decisions in the more recent pandemics and outbreaks is scarce. DNR was only discussed amid the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, with clear global recommendations. The unprecedented condition of the COVID-19 pandemic leaves healthcare systems worldwide confronting tough decisions. DNR has been implemented in some countries where the healthcare system is limited in capacity to admit, and thus intubating and resuscitating patients when needed is jeopardized. Some countries were forced to adopt a unilateral DNR policy for certain patient groups. Younger age was used as a discriminator in some, while general medical condition with anticipated good outcome was used in others. The ethical challenge of how to balance patient autonomy vs. beneficence, equality vs. equity, is a pressing concern. In the current difficult situation, when cases top 100 million globally and the death toll surges past 2.7 million, difficult decisions are to be made. Societal rather than individual benefits might prevail.

Acute infections are accompanied by increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). To date, there have been no studies of the rheological properties of blood during the course of digestive tract infections. The aim of our study was to examine the effects of CDI on red blood cell (RBC) rheology, specifically RBC deformability, RBC aggregation, and plasma viscosity. In addition, the activity of glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in RBC was studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS Our study group included 20 patients with CDI, 20 healthy persons comprised the control group. We examined the effects of CDI on the rheology of RBCs, their deformability and aggregation, using a Laser-assisted Optical Rotational Cell Analyzer (LORCA). Plasma viscosity was determined using a capillary tube plasma viscosymeter. Moreover, we estimated the activity of AChE and G6PD in RBC using spectrophotometric method. RESULTS A statistically significant increase was found in the aggregation index, viscosity and activity of G6PD whereas the amount of time to reach half of maximum aggregation (t?) and the amplitude of aggregation (AMP) both showed statistically significantly decreases among patients with CDI compared to the control group. We also observed that the Elongation Index (EI) was decreased when shear stress values were low, between 0.3 Pa and 0.58 Pa, whereas EI was increased for shear stress in the range of 1.13-59.97 Pa. These observations were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS We report for the first time that acute infection of the gastrointestinal tract with Clostridium difficile is associated with abnormalities in rheological properties of blood, increased serum viscosity as well as increased aggregation of RBCs, which correlated with severity of inflammation. These abnormalities may be an additional mechanism causing increased incidence of VTE in CDI.","output":"Rheological properties of erythrocytes in patients infected with Clostridium difficile."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the mechanism of maternal parenting stress on marital satisfaction based on the Vulnerability-Stress-Adaptation Model (VSAM), and draws on the needs theory to explore the role of alone time in marital relationships under different solitude preferences.

The resources are unevenly spread and, in order to be able to meet a potentially increased demand, we have estimated the future need for thrombectomy. METHODS The new treatment recommendations are similar to those that have been in use at the Karolinska University Hospital since 2007. Using our local thrombectomy data (2009-2011), we calculated the proportion of thrombectomies performed at our hospital by level of stroke severity according to the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (0-5, 6-11, 12-19, and 20-35). We then estimated the total number of potential thrombectomies expected in Sweden by extrapolating our treatment proportions to the rest of Sweden through the use of data from the Swedish National Stroke Registry. RESULTS The number of potential thrombectomies would have been more than five times higher (1268 estimated compared with 232 actually reported in the National Stroke Registry) if the new recommendations for thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke had been implemented in 2013 (the year from which we had the most recent available data from the Swedish Stroke Registry).

METHODS: We examined the association between dexamethasone use and mortality at AP-HP Greater Paris University hospitals. Study baseline was defined as the date of hospital admission. The primary endpoint was time to death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received dexamethasone and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusted for patient characteristics (such as age, sex and comorbidity) and clinical and biological markers of clinical severity of COVID-19, and stratified by the need for respiratory support, i.e. mechanical ventilation or oxygen. The primary analysis was a multivariable Cox regression model. RESULTS: Of 12 217 adult patients hospitalized with a positive COVID-19 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test, 171 (1.4%) received dexamethasone orally or by intravenous perfusion during the visit. Among patients who required respiratory support, the end-point occurred in 10/63 (15.9%) patients who received dexamethasone and 298/1129 (26.4%) patients who did not.

Organic dust (OD) is a major contaminant in the animal production industry and is central to the respiratory symptoms in the exposed individuals. However, the exposure effects on the brain remain largely unknown. OD exposure is known to induce a pro-inflammatory phenotype in microglial cells. Further, blocking cytoplasmic NOX-2 using mitoapocynin (MA) partially curtail the OD exposure effects. Therefore, using a mouse model, we tested a hypothesis that inhaled OD induces neuroinflammation and sensory-motor deficits. Mice were administered with either saline, fluorescent lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), or OD extract intranasally daily for 5 days a week for 5 weeks. The saline or OD extract-exposed mice received either a vehicle or MA (3 mg/kg) orally for 3 days/week for 5 weeks. We quantified inflammatory changes in the upper respiratory tract and brain, assessed sensory-motor changes using rotarod, open-field, and olfactory test, and quantified neurochemicals in the brain. Inhaled fluorescent LPS (FL-LPS) was detected in the nasal turbinates and olfactory bulbs. OD extract exposure induced atrophy of the olfactory epithelium with reduction in the number of nerve bundles in the nasopharyngeal meatus, loss of cilia in the upper respiratory epithelium with an increase in the number of goblet cells, and increase in the thickness of the nasal epithelium. Interestingly, OD exposure increased the expression of HMGB1, 3- nitrotyrosine (NT), IBA1, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), hyperphosphorylated Tau (p-Tau), and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells in the brain. Further, OD exposure decreased time to fall (rotarod), total distance traveled (open-field test), and olfactory ability (novel scent test). Oral MA partially rescued olfactory epithelial changes and gross congestion of the brain tissue. MA treatment also decreased the expression of HMGB1, 3-NT, IBA1, GFAP, and p-Tau, and significantly reversed exposure induced sensory-motor deficits. Neurochemical analysis provided an early indication of depressive behavior. Collectively, our results demonstrate that inhalation exposure to OD can cause sustained neuroinflammation and behavior deficits through lung-brain axis and that MA treatment can dampen the OD-induced inflammatory response at the level of lung and brain.","output":"Mitoapocynin Attenuates Organic Dust Exposure-Induced Neuroinflammation and Sensory-Motor Deficits in a Mouse Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bats (Chiroptera) host major human pathogenic viruses including corona-, paramyxo, rhabdo- and filoviruses.

None of the cells were sensitive to infection by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine coronavirus, or to infection mediated by the Spike (S) protein of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) incorporated into pseudotypes based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The resistance to infection was overcome if cells were transfected to express the respective cellular receptor, porcine aminopeptidase N for TGEV or angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 for SARS-CoV. VSV pseudotypes containing the S proteins of two bat SARS-related CoV (Bg08 and Rp3) were unable to infect any of the six tested bat cell lines. By contrast, viral pseudotypes containing the surface protein GP of Marburg virus from the family Filoviridae infected all six cell lines though at different efficiency. Notably, all cells were sensitive to infection by two paramyxoviruses (Sendai virus and bovine respiratory syncytial virus) and three influenza viruses from different subtypes. These results indicate that bat cells are more resistant to infection by coronaviruses than to infection by paramyxoviruses, filoviruses and influenza viruses.

METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we included 976 patients (age 61  17 years, 62% male) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 3CApril 4, 2020 and underwent chest imaging. 3836 radiographs from 976 patients and 105 CTs from 88 patients were reviewed for intrathoracic complications, including pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, lobar collapse, pleural effusion, and pneumatocele formation. RESULTS: There was a high rate of intrathoracic complications (197/976, 20%). Pleural effusion was the most common complication (168/976, 17%). Pneumothorax (30/976, 3%) and pneumatoceles (9/88, 10%) were also frequent. History of hypertension and high initial CXR severity score were independent risk factors for complications. Patients with any intrathoracic complication during admission had an over 11-fold risk of ICU admission (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 11.2, p < 0.0001) and intubation (aOR 12.4, p < 0.0001), over 50% reduction in successful extubation (aOR 0.49, p = 0.02) and longer length of stay (median 13 versus 5 days, p < 0.0001). There was no difference in overall survival between patients with and without any complication (log-rank p = 0.94). CONCLUSION: In COVID-19 patients who underwent chest imaging, 1 in 5 patients have an intrathoracic complication, which are associated with higher level of care and prolonged hospital stay. Hypertension history and high CXR severity score confer an increased risk of complication.

We develop a novel method, called gene set compactness (GSC), that contrasts the relative positions of disease-associated genes across 73 cell-type-specific interactomes to map genes associated with 196 diseases to the cell types they affect. We conduct text-mining of the PubMed database to produce an independent resource of disease-associated cell types, which we use to validate our method. RESULTS: The GSC method successfully identifies known diseaseCcell-type associations, as well as highlighting associations that warrant further study. This includes mast cells and multiple sclerosis, a cell population currently being targeted in a multiple sclerosis phase 2 clinical trial.

This virus causes an economically and, possibly, environmentally, important loss in the poultry industry. Therefore, research into the avian coronavirus in various species of birds is required. The Eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) is an endemic bird to Indonesia and Northern Australia and often kept as pets. At present, there has been limited information about avian coronavirus infection among birds. This study aimed to determine the presence of and to characterize avian coronavirus isolated from Eclectus parrots in Indonesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cloacal swab samples were taken from 10 healthy Eclectus parrots (E. roratus). Each isolate was propagated into specific pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs. The presence of avian coronavirus was determined using three sets of primers targeting the 3 untranslated region (3-UTR) of avian coronavirus (UTR41+/11?), the N gene of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBVN+/?), and the S1 gene of the IBV (XCE2+/XCE2?). The infectious bronchitis vaccine strain H120 was used as a positive control. Resulting positive bands were sequenced for the S1 gene. RESULTS: None of the isolates was positive for the 3-UTR, four isolates were positive for the N gene of infectious bronchitis, and two isolates were positive for the S1 gene of the IBV. However, only one isolate (parrot/Indonesia/BX9/16) was sequenced for the partial S1 gene with primers XCE2+/XCE2?. The partial nucleotide sequence of this isolate showed 100% homology with the IBV GI-13 lineage, specifically with a field isolate of the 4/91 variant 1 Israel and the 4/91 vaccine on the hypervariable region 3 site of the S1 gene.

The Tunisian ministry of health established a protocol planning the sample collection from the patients at their location. A triage score is first assigned to each patient according to the symptoms he is showing, and his health conditions. Then, given the limited number of the available ambulances in each area, the location of the patients and the capacity of the nearby hospitals for receiving the testing samples, an ambulance scheduling and routing plan needs to be established so that specimens can be transferred to hospitals in short time. In this paper, we propose to model this problem as a Multi-Origin-Destination Team Orienteering Problem (MODTOP). The objective is to find the optimal one day tour plan for the available ambulances that maximizes the collected scores of visited patients while respecting duration and capacity constraints. To solve this NP-hard problem, two highly effective approaches are proposed which are Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (HGA) and Memetic Algorithm (MA). The HGA combines (i) a k-means construction method for initial population generation and (ii) a one point crossover operator for solution recombination. The MA is an improvement of HGA that integrates an effective local search based on three different neighborhood structures. Computational experiments, supported by a statistical analysis on benchmark data sets, illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approaches. HGA and MA reached the best known solutions in 54.7% and 73.5% of instances, respectively. Likewise, MA reached a relative error of 0.0675% and performed better than four existing approaches.

Methods that do not explicitly account for disease prevalence and uncertainty therein can lead to significant classification errors. We present a novel method that leverages optimal decision theory to address this problem. As a preliminary step, we develop an analysis that uses an assumed prevalence and conditional probability models of diagnostic measurement outcomes to define optimal (in the sense of minimizing rates of false positives and false negatives) classification domains. Critically, we demonstrate how this strategy can be generalized to a setting in which the prevalence is unknown by either: (i) defining a third class of hold-out samples that require further testing;or (ii) using an adaptive algorithm to estimate prevalence prior to defining classification domains. We also provide examples for a recently published SARS-CoV-2 serology test and discuss how measurement uncertainty (e.g. associated with instrumentation) can be incorporated into the analysis. We find that our new strategy decreases classification error by up to a decade relative to more traditional methods based on confidence intervals.

Surgery is the traditional treatment; however, recent studies have indicated that an alternative to surgerycollagenase clostridium histolyticum (collagenase)is better than a placebo in the treatment of Dupuytrens contracture. There is however no robust randomised controlled trial that provides a definitive answer on the clinical effectiveness of collagenase compared with limited fasciectomy surgery. Dupuytrens intervention surgery vs collagenase trial (DISC) trial was therefore designed to fill this evidence gap. METHODS/DESIGN: The DISC trial is a multi-centre pragmatic two-arm parallel-group, randomised controlled trial. Participants will be assigned 1:1 to receive either collagenase injection or surgery (limited fasciectomy). We aim to recruit 710 adult participants with Dupuytrens contracture. Potential participants will be identified in primary and secondary care, screened by a delegated clinician and if eligible and consenting, baseline data will be collected and randomisation completed. The primary outcome will be the self-reported patient evaluation measure assessed 1 year after treatment. Secondary outcome measures include the Unit Rhumatologique des Affections de la Main Scale, the Michigan Hand Questionnaire, EQ-5D-5L, resource use, further procedures, complications, recurrence, total active movement and extension deficit, and time to return to function. Given the limited evidence comparing recurrence rates following collagenase injection and limited fasciectomy, and the importance of a return to function as soon as possible for patients, the associated measures for each will be prioritised to allow treatment effectiveness in the context of these key elements to be assessed. An economic evaluation will assess the cost-effectiveness of treatments, and a qualitative sub-study will assess participants experiences and preferences of the treatments. DISCUSSION: The DISC trial is the first randomised controlled trial, to our knowledge, to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of collagenase compared to limited fasciectomy surgery for patients with Dupuytrens contracture.

METHOD This was a prospective, open-label, 4-week randomized controlled trial. The primary end points of the study were changes in signs associated with critical colonization and in wound surface areas. All subjects were evaluated at weeks 0, 2, and 4 at the end of the study. SUBJECT AND SETTINGS: Participants between 18 and 85 years of age were recruited from 2 wound care clinics in Canada. The study was reviewed and approved by research ethics boards. DATA ANALYSIS Analyses of this study were carried out based on intent-to-treat principle; t tests were used to determine if the means were statistically different between treatment groups. RESULTS Thirty-four subjects participated and completed in the study. In the control group, the mean infection checklist score was 2.2 at baseline and 2.3 at week 4 (t9 = -0.36, P = .73). In the silver alginate powder group, the infection score reduced from 3.3 at baseline to 1.3 at week 4; the result was significant (t23 = 7.62, P < .00). The difference in average surface reduction over time between the 2 groups was statistically significant (t32 = 3.56, P < .001).

The COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity to obtain a deeper understanding of nurses willingness to care for patients during crisis. Objective: To elucidate clinical expressions of ontological situational ethics through nurses willingness to work during a pandemic. Research design, participants and context: A qualitative study with an interpretive design was applied. Twenty nurses who worked in intensive care unit at two Swedish hospitals during the first, second, and third waves of the COVID-19 pandemic were interviewed. The analysis was interpretative and applied a theoretical ethics perspective. Ethical considerations: The study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority and informed consent was obtained from all participants. Findings: From a philosophical perspective, the nurses expressed sovereign life expressions of mercy and compassion, which arose spontaneously in response to seeing vulnerable fellow humans. They referenced the nurse inside me and their choice of profession as motives to provide care. Ontological situational ethics in culture and norms were noted in the constructs of competence, responsibility, solidarity with colleagues and organization; and interest and learning were driving forces. Ethical demand was evident when nurses expressed ideas of meaningfulness in helping their fellow humans; but themes of ambiguity, exhaustion and unwillingness were also present. Conclusions: The nurses showed a high willingness to care for patients during a crisis. Responding to the ethical demand and to care for vulnerable human beings while risking their own health and lives could be interpreted as an inter-human vocation.

Inflammatory conditions are characterized by increased population of CD86+ve M1 cells and a therapeutic strategy to polarize microglial cells towards CD206+ve M2 cells is the need of hour. In this paper we analyzed A: whether the level of PP2A is altered in CD86+ve cells, B: whether FTY720, a known modulator of PP2A, is able to restore the level of PP2A in inflamed CD86+ve cells. Results revealed that PP2A activity was significantly diminished in inflamed cells but the surprising observation was the cell viability of only 35.99% upon FTY720 treatment in inflamed cells lacking basal PP2A activity. A sharp increase at mRNA level of CD95 and ASK-1 indicated that apoptosis occurred in these cells through CD95/ASK-1/JNK pathway. Importantly, flow cytometric analysis revealed apoptosis of not only CD86+ve cells but also CD206+ve cells. Previous studies have reported that FTY720 polarizes microglial cells towards M2 states; however apoptosis of M2 cells was not studied. As western blot analysis revealed that FTY720 failed to completely restore PP2A, another PP2A modulator, Memantine, was used for co-treatment. Upon co-treatment, the level of PP2A was completely restored and also viability of microglial cells was significantly improved with a significant reduction in apoptosis of M2 cells.

We collected our data using a self-administered structured questionnaire via email and online social media platforms. We analyzed our data using descriptive statistics and regression analysis (p<0.05). RESULTS: Close to three-fourth of HCWs (n=375, 72.7%) were knowledgeable regarding COVID-19. Doctors were more knowledgeable than community health workers and laboratory technicians (AOR= 2.48, 95% CI: 1.16C5.31, p=0.019) regarding COVID-19.

METHODS: Prospectively identified adult patients meeting the Berlin definition of ARDS between 1st January 2014 and 13th December 2016 were analyzed. Oxygen exposure variables were collected at 6-hourly intervals. The primary exposure was the average time-weighted partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO(2)) calculated over a maximum of 7 days from meeting ARDS criteria. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the impact of exposure variables on clinical outcomes. Results are presented as odds ratio [95% confidence interval]. RESULTS: 202 patients were included in the final analysis. Overall ICU mortality was 31%. The average time-weighted PaO(2) during the first 7 days of ARDS was similar between non-survivors and survivors (11.3 kPa [10.2, 12.5] (84.8 mmHg [76.5, 93.8]) vs. 11.9 kPa [10.9, 12.6] (89.3 mmHg [81.8, 94.5]); p = 0.08).

Addressing these comorbidities therapeutically in this pandemic includes continuity in respective disease control treatment plans with the use of pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) with a spacer rather than nebulizers or keeping the low incidence of exacerbations by inhaled/oral corticosteroid and/or Montelukast in children with asthma is recommended. In the case of T1-DM, blood glucose of 70-144mg/dL and &lt;0.6 mmol/L of blood ketone levels to be maintained without stopping Insulin dosing should be followed. Conclusion: Elevating the immunity with regular telemedicine and proper adherence to a prescribed action plan can address the present state of infection in children with asthma or T1-DM, or both.","output":"Pathophysiological association of covid-19 with type i diabetes mellitus and asthma in the pediatric population and its management strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter focuses on Closteroviridae family whose member genuses are Closterovirus, Ampelovirus, and Crinivirus. The virions are helically constructed filaments with a pitch of the primary helix in the range of 3.4C3.8 nm, containing about 10 protein subunits per turn of the helix and showing a central hole of 3C4 nm. The very flexuous and open structure of the particles is the most conspicuous trait of members of the family. The virions have a diameter of about 12 nm and their length ranges from 650 nm in case of species with fragmented genome, to over 2000 nm in case of species with monopartite genome. The fragility of virions and a tendency to end-to-end aggregation contribute to the fact that a range of lengths is often given for single viruses. The virions of several species are degraded by CsCl and are unstable in high salt concentration, resist moderately high temperatures and organic solvents, but are sensitive to RNase and chelation. Regardless of the genome type, monopartite or fragmented, virions contain a single molecule of linear, positive sense, single stranded RNA, constituting 5C6% of the particle weight. The structural proteins of most members of the family consist of a major CP and of a diverged copy of it denoted minor CP (CPm), with a size ranging from 22 to 46 kDa (CP) and 23 to 80 kDa (CPm). The members of the family have one of the largest genomes among plant viruses because of sequence duplication and acquisition of nonviral coding sequences such as protease, and HSP70 protein via RNA recombination.","output":"Closteroviridae"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to concerns around its subsequent impact on patients with non-COVID-19 diseases, and the health-seeking behavior of such patients must be investigated.Methods: Taking advantage of the remote ECG system covering 278 medical institutions throughout Shanghai, the numbers of hospital visits with ECG examinations during the lockdown (between January 23 and April 7, 2020), post-lockdown (between April 8 and December 31, 2020) and post-epidemic (between January 23 and April 7, 2021) periods were analyzed and compared against those during the same periods of the preceding years (2018 and 2019).Findings: Compared with those of the same period during pre-COVID years, the number of hospital visits decreased during the lockdown (a 38% reduction), followed by a rebound post-lockdown (a 17% increase) and a fall to the baseline level of the post-epidemic period. This decrease-rebound-fallback pattern was largely attributed to the dynamics of visits to community clinics rather than academic hospitals. The number of new COVID-19 cases or deaths announced on a given day correlated negatively with hospital visits during the same day and for the following 42 days, with the correlation at its most prominent at seven days. Hospital visit dynamics differed for various cardiovascular diseases. Whereas hospital visits for sinus bradycardia exhibited a typical decrease-rebound-fallback pattern, hospital visits for ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction did not fall during the lockdown period but did exhibit a subsequent increase during the post-lockdown period. By comparison, the volume for ventricular tachycardia remained constant throughout this entire period.Interpretation: The health-seeking behavior of patients with cardiovascular diseases exhibited a decrease-rebound-fallback pattern following the COVID-19 lockdowns. Hospital visits for diseases with more severe symptoms were less influenced by the lockdowns, showing a resilient demand for healthcare.Funding: Shanghai Hospital Development Center, National Natural Science Foundation of China, Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission, and Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine.

Home quarantine, web-based classes, and the stress surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic may have triggered an increased incidence of mental health problems among medical students. Although there have been increasing amounts of literature on depression among medical students, studies focusing on positive psychological resources, such as resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, still need to be expanded. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess depression among medical students who are taking web-based classes during the COVID-19 pandemic and to investigate the role of coping styles as mediators between resilience and depression. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 666 medical students involving stratified sampling in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China, was completed between March 20 and April 10, 2020. The participants responded to a self-administered, smartphone-based questionnaire, which included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire, and Ego Resilience 89 Scale. Hierarchical linear regression and structural equation modeling were used in this study. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression among the participants was 9.6% (64/666) in this study. The regression analysis revealed that grade (the year in which the medical student was in training) (P=.013), how well students adapted to web-based classes (P<.001), their levels of resilience (P=.04), and their coping styles were independent predictors for depression (P<.001). Resilience and positive coping styles were negatively related to depression (resilience: P=.04; positive coping styles: P<.001), and negative coping styles were positively related to depression (P<.001). The structural equation modeling analysis showed that the effect of resilience on depression was partially mediated by coping styles (P=.007). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, it was found that the prevalence of depression was slightly low and coping styles mediated the association between resilience and depression among medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings have significant implications for future studies. Future studies and interventions should aim to improve resilience and promote positive coping styles.","output":"Coping Styles for Mediating the Effect of Resilience on Depression Among Medical Students in Web-Based Classes During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Questionnaire Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After four months of silence before a new incursion of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS), world wide investigators specially from Asia had have to face a coronavirus capable of great spreading and inducing high morbidity.

Objective: Primary: To assess the durability of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 reinfection among initially unvaccinated individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondary: Evaluate the crude SARS-CoV-2 reinfection rate and associated characteristics. Design and Setting: Retrospective observational study of HealthVerity data among 144,678,382 individuals, during the pandemic era through April 2021. Participants: Individuals studied had SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic or antibody index test results from February 29 through December 9, 2020, with []365 days of pre-index continuous closed medical enrollment, claims, or electronic health record activity. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Rates of reinfection among index-positive individuals were compared to rates of infection among index-negative individuals. Factors associated with reinfection were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. For both objectives, the outcome was a subsequent positive molecular diagnostic test result. Results: Among 22,786,982 individuals with index SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test data (2,023,341 index positive), the crude rate of reinfection during follow-up was significantly lower (9.89/1,000-person years) than that of primary infection (78.39/1,000 person years). Consistent with prior findings, the risk of reinfection among index-positive individuals was 87% lower than the risk of infection among index-negative individuals (hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.13, 0.13). The cumulative incidence of reinfection among index-positive individuals and infection among index-negative individuals was 0.85% (95% CI: 0.82%, 0.88%) and 6.2% (95% CI: 6.1%, 6.3%), respectively, over follow-up of 375 days. The duration of protection against reinfection was stable over the median 5 months and up to 1-year follow-up interval. Factors associated with an increased reinfection risk included older age, comorbid immunologic conditions, and living in congregate care settings; healthcare workers had a decreased reinfection risk. Conclusions and Relevance: This large US population-based study demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is uncommon among individuals with laboratory evidence of a previous infection. Protection from SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is stable up to one year. Reinfection risk was primarily associated with age 85+ years, comorbid immunologic conditions and living in congregate care settings; healthcare workers demonstrated a decreased reinfection risk.

METHODS: We used a well-established golden Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 model. We placed SARS-CoV-2-challenged index hamsters and na?ve hamsters into closed system units each comprising two different cages separated by a polyvinyl chloride air porous partition with unidirectional airflow within the isolator. The effect of a surgical mask partition placed in between the cages was investigated. Besides clinical scoring, hamster specimens were tested for viral load, histopathology, and viral nucleocapsid antigen expression. RESULTS: Non-contact transmission was found in 66.7% (10/15) of exposed na?ve hamsters. Surgical mask partition for challenged index or na?ve hamsters significantly reduced transmission to 25% (6/24, P=0.018).

METHOD: At the beginning of the pandemic, individuals over the age of 18 participated in this cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire. Demographic information (age, gender, education level, place of residence and occupation), anthropometric data (reported weight and height);nutritional behavior information (number of meals per day, changes in consumption of various foods, use of nutritional supplements, etc.) and changes in lifestyle habits were requested from the participations. In addition, the Healthy Nutrition Attitude Scale (ASHN) was used to determine the healthy eating attitudes of the participants. RESULTS: A total of 432 volunteers participated in the study. It was revealed that body weight increased in 38.0% of the participants and activity level decreased in 73.1% of them during the initial stage of the pandemic. Nevertheless, 44.7% of participants reported increased sleep time, 77.8% reported increased social media use, and 66.7% reported increased stress and anxiety. It was found that the most commonly used nutritional supplements during this period were vitamin C, vitamin D and multivitamin complex.

METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 HCWs deployed to the frontline for an extended period to provide acute COVID-19 related care. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed thematically. RESULTS: HCWs demonstrated heightened self-confidence and readiness to deal with public health emergencies owing to the ramped-up efforts in infrastructure for outbreak management and pre-emptive infectious disease training. Despite overall confidence, deployed HCWs had to adopt various coping mechanisms to sustain resilience during the prolonged pandemic. Main themes on coping centred around the value of team leaders and support from family members as an effective buffer for work-induced stress while institution-based counseling services and welfare were viewed as important for fostering the internal locus of control and wellbeing. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that strategies such as on-the-job training, continuous education and improved communication would be essential to maintain resilience of deployed HCWs. Considerations should be also given to the swift implementation of blended wellness support comprising digital and in-person counseling to sustain wellbeing and prepare for endemic COVID-19.","output":"Experience of Living with COVID-19: Personal Preparedness and Coping Mechanism Among Deployed Healthcare Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This personal viewpoint, written by a neurologist with Parkinson disease (PD), is to provide a patient's perspective, to accompany the clinical perspective in this issue of the Intenal Medicine Journal entitled 'Approach to the patient with early stage Parkinson disease'.

These antibodies activate platelets via platelet FcIIa receptors, with platelet activation greatly enhanced by PF4. Here we summarize the current concepts in the pathogenesis of VITT. We first address parallels between heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and VITT, and provide recent findings on binding of PF4 to adenovirus particles and non-assembled adenovirus proteins in the two adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccines, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Ad26.COV2.S. Further, we discuss the potential role of vaccine constituents such as glycosaminoglycans, EDTA, polysorbate 80, human cell-line proteins and nucleotides as potential binding partners of PF4. The immune response towards PF4 in VITT is likely triggered by a proinflammatory milieu. Human cell-line proteins, non-assembled virus proteins, and potentially EDTA may contribute to the proinflammatory state. The transient nature of the immune response towards PF4 in VITT makes it likely thatas in HITmarginal zone B cells are key for antibody production. Once high-titer anti-PF4 antibodies have been formed 5-20 days after vaccination, they activate platelets and granulocytes. Activated granulocytes undergo NETosis and the released DNA also forms complexes with PF4, which fuels the Fc receptor-dependent cell activation process, ultimately leading to massive thrombin generation. Finally, we summarize our initial observations indicating that VITT-like antibodies might also be present in rare patients with recurrent venous and arterial thrombotic complications, independent of vaccination.","output":"Pathogenesis of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Previous research suggests that governments usually gain support during crises such as the Covid\\\\19.

RESULTS: The strength analysis supported previous studies that describing the PM with positive words was strongly associated with vote intention. Furthermore, a change in the direction of the attitudes from good to honest was found. A new finding was that the pandemic was associated with an increase in polarization.

The associations between impulsivity facets and SAM (or concurrent alcohol and marijuana, CAM) use have been analyzed in North American samples. These topics, however, remain unexplored in South American samples. This study assessed if internalizing symptoms, five impulsivity dimensions, and emotional regulation strategies differentiate between participants who reported last 2-month SAM use, CAM use, alcohol, or marijuana only use, or that reported no substance use. Methods: A sample of 1057 Argentinian citizens answered an online survey. A multinominal logistic regression was conducted on drug use membership. Results: Circa 25% of the sample reported SAM use. Higher sensation seeking differentiated between SAM use versus no substance use, and those with lower sensation seeking were more likely to be classified into the alcohol-only group or into the nonuse group, than into the SAM use group. Stress scores uniquely predicted membership into the alcohol-only category. Those with lower use of emotional suppression were more likely than nonusers to be classified in all drug use categories, except CAM use. Higher emotional suppression scores were associated with membership into the nonuse group or the alcohol-only group, when compared to the SAM use group. Hazardous drinking was significantly greater in SAM than in alcohol-only users.

OBJECTIVES To examine the effects of canned beans (daily rotation of black, navy, pinto, dark red kidney, white kidney) in 1-cup (1CB, 180 g) and ?-cup (?CB, 90 g) daily amounts compared with a 1-cup white rice (WR) control on serum lipid and glycemic biomarkers in adults with elevated LDL cholesterol. METHODS Adults [n = 73, mean  SD age: 48.1  14.2 y; BMI (in kg/m2): 25.9  4.22; fasting serum LDL cholesterol: 3.0-5.0 mmol/L] consumed 1CB, ?CB, and WR for 4-wk treatment periods separated by 4-wk washouts in a multicenter, randomized, crossover study. Fasting serum LDL cholesterol (primary outcome) and other lipids and glycemic biomarkers (secondary outcomes) were measured on study days 1 and 29 of each treatment period with study day 29 values compared using repeated-measures ANCOVA, including study day 1 values as covariates. RESULTS Treatment completion was n = 66 for 1CB, n = 68 for ?CB, and n = 64 for WR. Total cholesterol on study day 29 was lower for 1CB (P = 0.04) but not ?CB (P = 0.77) compared with WR (-5.46%, -2.74%, -0.65% changes from study day 1, respectively) and did not differ between 1CB and ?CB (P = 0.17).

During the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals began to re-evaluate the level of risk associated with everyday behaviors. But what about risks associated with typical risk-taking behaviors? In the present study, 248 undergraduate student participants completed measures of impulsivity, behavioral activation and inhibition, propensity to take risks, numeracy, and perceptions of and involvement in both risk-taking behavior and health promoting behavior (e.g., blood donation, registering as an organ donor, vaccination). Our study revealed that higher behavioral inhibition and greater propensity to take risks predicted greater likelihood of involvement in COVID-19-related risk behaviors, even after accounting for perceived risks and benefits of the behavior. Greater likelihood of involvement in social risk behaviors was predicted by greater numeracy and risk-taking propensity. Identifying as male, a greater propensity to take risks, and greater impulsivity predicted increased health/safety risk behaviors. Younger age, lower risk-taking propensity, and lower impulsivity were associated with a greater likelihood of donating blood. For the likelihood of registering to become an organ donor, increasing risk perception, both before and during the pandemic, was associated with greater likelihood of registering, but greater risk-taking propensity was associated with a decreased likelihood of organ donation registration. For flu vaccination, a greater propensity to take risks was associated with a greater likelihood of flu vaccination during the 2020C2021 flu season.

Given the robust behavioral association between DRD and addictive behavior, there is an expanding literature investigating the differences in the functional and structural correlates of DRD in the brain between addicted and healthy individuals. However, there has yet to be a systematic review which characterizes differences in regional brain activation, functional connectivity, and structure and places them in the larger context of the DRD literature. The objective of this systematic review is to summarize and critically appraise the existing literature examining differences between addicted and healthy individuals in the neural correlates of DRD using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). METHODS A systematic search strategy will be implemented that uses Boolean search terms in PubMed/MEDLINE and PsycINFO, as well as manual search methods, to identify the studies comprehensively. This review will include studies using MRI or fMRI in humans to directly compare brain activation, functional connectivity, or structure in relation to DRD between addicted and healthy individuals or continuously assess addiction severity in the context of DRD. Two independent reviewers will determine studies that meet the inclusion criteria for this review, extract data from included studies, and assess the quality of included studies using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Then, narrative review will be used to explicate the differences in structural and functional correlates of DRD implicated by the literature and assess the strength of evidence for this conclusion. DISCUSSION This review will provide a needed critical exegesis of the MRI studies that have been conducted investigating brain differences in addictive behavior in relation to healthy samples in the context of DRD. This will provide clarity on the elements of neural activation, connectivity, and structure that are most implicated in the differences in DRD seen in addicted individuals.

However, the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 in hemodialysis patients is still poorly characterized. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 on hemodialysis patients. METHOD: A retrospective observational study was conducted on 66 hemodialysis patients. Nasopharyngeal swab PCR and serology for SARS-CoV-2, blood analysis, chest radiography, treatment, and outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: COVID-19 was diagnosed in 50 patients: 38 (76%) were PCR-positive and 12 (24%) were PCR-negative but developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. By contrast, 17% of PCR-positive patients failed to develop detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Among PCR-positive patients, 5/38 (13%) were asymptomatic, while among PCR-negative patients 7/12 (58%) were asymptomatic (p = 0.005) for a total of 12/50 (24%) asymptomatic patients. No other differences were found between PCR-positive and PCR-negative patients. No differences in potential predisposing factors were found between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients except for a lower use of ACE inhibitors among asymptomatic patients. Asymptomatic patients had laboratory evidence of milder disease such as higher lymphocyte counts and oxygen saturation and lower troponin I and interleukin-6 levels than symptomatic patients. Overall mortality was 7/50 (14%) and occurred only in symptomatic PCR-positive patients in whom mortality was 7/33 (21%).

METHODS Serum MBL and Complement levels were determined for 286 Brazilian adult SLE patients and 301 healthy Brazilian adults as controls. MBL deficiency was classified as mild (<1000 and 500g/L), moderate (<500 and 100g/L) or severe (<100g/L). RESULTS SLE patients presented higher frequency of mild and moderate MBL deficiency compared to controls. SLE patients with MBL deficiency presented higher frequency of lupus nephritis compared to those without MBL deficiency. MBL deficiency was not associated with any other clinical manifestation, use of immunosuppressant therapy, disease activity, disease severity serum or Complement levels.

This leads to stress and subsequently to pecking and cannibalism. Environmental enrichment is suggested to reduce stress and feather pecking, thus leading to an increase of the overall flock health. However, the effect of increasing age on the use of enrichment elements and on the behavior repertoire as well as its correlation with health parameters has scarcely been studied. Therefore, our objective was to investigate the influence of environmental enrichment on the behavioral repertoire and on health parameters of turkeys. In 3 consecutive trials, female turkeys were housed up to 12 wk either in an unstructured (control group) or enriched environment (EE group) featuring elevated plateaus at different levels (turkey tree). Behavior parameters, clinical health, and immune parameters were determined at selected time points. The percentage of birds using the turkey tree increased with age up to 55 to 77% at 22 to 30 d post hatch (dph). Thereafter, the number of birds located on the turkey tree decreased to 25 to 32% at 73 to 79 dph. Feather pecking and fighting was significantly lower in the EE group compared to the control group in 2 and 3 trials, respectively (P < 0.05). The integrity of feathers and integument, scored in the head/neck, wing, and tail regions was repeatedly better in the EE birds compared to control birds at most investigated time points (P < 0.05), suggesting a reduction in stress related aggression by the use of the turkey tree. Head pecking, running and flying activity, foraging, and preening were overall comparable between the EE and the control group (P > 0.05). Humoral immunity as determined by vaccination-induced anti-Newcastle disease virus antibody titers was not affected by the turkey tree use. The flow cytometric evaluation of blood monocyte and T-lymphocyte numbers showed no repeatable difference between control and EE groups. Interestingly, compared to the control groups, EE birds displayed significantly higher numbers of circulating MHC class II(+) lymphocytes and lower numbers of thrombocytes at various time points compared to controls (P < 0.05). This study provides clear evidence that environmental enrichment with plateaus not only leads to an altered behavioral repertoire but also modifies some of the investigated immune parameters, implying that EE may have a modulatory effect on turkeys immunity and overall fitness.

Although generic protein composition of RJ has been investigated, little is known about how age-dependent changes on HG secretion affect RJ composition and their biological consequences. In this study, we identified differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) during HG development by using the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling technique. This proteomic method increases the potential for new protein discovery by improving the identification of low quantity proteins. RESULTS: A total of 1282 proteins were identified from five age groups of worker bees, 284 of which were differentially expressed. 43 (15.1%) of the DEPs were identified for the first time. Comparison of samples at day 6, 9, 12, and 16 of development relative to day 3 led to the unambiguous identification of 112, 117, 127, and 127 DEPs, respectively. The majority of these DEPs were up-regulated in the older worker groups, indicating a substantial change in the pattern of proteins expressed after 3 days. DEPs were identified among all the age groups, suggesting that changes in protein expression during HG ontogeny are concomitant with different states of worker development. A total of 649 proteins were mapped to canonical signaling pathways found in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), which were preferentially associated with metabolism and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. More than 10 key high-abundance proteins were involved in signaling pathways related to ribosome function and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. The results were validated by qPCR. CONCLUSION: Our approach demonstrates that HG experienced important changes in protein expression during its ontogenic development, which supports the secretion of proteins involved in diverse functions in adult workers beyond its traditional role in royal jelly production.

Among these confirmed compounds, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of 230 compounds, including 38 approved drugs, have not been previously reported. Chlorprothixene, methotrimeprazine, and piperacetazine were the three most potent FDA approved drugs with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities. These three compounds have not been previously reported to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities, although their antiviral activities against SARS-CoV and Ebola virus have been reported. These results demonstrate that this comprehensive data set of drug repurposing screen for SARS-CoV-2 is useful for drug repurposing efforts including design of new drug combinations for clinical trials.","output":"Drug Repurposing Screen for Compounds Inhibiting the Cytopathic Effect of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inhalation therapy offers several advantages in respiratory disease treatment.

When coupled with the higher-level treatment plant samples, this creates an opportunity for health officials to monitor the spread of the virus at different spatial and temporal scales to inform policy decisions. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of tracking SARS-CoV-2 at the neighborhood, hospital, and nursing home level with the ability to detect one COVID-19 positive out of 60 nursing home residents. The viral load obtained was correlative with the number of COVID-19 patients being treated in the hospital. Sequencing of the samples over time demonstrated that nonsynonymous mutations fluctuate in the viral population, and wastewater-based sequencing could be an efficient approach to monitor for vaccine or convalescent plasma escape mutants, as well as mutations that could reduce the efficacy of diagnostics. Furthermore, while SARS-CoV-2 was detected by untargeted RNA sequencing, qPCR and targeted whole genome amplicon sequencing were more reliable methods for tracking the pandemic.

The value of the ROX index, a validated benchmark for outcomes in HFNO is unknown in CPAP. Objective: Can the ROX, a validated benchmark in HFNO be used for measuring treatment outcomes of CPAP in SARS-COV-2 ARF? Study Design and Methods: A non-randomised prospective protocol driven observational non-intensive care unit study in 130 SARS-COV-2 patients with ARF treated with non-invasive therapy from March 2020 to January 2021. The primary end point was failure of therapy (death or escalation). Secondary outcomes included time to failure including invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death, the effect of escalation to CPAP from HFNO and the utility of ROX in ARF. Results: HFNO was better than CPAP in treating SARS-COV-2 ARF: 17/35 (48.5%) with successful HFNO therapy versus 24/95 (25.2%) with CPAP. The ROX index was more sensitive to outcomes with CPAP compared to HFNO and distinguished treatment failure early at 1, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours with the highest sensitivity at 24 hours (ROX-24h). The AUC for the ROX-24h was 0.77 for HFNO (P<0.0001), and 0.84 for CPAP (P<0.0001). The ROX-24h cut-points predicted failure with HFNO when < 3.9 (PPV 71%, NPV 75%) and CPAP < 4.3 (PPV 75%, NPV 91%). For success, ROX-24h cut-points of 7.6 for HFNO (PPV 85%, NPV 48%) and 6.1 for CPAP (PPV 88%, NPV 62%) were observed. Escalation from HFNO to CPAP was mostly not successful. Conclusion: ARF in SARS-COV-2 can be successfully managed by non-invasive support.

METHOD: We determined BAFF in serum and faeces and faecal calprotectin (CP) in 32 IBD children-16 Crohn's disease (CD) and 16 ulcerative colitis (UC). Twenty-six healthy children and 10 children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were included as controls. RESULTS: No differences were found in serum BAFF between IBD, IBS, and healthy group: 1037.35, 990.9 and 979.8 pg/ml, respectively, all p > 0.05, but faecal BAFF was higher in the IBD group: 15.1, 8.5 and 8.2 pg/ml, respectively, p < 0.05, and higher in the UC group (55.975 pg/ml) compared to the CD group (10.95 pg/ml), p = 0.015. Splitting the IBD group in relation to the CP level, the serum BAFF had no significantly different values between the subgroups, but the faecal BAFF was significantly higher in the >250 g/g subgroup.

ABSTRACT: Dogs have been close human companions for millennia and one would expectaccording to the continuity hypothesis of dreamingthat dogs are also quite common in dreams. Previous studies showed that the percentages of dreams that include dogs range from about 1.5% to 5%, but studies relating waking-life experiences with dogs with dreams about dogs have not been carried out. In total, 1695 persons (960 women, 735 men) completed an online survey that included questions about dreams and waking-life experiences that included dogs. The findings indicate that dogs show up, on average, in about 5% of remembered dreams, but this percentage is much higher in the dreams of dog owners and persons with close contacts with dogs. Moreover, the active time spent with a dog and the proximity during sleep is also related to a higher percentage of dreams that include dogs. Although dreams including dogs are on average more positively toned than dreams in general, about 11% of the dog dreams included threatening dogs. Persons who had negative experiences with dogs in their waking lives reported more threatening dog dreams.

Nevertheless, there are limited data on its feasibility, safety, and physiologic effects. The objective of our study was to assess the tolerability and safety of awake prone positioning in COVID-19 patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. METHODS: This historical cohort study was performed across four hospitals in Calgary, Canada. Included patients had suspected COVID-19 and hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intensive care unit (ICU) consultation, and underwent awake prone positioning. The duration, frequency, tolerability, and adverse events from prone positioning were recorded. Respiratory parameters were assessed before, during, and after prone positioning. The primary outcome was the tolerability and safety of prone positioning. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (n = 12 ICU, n = 5 hospital ward) were included between April and May 2020. The median (range) number of prone positioning days was 1 (1C7) and the median number of sessions was 2 (1C6) per day. The duration of prone positioning was 75 (30C480) min, and the peripheral oxygen saturation was 91% (84C95) supine and 98% (92C100) prone. Limitations to prone position duration were pain/general discomfort (47%) and delirium (6%); 47% of patients had no limitations. Seven patients (41%) required intubation and two patients (12%) died. CONCLUSIONS: In a small sample, prone positioning non-intubated COVID-19 patients with severe hypoxemia was safe; however, many patients did not tolerate prolonged durations. Although patients had improved oxygenation and respiratory rate in the prone position, many still required intubation.

The existing methods for inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) rely mainly on time-course gene expression data. However, most available omics data from cross-sectional studies of cancer patients often lack sufficient temporal information, leading to a key challenge for GRN inference. Through quantifying the latent progression using random walks-based manifold distance, we propose a latent-temporal progression-based Bayesian method, PROB, for inferring GRNs from the cross-sectional transcriptomic data of tumor samples. The robustness of PROB to the measurement variabilities in the data is mathematically proved and numerically verified. Performance evaluation on real data indicates that PROB outperforms other methods in both pseudotime inference and GRN inference. Applications to bladder cancer and breast cancer demonstrate that our method is effective to identify key regulators of cancer progression or drug targets. The identified ACSS1 is experimentally validated to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of bladder cancer cells, and the predicted FOXM1-targets interactions are verified and are predictive of relapse in breast cancer.

While mouse models of OSA are becoming increasingly sophisticated, they generally fail to accurately recapitulate tumor heterogeneity, tumor microenvironment (TME), systemic immune dysfunction, and the clinical features of tumor recurrence, metastases, and chemoresistance, which influence outcome. Pet dogs spontaneously develop OSA with an incidence that is 30-50 times higher than humans. Canine OSA parallels the human disease in its clinical presentation, biological behavior, genetic complexity, and therapeutic management. However, despite therapy, most dogs die from metastatic disease within 1 year of diagnosis. Since OSA occurs in immune-competent dogs, immune factors that sculpt tumor immunogenicity and influence responses to immune modulation are in effect. In both species, immune modulation has shown beneficial effects on patient outcome and work is now underway to identify the most effective immunotherapies, combination of immunotherapies, and correlative biomarkers that will further improve clinical response.

METHODS: Eight electronic databases were searched in January 2021. Original research studies or case reports involving adults with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension were included if caffeine was an intervention and outcomes included symptoms, blood pressure or adverse effects. Relevant studies were screened and underwent qualitative analysis. Insufficient reporting precluded meta-analysis. RESULTS: Five studies were identified: four crossover studies and one case report summation. Study size ranged from 5 to 16 participants. Participants had neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, with a mean standing systolic blood pressure of 86 mmHg. Two studies evaluated caffeine alone. Three studies administered caffeine in combination with ergotamine. Caffeine dose ranged from 100 to 300 mg. Nature and timing of outcomes measured varied between studies, with measurements being recorded from 30 to 480 min after intervention.

Up to 20% of Canadian patients pay for medications out of pocket. We sought to identify strategies that patients and prescribers can employ to reduce these costs. METHODS We collected data from outpatient pharmacies in Hamilton, Ontario. We determined prices for different medications in each of the drug classes recommended for HF with reduced ejection fraction in the Canadian Cardiovascular Society's guidelines. We examined differences in dispensing and delivery fees and inquired about other cost-saving strategies. RESULTS We collected data from 24 different pharmacies, including a selection of hospital-based, independent, and larger chain pharmacies. In the most extreme scenario (i.e., 90-day prescription instead of a 30-day prescription and the least expensive generic drug instead of the most expensive brand name drug), total medication costs can differ by up to $495.56 per month. Costs were affected by choice of agent within a drug class, generic versus brand-name drug, quantity dispensed, dispensing fee, and delivery cost. CONCLUSIONS Prescription content, dispensing practice, and pharmacy choice can remarkably impact out-of-pocket costs for HF medications. Prescribers can reduce costs by writing 90-day prescriptions and choosing the lowest-cost generic drugs in each therapeutic class. Patients should consider the services received for their pharmacy dispensing fees, use free delivery services where needed, and request inexpensive generic drugs.

ObjectiveTo estimate the relative Reporting Odds Ratio of anaphylactic and ana-phylactoid reactions following mRNA vaccination vis-a-vis other vaccinations. DesignReporting case-control study. SettingPersons reporting adverse events following vaccination to VAERS whose reports were received between 01 January 2000 and 02 July 2021, inclusive. PatientsEach case of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reaction was matched with 2.7 unique controls on average, by gender and age rounded to the nearest integer. MeasurementsOverall and stratified Reporting Odds Ratios (ROR) were calculated. Stratified contingency tables were tested for homogeneity using the Breslow-Day procedure, and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistics were calculated to test the hypothesis of a ROR of unity. Results2,665 cases of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions and 7,125 controls of non-anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reports were compared. The ROR of an anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction was 1.325 (95% CI: 1.212 - 1.448, p < 0.001). The matched set of cases and controls revealed an expected inhomogeneity by sex (with women slightly more likely to report anaphylactic presentations) and age band strata (with a bimodal distribution that reflects the common incidence of anaphylactic and allergic pathologies). No significant increase in the risk of anaphylactic adverse events was witnessed among persons who self-reported previous allergic reactions to vaccines. A slightly elevated ROR was observed with patients who reported a history of allergic reactions to NSAIDs and/or fluoroquinolone antibiotics. The precise meaning and relevance of this finding remains to be elucidated. LimitationsAs a reporting study using data from VAERS, our analysis is subject tunder- and overreporting, the extent of each of which is not known with any degree of precision. Since the Emergency Use Authorizations for both mRNA vaccines mandate reporting of all serious adverse events, reporting bias is likely in favour of non-mRNA vaccines, where such reporting is not mandatory in adults. Consequently, this analysis may exaggerate the ROR of anaphylactic and anaphylactoid events associated with mRNA vaccines, which may in reality be significantly lower. ConclusionsmRNA vaccination is not associated with a statistically significant higher risk of reporting an anaphylactic adverse event to VAERS. Anaphylaxis is a serious but very rare complication of all immunisations. No significant increase in reporting odds was found in any age group or gender, nor in most cases of previously known allergic adverse events in relation to vaccines.

Here we have described the use of a noninvasive mask sampling method to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory particles expelled by COVID-19 patients and discussed its relationship to transmission risk.Methods: Respiratory particles of 31 symptomatic patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positivity and 31 asymptomatic healthy volunteers were captured on N-95 masks layered with a gelatin membrane in a 30-minute process that involved talking/reading, coughing, and tidal breathing. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected and quantified using rRT-PCR in the mask and in concomitantly collected nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. The data were analyzed with respect to patient demographics and clinical presentation.Findings: Thirteen of 31(41.9%) patients showed SARS-COV-2 positivity in both the mask and NPS samples, while 16 patients were mask negative but NPS positive. Two patients were both mask and NPS negative. All healthy volunteers except one were mask and NPS negative. The mask positive patients had significantly lower NPS Ct value (26) compared to mask negative patients (30.5) and were more likely to be rapid antigen test positive. The mask positive patients could be further grouped into low emitters (expelling <100 viral copies) and high emitters (expelling >1000 viral copies).Interpretation: The study presents evidence for variation in emission of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles by COVID-19 patients reflecting differences in infectivity and transmission risk among individuals. The results conform to reported secondary infection rates and transmission and also suggest that mask sampling could be explored as an effective tool to assess individual transmission risks, at different time points and during different activities.Funding: Financial support in the undertaking of this study was provided by Godrej Agrovet Limited-Mumbai, Zoroastrian Charity Funds of Hong Kong, Canton and Macao, The Vashketu Foundation-Mumbai.

Although the role of Th1 and CTL responses in the induction of demyelinating disease is controversial, assessment of cytokine sproduced locally in the central nervous system (CNS) during the course of disease and the effects of altered inflammatory cytokine levels strongly support the importance of Th1 responses in this virus-induced demyelinating disease. Induction of various chemokines and cytokines in different glial and antigen presenting cells upon viral infection appears to be an important initiation mechanism for inflammatory Th1 responses in the CNS.

Berbamine significantly decreases the level of LDLR at the plasma membrane by inducing the secretion of LDLR via extracellular vesicles (EVs), thereby inhibiting JEV infection. Mechanistically, berbamine blocks TRPMLs (Ca(2+) permeable non-selective cation channels in endosomes and lysosomes) to compromise the endolysosomal trafficking of LDLR. This leads to the increased secretion of LDLR via EVs and the concomitant decrease in its level at the plasma membrane, thereby rendering cells resistant to JEV infection.

Methods: A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted on 1199 HWs between March and April 2020 in Iran. Data on demographic variables, sources of information about the COVID-19, and the trust level to them were collected using online self-administered questionnaires. The anxiety severity level was assessed using the Zung self-rating anxiety scale. Data were analyzed using simple and multiple linear regression models. Results: The mean age of participants was 32.5  8.79, and 65.7% (n = 763) were male. 30.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) (CI: 27.8%C33.1%) of HWs had mild to moderate, and 21.3% (95% CI: 18.9%C23.7%) had severe and extremely severe levels of anxiety.

Whilst an effective live-attenuated vaccine is available for livestock, there is currently no licensed human RVF vaccine. Replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd) vectors are an ideal platform for development of a human RVF vaccine, given the low prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against them in the human population, and their excellent safety and immunogenicity profile in human clinical trials of vaccines against a wide range of pathogens. METHODS: Here, in BALB/c mice, we evaluated the immunogenicity and efficacy of a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vector, ChAdOx1, encoding the RVF virus envelope glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, which are targets of virus neutralizing antibodies. The ChAdOx1-GnGc vaccine was assessed in comparison to a replication-deficient human adenovirus type 5 vector encoding Gn and Gc (HAdV5-GnGc), a strategy previously shown to confer protective immunity against RVF in mice. RESULTS: A single immunization with either of the vaccines conferred protection against RVF virus challenge eight weeks post-immunization. Both vaccines elicited RVF virus neutralizing antibody and a robust CD8(+) T cell response. CONCLUSIONS: Together the results support further development of RVF vaccines based on replication-deficient adenovirus vectors, with ChAdOx1-GnGc being a potential candidate for use in future human clinical trials.","output":"Immunogenicity and efficacy of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored Rift Valley Fever vaccine in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work, the co-processing of waste surgical masks, waste motor oil, and biomass was investigated to reduce the environmental impacts of the increasing medical-derived plastic pollution as well as to elucidate its effect on the production of chemicals in the fuel range.

Parents responded to a series of questions about their childs play, learning and development during lockdown, and described the impact of the restrictions on their childrens lives. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Findings indicate that most children missed their friends, playing with other children, and the routine and structure of ECEC and school settings. Parents described the negative impact of the closure of these settings on their childrens social and emotional well-being, which they suggested, resulted in tantrums, anxiety, clinginess, boredom, and under-stimulation. However, some parents did report positive aspects of lockdown for their children and the family, including more time to play with siblings and a break from the usual routine. While the findings of the PLEY study indicate that childrens socio-emotional development was severely disrupted during lockdown, with a variety of negative impacts, this experience was not universal.

Even though gait analysis is an objective measure of the neuro-motor system and may provide significant information about the pathophysiology of specific diseases, no studies have investigated the gait characteristics in adults after full recovery from COVID-19. This was a cross-sectional, controlled study that included 12 individuals (mean age, 23.0  4.1 years) with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 history (COVD) and 20 sedentary controls (CONT; mean age, 24.0  3.6 years). Gait was evaluated using inertial sensors on a motorized treadmill. Spatial-temporal gait parameters and gait symmetry were calculated by using at least 512 consecutive steps for each participant. The effect-size analyses were utilized to interpret the impact of the results. Spatial-temporal gait characteristics were comparable between the two groups. The COVD group showed more asymmetrical gait patterns than the CONT group in the double support duration symmetry (p = 0.042), single support duration symmetry (p = 0.006), loading response duration symmetry (p = 0.042), and pre-swing duration symmetry (p = 0.018).

COVID-19 mitigation strategies have unintended consequences on managing chronic conditions such as hypertension, a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and health disparities in the United States. During the first wave of the pandemic in the United States, the combination of observed racial/ethnic inequities in COVID-19 deaths and social unrest reinvigorated a national conversation about systemic racism in health care and society. The 4th Annual University of Utah Translational Hypertension Symposium gathered frontline clinicians, researchers, and leaders from diverse backgrounds to discuss the intersection of these 2 critical social and public health phenomena and to highlight preexisting disparities in hypertension treatment and control exacerbated by COVID-19. The discussion underscored environmental and socioeconomic factors that are deeply embedded in US health care and research that impact inequities in hypertension. Structural racism plays a central role at both the health system and individual levels. At the same time, virtual healthcare platforms are being accelerated into widespread use by COVID-19, which may widen the divide in healthcare access across levels of wealth, geography, and education. Blood pressure control rates are declining, especially among communities of color and those without health insurance or access to health care.

All these processes can be implicated in biological invasions, but only the first defines them. Research on EIDs is embedded within the One Health conceptthe notion that human, animal and ecosystem health are interrelated and that holistic approaches encompassing all three components are needed to respond to threats to human well-being.

The aim of this study was to assess whether percutaneous application of fibrin sealant in the hernia sac after LVHR reduces the incidence and volume of the postoperative seroma, and to analyze whether the percentage of patients achieving complete normalization of the abdominal wall increases. METHODS Prospective and comparative study. Patients were distributed into 2 control-case groups. Group 1 comprised patients submitted to LVHR using the double crown technique and a compressing bandage as the only method for prevent seroma. Group 2 comprised patients admitted to LVHR using the same technique together with percutaneous injection of fibrin sealant in the sac, and later applying the same bandage. Patients were examined clinically and radiologically at 7 days, 1 month, and 3 months after surgery. RESULTS Twenty-five patients were included in each group. There were significant differences in the incidence of seroma by the day 7 after surgery (92% in group 1 vs. 64 % in group 2, p = 0.017) and by 1 month (72% in group 1 vs. 28% in group 2, p = 0.002). The difference was also significant regarding the achievement of normalization of the abdominal wall by day 7 (24% in group 1 vs. 52% in group 2, p = 0.041) and by month 1 (64% in group 1 vs. 88% in group 2, p = 0.047) after operation. Volume of seroma was larger among patients of group 1 after the week (p = 0.002) and 1 month after operation (p = 0.001).

Ninety 1-d-old calves on each of 3 commercial calf ranches were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 groups. Treatment-group calves received 10 g of supplemental immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the form of 70 g of colostrum powder in the milk replacer twice daily for 14 d. The placebo-group calves received a nutritionally equivalent supplement lacking IgG in the milk replacer twice daily for 14 d. Control calves received milk replacer without supplements twice daily. Calves were housed in individual hutches and were weighed on d 1, 28, and 60. Serum was collected on d 2 for serum IgG determination. Daily health evaluations for the first 28 d of life were performed by study personnel blinded to treatment group assignment. Observed illness was treated based on health assessment, rectal temperature, and specific calf ranch protocols. Feed consumption (milk and grain) was recorded. Calves receiving supplemental colostrum had less diarrhea and received fewer antimicrobial treatments than control and placebo calves. The results indicated that calf diarrhea was associated with low serum IgG levels and low-weight calves. Grain consumption and weight gain over the first 28 d of life were significantly greater in colostrum-supplemented calves compared with control calves. No differences in mortality or respiratory disease incidence among groups were detected.

Although the underlying pathogenesis remains unclear, several potential mechanisms have been hypothesized, including oxygen supply/demand imbalance, direct viral cellular damage, systemic inflammatory response with cytokine-mediated injury, microvascular thrombosis, and endothelial dysfunction. The severe hypoxic state, combined with other conditions frequently reported in COVID-19, namely sepsis, tachyarrhythmias, anemia, hypotension, and shock, can induce a myocardial damage due to the mismatch between oxygen supply and demand and results in type 2 myocardial infarction (MI). In addition, COVID-19 promotes atherosclerotic plaque instability and thrombus formation and may precipitate type 1 MI. Patients with severe disease often show decrease in platelets count, higher levels of d-dimer, ultralarge von Willebrand factor multimers, tissue factor, and prolongation of prothrombin time, which reflects a prothrombotic state. An endothelial dysfunction has been described as a consequence of the direct viral effects and of the hyperinflammatory environment. The expression of tissue factor, von Willebrand factor, thromboxane, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promotes the prothrombotic status. In addition, endothelial cells generate superoxide anions, with enhanced local oxidative stress, and endothelin-1, which affects the vasodilator/vasoconstrictor balance and platelet aggregation. The optimal management of COVID-19 patients is a challenge both for logistic and clinical reasons.

This review details the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the aerodynamics, and different modes of transmission (e.g. droplets, droplet nuclei, and aerosol particles). SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by an infected person during activities such as expiration, coughing, sneezing, and talking.

However, as nursing care in general practice advances, comprehensive evaluation of the general practice nurse (GPN) role has not been undertaken. Therefore, processes which enable robust data collection to assess the role and facilitate development of services are required. Nursing quality care metrics are an established mechanism which evaluate quality of care. Nursing quality care process metrics (QCP-Ms) specifically refer to measurement of care delivered directly to patients by nurses, benchmarking these interventions adherence to best practice guidance. The use of nursing metrics has been adopted within seven distinct healthcare settings in Ireland but not general practice. This scoping review is the first stage of a project which aims to inform development and implementation of QCP-Ms by Irish GPNs. Aim: To explore and map the literature regarding the development and implementation of QCP-Ms within general practice settings.

METHOD Bibliographic databases MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycInfo, and CINAHL were searched from inception to February 2020 for randomized controlled trials evaluating treatments for adolescent depression. Ninety-eight trials were included for data extraction and analysis. RESULTS Assessment of outcome measurement instruments, metric strategies, methods of aggregation, and measurement timing, yielded 53 unique outcome definitions of \\"response\\" across 45 trials that assessed response, 47 unique definitions of \\"remission\\" in 29 trials that assessed remission, and 19 unique definitions of \\"recovery\\" across 11 trials that assessed recovery.

The link of these morbidities with renin angiotensin system (RAS) and angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) as the site of the multiplication of COVID-19 has widely been accepted. The objective of this research report was to delineate the clinical characteristics with COVID-19 infection with RAS and to consider its significance not just for the search of novel antiviral drugs, but for the management and prevention of death of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: It was a retrospective case series analysis of demographic and clinical data with associated comorbidities of 206 deaths reported in India up to 10th April 2020. The data were available from the official release from Ministry of Health and Family welfare, Government of India. This was followed by a literature search to correlate the available evidence for their possible relationship with RAS. RESULTS: The demographic data were consistent with those reported from other countries. The death (53.4%) was more common in patients with age above 60 years and men (69.3%) were more susceptible as compared to women (30.68%).We found that 50.5% of the deceased patients had pre-existing comorbidities. Diabetes and hypertension were the major comorbidities in 27.8% and 22.1% of the deceased cases respectively. Although respiratory and cardiac problems were prevalent at the time of death, the pre-existing pulmonary disease was comparatively less prevalent. Only 13.6% of the deceased were having pre-existing respiratory problems and 6.2% had cardiac ailments. We could correlate the reports that RAS plays a significant role in the prognosis of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and hypertension are at greater risk for developing COVID-19 infection.

In addition, using an ordinal logistic regression model for ordered SES outcomes will yield suitable results and conclusions. This study aimed to utilize an ordinal logistic regression model to find the factors associated with SES for households in Tepi town, Southwest Ethiopia. METHODS: The community-based cross-sectional study was carried out in Tepi town, southwest Ethiopia, with data collected from 382 households using a simple random sample technique. The ordinal logistic regression models were evaluated and contrasted for proper accounting of ordinal form. In addition, to come up with a better model, we compared fitted ordinal logistic models with the likelihood-ratio test and AIC criteria. We performed data analysis using STATA version 16. RESULTS: Of all 382 household heads, 170 (45.5%), 120 (31.4%), and 92 (24.1%) were at low, medium, and high SES of households, respectively. According to the result of the multivariable, partial proportional odds model (PPOM), age, education level, family size, and the saving habit were significantly associated with the SES of households at a 5% level of significance.

Of the 22 compounds evaluated, sinapic acid (?9.0 kcal/mol) and p-coumaric acid (?6.3 kcal/mol) had the best and most prominent affinity for NorA relative to ciprofloxacin, a reference standard (?4.9 kcal/mol). A further probe into the structural stability and flexibility of the resulting NorA-phenolic acids complexes through molecular dynamic simulations over a 100 ns period revealed p-coumaric acid as the best inhibitor of NorA relative to the reference standard. In addition, both phenolic acids formed H-bonds with TYR 76, a crucial residue implicated in NorA efflux pump inhibition. Furthermore, the phenolic acids demonstrated favourable drug likeliness and conformed to Lipinskis rule of five for ADME properties. For the in vitro evaluation, the phenolic acids had MIC values in the range 31.2 to 62.5 g/mL against S. aureus, and E. coli, and there was an overall reduction in MIC following their combination with ciprofloxacin. Taken together, the findings from both the in silico and in vitro evaluations in this study have demonstrated high affinity of p-coumaric acid towards NorA and could be suggestive of its exploration as a novel NorA efflux pump inhibitor.","output":"Computational Insights and In Vitro Validation of Antibacterial Potential of Shikimate Pathway-Derived Phenolic Acids as NorA Efflux Pump Inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Accurate triage of the undifferentiated patient is a critical task in prehospital emergency care. However, there is a paucity of literature synthesizing currently available prehospital triage tools. This scoping review aims to identify published tools used for prehospital triage globally and describe their performance characteristics. METHODS A comprehensive search was performed of primary literature in English-language journals from 2009 to 2019. Papers included focused on emergency medical services (EMS) triage of single patients. Two blinded reviewers and a third adjudicator performed independent title and abstract screening and subsequent full-text reviews. RESULTS Of 1521 unique articles, 55 (3.6%) were included in the final synthesis. The majority of prehospital triage tools focused on stroke (n = 19; 35%), trauma (19; 35%), and general undifferentiated patients (15; 27%). All studies were performed in high income countries, with the majority in North America (23, 42%) and Europe (22, 40%). 4 (7%) articles focused on the pediatric population. General triage tools aggregate prehospital vital signs, mental status assessments, history, exam, and anticipated resource need, to categorize patients by level of acuity. Studies assessed the tools' ability to accurately predict emergency department triage assignment, hospitalization and short-term mortality. Stroke triage tools promote rapid identification of patients with acute large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke to trigger timely transport to diagnostically- and therapeutically-capable hospitals. Studies evaluated tools' diagnostic performance, impact on tissue plasminogen activator administration rates, and correlation with in-hospital stroke scales. Trauma triage tools identify patients that require immediate transport to trauma centers with emergency surgery capability. Studies evaluated tools' prediction of trauma center need, under-triage and over-triage rates for major trauma, and survival to discharge. CONCLUSIONS The published literature on prehospital triage tools predominantly derive from high-income health systems and mostly focus on adult stroke and trauma populations. Most studies sought to further simplify existing triage tools without sacrificing triage accuracy, or assessed the predictive capability of the triage tool. There was no clear 'gold-standard' singular prehospital triage tool for acute undifferentiated patients.

DESIGN Partly cross-sectional, partly longitudinal study. SUBJECTS Patients' who had amputation of a limb due to long-standing, therapy-resistant CRPS-I, at the University Medical Centre Groningen, The Netherlands, between May 2000 and September 2015 (n = 53) were invited to participate. METHODS Participants were interviewed in a semi-structured way regarding mobility, pain, recurrence of CRPS-I, quality of life, and prosthesis use. Those who reported recurrence of CRPS-I underwent physical examination. RESULTS A total of 47 patients (median age at time of amputation, 41.0 years; 40 women) participated. Longitudinal evaluation was possible in 17 participants. Thirty-seven participants (77%) reported an important improvement in mobility (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 63-87%). An important reduction in pain was reported by 35 participants (73%; 95% CI 59-83%). CRPS-I recurred in 4 of 47 participants (9%; 95% CI 3-20%), once in the residual limb and 3 times in another limb. Of the 35 participants fitted with a lower limb prosthesis, 24 were still using the prosthesis. Longitudinal evaluation showed no significant deteriorations. CONCLUSION Amputation can be considered as a treatment for patients with long-standing, therapy-resistant CRPS-I. Amputation can increase mobility and reduce pain, thereby improving the quality of patients' lives.

METHODS: The Prospective Outcomes of Injury Study recruited 2856 injured New Zealanders aged 18C64 years from the entitlement claims register of the countrys no-fault injury insurance agency. One-fifth (n = 566) of the cohort were Mori. Information on predictors and outcomes, with the exception of injury and hospitalisation, was obtained directly from participants at approximately 3 and 12 months post-injury. The outcomes of interest were responses to the five dimensions of the EQ-5D-3L and a dichotomous measure obtained by summing scored responses to each question. Modified Poisson regression was used to identify predictors of each outcome at 12 months post-injury. RESULTS: Predictors differed by outcome. Being female, experiencing EQ-5D-3L problems pre-injury, having  2 chronic conditions pre-injury, perceiving ones injury to be a threat of long-term disability, and having trouble accessing health services for injury were common predictors of EQ-5D-3L problems at 12 months post-injury for Mori.

The aim of our study was to provide effectiveness and safety data of ocrelizumab treatment in patients with relapsingCremitting (RR-) and progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) and to evaluate clinical and immunological predictors of early treatment response. In this single-center prospective observational study, we investigated effectiveness outcomes (time-to-confirmed disability worsening, time-to-first relapse, time-to-first evidence of MRI activity and time-to-first evidence of disease activity), clinical and immunological predictors of early treatment response, and incidence of adverse events (AEs). One hundred and fifty-three subjects were included (93 RRMS; 84 females). Median follow-up was 1.9 (1.3C2.7). At 2-year follow-up (FU), disability worsening-free survival were 90.5%, 64.7%, and 68.8% for RRMS, primary-progressive MS (PPMS), and secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) patients, respectively. At 2-year FU, 67.1%, 72.7%, and 81.3% of patients with RRMS, PPMS, and SPMS were free of MRI activity, with NEDA-3 percentages of 62.1%, 54.6%, and 55.1%, respectively. Lower baseline EDSS was independently associated with a reduced risk of disability worsening (HR(95%CI) = 1.45(1.05C2.00), p = 0.024) and previous treatment exposure was independently associated with increased probability of radiological activity (HR = 2.53(1.05C6.10), p = 0.039).

To combat transmission of the disease in India, the government declared a lockdown on March 25, 2020. Even after this strict lockdown was enacted nationwide, the number of COVID-19 cases increased and surpassed 450,000. A positive point to note is that the number of recovered cases began to slowly exceed that of active cases. The survival of patients, taking death as the event that varies by age group and sex, is noteworthy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a survival analysis to establish the variability in survivorship of patients with COVID-19 in India by age group and sex at different levels, that is, the national, state, and district levels. METHODS: The study period was taken from the date of the first reported case of COVID-19 in India, which was January 30, 2020, up to June 30, 2020. Due to the amount of underreported data and removal of missing columns, a total sample of 26,815 patients was considered. Kaplan-Meier survival estimation, the Cox proportional hazard model, and the multilevel survival model were used to perform the survival analysis. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier survival function showed that the probability of survival of patients with COVID-19 declined during the study period of 5 months, which was supplemented by the log rank test (P<.001) and Wilcoxon test (P<.001) to compare the survival functions. Significant variability was observed in the age groups, as evident from all the survival estimates; with increasing age, the risk of dying of COVID-19 increased. The Cox proportional hazard model reiterated that male patients with COVID-19 had a 1.14 times higher risk of dying than female patients (hazard ratio 1.14; SE 0.11; 95% CI 0.93-1.38). Western and Central India showed decreasing survival rates in the framed time period, while Eastern, North Eastern, and Southern India showed slightly better results in terms of survival. CONCLUSIONS: This study depicts a grave scenario of decreasing survival rates in various regions of India and shows variability in these rates by age and sex.

Bedside real-time US guidance with visualization of needle path is routinely utilized for other procedures such as central venous catheterization, and may enhance the safety and accuracy of PT without causing airway occlusion or hypercarbia. Our objective was to demonstrate that PT performed under real-time US guidance with visualization of needle path during tracheal puncture is feasible, including in patients with features that increase the technical difficulty of PT. METHODS Mechanically ventilated patients with acute brain injury requiring tracheostomy underwent US guided PT. The orotracheal tube was withdrawn using direct laryngoscopy. The trachea was punctured under real-time US guidance (with visualization of the needle path) while using the acoustic shadows of the cricoid and the tracheal rings to identify the level of puncture. After guidewire passage the site and level of entry was verified using the bronchoscope, which was then withdrawn. Following dilatation and tube placement, placement in the airway was confirmed using auscultation and the \\"lung sliding\\" sign on US. Bronchoscopy and chest X-ray were then performed to identify any complications. RESULTS Thirteen patients successfully underwent US guided PT. Three patients were morbidly obese, two were in cervical spine precautions and one had a previous tracheostomy. In all 13 patients bronchoscopy confirmed that guidewire entry was through the anterior wall and between the first and fifth tracheal rings. There was no case of tube misplacement, pneumothorax, posterior wall injury, significant bleeding or other complication during the procedure. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous tracheostomy performed under real-time ultrasound guidance is feasible and appears accurate and safe, including in patients with morbid obesity and cervical spine precautions.

Developing new transplantation sites with emerging technologies to improve islet graft survival and simplify immune regulation will greatly benefit the future success of islet cell therapy in the treatment of diabetes.","output":"Advances in Pancreatic Islet Transplantation Sites for the Treatment of Diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In secondary schools, English teachers are often made responsible for writing results in national testing. Yet there have been few studies that focussed on this key group, or on how pedagogical practices have been impacted in the teaching of writing in their classrooms. This study investigated practices of English teachers in four secondary schools across different states, systems and regions. It developed a novel method of case study at a distance that required no classroom presence or school visits for the researchers and allowed a multi-sited and geographically dispersed design. Teachers were invited to select classroom artefacts pertaining to the teaching of writing in their English classes, compile individualised e-portfolios and reflect on these items in writing and in digitally conducted interviews, as well as elaborating on their broader philosophies and feelings about the teaching of writing. Despite and sometimes because of NAPLAN, these teachers held strong views on explicit teaching of elements of writing, but approached these in different ways. The artefacts that they created animated their teaching practices, connected them to their students and their subject, suggested both the pressure of externally driven homogenising approaches to writing and the creative individualised responses of skilled teachers within their unique contexts. In addition to providing granular detail about pedagogical practices in the teaching of writing in the NAPLAN era, the contribution of this paper lies in its methodological adaptation of case study at a distance through teacher-curated artefact portfolios that enabled a deep dive into individual teachers practices.","output":"Artefacts, practices and pedagogies: teaching writing in English in the NAPLAN era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In any phytochemical drug discovery programme, one of the major issues is the appropriate selection of target plant species that may provide lead for new drug discovery and development.

Therefore, the plant selection process is extremely important for ensuring success. In recent years, there have been significant amounts of work involving applications of various mathematical modelling and computational techniques to predict medicinal properties of plants, and thus to provide information-based selection of plant materials for further studies aiming at potential drug discovery and development.

We investigated the association between the C-reactive protein (CRP) to albumin ratio (CAR) and in-hospital mortality in patients with hypertensive COVID-19. A total of 176 patients with hypertension diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. The CAR was compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. Logistic regression analysis was used to detect independent predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 in patients with hypertension. A cutoff value of CAR was obtained for predicting in-hospital death in patients with hypertensive COVID-19. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed for survival analysis in the study population. The CAR values were significantly higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors with hypertension. Moreover, the CAR was an independent predictor of in-hospital death in patients with hypertensive COVID-19, as shown in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis yielded a cutoff value of 20.75 for the CAR for predicting in-hospital death in patients with hypertension. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that patients with hypertensive COVID-19 with a CAR value of &#8805;20.75 had a higher incidence of in-hospital death.

This study aims to evaluate the credit risk that Islamic banks in Indonesia have been exposed to related to home financing before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. Panel data are employed covering the period January 2016 to September 2020 on a monthly basis. The data were analyzed using a dynamic panel approach to present a distinct picture of Sharia-compliant property financing before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. In general, the findings show that the macroeconomic variable reflected by regional inflation has had a different influence in the two periods, with Islamic banks having had much more exposure to macroeconomic risk, specifically in home financing, during the epidemic. In addition, the different influences are also shown by the study results, which show that provinces on Java Island face less risk exposure than those outside Java. In terms of impulse response factors and variance decompositions' result, before the outbreak, the response of home financing risk to inflation tended to be more stable. However, during the outbreak, the movement has tended to fluctuate more, especially outside Java Island. The same result for variance decompositions shows a similar trend, with inflation tending to have a larger impact during the outbreak. ? Faaza Fakhrunnas, Yunice Karina Tumewang, M. B.

However, their clinical relevance in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is not well characterized. We analyzed the frequency, clinical significance, and prognostic relevance of RAS pathway alterations in 328 pediatric patients with de novo AML. RAS pathway alterations were detected in 80 (24.4%) out of 328 patients: NF1 (n = 7, 2.1%), PTPN11 (n = 15, 4.6%), CBL (n = 6, 1.8%), NRAS (n = 44, 13.4%), KRAS (n = 12, 3.7%). Most of these alterations were mutually exclusive and were also mutually exclusive with other aberrations of signal transduction pathways such as FLT3-ITD (p = 0.001) and KIT mutation (p = 0.004). NF1 alterations were frequently detected in patients with complex karyotype (p = 0.031) and were found to be independent predictors of poor overall survival (OS) in multivariate analysis (p = 0.007). At least four of seven patients with NF1 alterations had bi-allelic inactivation. NRAS mutations were frequently observed in patients with CBFB-MYH11 and were independent predictors of favorable outcomes in multivariate analysis [OS, p = 0.023; event-free survival (EFS), p = 0.037]. Patients with PTPN11 mutations more frequently received stem cell transplantation (p = 0.035) and showed poor EFS than patients without PTPN11 mutations (p = 0.013).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-arm phase II clinical trial, eligible patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (T3C4 and/or N1C2) were enrolled. All the patients received a median three sequential cycles of neoadjuvant CAPEOX (capecitabine + oxaliplatin) chemotherapy. A total dose of 25 Gy in five fractions during 1 week was prescribed to the gross tumor and regional lymph nodes. Surgery was performed about 8 weeks following radiotherapy. Pathologic complete response rate (pCR) and grade 3C4 toxicity were compared between older patients (65 years) and younger patients (<65 years). RESULTS: Ninety-six patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were enrolled. There were 32 older patients and 64 younger patients. Overall pCR was 20.8% for all the patients. Older patients achieved similar pCR rate (18.7% vs. 21.8; p = 0.795) compared to younger patients. There was no statistically significance in terms of the tumor and the node downstaging or treatment-related toxicity between older patients and younger ones; however, the rate of sphincter-saving surgery was significantly more frequent in younger patients (73% vs. 53%; p=0.047) compared to older ones.

Despite advancements in preventive and therapeutic strategies, there is room for further cardiovascular risk reduction. Recently, inflammation has emerged as a potential therapeutic target. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a novel inflammatory biomarker which predicts poor prognosis in several conditions such as metabolic syndrome, sepsis, malignancy and CAD. In atherosclerosis, a high NLR predicts plaque vulnerability and severe stenosis. This is consistent with observations in CCS, where an elevated NLR predicts long-term major adverse cardiac events (MACEs). In ACS patients, high NLR levels are associated with larger infarct sizes and poor long-term outcomes. Possible reasons for this include failure of fibrinolysis, ischemia-reperfusion injury and in-stent restenosis, all of which are associated with raised NLR levels. Following myocardial infarction, an elevated NLR correlates with pathological cardiac remodeling which propagates chronic heart failure. Finally, in heart failure patients, an elevated NLR predicts long-term MACEs, mortality, and poor left ventricular assist device and transplant outcomes. Further studies must evaluate whether the addition of NLR to current risk-stratification models can better identify high-risk CAD patients.","output":"The prognostic value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio across all stages of coronary artery disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Nonphysician health care workers are involved in high-risk patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic, placing them at high risk of mental health burden The mental health impact of COVID-19 in this crucial population has not been studied thus far Thus, the objective of this study is to assess the psychosocial well-being of these providers STUDY DESIGN: National cross-sectional online survey (no control group) SETTING: Academic otolaryngology programs in the United States SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We distributed a survey to nonphysician health care workers in otolaryngology departments across the United States The survey incorporated a variety of validated mental health assessment tools to measure participant burnout (Mini-Z assessment), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), distress (Impact of Event Scale), and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-2) Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictive factors associated with these mental health outcomes RESULTS: We received 347 survey responses: 248 (71 5%) nurses, 63 (18 2%) administrative staff, and 36 (10 4%) advanced practice providers A total of 104 (30 0%) respondents reported symptoms of burnout;241 (69 5%), symptoms of anxiety;292 (84 1%), symptoms of at least mild distress;and 79 (22 8%), symptoms of depression Upon further analysis, development of these symptoms was associated with factors such as occupation, practice setting, and case load CONCLUSION: Frontline otolaryngology health care providers exhibit high rates of mental health complications, particularly anxiety and distress, in the wake of COVID-19 Adequate support systems must be put into place to address these issues","output":"Snapshot Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Wellness in Nonphysician Otolaryngology Health Care Workers: A National Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infections cause great economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide, and the emergence of new variant strains complicates disease control.

Lung function abnormalities were detected in 14 patients and the measurement of D-dimer levels at admission may be useful for prediction of impaired diffusion defect (P = 0.031, OR 1.066, 95% CI 1.006 to 1.129). Of all the subjects, 47 of 55 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in serum, among which the generation of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody in female patients was stronger than male patients in infection rehabilitation phase. INTERPRETATION: Radiological and physiological abnormalities were still found in a considerable proportion of COVID-19 survivors without critical cases 3 months after discharge. Higher level of D-dimer on admission could effectively predict impaired DLCO after 3 months discharge. It is necessary to follow up the COVID-19 patients to appropriately manage any persistent or emerging long-term sequelae.

This study aimed to explore effective methods of reducing early recurrence. METHODS This study included patients aged 0 to 14 years diagnosed with ileocolic intussusception with a symptom duration of <48 hours from January 2019 to March 2021. The patients were divided into control and intervention groups. All patients received successful treatment with ultrasound-guided saline enema; however, in patients treated before January 4, 2020 (control group), the intestinal fluid was drained immediately, and in patients treated after January 4, 2020 (intervention group), the intestinal fluid was drained after 15 minutes of intestinal pressure maintenance. Early recurrence rates of the groups were compared. RESULTS Ileocolic intussusception was treated successfully by ultrasound-guided saline enema in 231 patients (116, control group;115, intervention group). The early recurrence rate in the intervention group (10%; 95% CI: 4.9-16.5) was numerically lower than that in the control group (19%; 95% CI: 12.3-27.3). No significant difference was observed in the number of recurrences per person between the groups (P = .448). Patients without early recurrence were older (P = .004) and received enemas of a shorter duration (P < .001) and lower pressure (P < .001) than patients without early recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Maintaining reduction pressure for 15 minutes after a successful ultrasound-guided saline enema may reduce the early recurrence of intussusception.

The safety and suitability of SPLS for colon cancer has not been widely proved. We aimed at validating the safety, efficacy, and short-term quality of life (QOL) of SPLS compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) in patients with colon cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between June 2010 and April 2011, a total of 62 patients with pathology-proven colon cancer were randomly allocated to two groups: SPLS and CLS. Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS In total, there were 62 patients (35 men and 27 women) with a mean age of 63.0 years (range, 38-82). The baseline characteristics of the patients and tumor factors were well balanced between two groups. The operation time and estimated blood loss were similar, whereas intraoperative complications only occurred in three patients, all of whom were in the SPLS group. Conversion to CLS or open surgery occurred in 6 (19.4%) patients of the SPLS group. The number of harvested lymph nodes and length of proximal and distal resection margins were not statistically different between two groups. Postoperative complications and recovery of bowel function were similar in both groups, but fatal postoperative complication occurred in one case in the SPLS group. The QOL between two groups was identical in all domains until postoperative 12 months. CONCLUSIONS SPLS for colon cancer is feasible and can be performed by following oncologic principles. However, surgeons should be aware of the potential for unexpected adjacent organ injury ( ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT01203969).","output":"Single-Port Laparoscopic Surgery Can Be Performed Safely and Appropriately for Colon Cancer: Short-Term Results of a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: (COVID-19) had a great impact on the worlds health systems since December 2019. A little is known about the clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with COVID-19 severity in Sudanese Patients;therefor it is necessary to summarize the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and to explore the risk factors associated with COVID-19 severity. Methods : A one-year retrospective cohort study (May 2020- May2021) was done at three isolation centers in Wad Medani.

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of G-Re on neuroinflammatory responses in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglia and its protective effects on hippocampal neurons. Cytokine levels were measured using ELISA and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were assessed using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Protein levels of inflammatory molecules and kinase activity were assessed by western blotting. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay; apoptosis was estimated by Annexin V apoptosis assay. The results revealed that G-Re significantly inhibited the production of IL-6, TNF-, nitric oxide (NO) and ROS in BV2 microglial cells, and that of NO in mouse primary microglia, without affecting cell viability. G-Re also inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-B, and phosphorylation and degradation of IB-. In addition, G-Re dose-dependently suppressed LPS-mediated phosphorylation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CAMK)2, CAMK4, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK). Moreover, the conditioned medium from LPS-stimulated microglial cells induced HT22 hippocampal neuronal cell death, whereas that from microglial cells incubated with both LPS and G-Re ameliorated HT22 cell death in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggested that G-Re suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by blocking CAMK/ERK/JNK/NF-B signaling in microglial cells and protected hippocampal cells by reducing these inflammatory and neurotoxic factors released from microglial cells. The present findings indicated that G-Re may be a potential treatment option for neuroinflammatory disorders and could have therapeutic potential for various neurodegenerative diseases.","output":"Ginsenoside Re exhibits neuroprotective effects by inhibiting neuroinflammation via CAMK/MAPK/NF-B signaling in microglia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT.-: We implemented multiple nucleic acid amplification test platforms because of the limited availability of test kits for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the early stages of the pandemic. Interpretation of results generated by different platforms and prioritization for testing algorithms required cross-comparison. OBJECTIVE.-: To compare the analytical sensitivity of 3 commercial SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays, selected samples were studied in parallel with Cobas SARS-CoV-2 test, NxTAG CoV Extended Panel, and ID NOW COVID-19 assays. DESIGN.-: A total of 8043 SARS-CoV-2 tests performed from March 22 to April 19, 2020, were included in this study. For all 1794 positive specimens detected by the cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay, the cycle threshold (Ct) values were manually tracked and plotted to demonstrate the distribution of sample viral levels. Additionally, 50 and 63 low-positive specimens (Ct values >32) as well as 50 and 61 consecutive positive specimens by the cobas assay were tested with NxTAG and ID NOW, respectively, to estimate their relative sensitivities. RESULTS.-: The Ct values of cobas SARS-CoV-2-positive samples were evenly distributed throughout ranges of 13.32 to 39.50 (mean, 25.06) and 13.60 to 42.49 (mean, 26.45) for ORF1 and E gene targets, respectively. NxTAG reliably detected only specimens with E gene Ct values lower than 33, and is estimated to detect 89.4% of positive specimens detected by cobas assay.

No study has evaluated the relationship between VAP and mortality in this population, or compared this relationship between SARS-CoV-2 patients and other populations. The main objective of our study was to determine the relationship between VAP and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 patients. METHODS: Planned ancillary analysis of a multicenter retrospective European cohort. VAP was diagnosed using clinical, radiological and quantitative microbiological criteria. Univariable and multivariable marginal Cox's regression models, with cause-specific hazard for duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay, were used to compare outcomes between study groups. Extubation, and ICU discharge alive were considered as events of interest, and mortality as competing event. FINDINGS: Of 1576 included patients, 568 were SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 482 influenza pneumonia, and 526 no evidence of viral infection at ICU admission. VAP was associated with significantly higher risk for 28-day mortality in SARS-CoV-2 (adjusted HR 1.70 (95% CI 1.16-2.47), p = 0.006), and influenza groups (1.75 (1.03-3.02), p = 0.045), but not in the no viral infection group (1.07 (0.64-1.78), p = 0.79).

AIM: We aimed to investigate influenza C virus circulation in Germany. METHODS: A total of 1,588 samples from 0 to 4 year-old children presenting as outpatients with influenza-like illness (ILI) or acute respiratory infection were analysed retrospectively. The samples represented a subset of all samples from the German national surveillance system for influenza in this age group in 2012C14. The presence of influenza C virus was investigated by real-time PCR. For positive samples, information on symptoms as well as other respiratory virus co-infections was considered. Retrieved influenza C viral sequences were phylogenetically characterised. RESULTS: Influenza C viral RNA was detected in 20 (1.3% of) samples, including 16 during the 2012/13 season. The majority (18/20) of influenza C-positive patients had ILI according to the European Union definition, one patient had pneumonia. Viruses belonged to the C/Sao Paulo and C/Kanagawa lineages. Most (11/20) samples were co-infected with other respiratory viruses. CONCLUSION: Our data are the first on influenza C virus circulation in Germany and notably from a European national surveillance system. The low detection frequency and the identified virus variants confirm earlier observations outside a surveillance system. More virus detections during the 2012/13 season indicate a variable circulation intensity in the different years studied. Influenza C virus can be considered for ILI patients.

However, the effects of strength-specific RT programs have received little attention. The purpose of this single-group proof of concept clinical trial was to determine whether a 12-week strength training (ST) program could improve fluid cognition in healthy older adults 60 to 80 years of age, and to explore concomitant physiological and psychological changes. METHODS: Twenty participants (69.1  5.8 years, 14 women) completed this study with no drop-outs or severe adverse events. Baseline assessments were completed before an initial 12-week control period, then participants were re-tested at pre-intervention and after the 12-week ST intervention. The NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery and standard physical and psychological measures were administered at all three time points. During the 36 sessions of periodized ST (3 sessions per week), participants were supervised by an exercise specialist and challenged via autoregulatory load progression. RESULTS: Test-retest reliability over the control period was good for fluid cognition and excellent for crystallized cognition. Fluid composite scores significantly increased from pre- to post-intervention (8.2  6.1%, p < 0.01, d = 1.27), while crystallized composite scores did not (-0.5  2.8%, p = 0.46, d = -0.34). Performance on individual fluid instruments, including executive function, attention, working memory, and processing speed, also significantly improved. Surprisingly, changes in fluid composite scores had small negative correlations with changes in muscular strength and sleep quality, but a small positive correlation with changes in muscular power. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, improvements in fluid cognition can be safely achieved in older adults using a 12-week high-intensity ST program, but further controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings. Furthermore, the relationship with other widespread physiological and psychological benefits remains unclear.","output":"12 weeks of strength training improves fluid cognition in older adults: A nonrandomized pilot trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 outbreak and stay at home orders has had multifaceted consequences on the mental health of adolescents. Therefore, the authors aim to (1) Investigate the feelings of depression among adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic (2) Evaluate the mental help seeking behavior and awareness among the adolescents. Method: ology: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken where adolescents in the age group of 10 to 19 years were invited to participate with a self-administered questionnaire. A snowball sampling strategy was used, focusing on recruiting adolescents living in Bangalore, India during the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. The survey included the PHQ-2 scale and questions on help seeking and awareness. The questionnaires were completed in English through an online survey platform. Data collection took place over five days. Results: : The study included 300 participants with a mean age of 17.01 +/- 1.34 years. PHQ-2 scale revealed a sample mean of 1.32 (SD=0.99). 34.7% felt little interest or pleasure in doing things on several days and 32.0% felt down depressed or hopeless on more than half the days. 52.3% of the adolescents indicated that they were unlikely or were unsure about seeking help for mental health issues and 24.3% were not aware of any mental health helpline. No association between socio-demographics and PHQ-2 scale was established. Majority indicated intention to seek help from parents or siblings. Conclusion: Adolescents constitute a vulnerable population and need careful consideration. The COVID -19 outbreak has resulted in increased depressive symptoms, anger, difficulty in relaxation and sleep disturbances. Lack of awareness of support and reluctance to use the resources has had a compounding effect on the mental health status of adolescents. Adolescents often choose to express their mental health concerns to their parents and siblings. Therefore, it is worth considering family as a potential resource of support for adolescents in this challenging time of need.","output":"COVID-19 and Mental Health of Adolescents: A South Indian Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A case with rheumatoid arthritis and insufficient compensation under disease-modifying combined long-term therapy with methotrexate and leflunomide is reported.

The synthesized materials were characterized by PXRD, Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC), and SEM-Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS).

The program focussed on the identification of ester-based benzodiazepine derivatives that are rapidly broken down by esterases. Remimazolam was identified as one of the lead compounds. The project at Glaxo was shelved for strategic reasons at the late lead optimization stage. Via the GSK ventures initiative, the program was acquired by the small biotechnology company, TheraSci, and, through successive acquisitions, developed as the besylate salt at CeNeS and PAION. The development of remimazolam besylate has been slow by industry standards, primarily because of the resource limitations of these small companies. It has, however, recently been approved for anesthesia in Japan and South Korea, procedural sedation in the United States, China, and Europe, and for compassionate use in intensive care unit sedation in Belgium. A second development program of remimazolam was later initiated in China, using a slightly different salt form, remimazolam tosylate. This salt form of the compound has also recently been approved for procedural sedation in China. Remimazolam has the pharmacological profile of a classical benzodiazepine, such as midazolam, but is differentiated from other intravenous benzodiazepines by its rapid conversion to an inactive metabolite resulting in a short onset/offset profile. It is differentiated from other intravenous hypnotic agents, such as propofol, by its low liability for cardiovascular depression, respiratory depression, and injection pain. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can reverse the effects of remimazolam in case of adverse events and further shorten recovery times. The aim of this review is to provide an analysis of, and perspective on, published non-clinical and clinical information on 1) the pharmacology, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic profile of remimazolam, 2) the profile of remimazolam compared with established agents, 3) gaps in the current understanding of remimazolam, 4) the compounds discovery and development process and 5) likely future developments in the clinical use of remimazolam.","output":"Remimazolam: Non-Clinical and Clinical Profile of a New Sedative/Anesthetic Agent"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a growing evidence that variation in gut microbial communities has important associations with overall host health, and that the diversity and the richness of such communities is helpful in distinguishing patients at high risk of life-threatening post-transplantation conditions.

Neck circumference (NC) has been shown to be strongly related to cardiometabolic and respiratory illnesses even after adjustment for body mass index (BMI). We performed a prospective study to investigate the potential of NC to predict the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in adult COVID-19 inpatients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively and consecutively enrolled COVID-19 adult patients admitted to dedicated medical wards of two Italian hospitals from 25 March to 7 April 2020. On admission, clinical, biochemical and anthropometric data, including BMI and NC were collected. As primary outcome measure, the maximum respiratory support received was evaluated. Follow-up time was 30 days from hospital admission. RESULTS: We enrolled 132 subjects (55.0-75.8 years, 32% female). During the study period, 26 (19.7%) patients underwent IMV. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, after adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension and COPD, NC resulted independently and significantly associated with IMV risk (adjusted OR 1.260-per 1 cm increase 95% CI:1.120-1.417; P < .001), with a stronger association in the subgroup with BMI &#8804;30 Kg/m2 (adjusted OR 1.526; 95% CI:1.243-1.874; P < .001).

The question arises if the host genetic variation may (partly) affect the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19. We postulated that the geographical variation of human polymorphisms might partly explain the variable prevalence of the infection. We investigated some candidate genes that have the potential to play a role in the immune defense against COVID-19: complement component 3 (C3), galactoside 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2), haptoglobin (Hp), vitamin D binding protein (DBP), human homeostatic iron regulator protein (HFE), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1). In a univariate approach, ACE1 D/I, C3, CFTR, and HFE polymorphisms correlated significantly with COVID-19 prevalence/mortality, whereas Hp and FUT2 polymorphism did not show any significant correlations. In a multivariate analysis, only ACE1 D/I and C3 polymorphisms were determinants for COVID-19 prevalence/mortality. The other polymorphisms (CFTR, DBP, FUT2, HFE, and Hp) did not correlate with COVID-19 prevalence/mortality. Whereas ACE1 D/I polymorphism shows functional links with ACE2 (which is the receptor for the virus) in COVID-19, C3 can act as a critical step in the virus-induced inflammation.

The transmission tends to be more effective in select settings that involve exposure to relatively high viral dose, such as in crowded indoor settings, assisted living facilities, prisons or food processing plants. To explore the effect on infection dynamics, we describe a new mathematical model where transmission can occur (i) in the community at large, characterized by low-dose exposure and mostly mild disease, and (ii) in so-called transmission hot zones, characterized by high-dose exposure that can be associated with more severe disease. The model yields different types of epidemiological dynamics, depending on the relative importance of hot zone and community transmission. Interesting dynamics occur if the rate of virus release/deposition from severely infected people is larger than that of mildly infected individuals. Under this assumption, we find that successful infection spread can hinge upon high-dose hot zone transmission, yet the majority of infections are predicted to occur in the community at large with mild disease. In this regime, residual hot zone transmission can account for continued virus spread during community lockdowns, and the suppression of hot zones after community interventions are relaxed can cause a prolonged lack of infection resurgence following the reopening of society. This gives rise to the notion that targeted interventions specifically reducing virus transmission in the hot zones have the potential to suppress overall infection spread, including in the community at large. Epidemiological trends in the USA and Europe are interpreted in light of this model.","output":"Role of high-dose exposure in transmission hot zones as a driver of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND While intermittent claudication is the hallmark of symptomatic peripheral artery disease, most patients with peripheral artery disease have atypical symptoms. The presence of lumbosacral spine disease, a common cause of nonvascular lower extremity pain, may confound the diagnosis of peripheral artery disease. The goal of this study was to quantify the prevalence of severe lumbar spine degenerative disease in patients referred for lower extremity arterial studies. METHODS All patients over age 18 years referred for segmental limb pressures and pulse volume recordings at rest and following treadmill exercise testing at a tertiary medical center accredited vascular diagnostic laboratory, who also underwent magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography of the lumbar spine within 6 months of the arterial studies, were included in the analysis. Frequencies of peripheral artery disease and lumbar spine degenerative disease were determined, and medical records were reviewed for cardiovascular risk factors and prior vascular and spinal interventions. RESULTS One hundred seven subjects (63 men) with a mean age of 70 years (range 35-88 years) were included in the analysis. Lumbar spine disease was present in 81 (75.7%) of the patients referred for vascular testing. The percentage of lumbar spine disease was equivalent in both patients with exercise-induced deterioration in arterial pressure and in those with a physiologic response to exercise. Compared with patients with a normal response to exercise, patients with exercise-induced peripheral artery disease had a lower resting ankle-brachial index (mean 0.79 vs 1.09, P <.001), abnormal pulse volume recordings, and were less likely to use opiate analgesics and more likely to have undergone lower extremity revascularization.

Using a two-stage transfer learning technique to train a convolutional neural network (CNN), we show that the algorithm is able to classify four classes of disease severity (normal, mild, moderate, and severe) with the average Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.93. In addition, we show that the outputs of different layers of the CNN under dominant filters provide valuable insight about the subtle patterns in the CXRs, which can improve the accuracy in the reading of CXRs by a radiologist. Finally, we show that our approach can be used for studying the disease progression in a single patient and its influencing factors. The results suggest that our technique can form the foundation of a more concrete clinical model to predict the evolution of COVID-19 severity and the efficacy of different treatments for each patient through using CXRs and clinical data in the early stages of the disease. This use of AI to assess the severity and possibly predicting the future stages of the disease early on, will be essential in dealing with the upcoming waves of COVID-19 and optimizing resource allocation and treatment.","output":"Toward understanding COVID-19 pneumonia: a deep-learning-based approach for severity analysis and monitoring the disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To inform the efficient allocation of testing resources, we evaluated the characteristics of those tested for COVID-19 to determine predictors of a positive test.

University professors suddenly shifted to work from home adopting distance teaching. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and its associated occupational and health factors during COVID-19 among university professors. METHODS: A cross-sectional design targeted university professors of all majors in Jordan. The study self-administered survey included demographics and lifestyle data, 12-item Short Form health survey (SF-12), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 21), professor' evaluation of distance teaching, Neck Disability Index (NDI), and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Descriptive analyses were conducted to demonstrate primary outcome measures data. Factors associated with HRQoL were determined using a multiple variable linear regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 299 university professors successfully completed the study. Participants' SF-12 physical health component score was 74.08 (18.5) and 65.74 (21.4) for mental health component. Higher depression, stress, neck disability, and weight change were significantly associated with lower HRQoL level. While higher satisfaction with distance teaching, health self-evaluation, and work load change were significantly associated with higher HRQoL level. The regression model explained 66.7%of the variance in professors' HRQoL (r2a=a0.667, Fa=a82.83, Pa<a0.001).

Genetic variation in the receptor for the Fc portion of IgG (FcR) determines their affinity for IgG subclasses driving innate and adaptive antiviral immunity. We investigated the relationship between FcRIIa-H131R polymorphism and RSV disease. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 182 infants 24-month-old (50 uninfected, 114 RSV-infected with moderate course and 18 suffering severe disease). FcRIIa-H131R SNP genotypic frequencies (HH, HR, RR) and anti-RSV IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 levels were studied. RESULTS: Genotypic frequencies for FcRIIa-H131R SNP were comparable between uninfected and RSV-infected infants. In contrast, we found a significant higher frequency of HH genotype in severe RSV-infected children compared to moderate patients. Among severe group, HH infants presented more factors associated to severity than HR or RR patients did. Furthermore, compared to moderate RSV-infected infants, severe patients showed higher levels of anti-RSV IgG1 and IgG3. CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between an FcRIIa (H131) polymorphism and severe RSV disease, which points towards a critical role for interactions between FcRs and immune complexes in RSV pathogenesis.

However, the underlying physiology of these TMS-evoked EEG potentials (TEPs) is still heavily underexplored, impeding a broad application of TEPs to study pathology in neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we tested the effects of a single oral dose of three antiepileptic drugs with specific modes of action (carbamazepine, a voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) blocker; brivaracetam, a ligand to the presynaptic vesicle protein VSA2; tiagabine, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) reuptake inhibitor) on TEP amplitudes in 15 healthy adults in a double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled crossover design. We found that carbamazepine decreased the P25 and P180 TEP components, and brivaracetam the N100 amplitude in the nonstimulated hemisphere, while tiagabine had no effect. Findings corroborate the view that the P25 represents axonal excitability of the corticospinal system, the N100 in the nonstimulated hemisphere propagated activity suppressed by inhibition of presynaptic neurotransmitter release, and the P180 late activity particularly sensitive to VGSC blockade.

Its severity ranges from mild to severe, latter manifesting into severe acute respiratory syndrome. As a part of multidisciplinary team, physiotherapy along with medical management was administered to patients with COVID-19 in an acute care setup. This retrospective study aims to explore various patient characteristics and will aid in identifying the impairments associated with the disease, giving a direction to the physiotherapy community in planning future management strategy to improve quality of life. Patients and methods: The present study is a unicentric study wherein prospective analysis of retrospective data of patients referred for physiotherapy from May 13 to July 31, 2020, was performed. (i) Characteristics of patients, (ii) associated comorbidities, (iii) hospital course since the time of admission to discharge, (iv) mode of oxygen delivery, (v) pre- and post-physiotherapy treatment values of oxygen saturation and heart rate, and (vi) physiotherapy treatment were recorded. The archived data were analyzed using the commercially available SPSS software version 24. Wilcoxon's matched pair test was used to compare pre- and post-treatment oxygen saturation and heart rate, and McNemar's test was used to compare mode of oxygen delivery and pre- and post-physiotherapy treatment. Results: Descriptive analysis of data showed a better outcome in terms of grade of dyspnea and rate of discharge on day 14 of physiotherapy treatment. Hence, a comparative analysis of day 1 and day 14 was performed for mode of oxygen delivery, oxygen saturation, and heart rate. A statistically significant improvement was observed in the heart rate (p = 0.001) and oxygen delivery (p = 0.000). However, no significant difference in the level of oxygen saturation was found (p = 0.6433). Conclusion: Physiotherapy treatment in conjunction with medical treatment can be effectively administered in patients with COVID-19 in acute care setup taking into consideration the health status and the hemodynamic stability of the patients. It emphasizes the role of physiotherapy in the alleviation of symptoms, facilitating early weaning and recovery enabling early discharge from the hospital.

OBJECTIVE: This retrospective observational study of emergency physician Twitter use details how the healthcare crisis has influenced emergency physician discourse online, and may have use as a harbinger of ensuing surge. METHODS: Followers of the three main emergency physician professional organizations were identified using Twitter's application programming interface. They and their followers were included in the study if identifying explicitly as United States-based emergency physicians. Statuses or 'tweets' were obtained between January 4th, 2020, when the new disease was first reported, and December 14th, 2020, when vaccination first began. Original tweets underwent sentiment analysis using the previously validated Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) tool as well as topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation unsupervised machine learning. Sentiment and topic trends were then correlated with daily change in new COVID-19 cases and inpatient bed utilization. RESULTS: 3,463 emergency physicians produced 334,747 unique English tweets during the study period. 910 (26.3%) stated that they were in training, and 446 (51.7%) of those who provided a gender identified as a man. Overall tweet volume went from a pre-March mean of 481.9 72.7 daily tweets to 1,065.5 257.3 daily thereafter. Parameter and topic number tuning led to 20 tweet topics, with a topic coherence of 0.49.

The degree of divergence of each iVDRV correlated with the duration of persistence indicating continuous intrahost evolution. The evolution rates for synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions were estimated to be 5.7 x 10(?3) subs/site/year and 8.9 x 10(?4) subs/site/year, respectively. Mutational spectra and signatures indicated a major role for APOBEC cytidine deaminases and a secondary role for ADAR adenosine deaminases in generating diversity of iVDRVs. The distributions of mutations across the genes and 3D hotspots for amino acid substitutions in the E1 glycoprotein identified regions that may be under positive selective pressure.

BACKGROUND DATA Although some studies investigated the efficacy of LAI of EDTA irrigation, no study has been conducted to investigate the efficacy of LAI of phytic acid in the removal of CH and TAP from root dentin. MATERIALS AND METHODS Root canals of extracted maxillary incisors (n = 80) were instrumented using rotary files and thereafter were split longitudinally. Following preparation of a standardized groove in the apical region of one root half, the roots were randomly divided into two groups according to the intracanal medicaments placed into the grooves: (1) CH and (2) TAP. The roots were reassembled, and the specimens were further assigned into four groups (n = 10/group) defined by the final irrigation solution (EDTA and phytic acid) and irrigation technique (needle irrigation and LAI) used for removal of the medicaments. The data were analyzed statistically using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS For both EDTA and phytic acid, LAI was more efficient than needle irrigation in removing both CH and TAP (p < 0.05), but none of the tested techniques completely removed CH. Irrespective of the tested irrigation solutions and techniques, significantly less TAP remained in canals (p = 0.0001), with TAP being completely removed by LAI.

Design, Setting, and Participants Using an interrupted time series approach, this cross-sectional study examined trends in per-capita COVID-19Crelated hospitalizations and deaths before and after state reopenings between April 16 and July 31, 2020. Daily state-level data from the University of Minnesota COVID-19 Hospitalization Tracking Project on COVID-19Crelated hospitalizations and deaths across 47 states were used in the analysis. Exposures Dates that states reopened their economies. Main Outcomes and Measures State-day observations of COVID-19Crelated hospitalizations and COVID-19Crelated new deaths per 100 000 people. Results The study included 3686 state-day observations of hospitalizations and 3945 state-day observations of deaths. On the day of reopening, the mean number of hospitalizations per 100 000 people was 17.69 (95% CI, 12.54-22.84) and the mean number of daily new deaths per 100 000 people was 0.395 (95% CI, 0.255-0.536). Both outcomes displayed flat trends before reopening, but they started trending upward thereafter. Relative to the hospitalizations trend in the period before state reopenings, the postperiod trend was higher by 1.607 per 100 000 people (95% CI, 0.203-3.011;P = .03). This estimate implied that nationwide reopenings were associated with 5319 additional people hospitalized for COVID-19 each day. The trend in new deaths after reopening was also positive (0.0376 per 100 000 people;95% CI, 0.0038-0.0715;P = .03), but the change in mortality trend was not significant (0.0443;95% CI, ?0.0048 to 0.0933;P = .08). Conclusions and Relevance In this cross-sectional study conducted over a 3.5-month period across 47 US states, data on the association of hospitalizations and mortality with state reopening policies may provide input to state projections of the pandemic as policy makers continue to balance public health protections with sustaining economic activity. This cross-sectional study evaluates trends in hospitalization and death rates related to COVID-19 in US states between closures and reopenings of businesses and public gatherings in 2020.","output":"US Trends in COVID-19CAssociated Hospitalization and Mortality Rates Before and After Reopening Economies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deep knowledge of the genetic features of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to track the ongoing pandemic through different geographical areas and to design and develop early diagnostic procedures, therapeutic strategies, public health interventions, and vaccines. We describe protocols and first results of the Ion AmpliSeq&#8482; SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel by a massively parallel sequencing (MPS) assay. The panel allows for targeted sequencing by overlapping amplicons, thereby providing specific, accurate, and high throughput analysis. A modified reverse transcription reaction, which consists of the use of a SARS-CoV-2 specific primers pool from the Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel, was assessed in order to promote viral RNA specific reverse transcription. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Ion AmpliSeq&#8482; SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel in sequencing the entire viral genome in different samples. SARS-CoV-2 sequence data were obtained from ten viral isolates and one nasopharyngeal swab from different patients. The ten isolate samples amplified with 12 PCR cycles displayed high mean depth values compared to those of the two isolates amplified with 20 PCR cycles. High mean depth values were also obtained for the nasopharyngeal swab processed by use of a target-specific reverse transcription. The relative depth of coverage (rDoC) analysis showed that when 12 PCR cycles were used, all target regions were amplified with high sequencing coverage, while in libraries amplified at 20 cycles, a poor uniformity of amplification, with absent or low coverage of many target regions, was observed. Our results show that the Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel can achieve rapid and high throughput SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing from 10 ng of DNA-free viral RNA from isolates and from 1 ng of DNA-free viral RNA from a nasopharyngeal swab using 12 PCR cycles for library amplification.

Knowledge can influence healthcare professionals through adoption of the correct attitudes and practices. The aim of this study was to evaluate, by a questionnaire, the perceptions of physicians about their level of knowledge as well as conditions in their workplaces for dealing with COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of Angolan physicians took place from 11 May to 23 June 2020. A questionnaire was electronically shared across social media and via email. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 637 valid questionnaires; 53% of respondents were female, 41% were aged 31-40 y and 79% were from Luanda province. About 51% of physicians perceived that they had adequate knowledge about COVID-19 and 64% used personal protective equipment. These figures were higher among specialists from the province of Luanda. About 81% stated that their health units lacked the technical capacity to diagnose COVID-19. Only 35% of health units have chest tomography equipment; 44% are prepared for the care and/or isolation of patients. Only 33% of units are running intensive care units. The main concerns of physicians were training opportunities and limited access to personal protective equipment. CONCLUSION: The results show that it is necessary to strengthen physicians' knowledge about COVID-19, as well as to improve the conditions of the health units, so as to promote safe practices.","output":"Physicians' perceptions of their knowledge and the preparedness of health facilities in Angola to diagnose and manage COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the autumn of 2020, the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic hit Europe.

The optimal approach to cardiac risk stratification following SARS-CoV-2 infection in athletes for a safe return to play (RTP) still needs defining. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of abnormal RTP test results, according to the protocol of Italian Federation of Sport Medicine (FMSI), which was endorsed by the Italian Ministry of Health, potentially representing COVID-19-associated cardiac injuries. Methods: This was a prospective, multicenter, observational study. All consecutive competitive athletes who underwent COVID-19 RTP testing protocol from 1 May to 31 July 2021, across 60 Italian Centers of Sports Medicine, were enrolled in the study. Athletes were tested at least 30 days after negativization of the nasopharyngeal swab (or immediately after negativization in professional athletes or Probable Olympians). A 12-lead electrocardiography at rest and during maximal incremental exercise test with continuous O(2) saturation monitoring and an echocardiographic examination were part of the protocol. In athletes with moderate disease (NHI classification), 24 h ECG monitoring (to be performed on a training day) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) were also performed. Results: A total of 4143 athletes (67.8% males and 32.2% females) (53% > 18 years, 20% 18C35 years and 16% > 35 years), from more than 40 different sport disciplines, were included in the study. The mean age was 22.5  13.3 years, with ages ranging from 8 to 80 years. Of these athletes, 52.3% were asymptomatic, 46.4% manifested mild symptoms, 1.1% and 0.14% had moderate or severe symptoms, respectively, while critical illness was evident in one athlete. Abnormal echocardiographic findings were detected in 80 cases (1.9%), and pericarditis in 7 cases (0.2%); all were from mildly symptomatic athletes. Arrhythmic events were recorded in 239 athletes, with 224 (5.4%) in the exercise test and 15 (0.4%) during 24 h ECG monitoring. Ventricular arrhythmias were observed in 101 (2.4%) athletes from the total population (mostly isolated or couples of premature ventricular beats): 91 in the exercise test and 10 during 24 h ECG monitoring. Cardiac magnetic resonance was performed in 34 athletes; the presence of myocarditis was confirmed in 5 athletes (0.12% of the total population, 14.7% of athletes in which MRI was performed). Conclusions: According to our results, cardiac complications from SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic competitive athletes are rare, and an RTP assessment based on symptoms and ECG-monitored exercise test would ensure a safe RTP in these athletes.","output":"Return to Play after SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Competitive Athletes of Distinct Sport Disciplines in Italy: A FMSI (Italian Federation of Sports Medicine) Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted a wide range of health services This study aimed to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on manual therapy service utilization within the Australian private healthcare setting during the first half of 2020 Quarterly data regarding the number and total cost of services provided were extracted for each manual therapy profession (i e , chiropractic, osteopathy, and physiotherapy) for the period January 2015 to June 2020 from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Time series forecasting methods were used to estimate absolute and relative differences between the forecasted and observed values of service utilization An estimated 1 3 million (13 2%) fewer manual therapy services, with a total cost of AUD 84 million, were provided within the Australian private healthcare setting during the first half of 2020 Reduction in service utilization was considerably larger in the second quarter (21 7%) than in the first quarter (5 7%), and was larger in physiotherapy (20 6%) and osteopathy (12 7%) than in chiropractic (5 2%) The impact varied across states and territories, with the largest reductions in service utilization observed in New South Wales (17 5%), Australian Capital Territory (16 3%), and Victoria (16 2%) The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on manual therapy service utilization in Australia The magnitude of the decline in service utilization varied considerably across professions and locations The long-term consequences of this decline in manual therapy utilization remain to be determined","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Manual Therapy Service Utilization within the Australian Private Healthcare Setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 52-year-old woman with no medical history was admitted on March 18, 2020, presenting since 3 days asthenia, abdominal pain, and dry cough but no fever.

Genetic variants, such as polymorphisms of the GST gene and other genes, may increase the risk of experiencing such toxicity events. This systematic review and meta-analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of the evidence base for associations between variants of the GST gene and other genes and toxicity outcomes related to anti-TB drugs. Methods We searched for relevant studies in MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, BIOSIS and Web of Science. We pooled effect estimates for each genotype on each outcome, and stratified all analyses by country. We qualitatively assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. Results We included data from 28 distinct cohorts of patients in the review. The methodological quality of included studies was variable, with several important areas of concern. For GSTM1, patients with the homozygous null genotype were significantly more likely to experience hepatotoxicity than patients with heterozygous or homozygous present genotype (odds ratio [OR]=1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15, 1.82). Moderate heterogeneity was observed in this analysis (I2=51.2%). No significant difference was observed for the GSTT1 null polymorphism. For the rs3814057 polymorphism of the PXR gene, both heterozygous genotype and homozygous mutant-type significantly increased hepatotoxicity risk compared with homozygous wild-type (heterozygous versus homozygous wild-type: OR=1.98, 95% CI 1.06, 3.69; I2=0%; homozygous mutant-type versus homozygous wild-type: OR=2.18, 95% CI 1.07, 4.44; I2=0%). Conclusions We found that it is challenging to perform robust synthesis of the evidence base for associations between GST and other genetic variants and toxicity related to anti-TB drugs. We identified significant associations between the GSTM1 null and PXR rs3814057 polymorphisms and ATDH. To the best of our knowledge, no meta-analyses on genetic variants other than variants of the NAT2, CYP2E1, GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes have been published.

However, population-based evidence regarding the long-term post-COVID-19 course of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) was limited when this study was initiated. OBJECTIVE: To detect possible changes in MS clinical disease activity after COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an observational study from July 2020 until July 2021 in the Isfahan MS clinic, comparing the trends of probable disability progression (PDP) C defined as a three-month sustained increase in expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score C and relapses before and after probable/definitive COVID-19 diagnosis in a cohort of people with RRMS (pwRRMS). RESULTS: Ninety pwRRMS were identified with definitive COVID-19, 53 of which were included in the final analysis.

However, healthcare providers in many low- and middle-income countries, including Haiti, do not have experience with NIV. We conducted NIV training and evaluation in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. OBJECTIVES: To design and implement a multimodal NIV training program in Haiti that would improve confidence and knowledge of NIV use for respiratory failure. METHODS: In January 2021, we conducted a 3-day multimodal NIV training consisting of didactic sessions, team-based learning, and multistation simulation for 36 Haitian healthcare workers. The course included 5 didactic session and 10 problem-based and simulation sessions. All course material was independently created by the study team on the basis of Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical EducationCapproved content and review of available evidence. All participants completed pre- and post-training knowledge-based examinations and confidence surveys, which used a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS: A total of 36 participants were included in the training and analysis, mean age was 39.94 years (standard deviation [SD] = 9.45), and participants had an average of 14.32 years (SD = 1.21) of clinical experience. Most trainees (75%, n = 27) were physicians. Other specialties included nursing (19%, n = 7), nurse anesthesia (3%, n = 1), and respiratory therapy (3%, n = 1). Fifty percent (n = 18) of participants stated they had previous experience with NIV. The majority of trainees (77%) had an increase in confidence survey score; the mean confidence survey score increased significantly after training from 2.75 (SD = 0.77) to 3.70 (SD = 0.85) (P < 0.05). The mean knowledge examination score increased by 39.63% (SD = 15.99%) after training, which was also significant (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This multimodal NIV training, which included didactic, simulation, and team-based learning, was feasible and resulted in significant increases in trainee confidence and knowledge with NIV.

Thus, RNA cap methylation is an attractive target for antiviral discovery and development of new live attenuated vaccines. For coronaviruses, RNA cap structure is first methylated at guanine N-7 (G-N-7) position by nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14), which facilitates and precedes the subsequent ribose 2'-O methylation by nsp16-nsp10 complex. Using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an Alphacoronavirus, as a model, we showed that G-N-7 methyltransferase (G-N-7 MTase) of PEDV nsp14 methylated RNA substrates in a sequence-unspecific manner. PEDV nsp14 can efficiently methylate RNA substrates with various lengths in both neutral and alkaline pH environment, and can methylate cap analogs (GpppA and GpppG) and single nucleotide GTP but not ATP, CTP, or UTP. Mutations to the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) binding motif in the nsp14 abolished the G-N-7 MTase activity and were lethal to PEDV. However, recombinant rPEDV-D350A with a single mutation (D350A) in nsp14, which retained 29.0% of G-N-7 MTase activity, was viable. Recombinant rPEDV-D350A formed significantly smaller plaque and had significant defects in viral protein synthesis and viral replication in Vero CCL-81 cells and intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-DQ) cells. Notably, rPEDV-D350A induced significantly higher expression of both type I and III interferons in IPEC-DQ cells compared to the parental rPEDV. Collectively, our results demonstrate that G-N-7 MTase activity of PEDV modulates viral replication, gene expression, and innate immune responses.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) include a wide range of important human and animal pathogens. Examples of human CoVs include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the most recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. Examples of pig CoVs include porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV). There are no vaccines or antiviral drugs for most of these viruses. All known CoVs encode a bifunctional nsp14 protein which possesses ExoN and G-N-7 MTase activities, responsible for replication fidelity and RNA cap G-N-7 methylation, respectively. Here, we biochemically characterized G-N-7 MTase of PEDV nsp14 and found that G-N-7 MTase-deficient PEDV was defective in replication and induced higher type I and III interferons. These findings highlight that CoV G-N-7 MTase may be a novel target for rational design of live attenuated vaccines and antiviral drugs.","output":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus deficient in RNA cap guanine-N-7 methylation is attenuated and induces higher type I and III interferon responses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Neuropathology caused by acute viral infection of the brain is associated with the development of persistent neurological deficits. Identification of the immune effectors responsible for injuring the brain during acute infection is necessary for the development of therapeutic strategies that reduce neuropathology but maintain immune control of the virus. METHODS: The identity of brain-infiltrating leukocytes was determined using microscopy and flow cytometry at several acute time points following intracranial infection of mice with the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. Behavioral consequences of immune cell depletion were assessed by Morris water maze. RESULTS: Inflammatory monocytes, defined as CD45(hi)CD11b(++)F4/80(+)Gr1(+)1A8(-), and neutrophils, defined as CD45(hi)CD11b(+++)F4/80(-)Gr1(+)1A8(+), were found in the brain at 12 h after infection. Flow cytometry of brain-infiltrating leukocytes collected from LysM: GFP reporter mice confirmed the identification of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes in the brain. Microscopy of sections from infected LysM:GFP mice showed that infiltrating cells were concentrated in the hippocampal formation. Immunostaining confirmed that neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes were localized to the hippocampal formation at 12 h after infection. Immunodepletion of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils but not of neutrophils only resulted in preservation of hippocampal neurons. Immunodepletion of inflammatory monocytes also preserved cognitive function as assessed by the Morris water maze. CONCLUSIONS: Neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes rapidly and robustly responded to Theiler's virus infection by infiltrating the brain. Inflammatory monocytes preceded neutrophils, but both cell types were present in the hippocampal formation at a timepoint that is consistent with a role in triggering hippocampal pathology. Depletion of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils with the Gr1 antibody resulted in hippocampal neuroprotection and preservation of cognitive function. Specific depletion of neutrophils with the 1A8 antibody failed to preserve neurons, suggesting that inflammatory monocytes are the key effectors of brain injury during acute picornavirus infection of the brain. These effector cells may be important therapeutic targets for immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies aimed at reducing or preventing central nervous system pathology associated with acute viral infection.","output":"Inflammatory monocytes damage the hippocampus during acute picornavirus infection of the brain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: In an era when the average life expectancy and overall mortality rate have improved, Korea remains at risk for infectious disease outbreaks that place substantial burdens on the healthcare system. This study investigated trends in mortality and the economic burden of infectious diseases. METHODS: Healthcare data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (2009-2019) and the Korean Statistics Information Service (1997-2019) were used. We selected 10 infectious disease groups (intestinal infections, tuberculosis, vaccine- preventable diseases, sepsis, viral hepatitis, HIV-related diseases, central nervous system infections, rheumatic heart diseases, respiratory tract infections, and arthropod-borne viral diseases). RESULTS: The age-standardized mortality rate for infectious diseases increased from 27.2 per 100,000 population in 1997 to 37.1 per 100,000 population in 2019 and has had an upward trend since 2004. During this same period, significant increases were seen in respiratory tract infections and among elderly persons, especially those aged 85 years. The costs for infectious diseases increased from 4.126 billion US dollar (USD) in 2009 to 6.612 billion USD in 2019, with respiratory tract infections accounting for 3.699 billion USD (69%). The annual cost per patient for visits for medical care due to infectious diseases increased from 131 USD in 2009 to 204 USD in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality among elderly persons and those with respiratory tract infections increased during the study period. The economic burden of infectious diseases has consistently increased, especially for respiratory tract infections.

Risk stratification based on the Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EOSS), which classifies obesity based on the presence of medical, mental, and/or functional complications rather than on body mass index (BMI), has been shown to be a better predictor of all-cause mortality and it may well be that EOSS stages may better describe the risk of hyperinflammation in patients with COVID-19 infection.

Milk replacer was fed at 12% of birth body weight per day and water offered free choice. Calves were randomly assigned to 4 treatments differing in geometric mean particle length (X(gm)) of straw comprising 5% of starter dry matter. Straw was provided within the pellet at manufacture (PS; 0.82 mm X(gm)) or mixed with the pellet at time of feeding at X(gm) of 3.04 (SS), 7.10 (MS), or 12.7 (LS) mm. Calves (n = 12; 3/treatment) in trial 1 were fitted with a rumen cannula by wk 2 of age. A fixed amount of starter that was adjusted with age and orts were fed through the cannula in cannulated calves. Calves were euthanized 6 wk after starter was offered (9 and 7 wk of age for trials 1 and 2, respectively). Rumen digesta pH linearly decreased with age, whereas volatile fatty acid concentration increased with age. Overall pH had a cubic trend with SS lower than that of PS and MS. Molar proportion of acetate decreased with age whereas propionate proportion increased. Overall molar proportions of volatile fatty acids were not affected by diet. Fecal X(gm) was not different in spite of changes in diet particle size and rumen digesta of PS being greater than SS, MS, and LS at slaughter. Fecal pH and starch concentration were not affected by diet; however, pH decreased whereas starch content increased with age. Weight of stomach compartments, rumen papillae length and width, and rumen wall thickness did not differ between diets. Omasum weight as a percentage of body weight at harvest linearly decreased as straw particle size increased.

Like other coronaviruses, PEDV makes use of a large, trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein to mediate membrane fusion and gain entry into host cells. Despite the importance of the spike protein in viral entry and host immune responses, high-resolution structural information concerning this large macromolecular machine has been difficult to obtain. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the PEDV S protein in the prefusion conformation at a resolution of 3.1 ?. Our studies revealed that the sialic acid-binding domain at the N terminus of the S1 subunit has an orientation that is substantially different from that observed in the previously determined spike structure from human alphacoronavirus NL63. We also observed dissociated S1 subunit trimers wherein the putative receptor-binding domains exist in a conformation differing from that observed in the intact spike proteins, suggesting that the PEDV receptor-binding domain undergoes conformational rearrangements akin to those that have been described in the related betacoronaviruses. Collectively, these data provide new insights into the biological processes that mediate alphacoronavirus attachment, receptor engagement, and fusion triggering while also identifying a source of conformational heterogeneity that could be manipulated to improve PEDV vaccine antigens. IMPORTANCE Coronavirus spike proteins are large, densely glycosylated macromolecular machines that mediate receptor binding and membrane fusion to facilitate entry into host cells.

The objective of this study is to present and evaluate the different options available for early HTA consultation (during drug development/Phase III) in the major European markets from the industry perspective. METHODS An exploratory (nonsystematic) literature review was performed to identify the European markets offering early HTA consultations, and each process was analyzed using a set of predefined metrics that are relevant to industry (the ability to consult with the regulatory body in parallel, consultation fees, length of consultation meeting, language of consultation meeting, maximum number of pharmaceutical company employees attending, procedural timelines, nature of data for which consultative advice can be sought, the output of the process, and the ability to involve external experts).

The homology model of the mature aerolysin of AhEUS112 was generated using the crystal structure of a mutant aerolysin (PDB#3g4n) as the template, which showed that the encoded aerolysin exists as a channel protein. Validation of the generated model using bioinformatics tool confirmed it to be a good quality model that can be used for drug design. Molecular dock analysis revealed that drugs, aralia-saponin I, cyclamin, ardisiacrispin B, and aralia-saponin II bind to aerolysin with a higher affinity as compared to other drugs and at functionally important amino acids of aerolysin. Hence, these molecules can act as an effective therapeutics for inhibiting the aerolysin pore formation and curtail the severity of Aeromonas infection.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Notably, white-tailed deer (WTD, Odocoileus virginianus), the most widely distributed cervid species in the Americas, were shown to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 in challenge studies and reported natural infection rates approaching 40% in free-ranging WTD in the U.S. Thus, understanding the infection and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in WTD is critical to prevent future zoonotic transmission to humans and for implementation of effective disease control measures. Here, we demonstrated that following intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2, WTD fawns shed infectious virus up to day 5 post-inoculation (pi), with high viral loads shed in nasal and oral secretions. This resulted in efficient deer-to-deer transmission on day 3 pi. Consistent a with lack of infectious SARS-CoV-2 shedding after day 5 pi, no transmission was observed to contact animals added on days 6 and 9 pi. We have also investigated the tropism and sites of SARS-CoV-2 replication in adult WTD. Infectious virus was recovered from respiratory-, lymphoid-, and central nervous system tissues, indicating broad tissue tropism and multiple sites of virus replication. The study provides important insights on the infection and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in WTD, a wild animal species that is highly susceptible to infection and with the potential to become a reservoir for the virus in the field. Author summaryThe high susceptibility of white-tailed deer (WTD) to SARS-CoV-2, their ability to transmit the virus to other deer, and the recent findings suggesting widespread SARS-CoV-2 infection in wild WTD populations in the U.S. underscore the need for a better understanding of the infection and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in this potential reservoir species. Here we investigated the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 over time and defined the major sites of virus replication during the acute phase of infection. Additionally, we assessed the evolution of the virus as it replicated and transmitted between animals. The work provides important information on the infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in WTD, an animal species that - if confirmed as a new reservoir of infection - may provide many opportunities for exposure and potential zoonotic transmission of the virus back to humans.","output":"From Deer-to-Deer: SARS-CoV-2 is efficiently transmitted and presents broad tissue tropism and replication sites in white-tailed deer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a worldwide public health concern.

In our research study, we aimed to examine perceived stress and health anxiety levels as well as coping styles among students at one of the higher education institutions in Hungary, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online-based survey at the University of Debrecen, during the official lockdown in Hungary when dormitories were closed, and teaching was conducted using online platforms. Our questionnaire solicited information using three international scales, namely, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WCQ), and the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI). Results: A total of 1320 students have participated in our study, of whom 6 responses were excluded due to incompleteness. Among the remaining 1314 participants, 948 (72.1%) and 366 (27.9%) were Hungarian and international students, respectively. Female students predominated the overall sample with 939 participants (71.5%). In general, there was a statistically significant positive relationship between perceived stress and health anxiety. Health anxiety and perceived stress levels were significantly higher among international students compared to the Hungarian ones. Also, the elevation in perceived stress was significantly greater among students who mostly used emotion-focused coping strategies, both in the Hungarian and in the international student samples. Besides, a higher proportion of international students used emotion-focused coping methods compared to Hungarian students. Concerning health anxiety, female students (Hungarian and international) had significantly higher levels of health anxiety compared to males. Moreover, female students had significantly higher levels of perceived stress compared to males in the international group, however, there was no significant difference in perceived stress between males and females in the Hungarian group. Conclusion: Peoples elevated perceived stress levels during major life events can be further deepened by disengagement from home by using inadequate coping methods. By following and adhering to international recommendations that primarily convey problem-focused strategies, peoples emotional-focus strategies and the associated higher levels of perceived stress may be mitigated.","output":"Health Anxiety, Perceived Stress, and Coping Styles in the Shadow of the COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The available data regarding the short and long-term consequences of COVID-19 is still insufficient This narrative review aims to provide information on the prolonged COVID-19 symptoms in recovered patients and their implications during dental management Additionally, this manuscript highlights the oral manifestations of COVID-19 and its management A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases, WHO and CDC websites, and grey literature was searched through Google Scholar Clinical articles (clinical trials, case-reports, cohort, and cross-sectional studies) were included, reporting prolonged post-COVID-19 symptoms Although COVID-19 is an infectious disease primarily affecting the lungs, its multi-organ involvement is responsible for several prolonged symptoms, including oral implications In recovered patients with prolonged COVID-19 symptoms, considerations for providing dental treatment has to be made as they can present with assortment of symptoms These prolonged post-COVID-19 symptoms can affect the delivery of the required dental treatment Hence, the recommendations proposed in this narrative review can be a useful starting point to aid dental teams providing adequate care for such recovered patients","output":"A Review of Prolonged Post-COVID-19 Symptoms and Their Implications on Dental Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cellular function is well known to be influenced by the physical cues and architecture of their three dimensional (3D) microenvironment.

We proposed a short-range airborne infection risk assessment model based on the continuum model and two-stage jet model. The effects of ventilation, physical distance and activity intensity on the short-range airborne exposure were studied systematically. The results suggested that increasing physical distance and ventilation reduced short-range airborne exposure and infection risk. However, a diminishing return phenomenon was observed when the ventilation rate or physical distance was beyond a certain threshold. When the infectious quantum concentration was less than 1 quantum/L at the mouth, our newly defined threshold distance and threshold ventilation rate were independent of quantum concentration. We estimated threshold distances of 0.59, 1.1, 1.7 and 2.6 m for sedentary/passive, light, moderate and intense activities, respectively. At these distances, the threshold ventilation was estimated to be 8, 20, 43, and 83 L/s per person, respectively.

In this paper we examine excess deaths in Serbia and 34 other European countries in 2020. Methodological inconsistencies and big differences in how COVID-19 deaths were recorded across different countries make it difficult to make any cross-country comparisons, even with the scope limited only to Europe. Since the number of total deaths is a methodologically solid indicator, we looked at the differences between the total number of deaths in 2020 and compared that to deaths in 2019. The lowest increase in mortality C below 5% C occurred in countries in the north of Europe (Norway, Denmark, Finland, Latvia), while the highest increase C over 18% C was recorded in the southern and central parts of the continent (Albania, Northern Macedonia, Spain, Belgium, Poland, Slovenia, Russia). There is no clear geographical regularity. In 2020, Serbia had 12.6% more deaths compared to 2019, which was close to the European average. Within Serbia, statistical differences between regions were not large. Measuring the contribution of COVID-19 deaths to excess mortality is much more problematic. The excess death ratio is more helpful for understanding methodological and data-gathering issues than finding evidence about composition and divergence in mortality. According to this indicator (based on preliminary data), only 25% of excess deaths in Serbia in 2020 were caused by COVID-19, while the European average was 54%. However, in many (primarily Eastern European) countries in 2020, the indirect consequences of COVID-19 on the health of the population were more significant than the direct ones. It is precisely the ratio of COVID-19 diagnoses that led to death in total mortality that shows this. The final results may confirm this statement or indicate potential data manipulation.

No research has empirically validated declines in surgical volume in Japan, based on the usage of surgical triage. We aimed to identify whether the announcement of surgical priorities by each Japanese surgical society may have affected the surgical volume decline during the 1st wave of this pandemic. METHODS: We extracted 490,719 available cases of patients aged > 15 years who underwent elective major surgeries between July 1, 2018, and June 30, 2020. After the categorization of surgical specialities, we calculated descriptive statistics to compare the year-over-year trend and conducted an interrupted time series analysis to validate the decline of each surgical procedure. RESULTS: Monthly surgical cases of eight surgical specialities, especially ophthalmology and ear/nose/throat surgeries, decreased from April 2020 and reached a minimum in May 2020.

With the adoption of safety/mitigation standards imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the seating capacities of rooms were reduced by more than 70%, thus making virtually every existing room assignment for Fall 2020 infeasible. The demand for in-person instruction required the reassignment of a large number of courses to rooms, where not all requests for physical space could be accommodated. In order to maximize opportunities for in-person instruction, UConn introduced a teaching modality in which class meetings are attended on campus by only 50% of the enrolled students. As decision makers were given partial flexibility to assign teaching modalities to classes, the complexity of the assignment problem increased considerably, especially because the real-world instances involved hundreds of rooms and thousands of classes and required a quick solution turnaround in practice. In this article, we introduce this flexible assignment problem and describe the two mixed-integer programming formulations that were used to solve the real-world instances of the problem;in particular, one of the formulations leverages structural properties presented in this work in order to represent the problem in a more compact way.

Based on the crucial fact, the study evaluated the impact of nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emissions, coal combustion, and traffic emissions on COVID-19 cases in a panel of 39 most affected countries of the world. These three air pollution factors are considered to form a lethal smog that negatively affects the patients respiratory system, leading to increased susceptibility to coronavirus worldwide. The study used the Markov two-step switching regime regression model for obtaining parameter estimates. In contrast, an innovation accounting matrix is used to assess smog factors intensity on possibly increasing coronavirus cases over time. The results show that N(2)O emissions, coal combustion, and traffic emissions increase COVID-19 cases in regime-1. On the other hand, N2O emissions significantly increase coronavirus cases in regime-2. The innovation accounting matrix shows that N2O emissions would likely have a more significant share of increasing coronavirus cases with a variance of 33.902%, followed by coal combustion (i.e., 6.643%) and traffic emissions (i.e., 2.008%) over the time horizon.

Borehole observations provide the first-hand data that characterise the fluctuation, depth, and aquifer conditions of the groundwater. Unfortunately, such observations are not available or are insufficient for scientific use in many regions. Taking the Lake Victoria Basin (LVB) as an example of data-deficient regions, this study proposes a simple knowledge-based approach that uses the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) for the main data, with rainfall, hydrological, topographical and geological datasets as supports, by which to infer the spatio-temporal variability and storage potential of groundwater. The method is based on analysis and inversion of impact factors on groundwater, and the feasibility of such a method is proven by showing that the groundwater results from GLDAS CLSM can correctly indicate the seasonality, as well as the link to topographical and geological features. For example, both results from the water balance equation (WBE) and GLDAS CLSM indicate that there are two groundwater recharge seasons in the basin, e.g., March to May and September to November. Compared to the eastern side of the LVB, the western side has mountains blocking surface runoff, and thus, reasonably, has larger storage potential estimates in GLDAS CLSM. Due to the low degree of weathering of the basement rocks, it is expected that there is only small storage potential and variation of groundwater in the southeastern parts of the LVB. GLDAS CLSM also correctly reflects this behaviour. Additionally, the largest groundwater storage potential over the LVB is found in regions near the Kagera River and the western shoreline, since it associates with unconsolidated rocks and behaviours of large groundwater recharge from GLDAS CSLM during the wet year of 2006. The major limitation of this knowledge-based method is that the uncertainty in terms of magnitude on GLDAS CLSM groundwater changes cannot be assessed, in addition to the fact that the reliability of the results cannot be quantified in terms of specific numbers. Therefore, the results and interpretation of groundwater behaviours using such methods can only be a guide for 'where' and 'when' to find groundwater.","output":"Inference of the spatio-temporal variability and storage potential of groundwater in data-deficient regions through groundwater models and inversion of impact factors on groundwater, as exemplified by the Lake Victoria Basin."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wastewater surveillance for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has garnered extensive public attention during the coronavirus disease pandemic as a proposed complement to existing disease surveillance systems.

With all attention and significant effort diverted to containing and managing the COVID-19 outbreak (and understandably so), essential medical services such as transplant services are likely to be affected. Closure of transplant programs in an outbreak caused by a highly transmissible novel pathogen may be inevitable owing to patient safety. Yet program closure is not without harm; patients on the transplant waitlist may die before the program reopens. By adopting a tiered approach based on outbreak disease alert levels, and having hospital guidelines based on the best available evidence, life-saving transplants can still be safely performed. We performed a lung transplant and a liver transplant successfully during the COVID-19 era. We present our guidelines and experience on managing the transplant service as well as the selection and management of donors and recipients.

An effective and practical MV weaning protocol is needed for these fragile cases. CASE SUMMARY: Here, we present two critical COVID-19 patients who presented with fever, cough and fatigue. COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed based on blood cell counts, chest computed tomography (CT) imaging, and nuclei acid test results. To address the patients respiratory failure, they first received noninvasive ventilation (NIV). When their condition did not improve after 2 h of NIV, each patient was advanced to MV [tidal volume (Vt), 6 mL/kg ideal body weight (IBW); 8-10 cmH(2)O of positive end-expiratory pressure; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/min; and 40%-80% FiO(2)] with prone positioning for 12 h/day for the first 5 d of MV. Extensive infection control measures were conducted to minimize morbidity, and pharmacotherapy consisting of an antiviral, immune-enhancer, and thrombosis prophylactic was administered in both cases. Upon resolution of lung changes evidenced by CT, the patients were sequentially weaned using a weaning screening test, spontaneous breathing test, and airbag leak test. After withdrawal of MV, the patients were transitioned through NIV and high-flow nasal cannula oxygen support. Both patients recovered well. CONCLUSION: A MV protocol attentive to intubation/extubation timing, prone positioning early in MV, infection control, and sequential withdrawal of respiratory support, may be an effective regimen for patients with critical COVID-19.","output":"Two mechanically ventilated cases of COVID-19 successfully managed with a sequential ventilation weaning protocol: Two case reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the huge negative impacts it is causing, researching on COVID-19-related issues is very important for designing proactive and comprehensive public health interventions to fight against the pandemic.

Data used in this paper were mainly obtained from the official database of the Ministry of Health of Vietnam. Descriptive statistics were carried out using Stata 16 software. As of 18 May 2020, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases detected in Vietnam was 324, 16 cases from 4 cities and provinces in the first phase (during 20 days, 0.8 cases detected per day) and 308 cases from 35 cities, provinces in the second phase (during 76 days, 4.1 cases detected per day). Vietnam has mobilized its entire political system to fight the COVID-19 and achieved some initial successes.

Many of these studies rely on geographical and temporal aggregation of cases and can be difficult to interpret due to the spatial and temporal factors in outbreak spread. Further, it can be challenging to distinguish between disparities in health outcomes caused by variation in transmission risk or disease severity. METHODS: We used anonymised laboratory confirmed and suspected case data, classified by ethnicity and deprivation status, to evaluate how disparities in risk between socio-economic and ethnic groups vary over the early stages of the 2009 Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 epidemic in Birmingham and London, two key cities in the emergence of the UK epidemic. We evaluated the relative risk of infection in key ethnic minority groups and by national and city level deprivation rank. RESULTS: We calculated higher incidence in more deprived areas and in people of South Asian ethnicity in both Birmingham and London, although the magnitude of these disparities reduced with time. The clearest disparities existed in school-aged children in Birmingham, where the most deprived fifth of the population was 2.8 times more likely to be infected than the most affluent fifth of the population. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows that although disparities in reported cases were present in the early phase of the Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreak in both Birmingham and London, they vary substantially depending on the period over which they are measured. Further, the development of disparities suggest that clustering of social groups play a key part as the outbreak appears to move from one ethnic and socio-demographic group to another. Finally, high incidence and large disparities between children indicate that they may hold an important role in driving inequalities.

Together with Src and other signaling proteins, the Na/K-ATPase forms an oxidant amplification loop (NKAL), amplifies ROS, and participates in cytokines storm in obesity. The development of a peptide fragment of the 1 subunit, NaKtide, has been shown to negatively regulate Src. Several groups showed that the systemic administration of the cell permeable modification of NaKtide (pNaKtide) or its selective delivery to fat tissueadipocyte specific expression of NaKtideameliorate the systemic elevation of inflammatory cytokines seen in chronic obesity. Severe acute respiratory syndrome C coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the RNA Coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 global pandemic, invades cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor (ACE2R) that is appended in inflamed fat tissue and exacerbates the formation of the cytokines storm. Both obesity and heart and renal failure are well known risks for adverse outcomes in patients infected with COVID-19. White adipocytes express ACE-2 receptors in high concentration, especially in obese patients. Once the virus invades the white adipocyte cell, it creates a COVID19Cporphyrin complex which degrades and produces free porphyrin and iron and increases ROS. The increased formation of ROS and activation of the NKAL results in a further potentiated formation of ROS production, and ultimately, adipocyte generation of more inflammatory mediators, leading to systemic cytokines storm and heart failure. Moreover, chronic obesity also results in the reduction of antioxidant genes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), increasing adipocyte susceptibility to ROS and cytokines. It is the systemic inflammation and cytokine storm which is responsible for many of the adverse outcomes seen with COVID-19 infections in obese subjects, leading to heart failure and death. This review will also describe the potential antioxidant drugs and role of NaKtide and their demonstrated antioxidant effect used as a major strategy for improving obesity and epicardial fat mediated heart failure in the context of the COVID pandemic.","output":"The Pivotal Role of Adipocyte-Na K peptide in Reversing Systemic Inflammation in Obesity and COVID-19 in the Development of Heart Failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the dynamics of healthcare in the USA. In early 2020, most states issued orders to stop non-emergent elective surgeries. This contracted the overall revenue generated by the hospital systems. The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on volume has not been well studied but effects on surgeon professional fees generated remains unexplored. The goal of this study was to assess if COVID-19 pandemic has affected surgeon professional fees and revenues generated from emergency general surgeries. METHODS: This is a retrospective review to compare surgical case volume in 2019 and 2020. We obtained our data from a tertiary care referral center database. Data were collected from February to April of 2019 and 2020, corresponding to the duration of statewide ban on non-emergent surgical cases. We used the most reported current procedural terminology (CPT) Code for each surgical procedure to calculate the surgeon professional fees generated. We calculated the percentage difference in surgeon professional fees between 2019 and 2020 for comparison. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant decrease in daily emergent operations between 2019 and 2020 time periods (6.13/day vs 4.64/day). There was a statistically significant decrease in hospital admissions for appendicitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis, skin and soft tissue infections, small bowel obstruction and GI bleed. Additionally, a statistically significant decrease in number of appendectomy, cholecystectomy, sigmoid colectomy with anastomosis, small bowel resection, operation for incarcerated and reducible hernia procedures was observed. There is a decline in surgeon professional fees generated in 2020 compared to 2019 for all emergent surgeries. When compared to 2019, we observed an increase of 238 more inquests in February to April of 2020, which is the same time period when we noticed a significant decrease in hospital admissions and procedures for emergency general surgery. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted surgical case volumes in 2020 compared to 2019. This includes both emergent and non-emergent cases. There is a need for more broad cost analysis which considers hospital expenditures and cost benefit analysis.","output":"Impact of Covid-19 pandemic on volume and surgeon professional fees generated by emergency general surgery procedures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Frente a la pandemia el gobierno argentino estableci el aislamiento social, preventivo y obligatorio que impona la restriccin de movimientos de toda la poblacin, el cual se prolong durante ocho meses.

The purpose of this article is to explore the subjective experience of 319 participants of 65 years of age and over, residents of Buenos Aires City, focusing on their feelings, emotions, and their own assessment of the gains experienced during the mandatory social isolation. Using data collected through a three-wave panel survey, we examine the temporal variability of the responses. The questionnaires ran between June and August 2020, during which time the epidemiological curve reached its highest levels. For the analysis of the textual data, we used a content analysis approach. A typology of emotion trajectories was developed, reporting both stable and oscillating characteristics that account for positive or negative emotional valences. Most cases show oscillating emotion trajectories that show a shift towards negative valences. The study observed that women experience emotional discomfort to a greater extent than men.","output":"El pjaro en la jaula: Una exploracin longitudinal de opiniones, emociones y sentimientos de adultos mayores en la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina, durante el aislamiento social preventivo y obligatorio (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic faces the reader of scientific papers with a variety of epidemiologic terms, often not familiar to the reader.

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of targeted antibiotic stewardship programs (ASP) on the use of antibiotics in designated COVID-19 departments and to compare it to the antibiotic use in the equivalent departments in the same periods of 2018 and 2019. Antibiotic consumption was assessed as days of treatment (DOT) per 1000 patient days (PDs). The COVID-19 pandemic was divided into three periods (waves) according to the pandemic dynamics. The proportion of patients who received at least one antibiotic was significantly lower in COVID-19 departments compared to equivalent departments in 2018 and 2019 (Wave 2: 30.2% vs. 45.6% and 44.9%, respectively; Wave 3: 30.5% vs. 47.8% and 50.1%, respectively, p < 0.001). The DOT/1000PDs in every COVID-19 wave was lower than during similar periods in 2018 and 2019 (179-282 DOT/1000PDs vs. 452-470 DOT/1000PDs vs. 426-479 DOT/1000PDs, respectively). Moreover, antibiotic consumption decreased over time during the pandemic. In conclusion, a strong ASP is effective in restricting antibiotic consumption, particularly for COVID-19 which is a viral disease that may mimic bacterial sepsis but has a low rate of concurrent bacterial infection.","output":"Antibiotic Use during the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Tertiary Hospital with an Ongoing Antibiotic Stewardship Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present era, there are many efforts trying to face the emerging and successive waves of the COVID-19 pandemic This has led to considering new and unusual targets for SARS CoV-2 2-O-Methyltransferase (nsp16) is a key and attractive target in the SARS CoV-2 life cycle since it is responsible for the viral RNA protection via a cap formation process In this study, we propose a new potential inhibitor for SARS COV-2 2-O-methyltransferase (nsp16) A fragment library was screened against the co-crystal structure of the SARS COV-2 2-O-methyltransferase complexed with Sinefungin (nsp16-PDB ID: 6WKQ), and consequently the best proposed fragments were linked via a de novo approach to build molecule AP-20 Molecule AP-20 displayed a superior docking score to Sinefungin and reproduced the key interactions in the binding site of 2-O-methyltransferase Three molecular dynamic simulations of the 2-O-methyltransferase apo structure and its complexed forms with AP-20 and Sinefungin were performed for 150 nano-seconds to provide insights on the dynamic nature of such setups and to assess the stability of the proposed AP-20/enzyme complex AP-20/enzyme complex demonstrated better stability for the ligand-enzyme complex compared to Sinefungin in a respective setup Furthermore, MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations showed a better profile for AP-20/enzyme complex compared to Sinefungin/enzyme complex emphasizing the potential inhibitory effect of AP-20 on SARS COV-2 2-O-methyltransferase We endorse our designed molecule AP-20 to be further explored via experimental evaluations to confront the spread of the emerging COVID-19 Also, in silico ADME profiling has ascribed to AP-20 an excellent safety and metabolic stability profile ? 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry","output":"In silico identification of potential SARS COV-2 2- O -methyltransferase inhibitor: Fragment-based screening approach and MM-PBSA calculations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The health profession faces a new challenge with the emergence of a novel viral disease Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a form of atypical pneumonia caused by a coronavirus termed SARS-CoV.

Commonly used clinical content standards, and the information models that underpin them, are primarily related to health data exchange, and so are usually document- or message-focused. In contrast, over the past 12 years, the Clinical Models program at openEHR International has gradually established a governed, coordinated, and coherent ecosystem of clinical information models, known as openEHR archetypes. Each archetype is designed as a maximal data set for a universal use-case, intended for reuse across various health data sets, known as openEHR templates. To date, only anecdotal evidence has been available to indicate if the hypothesis of archetype reuse across templates is feasible and scalable. As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, between February and July 2020, 7 openEHR templates were independently created to represent COVID-19Crelated data sets for symptom screening, confirmed infection reporting, clinical decision support, and research. Each of the templates prioritized reuse of existing use-case agnostic archetypes found in openEHR International's online Clinical Knowledge Manager tool as much as possible. This study is the first opportunity to investigate archetype reuse within a range of diverse, multilingual openEHR templates. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the use and reuse of openEHR archetypes across the 7 openEHR templates as an initial investigation about the reuse of information models across data sets used for a variety of clinical purposes. METHODS: Analysis of both the number of occurrences of archetypes and patterns of occurrence within 7 discrete templates was carried out at the archetype or clinical concept level. RESULTS: Across all 7 templates collectively, 203 instances of 58 unique archetypes were used. The most frequently used archetype occurred 24 times across 4 of the 7 templates. Total data points per template ranged from 40 to 179. Archetype instances per template ranged from 10 to 62. Unique archetype occurrences ranged from 10 to 28. Existing archetype reuse of use-case agnostic archetypes ranged from 40% to 90%. Total reuse of use-case agnostic archetypes ranged from 40% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Investigation of the amount of archetype reuse across the 7 openEHR templates in this initial study has demonstrated significant reuse of archetypes, even across unanticipated, novel modeling challenges and multilingual deployments. While the trigger for the development of each of these templates was the COVID-19 pandemic, the templates represented a variety of types of data sets: symptom screening, infection report, clinical decision support for diagnosis and treatment, and secondary use or research. The findings support the openEHR hypothesis that it is possible to create a shared, public library of standards-based, vendor-neutral clinical information models that can be reused across a diverse range of health data sets.","output":"openEHR Archetype Use and Reuse Within Multilingual Clinical Data Sets: Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID -19 pandemic has seen a rise in the deployment of digital health technologies.

However, the worldwide usage of AI-based automation-assisted cervical cancer screening systems is hindered by computational cost and resource limitations. Thus, a highly economical and efficient model with enhanced classification ability is much more desirable. This paper proposes a hybrid loss function with label smoothing to improve the distinguishing power of lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for cervical cell classification. The results strengthen our confidence in hybrid loss-constrained lightweight CNNs, which can achieve satisfactory accuracy with much lower computational cost for the SIPakMeD dataset. In particular, ShufflenetV2 obtained a comparable classification result (96.18% in accuracy, 96.30% in precision, 96.23% in recall, and 99.08% in specificity) with only one-seventh of the memory usage, one-sixth of the number of parameters, and one-fiftieth of total flops compared with Densenet-121 (96.79% in accuracy).

In hospitals, it has been confirmed by several studies that SARS-CoV-2 can contaminate surfaces and medical equipment especially in hospitals dedicated to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. The aim of this study was to detect the contamination of hands, objects, and surfaces in isolation rooms and also in outpatients' clinics in hospitals and polyclinics. Environmental contamination of public high-touch surfaces in public facilities was also investigated during an active COVID-19 pandemic. Random swabs were also taken from public shops, pharmacies, bakeries, groceries, banknotes, and automated teller machines (ATMs). Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 positivity using real-time polymerase chain reaction. In the COVID-19 regional reference hospital, only 3 out of 20 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Hand swabs from SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in isolation rooms were occasionally positive for viral RNA. In outpatients' clinics, door handles were the most contaminated surfaces. Dental chairs, sinks, keyboards, ophthalmoscopes, and laboratory equipment were also contaminated. Although no positive swabs were found in shops and public facilities, random ATM swabs returned a positive result for SARS-CoV-2. Although there is no longer a focus on COVID-19 wards and isolation hospitals, more attention is required to decontaminate frequently touched surfaces in health-care facilities used by patients not diagnosed with COVID-19.

METHODS: Overall, medical records of 319 COVID-19 patients were included in the study. Demographic and clinical characteristics on admission were used for calculating the Standardized Early Warning Score (SEWS), National Early Warning Score (NEWS), National Early Warning Score2 (NEWS2), Hamilton Early Warning Score (HEWS), and Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS). Data on the outcomes (survival or death) were collected for each case and extracted for overall and subgroup analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the SEWS, NEWS, NEWS2, HEWS, and MEWS in predicting mortality were 0.841 (95% CI: 0.765-0.916), 0.809 (95% CI: 0.727-0.891), 0.809 (95% CI: 0.727-0.891), 0.821 (95% CI: 0.748-0.895), and 0.670 (95% CI: 0.573-0.767), respectively.

The basic reproduction number derived from the model is more comprehensive including the contribution from the exposed, infected, and asymptomatic patients. For this more complex six-dimensional ODE system, we investigate the global and local stability of disease-free equilibrium, as well as the endemic equilibrium, whereas most studies overlooked asymptomatic infection or some other virus transmission features. In the sensitivity analysis, the parameters related to the asymptomatic play a significant role not only in the basic reproduction number R0. It is also found that the asymptomatic infection greatly affected the endemic equilibrium. Either in completely eradicating the disease or achieving a more realistic goal to reduce the COVID-19 cases in an endemic equilibrium, the importance of controlling the asymptomatic infection should be emphasized.

Our study focused on COVID-19 mortality in the elderly in seven European cities. Long-term exposure to air pollution was estimated through annual pollutant concentrations at the residential address averaged over the last two years of the study period between February and May 2020. We focused on the main outdoor air pollutants PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and O3. Short-term variations in air pollutants and weather parameters (e.g. temperature, UV, relative humidity) were also examined through a 20-day period before the confirmed PCR diagnostic of COVID-19. Individual risk factors such as smoking status, sex, body mass index (BMI), ischemic heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic renal failure, history of cancer, COPD, and lung fibrosis, were taken into account. We found positive associations for diabetes and COVID-19 mortality (OR 2.2 CI 95% :1.1, 4.4). Using a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for all patient characteristics and city, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of no association between COVID-19 mortality and long-term and short-term increase in PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3. Our study suffers from the fact that patient profiles strongly differ between high-polluted and less-polluted cities. Strong differences in COVID-19 mortalities were observed between cities, which could be due to differences in COVID-19 management and treatment, such as accessibility to reanimation and intensive units between cities. Overall, our study highlights the need to improve estimation of individual exposure to air pollution. Indeed, even with the high-efficiency modelisation systems used in our study, we were unable to estimate the effect of air pollution within each city, because variations in air pollution exposure were too small. Individual markers of air pollution exposure such as recently demonstrated with urinary black carbon or passive individual samplers, would be most suitable for future explorations.

The economic and social burden that breast cancer places on societies has propelled research that analyzes the role of modifiable risk factors as the primary prevention methods. Healthy behavior changes, moderated alcohol intake, healthy body weight, and regular physical activity may decrease the risk of breast cancer among women. This review aimed to synthesize evidence on the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle-related interventions for the primary prevention of breast cancer in order to answer the question on whether implementing interventions focused on behavior changes are worth the value for money. Methods: A rapid review was performed using search terms developed by the research team. The articles were retrieved from MEDLINE and the Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, with an additional web search in Google and Google Scholar. Comparisons were performed on the cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life-year between the interventions using a league table, and the likelihood of cost-effective interventions for breast cancer primary prevention was analyzed. Results: Six studies were selected. The median cost-effectiveness ratio (in 2018 USD) was $24,973, and 80% of the interventions had a ratio below the $50,000 threshold. The low-fat-diet program for postmenopausal women was cost-effective at a societal level, and the physical activity interventions, such as the Be Active Program in the UK, had the best cost saving results.

The finished surface is a direct outcome of grinding wheel topography and its various microscopic interactions with the surface creating a compelling need for in-depth understanding. Study and characterization of grinding wheel topography in the present paper aim to understand the behavior of forces in the contact area. Due to stochastic abrasive grain distribution and quasi-static surface wear, 3-dimensional parameters hold a better physical significance in explaining the nature of microscopic interactions and their impact on the behavior of forces. Experiments are performed in a manner to wear out grinding wheels of the same specification with varying number of passes in an attempt to highlight the influence of varying topography on tribological interactions in the grind zone. The variation in topography at a specific interval of time is captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope and further processed for surface characterization whereas forces are captured using a dynamometer.

BACKGROUND: To limit the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, governments have imposed nationwide lockdowns to prevent direct contact; this has affected everyday lives and activities such as attending school classes. Such isolation may have impacted children's anxiety levels. DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study using a web-based anonymous questionnaire from 22-26 April, 2020, among children (N = 2,292) in Spain. For children below 7 years of age, parents reported the children's behavioural, emotional and somatic symptoms and family environment data on a questionnaire designed by the researchers. Children over 7 years answered the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale either independently or with their parents' assistance. RESULTS: Children over 7 years, boys in particular, scored high on the anxiety spectrum. Moreover, participants who knew someone who had suffered from COVID-19 at home or whose parent was directly involved in the pandemic, obtained higher Total Anxiety scores. Significantly high values were found in all aspects of anxiety among those who feared infection or whose parents been unemployed. Of the children below 7 years, 56.3% had four or more anxiety-related symptoms, the most frequent of which were tantrums, emotional changes, restlessness and fear of being alone. The number of symptoms reported was significant when someone in the family home had been infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 home confinement had a significant impact on children, causing anxiety, behavioural problems and somatic manifestations.

The differences in the ABO blood group distribution between COVID-19 patients and the control group (1991 cases) were analyzed. The relationship between blood type and clinical characteristics was analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 187 patients with COVID-19, 69 had type A (36.90%), 63 had type B (33.69%), 41 had type O (21.92%), and 14 had type AB blood (7.49%). The proportion of patients with type A blood in the COVID-19 group was significantly higher than that in the control group (36.90% vs. 27.47%, P = 0.006), while the proportion of patients with type O blood in the COVID-19 group was significantly lower than that in the control group (21.92% vs. 30.19%, P = 0.018).

The ABO blood group distribution was related to COVID-19 status. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with blood group A had an increased risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2, whereas blood group O was associated with a decreased risk, indicating that certain ABO blood groups were correlated with SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. Blood type was related to some clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19.","output":"Relationship between ABO blood group distribution and clinical characteristics in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction We explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence of mental health problems in the elderly population in retirement communities in Florida Older adults are especially at risk of illness from COVID-19, and the elderly population is more prone to comorbidities that can affect their contraction of COVID-19 While the aging population is known to be at risk, there is very little research conducted on how this risk affects mental health, a factor that can worsen and further impair recovery Methods We examined survey data amongst 1620 patients between the ages of 55 and 93 years old 53% of the patients were male, and 47% was female Demographic information such as race, ethnicity, marriage status, and living situation were collected Other health information such as BMI, smoking history, and alcohol intake were collected as well Since the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing, we look at the changes before and after March 2020, when COVID-19 was declared a national emergency in the United States Survey included COVID-19 interaction measures such as travel, mask usage, contact tracing, and whether patient has been tested for COVID-19 in the past Data collected using DSM V diagnostic criteria desk reference on mental health included diagnoses, insomnia, stress levels, and weight gain Patients were asked whether their stress levels have increased during COVID-19, and also if they already have an existing mental health diagnosis that worsened during the pandemic period Results 39% of patients report leaving the house daily, and 92 5% of the subjects wear a mask 100% of the time when going outside This shows that most elderly patients have a strict adherence to prevention policies that the CDC recommends such as wearing a mask in public settings, staying indoors, and using social distancing measures Therefore, this provides an explanation for why only 54 7% of the subjects reported stress level increases because of COVID-19 when recent research has stated that COVID-19 has had a detrimental effect on mental health and stress levels especially in the elderly population Correlation between subjects who have preexisting health conditions (hypertension, diabetes, history of stroke, and coronary artery disease (CAD)) and stress levels were insignificant, as well as the correlation between subjects who have pre-existing mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder) and stress levels In addition, 52 8% of subjects reported that if a COVID-19 vaccine was released to the public they would choose to get the vaccine Conclusions There has been an increase in evidence published that the COVID-19 pandemic is having a detrimental effect on mental health on populations worldwide and has been often declared as a mental health crisis Previous research has shown that the pandemic is disproportionately affecting people with pre-existing conditions and has had a negative impact because of widespread panic and anxiety, and physical isolation This survey data demonstrates that in the elderly population, the mental health impact of the pandemic has been overstated, and that with adherence to the guidelines on how to prevent contraction of COVID-19 there is not a significant impact on mental health for the older population","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on mental health in the elderly population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Cognitive dysfunction is a frequent complication after cardiac surgery and has been found to be associated with decreases in cerebral oxygen saturation measured with near-infrared spectroscopy. Sevoflurane has neuroprotective properties in vitro and in animal models. This study was designed to determine cognitive and clinical outcomes after sevoflurane- compared with propofol-based anaesthesia for on-pump cardiac surgery and the impact of decreases in under different anaesthesia regimens. METHODS One hundred and twenty-eight patients were randomly assigned to either i.v. anaesthesia with propofol- (PROP) or sevoflurane-based anaesthesia (SEVO). An intraoperative was defined as desaturation. The Abbreviated Mental Test, Stroop Test, Trail-Making Test, Word Lists, and mood-assessment tests were performed before, 2, 4, and 6 days after cardiac surgery. Markers of general outcome were obtained. RESULTS The analysis groups had differences in baseline cognitive performance. Analysis of variance for repeated measures (incorporating covariance of baseline scores) showed that in three of four cognitive tests, patients with cerebral desaturation showed worse results than patients without desaturation. Patients assigned to sevoflurane-based anaesthesia showed better results in all cognitive tests than patients after propofol. Interactions between the anaesthetic regimen and desaturation were found in all four cognitive tests. There were no differences in markers of organ dysfunction or general clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS Patients with impaired cognitive performance before operation may be at particular risk for intraoperative cerebral insult. A sevoflurane-based anaesthesia was associated with better short-term postoperative cognitive performance than propofol.","output":"Cognitive function after sevoflurane- vs propofol-based anaesthesia for on-pump cardiac surgery: a randomized controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the main challenges higher educational institutions encounter amid the recent COVID-19 crisis is transferring assessment approaches from the traditional face-to-face form to the online Emergency Remote Teaching approach. A set of language assessment principles, practicality, reliability, validity, authenticity, and washback, which can be applied to any academic subject, are critical within the design of any task that aims to assess learning. This review paper discusses how assessment approaches need to be modified in a time of crisis. It determines the position assessment should adopt within emergency remote teaching methods and analyzes the fundamental characteristics of five principles of assessment and how they can be accomplished with emergency remote teaching approaches. Furthermore, this paper evaluates the vulnerability and viability of the five assessment principles, examines the application of online assessment on a holistic level, and puts forward a set of recommendations to ensure the assessment principles are achieved within emergency remote learning contexts. The paper concludes with the notion that the construct of time, which is inherent within the principle of practicality, is the most significant when developing online assessments as it is this characteristic that is the most at risk. In addition, we suggest that the assessments that are implemented during emergency remote learning involve open-ended, as opposed to close-ended, questions and highlight the importance of educators demonstrating flexibility and understanding toward their students.","output":"Applying Assessment Principles during Emergency Remote Teaching: Challenges and Considerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human civilization witnessed an array of disastrous events since the very beginning. The ongoing global pandemic is the latest addition to that. Indeed, the effects of the present one have been overwhelming across the vast global periphery. Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a constant debate going regarding the potential origin. The most crucial part of the ongoing event without a doubt, however, has been the hallmark along with the pandemic itself is the negative infodemic, and that has been the most evident obstacle to counter, thus far. The fabricated version of the infodemic made the incidence several folds greater than it would have been.
