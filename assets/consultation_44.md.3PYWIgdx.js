Experimental design comprised of both whole-cell and cell-attached single-channel recordings using the patch-clamp techniques. The liposomal form of NO, Lip(NO), increased whole-cell outward K+ currents in a dose dependent manner while shifting the activation curve negatively by about 50 mV with respect to unstimulated cells with the EC50 value of 0.55  0.17 M. At the single channel level, Lip(NO) increased the probability of the open state (Po) of Maxi-K channels from 0.0020  0.0008 to 0.74  0.02 with half-maximal activation occurring at 4.91  0.01 M, while sub-maximal activation was achieved at 10-5 M Lip(NO. Channel activation was mainly due to significant decrease in the mean closed dwell time (about 500-fold), rather than an increase in the mean open dwell time, which was comparatively modest (about 2-fold). There was also a slight decrease in the amplitude of the elementary Maxi-K currents (approximately 15%) accompanied by an increase in current noise, which might indicate some non-specific effects of Lip(NO) on the plasma membrane itself and/or on the phospholipids environment of the channels. In conclusion, the activating action of Lip(NO) on the Maxi-K channel is due to the destabilization of the closed conformation of the channel protein, which causes its more frequent openings and, accordingly, increases the probability of channel transition to its open state.","output":"Electrophysiological Characterization of the Activating Action of a Novel Liposomal Nitric Oxide Carrier on Maxi-K Channels in Pulmonary Artery Smooth Muscle Cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considerations comprised in the article concern the problem of mandatory vaccination in Poland.

METHODS Based on the reference sequences of S protein, physical and chemical properties, hydrophobicity, signal peptide, transmembrane region, domain, secondary structure, tertiary structure analysis and antigenic epitopes prediction were carried out. Meanwhile, the tissue expression, related pathways and reactome pathways of angiotensis  converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and C-type lectin domain family 4 member M (CLEC4M) receptors were analyzed. RESULTS The amino acid sequence of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV has a 75.80% consistency. The structural characteristics of the two coronaviruses are highly consistent, but the secondary structure and tertiary structure of SARS-CoV-2 is not as obvious as SARS-CoV. ACE2 and CLEC4M are expressed in alimentary system, heart, kidney, lung and placenta. The main related the pathways of renin-angiotensin system, protein digestion and absorption pathway, and the reactome pathways of metabolism of angiotensinogen to angiotensins, GPCR ligand binding, are related to typical symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 induced by SARS-CoV-2.

We test predictions from the perturbation hypothesis, determining the impact of culling operations on badger populations, movement of surviving individuals and the influence on the epidemiology of bTB in badgers using data dervied from two study areas within the UK Government's Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT). Culling operations did not remove all individuals from setts, with between 34C43% of badgers removed from targeted social groups. After culling, bTB prevalence increased in badger social groups neighbouring removals, particularly amongst cubs. Seventy individual adult badgers were fitted with radio-collars, yielding 8,311 locational fixes from both sites between November 2001 and December 2003. Home range areas of animals surviving within removed groups increased by 43.5% in response to culling. Overlap between summer ranges of individuals from Neighbouring social groups in the treatment population increased by 73.3% in response to culling. The movement rate of individuals between social groups was low, but increased after culling, in Removed and Neighbouring social groups. Increased bTB prevalence in Neighbouring groups was associated with badger movements both into and out of these groups, although none of the moving individuals themselves tested positive for bTB. Significant increases in both the frequency of individual badger movements between groups and the emergence of bTB were observed in response to culling. However, no direct evidence was found to link the two phenomena. We hypothesise that the social disruption caused by culling may not only increase direct contact and thus disease transmission between surviving badgers, but may also increase social stress within the surviving population, causing immunosuppression and enhancing the expression of disease.","output":"Culling-Induced Changes in Badger (Meles meles) Behaviour, Social Organisation and the Epidemiology of Bovine Tuberculosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, the logarithmic production of existing well-known food materials is unable to keep up with the demand caused by the exponential growth of the human population in terms of the equality of access to food materials.

These peptides experienced liberation by the proteasome and transport by the peptide transporter TAP. However, there are multiple roads that lead to Rome, illustrated by the increasing number of alternative processing pathways that have been reported during last years. Interestingly, TAP-deficient individuals do not succumb to viral infections, suggesting that CD8 T cell immunity is sufficiently supported by alternative TAP-independent processing pathways. To date, a diversity of viral and endogenous TAP-independent peptides have been identified in the grooves of different MHC class I alleles. Some of these peptides are not displayed by normal TAP-positive cells and we therefore called them TEIPP, for T-cell epitopes associated with impaired peptide processing. TEIPPs are hidden self-antigens, are derived from normal housekeeping proteins, and are processed via unconventional processing pathways. Per definition, TEIPPs are presented via TAP-independent pathways, but recent data suggest that part of this repertoire still depend on proteasome and metalloprotease activity. An exception is the C-terminal peptide of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-membrane-spanning ceramide synthase Trh4 that is surprisingly liberated by the signal peptide peptidase (SPP), the proteolytic enzyme involved in cleaving leader sequences. The intramembrane cleaving SPP is thereby an important contributor of TAP-independent peptides. Its family members, like the Alzheimers related presenilins, might contribute as well, according to our preliminary data. Finally, alternative peptide routing is an emerging field and includes processes like the unfolded protein response, the ER-associated degradation, and autophagy-associated vesicular pathways. These data convince us that there is a world to be discovered in the field of unconventional antigen processing.","output":"Alternative Antigen Processing for MHC Class I: Multiple Roads Lead to Rome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies decay but persist 6 months postvaccination; lower levels of neutralizing titers persist against Delta than wild-type virus.

However, collective traumatic memories of past infectious diseases and the current impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in many Indigenous communities point to the need for Indigenous strengths-based public health resources. Further, recent data suggest that COVID-19 is escalating mental health and psychosocial health inequities for Indigenous communities. To align with the intergenerational strengths of Indigenous communities in the face of the pandemic, we developed a strengths- and culturally-based public health education and mental health coping resource for Indigenous children and families. Using a community-engaged process, the Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health collaborated with 14 Indigenous and allied child development, mental health, health communications experts and public health professionals, as well as a Native American youth artist. Indigenous collaborators and Indigenous Johns Hopkins project team members collectively represented 12 tribes, and reservation-based, off-reservation, and urban geographies. This group shared responsibility for culturally adapting the children's book My Hero is You: How Kids Can Fight COVID-19! developed by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Reference Group on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings and developing ancillary materials. Through an iterative process, we produced the storybook titled Our Smallest Warriors, Our Strongest Medicine: Overcoming COVID-19 with content and illustrations representing Indigenous values, experiences with COVID-19, and strengths to persevere. In addition, parent resource materials, children's activities, and corresponding coloring pages were created. The book has been disseminated online for free, and 42,364 printed copies were distributed to early childhood home visiting and tribal head start programs, Indian Health Service units, tribal health departments, intertribal, and urban Indigenous health organizations, Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health project sites in partnering communities, schools, and libraries.

There have been recent calls for more HCS to be conducted in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where many relevant diseases are endemic. HCS in general, and HCS in LMICs in particular, raise numerous ethical issues. This paper summarises the findings of a project that explored ethical and regulatory issues related to LMIC HCS via (i) a review of relevant literature and (ii) 45 qualitative interviews with scientists and ethicists. Among other areas of consensus, we found that there was widespread agreement that LMIC HCS can be ethically acceptable, provided that they have a sound scientific rationale, are accepted by local communities and meet usual research ethics requirements. Unresolved issues include those related to (i) acceptable approaches to trade-offs between the scientific aim to produce generalisable results and the protection of participants, (iii) the sharing of benefits with LMIC populations, (iii) the acceptable limits to risks and burdens for participants, (iv) the potential for third-party risk and whether the degree of acceptable third-party risk is different in endemic settings, (v) the conditions under which (if any) it would be appropriate to recruit children for disease-causing HCS, (v) appropriate levels of payment to participants and (vi) appropriate governance of (LMIC) HCS. This paper provides preliminary analyses of these ethical considerations in order to (i) inform scientists and policymakers involved in the planning, conduct and/or governance of LMIC HCS and (ii) highlight areas warranting future research.

Macrophages are one of the initial targets for rickettsiae after inoculation by ticks. However, it remains poorly understood how rickettsiae remain free in macrophages prior to establishing their infection in microvascular endothelial cells. Here, we demonstrated that the concentration of Rickettsia australis was significantly greater in infected tissues of Atg5(flox/flox) mice than in the counterparts of Atg5(flox/flox) Lyz-Cre mice, in association with a reduced level of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in serum. The greater concentration of R. australis in Atg5(flox/flox) bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) than in Atg5(flox/flox) Lyz-Cre BMMs in vitro was abolished by exogenous treatment with recombinant IL-1. Rickettsia australis induced significantly increased levels of light chain 3 (LC3) form II (LC3-II) and LC3 puncta in Atg5-competent BMMs but not in Atg5-deficient BMMs, while no p62 turnover was observed. Further analysis found the colocalization of LC3 with a small portion of R. australis and Rickettsia-containing double-membrane-bound vacuoles in the BMMs of B6 mice. Moreover, treatment with rapamycin significantly increased the concentrations of R. australis in B6 BMMs compared to those in the untreated B6 BMM controls. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Atg5 favors R. australis infection in mouse macrophages in association with a suppressed level of IL-1 production but not active autophagy flux.

Methods: The clinical and CT imaging data of 60 cured patients with imported COVID-19 and discharged from January to February 2020 in Anhui Province were retrospectively collected. At the initial diagnosis, 5 cases were mild, 53 were ordinary, and 2 were severe. The clinical characteristics of the patients and the characteristics of chest CT images at discharge were analyzed. Results: Fever (57 cases) and cough (55 cases) were the main symptoms in 60 patients. In 5 mild patients, 3 cases were negative in the whole course of CT examination, 2 cases were negative in the first time and abnormal in the second time. The first CT imaging features of 55 patients (53 common type and 2 severe type) were mainly bilateral lung involvement (51 cases), multiple lesions (33 cases), more common under the pleura (40 cases), and ground glass opacities were the most common (55 cases). The features of chest CT in clinical outcomes were that the ground glass shadow in the lung gradually faded and was completely absorbed (19 cases); the scope of ground glass shadow in the lung expanded and progressed to crazy-paving, consolidation shadow, and the lesion gradually absorbed again followed by fibrous cord shadows (27 cases); ground-glass opacities in the lungs quickly progressed to a consolidation and then slowly absorbed. Most of the lesions were accompanied by more residual fibrous cord shadows (4 cases). In 2 severe patients, the lesions in the lungs were larger ground glass, and a large amount of fibrous foci remained after slow absorption. Conclusions: Chest CT plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of imported COVID-19, and the degree of lung involvement seen on CT images is in good agreement with clinical outcome.","output":"Imaging dynamic observation of cured COVID-19 patients with imported coronavirus pneumonia/ ͹״߷ڲӰѧ̬۲"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Cross-sector Innovation Initiative (CSII) funded 10 communities for 2 years to support public health, health care, and social services sector alignment and community engagement to improve health equity and population health.

A nested mixed-methods approach was used to examine aged care leaders' opinions about the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of aged care residents and staff. METHODS: A total of 288 senior staff of Australian residential aged care facilities (care managers, clinical care coordinators, and lifestyle team leaders; mean age = 52.7 years, SD = 10.3) completed an online survey between 10th September and 31st October 2020. RESULTS: On average, nearly half of their residents experienced loneliness (41%) and a third experienced anxiety in response to COVID-19 (33%). The most frequently noted contributors to poor mental health among residents were restrictions to recreational outings and watching news coverage relating to COVID-19. Participants emphasized the need for increased access to counseling services and improved mental health training amongst staff. Residential care staff were similarly impacted by the pandemic. More than a third of staff were reported as anxious (36%) and 20% depressed, in response to COVID-19. Staff were worried about introducing COVID-19 into their facility and were impacted by news coverage of COVID-19. Staff would feel supported by financial assistance and by increased staff-resident ratios. CONCLUSIONS: Senior staff perceive that the mental health of Australian aged care residents and staff was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The most noted contributors were identified, as was the mental health support for aged care communities. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This study provides government and policymakers with clear intervention targets for supporting the sector.

Methods: This retrospective study used electronic medical records, between March 1, 2020 to September 14, 2020, and included patients aged  18 years with DKA. Clinical characteristics, hospital course, and complications (ICD-10 codes) were compared between patients admitted with DKA and confirmed COVID-19 infection (COVID+) to those with DKA without COVID-19 infection (COVID-). The American Diabetes Association criteria was used to define DKA. Results: Among 757 patients with DKA, 80 COVID+ patients with and 677 COVID- patients were included (mean age 49.1 years, female 52.7%, African-American 70.4%). Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. The COVID+ group had a lower admission glucose (mean glucose 413.1  218.7 mg/dL vs 441.1  222.6 mg/dL, p-value 0.05), and higher serum bicarbonate levels (18.2 mmol/L vs 16.6 mmol/L, p-value <0.05) compared to the COVID- group. Compared to the COVID- group, COVID+ required a longer time to achieve blood glucose < 250 mg/dl from admission (8.8 hours vs 7.1 hours, p-value <0.01), and had higher rates of acute respiratory failure (48.8% vs 9.5%, p-value <0.001), mechanical ventilation (32.5% vs 10.9%, p-value <0.001), sepsis (37.5% vs 15.7%, p-value <0.001), acute thrombotic events (11.3% vs 2.7%, p-value <0.05), and pneumonia (70% vs 10.3%, p-value <0.001).

The 22-item scale contains four subscales measuring symptom severity, functional disability, overall health and additional symptoms. ObjectivesThis study aimed to modify and refine the scale based on psychometric properties, emerging evidence on additional Long Covid symptoms, and feedback from a working group of patients and healthcare professionals. MethodsData were collected from 370 patients who completed the C19-YRS scale in a community Long COVID service. The psychometric properties of the Symptom Severity and Functional Disability subscales were assessed using a Rasch Measurement Theory framework, where all individual scale items were assessed for model fit, local dependency, response category functioning and differential item functioning (DIF) by age group and sex. Additionally, the subscales were assessed for targeting, reliability and unidimensionality. The overall health subscale is a single item, and the additional symptoms subscale is not intended to be summed, therefore neither is appropriate for Rasch analyses. Psychometric results and implications were relayed back to the working group for discussion, alongside clinical evidence of emerging and relevant symptoms not covered by the original C19-YRS. ResultsRasch analysis revealed promising psychometric properties of the symptom severity and functional disability subscales, with both displaying good targeting and reliability, although some individual measurement anomalies were noted. The original 0-10 item response category structure did not operate as intended for both the subscales. Post-hoc rescoring suggested that a 4-point response category structure would be more appropriate for both the subscales, and this aligned with patient feedback. This scoring change was implemented, alongside changes in the item composition of the symptom severity and additional symptoms subscales.

Animal cruelty and interpersonal violence-as well as other socially undesirable conduct such as bullying, antisocial personality disorder, rape, and serial murder-are closely related, so timely diagnoses of either one can help prevent acts of aggression. It is necessary, therefore, to analyze and try to understand whether there are early indicators that may help identify potentially violent individuals.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate clinical performance of six different SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and their quantitative results to better elucidate the clinical role of serology testing in COVID-19. DESIGN Six SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays were tested using remnant specimens from 190 patients. Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated for each assay with the current manufacturer's cutoff and a lower cutoff. A numeric result analysis and discrepancy analysis were performed Results: The specificity was >93% for all assays, and sensitivity was >80% for all assays ( 7 days post-polymerase chain reaction [PCR] testing). Inpatients with more severe disease had higher numeric values compared to health care workers with mild or moderate disease. Several discrepant serology results were those just below the manufacturers cutoff. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing can aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19 especially with negative PCR.

In an effort to continue to serve the community of people who inject drugs and practice compassionate and non-judgmental care, the students transitioned the clinic to a model of TeleMOUD (medications for opioid use disorder). We describe development and implementation of a medical student-run telemedicine clinic through an academic medical center-operated syringe services program. METHODS: Students advertised TeleMOUD services at the syringe service program on social media and created an online sign-up form. They coordinated appointments and interviewed patients by phone or videoconference where they assessed patients for opioid use disorder. Supervising attending physicians also interviewed patients and prescribed buprenorphine when appropriate. Students assisted patients in obtaining medication from the pharmacy and provided support and guidance during home buprenorphine induction. RESULTS: Over the first 9 weeks in operation, 31 appointments were requested, and 22 initial telehealth appointments were completed by a team of students and attending physicians. Fifteen appointments were for MOUD and 7 for other health issues. All patients seeking MOUD were prescribed buprenorphine and 12/15 successfully picked up medications from the pharmacy. The mean time between appointment request and prescription pick-up was 9.5 days. CONCLUSIONS: TeleMOUD is feasible and successful in providing people who inject drugs with low barrier access to life-saving MOUD during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell stimulates innate immunity including NLRP3 inflammasome and lead to development of adaptive immunity later. Hyperinflammatory response with the release of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1 and IL-6 results in cytokine storm in some patients with a worse outcome. Colchicine acts on NLRP3 inflammasome and inhibits and IL-1 mediated inflammatory attacks in gout and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) patients. Patients with inadequate response to colchicine may benefit from anti-IL-1 biologic agents such as anakinra and canakinumab. Recently, favourable effects of anakinra have been observed in COVID-19 patients with findings of cytokine storm. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 among refractory FMF patients followed-up in tertiary referral with the treatment of biologic agents and also document the course of COVID-19 in these patients. Methods: We searched out database of FMF patients to identify those using biologic agents (anti-IL-1, anti-IL-6 or anti-TNF) for colchicine-refractory FMF. We interviewed the patients using a standard questionnaire by phone call for symptomatic COVID-19 and evaluated those patients who described findings of COVID-19 further by their hospital records or inviting them to the hospital for additional investigations. Results: We identified 183 patients and contacted 106 of them by phone in May-October 2020. A history of symptomatic COVID-19 was documented in 7 FMF patients who were on a biologic agent. Six were on anti-IL-1 and one was on anti-TNF, and one of the patients was not taking his biologic agents for 1 year. All of 7 patients had a favourable outcome. All but 1 patient followed at home and none of them developed findings of cytokine storm, thromboembolism and secondary bacterial infection. Hospitalized patient did not require intensive care unit (ICU) support or mechanical ventilation, and he was not given additional anti-inflammatory medications. Conclusion: This series of refractory FMF patients with potentially higher inflammatory characteristics showed COVID-19 did not result in a worse outcome in those patients during the first phase of the pandemic, and none developed findings of cytokine storm. Observations in these patients supports further that biologic agents blocking IL-1 and possibly TNF may contribute to the uneventful course of COVID-19 by preventing the development of hyperinflammatory response. Data collection from a larger group of patients, especially those with amyloidosis, will clarify the protective effects of colchicine and contribution of anti-IL-1 treatments on the favourable disease course during the second phase of the pandemic.","output":"Favourable short-term course of COVID-19 in patients with familial mediterranean fever using biologic agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present paper discusses how climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic can be read as two facets of a Hegemonic Social Representation (HSR) under construction, the representation of survival, reshaping other hegemonic, socially shared representations in the Western culture such as Science, Politics/Democracy, and Nature, on an unprecedented scale.

Most studies have focused on hospitalized children or children from closed populations. It is essential that the viral etiology of these clinical diseases be accurately defined in the development of antiviral drugs. OBJECTIVE To investigate the role of all common respiratory viruses as upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens in the first year of life. STUDY DESIGN This community-based birth cohort study prospectively collected detailed information on all ARI contracted by 263 infants from birth until 1 year of age. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected for each ARI episode, and all common respiratory viruses were detected by polymerase chain reaction. Episodes were classified as upper respiratory illnesses or lower respiratory illnesses (LRI), with or without wheeze. RESULTS The majority reported 2-5 episodes of ARI in the first year (range, 0-11 episodes; mean, 4.1). One-third were LRI, and 29% of these were associated with wheeze. Viruses were detected in 69% of ARI; most common were rhinoviruses (48.5%) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (10.9%). Compared with RSV, >10 times the number of upper respiratory illnesses and >3 times the number of both LRI and wheezing LRI were attributed to rhinoviruses. CONCLUSION Rhinoviruses are the major upper and lower respiratory pathogens in the first year of life. Although RSV is strongly associated with severe LRI requiring hospitalization, the role of rhinoviruses as the major lower respiratory pathogens in infants has not previously been recognized.","output":"Role of respiratory viruses in acute upper and lower respiratory tract illness in the first year of life: a birth cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several arenaviruses cause hemorrhagic fever (HF) in humans, and evidence indicates that the worldwide-distributed prototypic arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is a neglected human pathogen of clinical significance. Moreover, arenaviruses pose a biodefense threat. No licensed anti-arenavirus vaccines are available, and current anti-arenavirus therapy is limited to the use of ribavirin, which is only partially effective and is associated with anemia and other side effects. Therefore, it is important to develop effective vaccines and better antiviral drugs to combat the dual threats of naturally occurring and intentionally introduced arenavirus infections. The development of arenavirus reverse genetic systems is allowing investigators to conduct a detailed molecular characterization of the viral cis-acting signals and trans-acting factors that control each of the steps of the arenavirus life cycle, including RNA synthesis, packaging and budding. Knowledge derived from these studies is uncovering potential novel targets for therapeutic intervention, as well as facilitating the establishment of assays to identify and characterize candidate antiviral drugs capable of interfering with specific steps of the virus life cycle. Likewise, the ability to generate predetermined specific mutations within the arenavirus genome and analyze their phenotypic expression would significantly contribute to the elucidation of arenavirus-host interactions, including the basis of their ability to cause severe HF.

The delayed access cohort showed a close correlation with increased morbidity (OR = 3.19, 95% CI 0.89C11.44, p = 0.07), blood transfusion (OR = 5.13, 95% CI 1.05C25.15, p = 0.04) and 30-day mortality risk (OR = 8.00, 95% CI 1.01C63.23, p = 0.05). SARS-CoV-2-positive patients had higher risk of blood transfusion (20% vs 7.8%, p = 0.37) and ICU admissions (20% vs 2.6%, p = 0.17) and a longer median LOS (9 days vs 4 days, p = 0.11). CONCLUSIONS: This article provides enhanced understanding of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient access to emergency surgical care. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 changed the quality of surgical care with poorer prognosis and higher morbidity rates. Delayed emergency department access and a filter effect induced by a fear of COVID-19 infection in the population resulted in only the most severe cases reaching the emergency department in time.","output":"The negative effects of COVID-19 and national lockdown on emergency surgery morbidity due to delayed access"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deep-sea mussels of the subfamily Bathymodiolinae are common and numerically dominant species widely distributed in cold seeps and hydrothermal vents. During long-time evolution, deep-sea mussels have evolved to be well adapted to the local environment of cold seeps and hydrothermal vents by various ways, especially by establishing endosymbiosis with chemotrophic bacteria. However, biological processes underlying the establishment and maintenance of symbiosis between host mussels and symbionts are largely unclear. In the present study, Gigantidas platifrons genes possibly involved in the symbiosis with methane oxidation symbionts were identified and characterized by Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pull-down and in situ hybridization. Five immune related proteins including Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), integrin, vacuolar sorting protein (VSP), matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), and leucine-rich repeat (LRR-1) were identified by LPS pull-down assay. These five proteins were all conserved in either molecular sequences or functional domains and known to be key molecules in host immune recognition, phagocytosis, and lysosome-mediated digestion. Furthermore, in situ hybridization of LRR-1, TLR2 and VSP genes was conducted to investigate their expression patterns in gill tissues of G. platifrons. Consequently, LRR-1, TLR2, and VSP genes were found expressed exclusively in the bacteriocytes of G. platifrons. Therefore, it was suggested that TLR2, integrin, VSP, MMP1, and LRR-1 might be crucial molecules in the symbiosis between G. platifrons and methane oxidation bacteria by participating in symbiosis-related immune processes.

METHODS We searched the Medline and Embase databases using search strings defined according to the population, exposure, comparison, and outcomes (PECO) applicable to our research questions in order to find studies published since 2000. Two independent reviewers evaluated the search hits using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A manual search was performed to identify additional relevant literature. We extracted the resulting studies and assessed them in eight domains of bias. The pooled CMV seroprevalence for daycare workers compared to the general population was calculated. RESULTS After evaluating the 6879 records, six methodologically adequate studies were identified: five cross-sectional studies and one cohort study. The pooled seroprevalence of daycare workers was 59.3% (95% CI 47.6-70.9). The four studies investigating risk of infection indicated an increased seroprevalence for daycare workers compared to a reference population (prevalence ratio, PR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.33-1.77). No study evaluated CMV seroconversions for daycare workers. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest a higher CMV seroprevalence for daycare workers compared to the general population. Notwithstanding the need for longitudinal and intervention studies, preventative efforts are needed. A pooled PR of 1.54 is compatible with a doubled seroconversion risk corresponding to a vocational probability of 50% if the substantial underestimation of the actual occupational seroconversion risk by prevalence-based estimators is considered.","output":"The risk of cytomegalovirus infection in daycare workers: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We learn painful lessons these days about the hidden weaknesses in the supply chains, while the surge reflects a new inflection point of the COVID-19 outbreak Healthcare experts, politicians, academics, and supply chain practitioners need to collaborate to build a reform agenda and roadmap for our humanitarian supply chain This study aims at investigating and assessing risks on the supply chain, especially for health care supplies The theme of the article is based on the development of an information-driven model to help in the assessment of supply chain risk An integrative review technique has been used to analyze literature to develop prepositions for the model The main actors of the model are supply chain preparedness, supply chain risk, supply chain response, and supply chain recovery The findings identify that timely preparation and assessment of supply chain risk can result in accurate adoption of the practices that can not only reduce supply chain risk but also enhance supply chain recovery during any catastrophic event","output":"Information-driven Supply Chain During a Catastrophic Event: COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)is spreading worldwide in 2020 Previous studies showed that elderly diabetic patients are more susceptible to COVID-19 and have higher rates of severity and mortality, though the reasons for this are unclear yet This research retrieved, the relevant articles in recent years and found that it may be related to the changes of lung structure and function, cellular and humoral immunity deficiency, angiotensin converting enzyme 2, obesity and inflammatory factors, hypercoagulability, oxidative stress, glycosylation, age and other factors in diabetic patients, but whether diabetes increases the susceptibility to COVID-19 needs to be confirmed by further research Copyright ? 2020 by the Chinese General Practice","output":"Factors Associated with Increased Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Diabetics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Diarrhoea is a major cause of death in neonate pigs and most of the viruses that cause it are RNA viruses.

The diversity of RNA viruses present in faeces of neonatal piglets suffering from diarrhoea in 47 farms, plus 4 samples from non-diarrhoeic piglets has been evaluated by NGS. Samples were selected among the cases submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories of Infectious Diseases of the Universitat Autnoma de Barcelona (Barcelona, Spain) and Universidad de Len (Len, Spain). RESULTS: The analyses identified the presence of 12 virus species corresponding to 8 genera of RNA viruses. Most samples were co-infected by several viruses. Kobuvirus and Rotavirus were more commonly reported, with Sapovirus, Astrovirus 3, 4 and 5, Enterovirus G, Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus, Pasivirus and Posavirus being less frequently detected. Most sequences showed a low identity with the sequences deposited in GenBank, allowing us to propose several new VP4 and VP7 genotypes for Rotavirus B and Rotavirus C. CONCLUSIONS: Among the cases analysed, Rotaviruses were the main aetiological agents of diarrhoea in neonate pigs. Besides, in a small number of cases Kobuvirus and Sapovirus may also have an aetiological role.

The explosive increase in number of cases requiring hospitalization has led to a delay in a big number of surgical interventions, including oncologic surgeries. Collateral effects of this increase means a challenge for urologists, who have been forced to redistribute their resources. Due to its poor pronostic, patients suffering from by upper tract urinary tumours will be negatively affected by this pandemic. METHODS: A non sistematic review was performed using literature published until May 23, 2020, using \\"Uppertract urothelial tumours\\", \\"COVID-19\\" and \\"nephroureterectomy\\".as keywords. The resulting manuscript was critically revised by national authors in order to establish common criteria about treatment and follow up. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Four studies were identified that assessed the impact of delaying radical nephrouretrectomy as curative treatment. These studies showed that surgery delays decrease overall survival and cancer specific survival rates in high-risk groups. On the other hand, delaying radical nephrouretrectomy due to ureteroscopy did not affect survival in cohorts of patients with predominately low-grade disease. CONCLUSIONS: A delay in curative treatment of upper tract urothelial tumours for more than three months results in adverse outcomes as overal survival and cancer specific survival.

In this observational population-based cohort study, we examined longitudinal changes in psychological distress associated with testing positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Participants (N = 8002; observations = 139 035) were drawn from 23 waves of the Understanding America Study, a nationally representative probability-based online panel of American adults followed-up every 2 weeks from 1 April 2020 to 15 February 2021. Psychological distress was assessed using the standardized total score on the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. RESULTS: Over the course of the study, 576 participants reported testing positive for COVID-19. Using regression analysis including individual and time-fixed effects we found that psychological distress increased by 0.29 standard deviations (p < 0.001) during the 2-week period when participants first tested positive for COVID-19. Distress levels remained significantly elevated (d = 0.16, p < 0.01) for a further 2 weeks, before returning to baseline levels. Coronavirus symptom severity explained changes in distress attributable to COVID-19, whereby distress was more pronounced among those whose symptoms were more severe and were slower to subside. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that testing positive for COVID-19 is associated with an initial increase in psychological distress that diminishes quickly as symptoms subside. Although COVID-19 may not produce lasting psychological distress among the majority of the general population it remains possible that a minority may suffer longer-term mental health consequences.","output":"Acute and longer-term psychological distress associated with testing positive for COVID-19: longitudinal evidence from a population-based study of US adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To examine the added value of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in a nursing home during an acute COVID-19 outbreak.

METHODS: The study included 369 patients who had clinical group III RMS at sites amenable to DPE from intermediate-risk Children's Oncology Group studies D9803 (encouraged DPE) and ARST0531 (discouraged DPE). RESULTS: The primary tumor site was bladder/prostate (136 patients; 37%), extremity (97 patients; 26%), trunk (24 patients; 7%), retroperitoneum (91 patients; 25%), or intrathoracic/perineum/perianal (21 patients; 6%). In total, 112 patients (53.9%) underwent DPE in D9803, and 26 patients (16.2%) underwent DPE in ARST0531 (P < .001), with loss of vital organ or function in 30 of 138 patients (22%). DPE allowed for a reduced radiation dose in 110 of 135 patients (81%; 51% were reduced to 36 Gy, and 30% were reduced to 42 Gy). Patients who underwent DPE had improved unadjusted overall survival (P = .013). In adjusted regression analysis, the risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI 0.43-1.16) was similar for patients who did and did not undergo DPE and was improved for the subset of patients who had tumors of the trunk and retroperitoneum (hazard ratio, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.20-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Children with group III RMS have equivalent or improved outcomes with DPE and can receive a decreased radiation dose for definitive local control.

Social distancing is critical for patients with cancer; however, it can also reduce their access to psychosocial coping resources. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore patient experiences to generate a model of how virtual mind-body programs can support the psychosocial well-being of patients with cancer. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study among patients (aged &#8805;18 years) who participated in a virtual mind-body program offered by a National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center during the COVID-19 pandemic. The program consisted of mind-body group therapy sessions of fitness, yoga, tai chi, dance therapy, music therapy, and meditation. Live integrative medicine clinicians held each session via Zoom videoconferencing for 30-45 minutes. In semistructured phone interviews (n=30), patients were asked about their overall impressions and perceptions of the benefits of the sessions, including impacts on stress and anxiety. Interviews were analyzed using grounded theory. RESULTS: Among the 30 participants (average age 64.5 years, SD 9.36, range 40-80, 29 female), three major themes were identified relating to experiences in the virtual mind-body program: (1) the sessions helped the patients maintain structured routines and motivated them to adhere to healthy behaviors; (2) the sessions enhanced coping with COVID-19-related-stressors, allowing patients to \\"refocus\\" and \\"re-energize\\"; and (3) the sessions allowed patients to connect, fostering social relationships during a time of isolation. These themes informed the constructs of a novel behavioral-psychological-social coping model for patients with cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual mind-body programming supported patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic through a behavioral-psychological-social coping model by enhancing psychological coping for external stressors, supporting adherence to motivation and health behaviors, and increasing social connection and camaraderie. These programs have potential to address the behavioral, psychological, and social challenges faced by patients with cancer during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The constructs of the conceptual model proposed in this study can inform future interventions to support isolated patients with cancer.

Together, the four cleavage products probably cover the entire ORF1b-encoded region of the EAV replicase, thereby representing the first complete processing scheme of a coronaviruslike ORF1b polyprotein. Pulse-chase analysis revealed that processing of the ORF1b polyprotein is slow and that several large precursor proteins containing both ORF1a- and ORF1b-encoded regions are generated. The localization of ORF1b-specific proteins in the infected cell was studied by immunofluorescence. A perinuclear staining was observed, which suggests association with a membranous compartment.","output":"Processing of the equine arteritis virus replicase ORF1b protein: identification of cleavage products containing the putative viral polymerase and helicase domains."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious diseases of farm animals are one of the major threats to agriculture and can cause considerable damage at local, regional, and even at the international level both in industrialized and in developing countries. In the last two centuries considerable efforts have been invested in understanding the causes and pathogenesis of viral and bacterial diseases of domestic animals. These studies have introduced new methodologies for the diagnosis, treatment, and control of veterinary diseases. Importantly, research on veterinary pathogens also had a major impact in understanding basic biological processes of viruses and bacteria. In some cases, studies on veterinary pathogens have revolutionized biology and established entire new disciplines. This article will furnish a historical perspective on how studies of animal diseases, focusing on viral diseases in particular, have made a major contribution on the current understanding of pathogen biology. In addition, the main features of some of the most important viral diseases of farm animals will be described. Climate and environmental changes can favor the emergence of new pathogens or the reemergence of old ones. It is critical that resources be devoted to research and surveillance of veterinary pathogens in order to preserve and improve both animal and human health.","output":"Viral Pathogens of Domestic Animals and Their Impact on Biology, Medicine and Agriculture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Endotracheal (ET) intubation is a common cause of acquired glottic stenosis. Severe cases often require an irreversible arytenoidectomy/cordectomy, which typically results in poor voice quality. Adult human cadaver larynges were studied to gain insights about ET tube-induced posterior glottic injuries, hoping to create a less invasive remedy. STUDY DESIGN: Human cadaver investigation and case reports. METHODS: Microlaryngeal assessments were done on 10 human cadaver larynges (5 men, 5 women) with and without ET tubes. After supracricoid soft tissue resection, measurements were obtained, including the distance between the outer diameter of the ET tube and the medial aspect of the cricoarytenoid joint facet. Additionally, measurements of the circumferential arc of differently sized ET tubes were made alongside both cricoarytenoid joint capsules. This information was used to design a silastic stent that would function as a self-retaining interarytenoid spring to treat posterior glottic stenosis in 5 patients. Four of 5 patients included in the clinical study were tracheotomy dependent, primarily because of glottic stenosis. The human surgical technique is described in detail. RESULTS: The shortest distance between the outer diameter of the ET tube to the medial cricoid facet averaged 5.02 mm in men and 3.62 mm in women. On the basis of the diameter of the intralaryngeal component of the initially round stent, and the position of the cricoarytenoid joint facets, the interarytenoid spring would have a subtended arc between 110 and 175. These data helped fashion parameters for modifying a conventional T-tube to form a new self-retaining silastic interarytenoid spring. The first 5 human cases have been successful, allowing effective tracheotomy tube decannulation and excellent voice quality. CONCLUSIONS: The anatomic investigation herein provided key insights into ET tube-induced glottic stenosis and facilitated a new straightforward procedure to surgically improve the airway yet preserve excellent vocal function in patients with acquired glottic stenosis.

It has narrowly lanceolate valves (26C55 m long, 4C5 m wide) and girdles 10C24 m in depth. Striae are parallel at the center of the valve (24C28 in 10 m), becoming slightly convergent toward the apices. Electron microscopy revealed that the external valve surface presents a longitudinally ribbed appearance (20C28 parallel ribs at its maximum width), whereas internally, rectangular areolae are occluded by ricae. The raphe slit lies in a narrow axial area, and one side of the raphe sternum is deeper and folds over the other, obscuring the internal opening. Internally, the central virga on one side of the raphe and two virgae on the other are somewhat broader. A conspicuous pore (stigma) is present between the two broadened virgae. The girdle consists of valvocopulae, copulae, and pleurae. There are 16C20 bands per cingulum. The valvocopulae and copulae are hollow tube\\\\like structures, with inner and outer portions contrsting in morphology. They decrease in diameter in an abvalvar direction. There are four pleurae. These are flat bands which facilitate overlap of the epicingulum and hypocingulum. Fundamental features of the valve and girdle reveal the distinctness of this species within Navicula. The areolae, external longitudinal ribs, and raphe structure suggest affinities with Pleurosigma, Gyrosigma, and Haslea. It is hypothesized that they share a derived state which indicates a recent common ancestor for these taxa.

The present study examined trends in distress and recovery in the aftermath of COVID-19 in China. Predictors that might increase risks or provide protections again distress were explored. METHOD: Participants were recruited using social media during the COVID-19 pandemic to complete a baseline and 6-week follow-up survey (N = 241). The change patterns of PTSD symptoms from baseline to follow-up were characterized using latent class growth analysis (LCGA). A repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted to explore the differences in the depressive symptoms across trajectory groups. Multinominal logistic regression was performed to investigate potential predictors of the outcome trajectories. RESULTS: Four longitudinal outcome trajectories were identified: chronic (PTSD symptoms remained high; 14.9%), resilient (symptoms remained low; 43.2%), recovered (symptoms decreased from symptomatic levels to asymptomatic; 19.5%), and delayed (symptoms increased from asymptomatic levels to symptomatic; 22.4%). Hopelessness and maladaptive coping strategies were unique predictors of distress and resilience as well as longer-term trajectories. CONCLUSION: Individuals evidenced four outcome trajectories of distress in the aftermath of COVID-19 in China. Despite the uncertainty and high levels of stress related to the pandemic, the majority of the sample demonstrated resilience and recovery.

We conducted interrupted time series analyses with respect to the UK lockdown. We examined changes in standardized mortality ratio for those with and without severe mental illness (SMI).OUTCOMES: Referrals and presentations to nearly all mental and physical health services dropped at lockdown, with evidence for changes in both supply (service provision) and demand (help-seeking). This was followed by an increase in demand for some services. This pattern was seen for all major forms of presentation to liaison psychiatry services, except for psychosis/mania and eating disorders, for which there was no evidence of change. Inpatient numbers fell, but new detentions under the Mental Health Act were unchanged. Many services shifted from face-to-face to remote contacts. Excess mortality, primarily in the over-70s, lagged slightly behind confirmed numbers of COVID-19 cases. There was a much greater increase in mortality for patients with SMI, which was not explained by ethnicity.INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 has been associated with a system-wide drop in the use of mental health services, with some subsequent return in activity. This may reflect a genuine reduction of need or a lack of help-seeking and pent-up demand. There has been a disproportionate increase in death among those with SMI during the pandemic.FUNDING: UK Medical Research Council and National Institute of Health Research.DECLARATION OF INTERESTS: ?

Whether such dual exposure to auto repair and spray painting environments worsens the lung function of auto mechanics is not documented. Lung function was evaluated in 300 males divided into three groups: control (group1), auto mechanics in stand-alone auto repair shops (group 2) and auto mechanics working in the vicinity of spray painting shops (group 3). Each group consisted of 100 subjects. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and forced expiratory volume in the first second expressed as percentage of FVC (FEV1%) were assessed using a Vitalograph spirometer. Percentage oxygen saturation was evaluated using a pulse oximeter. Results showed no significant differences in age, weight and height among various groups. FVC was significantly reduced in groups 2 and 3 (p< 0.05 and p<0.001 respectively) compared to control but not between groups 2 and 3. FEV1 was significantly reduced in groups 2 and 3 (P <0.001 each) compared with control but not significantly different between groups 2 and 3.

It is necessary to immediately investigate this due to the mutation of the viral genome and there being no current protective vaccines or therapeutic drugs. Molecular modelling and molecular docking based on in silico screening strategies were employed to determine the potential activities of seven HIV protease (HIV-PR) inhibitors, two flu drugs, and eight natural compounds. The computational approach was carried out to discover the structural modes with a high binding affinity for these drugs on the homology structure of the Wuhan coronavirus protease (SARS-CoV-2 PR). From the theoretical calculations, all the drugs and natural compounds demonstrated various favourable binding affinities. An interesting finding was that the natural compounds tested had a higher potential binding activity with the pocket sites of SARS-CoV-2 PR compared to the groups of HIV-PR inhibitors. The binding modes of each complex illustrated between the drugs and compounds interacted with the functional group of amino acids in the binding pocket via hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bond interactions using the molecular dynamics simulation technique. This result supports the idea that existing protease inhibitors and natural compounds could be used to treat the new coronavirus. This report sought to provide fundamental knowledge as preliminary experimental data to propose an existing nutraceutical material against viral infection.

Inclusion criteria were studies published from January 2020 to July 11, 2020, published and translated in English language, and studies that evaluated patients and providers satisfaction with the use of telehealth or telemedicine during COVID-19. Eighteen articles were included in this review. REVIEW METHODS: An evaluation matrix was developed to collect data from the included articles. The articles were appraised using Fineout-Overholt & Gallagher-Ford Rapid Critical Appraisal Checklist for Descriptive Studies and Rapid Critical Appraisal of Evidence-Based Practice Implementation or Quality Improvement Projects (Melnyk & Fineout-Overholt, 2015). Authors independently appraised each article using the appropriate appraisal tools. RESULTS: Ten of the articles (53%) included were studies conducted in the United States. Sixteen out of 18 studies evaluated patient satisfaction and five studies examined healthcare providers satisfaction with the use of telehealth. The majority of telehealth services offered were by subspecialists. Overall, patients and healthcare providers have high level of satisfaction with the use of telehealth during COVID-19 pandemic. Many patients and healthcare providers reported willingness to continue using telehealth after the pandemic. CONCLUSION: This integrative review provided additional evidence on patient and healthcare provider's satisfaction with the use of telehealth. Findings in this review may not be surprising as individuals, healthcare providers, and health systems needed to adopt the use telehealth due to necessity. However, the results for telehealth are promising.","output":"Satisfaction with the use of telehealth during COVID-19: An integrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current case was the first report demonstrating a single case presenting with sudden-onset tinnitus and cochleopathy after his first dosage of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. Audiometry revealed an abnormally high short increment sensitivity index. His tinnitus/cochleopathy was reversible and recoverable under conservative steroid management. The abnormality of the high short increment sensitivity index returned to the normal range after steroid management. This case report aimed to increase the cautionary awareness of clinicians concerning the potential adverse events of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine and the new onset of tinnitus/cochleopathy. In addition, immediate treatment is recommended for managing these patients after the onset of tinnitus/cochleopathy. Furthermore, due to the fact that the adverse event of new-onset tinnitus was reversible and recoverable, we still strongly recommend the continuation of the administration of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, based on its merits and demerits.","output":"The reversible tinnitus and cochleopathy followed first-dose AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a recently emerged lower respiratory tract illness, has quickly become a pandemic. The purpose of this review is to discuss and differentiate COVID-19 typical imaging findings from other diseases, which can appear similar in the first instance. The typical CT findings of COVID-19 are bilateral and peripheral predominant ground glass opacities. As per the Fleischner Society consensus statement, CT is appropriate in certain scenarios, including patients who are at risk for and/or develop clinical worsening. The probability, that CT findings represent COVID-19, however, depends largely on the pre-test probability of infection, which is in turn defined by community prevalence of infection. When the community prevalence of COVID-19 is low, a large gap exists between positive predictive values of chest CT vs. RT-PCR. This implies that with usage of Chest CT there are a large number of false positive results. Imaging differentiation is important, for management and isolation purposes, and for appropriate disposition of CT false positive patients. We will discuss differential pathology with close imaging resemblance to typical CT imaging features of COVID-19, and, highlight CT features that may help in differentiation from other conditions.","output":"Review of the Chest CT Differential Diagnosis of Ground-Glass Opacities in the COVID Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a case of COVID-19 pneumonia associated with spontaneous pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema.","output":"COVID-19 with spontaneous pneumothorax,pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Numerous skin manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection have been reported so far1-3 .

Understanding reinfection, including longevity after natural infection, will allow us to better know the prospect of herd immunity, which hinges on the assumption that natural infection generates sufficient, protective immunity. The primary objective of this observational cohort study is to establish the incidence of reinfection of COVID-19 among healthcare employees who experienced a prior COVID-19 infection over a 10-month period. Of 2,625 participants who experienced at least one COVID-19 infection during the 10-month study period, 156 (5.94%) experienced reinfection and 540 (20.57%) experienced recurrence after prior infection. Median days were 126.50 (105.50C171.00) to reinfection and 31.50 (10.00C72.00) to recurrence. Incidence rate of COVID-19 reinfection was 0.35 cases per 1,000 person-days, with participants working in COVID-clinical and clinical units experiencing 3.77 and 3.57 times, respectively, greater risk of reinfection relative to those working in non-clinical units. Incidence rate of COVID-19 recurrence was 1.47 cases per 1,000 person-days. This study supports the consensus that COVID-19 reinfection, defined as subsequent infection  90 days after prior infection, is rare, even among a sample of healthcare workers with frequent exposure.","output":"Incidence of COVID-19 reinfection among Midwestern healthcare employees"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 as a new global threat has affected global population for one year. Despite the great effort to eradicate this infection, there are still some challenges including different viral presentation, temporal immunity in infected individuals and variable data of viral shedding. We studied 255 COVID-19 suspected individuals to assess the viral shedding duration and also the antibody development against SARS-CoV-2 among the cases. Real Time RT-PCR assay was applied to determine the virus presence and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were evaluated using SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG kits. 113 patients were confirmed for COVID-19 infection. The patients were followed until negative PCR achieved. The median viral shedding among studied population was obtained 34.16 (17.65) days which was not significantly associated with age, sex and underlying diseases. Shiver and body pain were found in prolonged form of the infection and also patients who had gastrointestinal problems experienced longer viral shedding. Moreover, IgG was present in 84% of patients after 150 days. According to this data, the median viral shedding prolongation was 34.16 days which indicates that 14 days isolation might not be enough for population. In addition, IgG profiling indicated that it is persistent in a majority of patients for nearly 6 months which has brought some hopes in vaccine efficacy and application.","output":"Prolonged Viral Shedding and Antibody Persistence in Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The social currency, the existing potential resource in the social networks and communities of an individual, has become more significant in the era of information technology. Meanwhile, the rapid development of Internet service, especially its application on mobile devices, brings many new contents of prosocial behaviors (PBs), which benefits both individuals and communities. Specifically, social currency plays a positive role in promoting PB, forming positive personalities, promoting positive social adaptation, and contributing to human survival and social development. However, the theoretical research in this field still lags far behind the development of practice, and the research on the impact of social currency on PB remains exceedingly scarce. Grounded in the social exchange theory (SET), the present study collects a total of 497 WeChat user questionnaires, constructs a model for the influence mechanism of social currency on PB, and tests the hypothesis through hierarchical regression. According to the results obtained, it was found that the social currency is positively associated with PB, and users with a more social currency are more likely to act prosocially on their own. The PB of an individual is then influenced by the social currency generated through collective self-esteem (CS) so that the perception of CS can be considered as a mediating variable. Moreover, the communication network heterogeneity (CNH) moderates the above relationship, and the degree of heterogeneity will have different effects on the relationship of CS. The obtained conclusions enrich the previous theoretical results of PB and provided new insights for social managers to enhance the prosocial-related behaviors for the group, organization, and society.","output":"How Does Social Currency Influence Prosocial Behavior?

Higher education students may have been disproportionally affected due to the rearrangement of educational life and their susceptibility to psychosocial distress and substance use. The current study examined associations between pandemic-related stressors, psychosocial distress, and self-reported alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use before and during the first wave of the pandemic. Data were collected in Belgium as part of the COVID-19 International Student Well-being Study (C19 ISWS) and analyzed using multinomial logistic regression analyses. The sample contained 18,346 higher education students aged 17 to 24 (75% women). Overall use of alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis as well as binge drinking decreased during the pandemic, perhaps due to limited social gatherings. Moving back to the parental home was associated with decreased substance use, while depressive symptoms were associated with increased substance use. Perceived threat and academic stress were associated with increased binge drinking among heavy bingers and increased tobacco use. Decreases among students who moved back to their parental home may be explained by increased informal social control. Increased substance use was associated with a number of stressors and psychosocial distress, which suggests that some students may have been self-medicating to manage their mental health amidst the pandemic. Public health policy concerning substance use may prove to be less effective if not tailored to particular subgroups within the student population.","output":"Substance Use among Belgian Higher Education Students before and during the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The constant emergence of COVID-19 variants reduces the effectiveness of existing vaccines and test kits. Therefore, it is critical to identify conserved structures in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes as potential targets for variant-proof diagnostics and therapeutics. However, the algorithms to predict these conserved structures, which simultaneously fold and align multiple RNA homologs, scale at best cubically with sequence length and are thus infeasible for coronaviruses, which possess the longest genomes (30,000 nt) among RNA viruses. As a result, existing efforts on modeling SARS-CoV-2 structures resort to single-sequence folding as well as local folding methods with short window sizes, which inevitably neglect long-range interactions that are crucial in RNA functions. Here we present LinearTurboFold, an efficient algorithm for folding RNA homologs that scales linearly with sequence length, enabling unprecedented global structural analysis on SARS-CoV-2. Surprisingly, on a group of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-related genomes, LinearTurboFolds purely in silico prediction not only is close to experimentally guided models for local structures, but also goes far beyond them by capturing the end-to-end pairs between 5 [Formula: see text] and 3 [Formula: see text] untranslated regions (UTRs) (29,800 nt apart) that match perfectly with a purely experimental work. Furthermore, LinearTurboFold identifies undiscovered conserved structures and conserved accessible regions as potential targets for designing efficient and mutation-insensitive small-molecule drugs, antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), CRISPR-Cas13 guide RNAs, and RT-PCR primers. LinearTurboFold is a general technique that can also be applied to other RNA viruses and full-length genome studies and will be a useful tool in fighting the current and future pandemics.","output":"LinearTurboFold: Linear-time global prediction of conserved structures for RNA homologs with applications to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic situation gives us the opportunity of the following research, which is a plea to use the principle of proportionality as a rational argument in substantiating the restrictive measures adopted by the authorities in order to prevent the spread of Sars-CoV-2 virus Thus, after (1) we found it appropriate to make general considerations related to governmental measures for public health and safety in the introductory part, we continued with (2) the presentation of the proportionality standard, as a jurisprudential model used both at national and international level, in order to develop (3) proportionality in a narrow sense afterwards, using the formula of professor Robert Alexy, which we consider representative for the structure of balancing competing rights, using a quantifiable model, in which respect we have ex-emplified the applicability of this formula (4) Final-ly, we concluded that the principle of proportionality can be a convincing structural approach in the legal reasoning designated to promote the balance of principles (6), although we acknowledge some of the limitations of the proposed method, which we consider that can be overcome (5) ? 2020, Babes-Bolyai University All rights reserved","output":"About the fair balance of competing rights in the context of the covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are making up an increasing share of the pharmaceutical market. However, to improve affinity and efficacy of antibodies, many somatic hypermutations could be introduced during affinity maturation, which cause several issues including safety and efficacy and limit their application in clinic. Here, we propose a special class of human mAbs with limited level of somatic mutations, referred to as germline-like mAbs. Remarkably, germline-like mAbs could have high affinity and potent neutralizing activity in vitro and in various animal models, despite lacking of extensive affinity maturation. Furthermore, the germline nature of these mAbs implies that they exhibit lower immunogenicity and can be elicited relatively fast in vivo compared with highly somatically mutated antibodies. In this review, we summarize germline-like mAbs with strong therapeutic and protection activity against various viruses that caused large-scale outbreaks in the last decade, including influenza virus H7N9, Zika virus, Dengue virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. We also illustrate underlying molecular mechanisms of these germline-like antibodies against viral infections from the structural and genetic perspective, thus providing insight into further development as therapeutic agents for the treatment of infectious diseases and implication for rational design of effective vaccines.","output":"Potent germline-like monoclonal antibodies: rapid identification of promising candidates for antibody-based antiviral therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of early mortality and identify risk factors for early death following modern uncemented THA.

We aim to report the clinical outcomes and first series of carotid stenting in a cohort of patients with strokes from symptomatic carotid webs. METHODS Prospective and consecutive data of patients <65 years old with cryptogenic stroke admitted within September 2014 to May 2017. Carotid web was defined by a shelf-like/linear filling defect in the posterior internal carotid artery bulb by computed tomographic angiography. RESULTS Twenty-four patients were identified (91.6% strokes/8.4% transient ischemic attacks [TIAs]). Median age was 46 (41-59) years, 61% were female, and 75% were black. Median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 10.5 (3.0-16.0) and ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) was 8 (7-8). There were no parenchymal hemorrhages, and 96% of patients were independent at 3 months. All webs caused <50% stenosis. In patients with bilateral webs (58%), median ipsilateral web length was larger than contralateral (3.1 [3.0-4.5] mm versus 2.6 [1.85-2.9] mm; P=0.01), respectively. Twenty-nine percent of patients had thrombus superimposed on the symptomatic carotid web. A recurrent stroke/TIA involving the territory of the previously symptomatic web occurred in 7 (32%; 6 strokes/1 TIA) patients: 3 <1 week, 2 1 year of follow-up. Two recurrences occurred on dual antiplatelet therapy, 3 on antiplatelet monotherapy, 1 within 24 hours of thrombolysis, and 1 off antithrombotics. Median follow-up was 12.2 (8.0-18.0) months. Sixteen (66%) patients were stented at a median 12.2 (7.0-18.7) days after stroke with no periprocedural complications. No recurrent strokes/TIAs occurred in stented individuals (median follow-up of 4 [2.4-12.0] months).

Of course, I am speaking primarily of the global COVID\\\\19 pandemic, and the massive civil unrest that followed the murders of Breonna Taylor, Daniel Prude, George Floyd, Rayshard Brooks, and Jacob Blake. As we are all aware, higher education made unprecedented adjustments and tried to give a semblance of continuity and stability to students. But it is clear that the events of 2020 referred to here, affected and continues to affect students in different ways, and to hugely different extents. On one side, some students are actually thriving with more time to focus on their work and fewer distractions that are sometimes part of campus life. On the other side, we have students who have had family members die, have been separated from family, live in fear of being in a vulnerable population. Students have lost their jobs, struggled to pay for food, been scared to walk alone, have been attacked for simply who they are. Mental health crises in this already vulnerable population increased significantly. The achievement gaps that we all knew existed before 2020, have widened and continue to do so. What can we as educators do to eliminate, or more realistically perhaps, minimize these achievement gaps? Here, I show data from Summer 2020 and Fall 2020 classes showing that 93% and 88%, respectively, of the assignments that were summited more than 5 days late were from students who voluntarily disclosed that they were experiencing a significant life event, general stress, anxiety, or other illness.

METHODS: RNA sequencing and clinical data for COAD patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to identify differentially expressed (DE) RBPs between COAD tissue and normal colon tissue, and then the expression and prognostic significance of these RBPs were investigated in detail by systematic bioinformatics analysis. qRT-PCR was used to validate the expressions of prognosis-related RBP-encoding genes. RESULTS: Seven RBPs (RPL10L, ERI1, POP1, CAPRIN2, TDRD7, SNIP1 and PPARGC1A) were identified as hub genes associated with prognosis by a series of regression analyses, and were then used to construct a prognostic model. Further analysis based on this model indicated that the overall survival (OS) of the high-risk groups was lower than that of the low-risk groups. In this prognostic model, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.694, 0.709 and 0.665 for the TCGA cohort at 1, 3 and 5 years, respectively, while the AUC was 0.671, 0.633 and 0.601 for the GEO combined cohort at 1, 3 and 5 years, respectively, indicating the good predictive ability of the model.

Analogous to an electrical resistorCcapacitor circuit, it is expressed as the product of arterial compliance (Ca) and cerebrovascular resistance (CVR). Hypocapnia increases the time constant in healthy volunteers and decreases arterial compliance in head trauma. How the combination of hyocapnia and trauma affects this parameter has yet to be studied. We hypothesized that in TBI patients the intense vasoconstrictive action of hypocapnia would dominate over the decrease in compliance seen after hyperventilation. The predominant vasoconstrictive response would maintain an incoming blood volume in the arterial circulation, thereby lengthening tau. We retrospectively analyzed recordings of intracranial pressure (ICP), arterial blood pressure (ABP), and blood flow velocity (FV) obtained from a cohort of 27 severe TBI patients [(39/30 years (median/IQR), 5 women; admission GCS 6/5 (median/IQR)] studied during a standard clinical CO(2) reactivity test. The reactivity test was performed by means of a 50-min increase in ventilation (20% increase in respiratory minute volume). CVR and Ca were estimated from these recordings, and their product calculated to find the time constant. CVR significantly increased [median CVR pre-hypocapnia/during hypocapnia: 1.05/1.35 mmHg/(cm(3)/s)]. Ca decreased (median Ca pre-hypocapnia/during hypocapnia: 0.130/0.124 arbitrary units) to statistical significance (p = 0.005). The product of these two parameters resulted in a significant prolongation of the time constant (median tau pre-hypocapnia/during hypocapnia: 0.136 s/0.152 s, p ? .001). Overall, the increase in CVR dominated over the decrease in compliance, hence tau was longer. We demonstrate a significant increase in the time constant of the cerebral circulation during hypocapnia after severe TBI, and attribute this to an increase in cerebrovascular resistance which outweighs the decrease in cerebral arterial bed compliance.","output":"Hypocapnia after traumatic brain injury: how does it affect the time constant of the cerebral circulation?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies investigating the impact of coronavirus outbreak at the sector (industry) level are scant and focus on the USA market We examine this issue for the US, UK, and the European stock markets, using endogenous structural break models and event study methodology by identifying the critical events We find that the impact of coronavirus outbreak to the extent of black swan events is visible in March and, till the end of March 2020, the investors had limited opportunities for investment except for a few sectors in the US, UK, and Europe due to black swan events Specifically, we find some stocks in consumer staples, healthcare, telecommunications, utilities, and financials were the attention-seekers and different sectors in our sample countries had different reactions to the outbreak Overall, the analysis provides the reasons for panic buy and sell","output":"Black swan events and COVID-19 outbreak: Sector level evidence from the US, UK, and European stock markets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses responsible for severe respiratory diseases in birds and mammals. In infected cells they induce double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs), which are thought to be the site of virus replication. Until recently, both the origin of the CoV-induced vesicles and the exact localization of CoV replication remained unknown. It was assumed that the vesicles derive from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Nevertheless no conventional protein markers of the ER, ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), Golgi, or coatomer proteins could be detected in these structures. Recent data from our laboratory and others shed light on this mystery. It appears that the Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV), a prototype CoV, co-opts ERAD tuning vesicles as replication platforms. These vesicles are released from the ER, but do not contain conventional ER markers or coatomer proteins. Rather, they contain ERAD factors such as SEL1L, EDEM1, and OS-9 that are constitutively cleared from the folding compartment by so called ERAD tuning programs, and display non-lipidated LC3 (LC3-I) periferically associated at their limiting membrane. In MHV-infected cells, the ERAD tuning vesicle markers co-localize with viral non-structural proteins and double-stranded RNA, which are DMV markers. The unconventional role of LC3-I in the MHV infection cycle is further supported by the fact that Atg5 and Atg7, both essential proteins for LC3-I to LC3-II conversion and macroautophagy, are dispensable for CoV replication and DMV formation. These new insights into CoV replication might lead to new therapies to treat CoV infections. They also reveal a novel role for LC3, in its non-lipidated form, in both maintenance of cellular proteostasis and viral infection, the latter function supported by recent findings showing involvement of LC3-I in equine arteritis virus replication.","output":"Non-Lipidated LC3 is Essential for Mouse Hepatitis Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronaviridae family, has caused a deadly pandemic known as the Coronavirus disease 2019, (COVID-19).

METHODS: We conducted a Danish population-based cohort study including all residents living within Capital Region of Denmark and Region Zealand from January 28th, 2020 until September 15th, 2020 with the only eligibility criterion being a test for SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription-polymerase chain-reaction. Main outcomes included development of COVID-19, COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality. RESULTS: COVID-19 was less common among patients with IMIDs than the background population (n = 328/20,513 (1.60%) and n = 10,792/583,788(1.85%), p < 0.01, respectively). However, those with IMIDs had a significantly higher risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization (31.1% and 18.6%, p < 0.01, respectively) and mortality (9.8% and 4.3%, p < 0.01, respectively), which were associated with patients older than 65 years, and presence of comorbidities. Furthermore, systemic steroids were independently associated with a severe course of COVID-19 (Odds ratio (OR) = 3.56 (95%CI 1.83-7.10), p < 0.01), while biologic therapies were associated with a reduced risk hereof (OR = 0.47 (95%CI 0.22-0.95), p = 0.04).

This paper shows the mathematical model and a proposal for its calibration. Specific results are shown for Spain. Four phases were considered: non-controlled evolution;total lock-down;partial easing of the lock-down;and a phased lock-down easing. For no control the model predicted the infection of a 25% of the Spanish population, 1 million would need intensive care and 700,000 direct deaths. For total lock-down the model predicted 194,000 symptomatic infected, 85,700 hospitalized, 8600 patients needing an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 19,500 deaths. The peak was predicted between the 29 March/3 April. For the third phase, with a daily rate r=1.03, the model predicted 400,000 infections and 46,000 +/- 15,000 deaths. The real r was below 1%, and a revision with updated parameters provided a prediction of 250,000 infected and 29,000 +/- 15,000 deaths. The reported values by the end of May were 282,870 infected and 28,552 deaths. After easing of the lock-down the model predicted that the health system would not saturate if r was kept below 1.02.

Less is known about the clinical and laboratory characteristics of non-HFE related HH in Asian population. We aimed to explore the relationship between genotype and clinical phenotype in Chinese patients with non-HFE related hereditary hemochromatosis. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples and clinical data of patients with primary iron overload were collected from the China Registry of Genetic/Metabolic Liver Diseases. Sanger sequencing was performed in cases with primary iron overload, for 5 known HH related genes (HFE, HJV, HAMP, TFR2 and SLC40A1) and 2 novel iron homeostasis-related genes (DENND3 and SUGP2). The correlation of genotype and clinical phenotype in these patients was analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 32 patients with primary iron overload (23 were males and 9 were females), non-HFE variants were detected in 31 (31/32, 97%), including 8 pathogenic variants in HJV, 7 pathogenic variants in SLC40A1, 8 likely pathogenic variants in SUGP2 and 5 likely pathogenic variants in DENND3 cases. Among these 31 cases, 4 cases harbored homozygous variants, 2 cases harbored homozygous + heterozygous variants, 19 cases harbored heterozygous or combined heterozygous variants, and 6 cases harbored no any damaging variants. None of investigated cases carried damaging HAMP and TFR2 variants were found. 8 cases were classified as type 2A HH and 6 cases as type 4 HH, 10 cases as non-classical genotype, and 6 cases had no pathogenic variants from 31 cases. During the statistical analysis, we excluded one case (SLC40A1 IVS3 + 10delGTT + SUGP2 p. R639Q(homo)) with difficulty in grouping due to combined damaging variants. Cases with type 2A HH have an earlier age at diagnosis (p = 0.007). The iron index of cases in type 2A HH and type 4 HH was higher than that in other groups (p = 0.01). Arthropathy was relatively rare in all groups. None of cases with type 2A HH developed cirrhosis. Cirrhosis and diabetes are more prevalent in type 4 HH. The incidence of cirrhosis (p = 0.011), cardiac involvement (p = 0.042), diabetes (p = 0.035) and hypogonadism (p = 0.020) was statistically significant in the four groups. However, due to the limited sample size, the pairwise comparison showed no significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive analysis about the gene variant spectrum and phenotypic aspects of non-HFE HH in China. The results will be useful to the identification, diagnosis and management of HH in China.","output":"Correlation of genotype and phenotype in 32 patients with hereditary hemochromatosis in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study explores the association between weather and COVID-19 pandemic in Delhi, India.

However, methods of estimation are varied and often complex. Here, we critically review over 40 original studies and establish criteria to facilitate comparative analyses. The mutation rates of 23 viruses are presented as substitutions per nucleotide per cell infection (s/n/c) and corrected for selection bias where necessary, using a new statistical method. The resulting rates range from 10(-8) to 10(-6) s/n/c for DNA viruses and from 10(-6) to 10(-4) s/n/c for RNA viruses. Similar to what has been shown previously for DNA viruses, there appears to be a negative correlation between mutation rate and genome size among RNA viruses, but this result requires further experimental testing. Contrary to some suggestions, the mutation rate of retroviruses is not lower than that of other RNA viruses. We also show that nucleotide substitutions are on average four times more common than insertions/deletions (indels). Finally, we provide estimates of the mutation rate per nucleotide per strand copying, which tends to be lower than that per cell infection because some viruses undergo several rounds of copying per cell, particularly double-stranded DNA viruses.

If the transitional arrangements led to an increase in EU8 and EU2 nationals self-employment rates, as previous research suggests, then their removal should have led to a corresponding decrease. This article analyses whether the latter has indeed been the case. Using pooled cross section data from the EU Labour Force Survey, over the period 2004C2019, we show that removing the transitional arrangements has had a negative effect on the self-employment rates of EU2 nationals, but seemingly no effect on the self-employment rates of EU8 nationals.

However, the increased use of PPEs may lead to facial skin complaints. AIMS: This survey study aims to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on facial dermatoses and complaints. METHODS: A total of 1017 volunteers (age 18 to 60 years), consisting of healthcare workers (HCWs), participated in the study. In the present study, healthcare professionals were screened for facial dermatoses and complaints between 1-15 April 2021 with an online survey. RESULTS: The vast majority in survey were women (82.4%) and between 26 and 35 years old (49.2%). The most new-onset facial complaints were acne (25.3%) and lip dryness (29.2%). Along with the pandemic, 50.9% of patients with seborrheic dermatitis had an increase in lesions. Another remarkable result was a 60.5% increase in acne complaints. Moreover, the rate of exacerbations of rosacea, melasma, and lip dryness was increased after the COVID-19 pandemic (39.1%, 22.0%, and 42.7%, respectively). Exacerbations of seborrheic dermatitis, acne, and lip dryness have occurred more frequently in females when compared males (p<0.001).

While previous investigations have reported that individuals' sexual preferences are influenced by a pathogen threat, the empirical support for face preference is mixed (i.e., the association of pathogenic threat and individuals' preferences for masculine and/or feminine faces is equivocal). The COVID-19 pandemic provides the opportunity to investigate the association of pathogenic threat and men's and women's preferences for sexual dimorphism of faces in the opposite sex in a real-world pathogenic situation. Methods: Data were collected during COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020) from men and women in the United States, and women in Iran, on preferences for masculinity in men's faces using women participants, and femininity in women's faces using men. Results: Results showed that concern about an actual pathogenic threat (i.e., contracting COVID-19) predicts men's preference for female facial femininity, but not women's preference for male facial masculinity (for both U.S. and Iranian women). Conclusion: By using an actual pathogenic threat, our results support previous findings that men's preferences for female faces are shifted to less feminine faces under pathogenic threat. Moreover, our results provide support for the distinction between the behavioral immune system and pathogen disgust, at least for men's preference for feminine female faces.

Objective: To examine whether high-dose zinc and/or high-dose ascorbic acid reduce the severity or duration of symptoms compared with usual care among ambulatory patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter, single health system randomized clinical factorial open-label trial enrolled 214 adult patients with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed with a polymerase chain reaction assay who received outpatient care in sites in Ohio and Florida. The trial was conducted from April 27, 2020, to October 14, 2020. Intervention: Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio to receive either 10 days of zinc gluconate (50 mg), ascorbic acid (8000 mg), both agents, or standard of care. Outcomes: The primary end point was the number of days required to reach a 50% reduction in symptoms, including severity of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue (rated on a 4-point scale for each symptom). Secondary end points included days required to reach a total symptom severity score of 0, cumulative severity score at day 5, hospitalizations, deaths, adjunctive prescribed medications, and adverse effects of the study supplements. Results: A total of 214 patients were randomized, with a mean (SD) age of 45.2 (14.6) years and 132 (61.7%) women. The study was stopped for a low conditional power for benefit with no significant difference among the 4 groups for the primary end point. Patients who received usual care without supplementation achieved a 50% reduction in symptoms at a mean (SD) of 6.7 (4.4) days compared with 5.5 (3.7) days for the ascorbic acid group, 5.9 (4.9) days for the zinc gluconate group, and 5.5 (3.4) days for the group receiving both (overall P = .45).

The integrative therapy group was defined as patients treated with both Korean medicine (KM) and biomedicine, and the monotherapy group consisted of patients treated with biomedicine alone. From PD diagnosis to 2013, the prevalence and annual length of hospitalization because of PD and major complications (dementia, depression and pneumonia/sepsis) were analyzed using logistic regression, ANOVA and t-tests after propensity score (PS) matching with a 1:1 ratio. Results: After PS estimation and matching, the cohort used in the analysis included 228 subjects (114 integrative therapy group, 114 monotherapy group). Sex, age, index year, comorbidity, severity of disability, neurologic care, and anti-parkinsonism medication (levodopa, ropinirole, pramipexole, selegiline) were adjusted in both groups. The prevalence of hospitalization due to pneumonia/sepsis was 0.50 times (95% C.I.: 0.26C0.96) lower in the integrative therapy group than the monotherapy group, which was statistically significant (p = 0.038).

Practices for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection vary geographically in Russia. For example, in the city of St. Petersburg, where mortality rate for COVID-19 is the highest in the Russian Federation on Oct. 25, 2020, every death for COVID-19 corresponds to 15.7 detected cases of COVID-19 in the population, while the corresponding number for the whole of Russia is 58.1, suggesting limited detection of mild/moderate cases of COVID-19 in St. Petersburg. Methods: More active testing for SARS-CoV-2 results in lower case-fatality ratio (i.e. the proportion of detected COVID-19 cases among all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population). We used data on COVID-19 cases and deaths to examine the correlation between case-fatality ratios and rates of mortality for COVID-19 in different regions of the Russian Federation. Results: The correlation between case-fatality ratios and rates of mortality for COVID-19 in different regions of the Russian Federation on Oct. 25, 2020 is 0.64 (0.50,0.75). For several regions of the Russian Federation, detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection is relatively low, while rates of mortality for COVID-19 are relatively high. Conclusions: Detectability of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is one of the factors that affects the levels of mortality from COVID-19. To increase detectability, one ought to test all individuals with respiratory symptoms seeking medical care for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to undertake additional measures to increase the volume of testing for SARS-CoV-2. Such measures, in combination with quarantine for infected cases and their close contacts help to mitigate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and diminish the related mortality.","output":"Detectability of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection and rates of mortality from the novel coronavirus infection in different regions of the Russian Federation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diagnostic errors are a serious problem in healthcare.

The primary aim was to assess the incidence and the type of neurological complications in critically ill COVID-19 patients and their effect on survival as well as on hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. The secondary aim was to describe cerebral hemodynamic changes detected by noninvasive neuromonitoring modalities such as transcranial Doppler, optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), and automated pupillometry. Results: Ninety-four patients with COVID-19 admitted to an ICU from February 28 to June 30, 2020, were included in this study. Fifty-three patients underwent noninvasive neuromonitoring. Neurological complications were detected in 50% of patients, with delirium as the most common manifestation.

Forecasting of COVID-19 spread is helpful for key policy discussions. The transmission coefficient kn of COVID-19 spread varies across time. Accurately forecasting COVID-19 spread is difficult because of the time-dependent kn and becomes more complicated when coronavirus vaccination needs to be considered. In this study, the l-i AIR model was further developed for analyzing COVID-19 spread accompanied by coronavirus vaccinations in the United States. We determined all values of kn prior to January 13, 2021 and calculated the actual number of cumulative infections (In) including asymptomatic infected individuals. We observed 4 plateaus of kn, which corresponded to four national social events. This suggests that events that reduce social distancing and/or percentage of mask wearing played an important role in the acceleration of COVID-19 transmission. Our simulations show that if the American people return to their normal life before 100 million of people are vaccinated, there is likely to be at least one large surge of daily COVID-19 cases. However, if the American people partially return (kn0.4) to normal life after 100 million vaccinations, and completely return (kn=1) to normal life after two thirds of the US population are vaccinated in addition to those who have gained some immunity through coronavirus infections, the US may avoid any additional major surge of COVID-19 cases.","output":"Analysis of Current Status and Simulations of Future Spread of COVID-19 in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dear Editor, A recent systematic review and meta-analysis identified an overall rate of incomplete basal cell carcinoma (BCC) excision of 11%, rising to 20% for excisions attempted in primary care1 .

The objective of this study was to identify the most important factors for assessing country needs for vaccines, and to weight each, generating a scoring tool for prioritising countries. Methods The study was conducted between March and November 2021. The first stage involved a Delphi survey with a purposive and snowball sample of public health experts, to reach consensus on country-level factors for assessing relative needs for COVID-19 vaccines. The second stage involved a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to determine weights for the factors. Results The study included 28 experts working across 13 different countries and globally. The Delphi survey found 37 factors related to needs. Nine of the most important factors were included in the DCE. Among these, the most important factor was the proportion of overall population not fully vaccinated with a mean weight of 19.5, followed by proportion of high-risk population not fully vaccinated (16.1), health system capacity (14.2), capacity to purchase vaccines (11.9) and the proportion of the population clinically vulnerable (11.3).

Since SARS showed a severe case fatality ratio, our concern is to know such a case fatality ratio as soon as possible after a similar outbreak begins. The epidemiological determinants of spread of SARS can be dealt with as the probabilistic growth curve models, and the parameter estimation procedure for the probabilistic growth curve models may similarly be treated as the lifetime analysis. Thus, we try to do the parameter estimation to the SARS cases for the infected cases, fatal cases, and cured cases here, as we usually do it in the lifetime analysis. Using the truncated data models to the infected and fatal cases with some censoring time, we may estimate the total (or final) numbers of the patients and deaths, and the case fatality ratio may be estimated by these two numbers. We may also estimate the case fatality ratio using the numbers of the patients and recoveries, but this estimate differs from that using the numbers of the patients and deaths, especially when the censoring time is located at early stages. To circumvent this inconsistency, we propose a mixed trunsored model, an extension of the trunsored model, which can use the data of the patients, deaths, and recoveries simultaneously. The estimate of the case fatality ratio and its confidence interval are easily obtained in a numerical sense. This paper mainly treats the case in Hong Kong. The estimated epidemiological determinants of spread of SARS, fitted to the infected, fatal, and cured cases in Hong Kong, could be the logistic distribution function among the logistic, log-normal, gamma, and Weibull models. Using the proposed method, it would be appropriate that the SARS case fatality ratio is roughly estimated to be 17% in Hong Kong. Worldwide, it is roughly estimated to be about 12C18%, if we consider the safety side without the Chinese case. Unlike the questionably small confidence intervals for the case fatality ratio using the truncated models, the case fatality ratio in the proposed model provides a reasonable confidence interval.","output":"The mixed trunsored model with applications to SARS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The tension in metal products markets increase due to coronavirus pandemic and rapid oil prices decrease The experts define the current condition of national economy as new reality In those circumstances the main goal of enterprise is to retain competitive performance, which means to retain the employees and their living standards The opportunities of social partnership and its best practices should be used in order to achieve that The article provides suggestions on modification of certain provision of 2020 industry tariff agreement based on the analysis of remuneration management in certain mining and smelting enterprises The article rationalize the decrease of tax burden on labor remuneration The article suggests the development of the shiftwork schedules in main production as one of the main methods to improve the operational effectiveness -٧ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ ܧߧѧӧڧ  ߧڧا֧ߧڧ ֧ ߧ ߧ֧ ڧѧڧ ߧ ߧܧѧ ާ֧ѧݧݧէܧڧ ѧߧӧڧ ӧ ҧݧ֧ ߧѧا֧ߧߧ ܧ֧ ֧է֧ݧڧݧ ߧڧ ֧֧ӧ֧ߧߧ ܧߧާڧܧ ܧѧ ?ߧӧ ֧ѧݧߧ?  ڧ ݧӧڧ ԧݧѧӧߧѧ ٧ѧէѧ ܧާѧߧڧ -

RESULTS Fifty puerperal women participated in the three periods of the study. The median age was 25 years. There was an inverse correlation between the ?? FSFI and EPDS values at T2 (p < 0.001) and T3 (p < 0.001), demonstrating that the worsening sexual response was secondary to the higher prevalence of depressive symptoms in the puerperium in the COVID-19 pandemic. There was an increase in EPDS scores in the three periods: at T1, the EPDS scores ??were 5.0 (2.0-9.0), increasing to 7.0 (4.0-14.0) at T2 and 6.5 (3.0-13.0) at T3 (p = 0.004). There was no difference between the FSFI index at the three evaluated times.

METHODS: During October 2019, 720 older adults participated in The Otassha Study. A year after the COVID\\\\19 outbreak, between June 29 and July 31, 2020, a health status questionnaire, comprising questions concerning knowledge about infection, behaviors and psychological responses during the pandemic, was sent to all participants of the health examination in 2019. Respondents were divided into the robust and frail groups, and their responses were compared. RESULTS: Although the self\\\\reported health status of the older adults in both groups was worse in 2020 than in 2019, differences were not observed in the degree of deterioration between the groups. Those in the frail group had fewer resources of information related to COVID\\\\19 and had fewer coping behaviors for health maintenance compared with the robust group. CONCLUSION: Information gathering and actions aimed at health maintenance tended to be weaker among older adults with frailty, although the influence of COVID\\\\19 on subjective health status did not differ significantly between robust and frail adults. Therefore, robust and frail older adults may need to adopt different countermeasures to prevent worse health during this pandemic.

The microbes inhabiting the oral cavity and gut might play crucial roles in maintaining a favorable gut environment, and their relationship with SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility and severity is yet to be fully explored. This study investigates the diversity and species richness of gut and oral microbiota of patients with COVID-19, and their possible implications toward the severity of the patient's illness and clinical outcomes. Seventy-four (n = 74) clinical samples (gut and oral) were collected from 22 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with various clinical conditions and 15 apparently healthy people (served as controls). This amplicon-based metagenomic sequencing study yielded 1,866,306 paired-end reads that were mapped to 21 phyla and 231 classified genera of bacteria. Alpha and beta diversity analyses revealed a distinct dysbiosis of the gut and oral microbial communities in patients with COVID-19, compared to healthy controls. We report that SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly reduced richness and evenness in the gut and oral microbiomes despite showing higher unique operational taxonomic units in the gut. The gut samples of the patients with COVID-19 included 46 opportunistic bacterial genera. Escherichia, Shigella, and Bacteroides were detected as the signature genera in the gut of patients with COVID-19 with diarrhea, whereas a relatively higher abundance of Streptococcus was found in patients with COVID-19 having breathing difficulties and sore throat (BDST).

SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional study of radiology facilities in Nigeria. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Radiologists from nine government and four private facilities who attended to COVID-19 patients were asked to fill questionnaires on challenges faced and their coping strategies. Responses were sent through E-mail. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Data from the responses were analyzed using Microsoft excel for Mac 2011 and presented as figures and tables. RESULTS: Majority of the government 7 (77.8%) and private facilities 4 (100%) had no equipment dedicated only to COVID-19 patients. Seven (77.8%) government facilities complained of inadequate staff, poor availability of personal protective equipment (PPEs) 8 (88.9%), and lack of technology for remote viewing 7 (77.8%). Fear of cross-infection was a challenge in one of the facilities 1 (11.1%). Coping strategies adopted include ensuring less traffic in the department by discouraging walk-in patients and canceling non-emergent cases, booking suspected/confirmed cases for lighter times, using old film for face shields and cloth for facemasks, staff education on COVID-19 and preventive measures, and sending reports to physicians through E-mail. CONCLUSIONS: There were a lot of challenges during the COVID-19 crisis, with government hospitals experiencing more challenges than private facilities.

For older people, self-isolation presents particular challenges for mental health and social relationships. As time progresses, continued social distancing could have a compounding impact on these concerns. OBJECTIVE: This project aims to provide a tool for older people and their families and peers to improve their well-being and health during and after regulated social distancing. First, we will evaluate the tool's feasibility, acceptability, and usability to encourage positive nutrition, enhance physical activity, and enable virtual interaction while social distancing. Second, we will be implementing the app to provide an online community to assist families and peer groups in maintaining contact with older people using goal setting. Anonymized data from the app will be aggregated with other real-world data sources to develop a machine learning algorithm to improve the identification of patients with COVID-19 and track for real time use by health systems. METHODS: Development of this project is occurring at the time of publication, and therefore, a case study design was selected to provide a systematic means of capturing software engineering in progress. The app development framework for software design was based on agile methods. The evaluation of the app's feasibility, acceptability and usability shall be conducted using Public Health England's guidance on evaluating digital health products, Bandura's model of health promotion, the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and the Nonadoption, Abandonment and Challenges to the Scale-up, Spread and Suitability (NASSS) framework. RESULTS: Making use of a pre-existing software framework for health behavior change, a proof of concept was developed, and a multistage app development and deployment for the solution was created. Grant submissions to fund the project and study execution have been sought at the time of publication, and prediscovery iteration of the solution has begun.

Standards such as the World Health Organization (WHO) IPC minimum requirements offer a basis, but robust evidence on effective IPC implementation strategies in low-resource settings remains limited. We aimed to qualitatively assess IPC implementation themes in these settings. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with IPC experts from low-resource settings, guided by a standardised questionnaire. Applying a qualitative inductive thematic analysis, IPC implementation examples from interview transcripts were coded, collated into sub-themes, grouped again into broad themes, and finally reviewed to ensure validity. Sub-themes appearing  3 times in data were highlighted as frequent IPC implementation themes and all findings were summarised descriptively. RESULTS: Interviews were conducted with IPC experts from 29 countries in six WHO regions. Frequent IPC implementation themes including the related critical actions to achieve the WHO IPC core components included: (1) To develop IPC programmes: continuous advocacy with leadership, initial external technical assistance, stepwise approach to build resources, use of catalysts, linkages with other programmes, role of national IPC associations and normative legal actions; (2) To develop guidelines: early planning for their operationalization, initial external technical assistance and local guideline adaption; (3) To establish training: attention to methods, fostering local leadership, and sustainable health system linkages such as developing an IPC career path; (4) To establish health care-associated (HAI) surveillance: feasible but high-impact pilots, multidisciplinary collaboration, mentorship, careful consideration of definitions and data quality, and data for action; (5) To implement multimodal strategies: clear communication to explain multimodal strategies, attention to certain elements, and feasible but high-impact pilots; (6) To develop monitoring, audit and feedback: feasible but high-impact pilots, attention to methods such as positive (not punitive) incentives and data for action; (7) To improve staffing and bed occupancy: participation of national actors to set standards and attention to methods such as use of data; and (8) To promote built environment: involvement of IPC professionals in facility construction, attention to multimodal strategy elements, and long-term advocacy.

These measures led to a decrease in human activity, affecting air pollutant emissions. This study evaluates air quality during the partial lockdown of Shanghai, the largest city in China, and the broader Yangtze River Delta region. It was found that daily concentrations of PM(2.5,) PM(10), SO(2), NO(2), and CO during the lockdown period were reduced by 9%, 77%, 31.3%, 60.4%, and 3% respectively, compared to the same period in 2019. Even with decreasing concentrations of PM(2.5) and PM(10), the overall values are still more than four times higher for the lockdown period than the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends for safe concentrations (10 g/m(3) and 20 g/m(3)). This indicates the existence of other background sources that continue to make a significant contribution to air pollution in the region even with severe reductions in human activity.

However, only a few studies have examined hospitalization risk with regard to social determinants of health. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify how health disparities affect hospitalization rates among patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: This observational study included all individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 from February 25, 2020 to December 31, 2020. Uni- and multivariate analyses were utilized to evaluate associations between demographic data and inpatient versus outpatient status for patients with COVID-19. SETTING: Multicenter (8 hospitals), largest size health system in Southeast Michigan, a region highly impacted by the pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: All outpatients and inpatients with a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab were included. Exclusion criteria included missing demographic data or status as a non-permanent Michigan resident. EXPOSURE: Patients who met inclusion and exclusion criteria were divided in 2 groups: outpatients and inpatients. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: We described the comparative demographics and known disparities associated with hospitalization status. RESULTS: Of 30,292 individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 34.01% were admitted to the hospital. White or Caucasian race was most prevalent (57.49%), and 23.35% were African-American. The most common ethnicity was non-Hispanic or Latino (70.48%). English was the primary language for the majority of patients (91.60%). Private insurance holders made up 71.11% of the sample. Within the hospitalized patients, lower socioeconomic status, African-American race and Hispanic and Latino ethnicity, non-English speaking status, and Medicare and Medicaid were more likely to be admitted to the hospital.

RECENT FINDINGS: Extended-spectrum and carbapenemase producing Enterobacterales and multidrug and extensive drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii have increased worldwide. Sequence type (ST)131 Escherichia coli, ST258, ST11, ST10, ST147 and ST307 Klebsiella pneumoniae, ST111, ST175, ST235 and ST244 P. aeruginosa HiRCs are responsible for this increase in the ICUs, and some of them are implicated in the emergence of resistance mechanisms affecting new antimicrobials. A similar situation can be found with European clonal complex 1 and clonal complex 2 of A. baumannii. The high use of antimicrobials during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in ICUs, might have a negative influence in future trends of antimicrobial resistance. SUMMARY: The increase of antimicrobial resistance in ICUs is mainly due to the spread of HiRCs and is exemplified with the ESKAPE Gram-negative microorganisms.

METHOD: We used the health belief model, which explores four dimensions: perceived susceptibility (five questions), perceived severity (five questions), perceived benefits (five questions), and perceived barriers (five questions). Additionally, we included a fifth dimension, called pro-health motivation (four questions). The questions composed an electronic questionnaire disseminated by social networks for an one-week period. Answers were quantitative values of subjective representations, obtained by a psychophysically constructed scale with verbal anchors ratio (CentiMax (?) ). Mean time for total filling was 12 minutes (standard deviation = 1.6). RESULTS: We obtained 277 complete responses to the form. One was excluded because it belonged to a participant under 18 years old. Reproducibility measures were significant for 22 of the 24 questions in our questionnaire (Cronbachs  = 0.883).

METHODS: We included 27,674 people with HIV (PWH) enrolled in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study prior to 1 March 2019, with 1 healthcare encounter from 1 March 2019 to 29 February 2020 (2019) and/or 1 March 2020 to 28 February 2021 (2020). We counted monthly general medicine/infectious disease (GM/ID) clinic visits and HIV\\\\1 RNA viral load (VL) tests. We determined the percentage with 1 clinic visit (in\\\\person vs. telephone/video [virtual]) and 1 VL test (detectable vs. suppressed) for 2019 and 2020. Using pharmacy records, we summarized antiretroviral (ARV) medication refill length (<90 vs. 90 days) and monthly ARV coverage. RESULTS: Most patients had 1 GM/ID visit in 2019 (96%) and 2020 (95%). For 2019, 27% of visits were virtual compared to 64% in 2020. In 2019, 82% had VL measured compared to 74% in 2020. Of those with VL measured, 92% and 91% had suppressed VL in 2019 and 2020. ARV refills for 90 days increased from 39% in 2019 to 51% in 2020. ARV coverage was similar for all months of 2019 and 2020 ranging from 76% to 80% except for March 2019 (72%). Women were less likely than men to be on ARVs or to have a VL test in both years.

Assessing potential drugs for safety and efficacy enables clinicians to make evidence-based treatment decisions and contributes to overall outbreak control.

We conducted a bibliometric systematic review for the 2009 influenza pandemic to determine the speed and quality of evidence generation for treatments. This informs approaches to high-quality evidence generation in this and future pandemics. METHODS: We searched PubMed for all clinical data (including clinical trial, observational and case series) describing treatment for patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and ClinicalTrials.gov for research that aimed to enrol patients with the disease. RESULTS: Thirty-three thousand eight hundred sixty-nine treatment courses for patients hospitalised with A(H1N1)pdm09 were detailed in 160 publications. Most were retrospective observational studies or case series. Five hundred ninety-two patients received treatment (or placebo) as participants in a registered interventional clinical trial with results publicly available. None of these registered trial results was available during the timeframe of the pandemic, and the median date of publication was 213 days after the Public Health Emergency of International Concern ended. CONCLUSION: Patients were frequently treated for pandemic influenza with drugs not registered for this indication, but rarely under circumstances of high-quality data capture.

The data remain associative rather than mechanistic, but correlations with systemic immune markers suggest effects of inflammation, hypercoagulation, or other aspects of disease severity. Mechanistic research is warranted. Given the lack of obvious neurological symptoms, neurocognitive assessments were not performed, but the findings suggest that such assessments may be warranted in severely affected patients, even without obvious symptoms. Further, studying CNS involvement of other disorders with overlapping pathophysiologies such as inflammation, coagulation, hypoxia, or direct viral infection may reveal the causes for COVID-19-related neuropathology.","output":"A sobering addition to the literature on COVID-19 and the brain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To mimic the 3D geospatial components of geologic mapping usually spotlighted by field camp, we developed a virtual course based in the sandbox video game Minecraft. Paired with audio/video conferencing and real data, students practiced measuring strike and dip, orienteering with a compass, matching landscape features with topographic maps, and tracing geologic contacts within the team structure typically employed in field camp. Open-source programs and tutorials freely available online assisted with constructing the Minecraft worlds. Assignments were aligned to the nine learning outcomes established for geology field camps by the National Association of Geology Teachers (NAGT). A pre-survey and post-survey quantified students' learning of the subject matter as well as perceptions towards Minecraft and online learning. We also held feedback sessions and conducted in-class, live observations to classify students' reactions and experiences during virtual activities. Overwhelmingly, students indicated they would have preferred an in-person field camp, yet they considered the Minecraft assignments exciting, important, interesting, and valuable. Regardless of perceived barriers, scores on subject matter questions increased from the pre- to the post-survey. Finally, observations illustrated how students' experiences in a virtual field camp recreated comparable components that students experience during an in-person field camp (e.g., students discussing career pathways, geological skills, and fostering interpersonal relationships). Because this virtual course achieved the curricular goals as well as the non-curricular goals and was relatively easy to construct, we recommend the usage of Minecraft for virtual geology courses in the future.","output":"Pandemic Minecrafting: an analysis of the perceptions of and lessons learned from a gamified virtual geology field camp"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An unprecedented research effort has been undertaken in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This has included the determination of hundreds of crystallographic structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, and numerous virtual screening projects searching large compound libraries for potential drug inhibitors. Unfortunately, these initiatives have had very limited success in producing effective inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 proteins. A reason might be an often overlooked factor in these computational efforts: receptor flexibility. To address this issue we have implemented a computational tool for ensemble docking with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We have extracted representative ensembles of protein conformations from the Protein Data Bank and from in silico molecular dynamics simulations. Twelve pre-computed ensembles of SARS-CoV-2 protein conformations have now been made available for ensemble docking via a user-friendly webserver called DINC-COVID (dinc-covid.kavrakilab.org). We have validated DINC-COVID using data on tested inhibitors of two SARS-CoV-2 proteins, obtaining good correlations between docking-derived binding energies and experimentally-determined binding affinities. Some of the best results have been obtained on a dataset of large ligands resolved via room temperature crystallography, and therefore capturing alternative receptor conformations. In addition, we have shown that the ensembles available in DINC-COVID capture different ranges of receptor flexibility, and that this diversity is useful in finding alternative binding modes of ligands. Overall, our work highlights the importance of accounting for receptor flexibility in docking studies, and provides a platform for the identification of new inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 proteins.","output":"DINC-COVID: A webserver for ensemble docking with flexible SARS-CoV-2 proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) is a serious health problem that mainly affects growing and finishing pigs. PRDC is caused by a combination of viral and bacterial agents, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), swine influenza virus (SIV), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Myh), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP), Pasteurella multocida and Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2). To characterize the specific role of swine influenza virus in PRDC presentation in Colombia, 11 farms from three major production regions in Colombia were examined in this study. Nasal swabs, bronchial lavage and lung tissue samples were obtained from animals displaying symptoms compatible with SIV. Isolation of SIV was performed in 9-day embryonated chicken eggs or Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. Positive isolates, identified via the hemagglutination inhibition test, were further analyzed using PCR. Overall, 7 of the 11 farms were positive for SIV. Notably, sequencing of the gene encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) protein led to grouping of strains into circulating viruses identified during the human outbreak of 2009, classified as pandemic H1N1-2009. Serum samples from 198 gilts and multiparous sows between 2008 and 2009 were obtained to determine antibody presence of APP, Myh, PCV2 and PRRSV in both SIV-H1N1p-negative and -positive farms, but higher levels were recorded for SIV-H1N1p-positive farms. Odds ratio (OR) and P values revealed statistically significant differences (p<0.05) in PRDC presentation in gilts and multiparous sows of farms positive for SIV-H1N1p.

DKA is an acute complication of diabetes with a mortality rate of approximately 0.67%. Little is known about the natural history of DKA in the presence of COVID-19. This study aimed to explore the effects of COVID-19 on presentation, clinical course and outcome in patients presenting with DKA. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: All patients treated for DKA between 1 March 2020 and 30 May 2020 were included. Patients were categorised as COVID-positive or COVID-negative based on swab test. A pre-COVID group was established using data from 01 March 2019 to 30 May 2019 as external control. Data regarding demographics, diabetes type, pH, bicarbonate, lactate, glucose, DKA duration, complications and outcome were collected. RESULTS: A total of 88 DKA episodes were included in this study. There was no significant difference in the severity or duration of DKA between the three groups. COVID-positive T1DM were more hyperglycaemic on admission compared to COVID-negative and pre-COVID patients. There was an over representation of T2DM in COVID-positive patients with DKA than in pre-COVID or COVID-negative groups. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 appears to influence the natural history of DKA differently in T1DM and T2DM. Patients with T1DM and COVID-19 presented with more hyperglycaemia (60mmol/l (35.9-60.0) vs. 31.4mmol/l (28.0-39.1) vs. 24mmol/l (20.2-33.75), respectively). Patients with T2DM were unusually presenting in DKA when infected with COVID-19 with greater ICU need and higher mortality rates.

The safety of laparoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic was therefore debated. We aimed to systematically review the literature regarding the safe use of laparoscopy during COVID-19. METHOD: We performed a systematic search using PubMed and ScienceDirect databases from inception to 1st May 2020. The following search terms were used: laparoscopic surgery and COVID-19; minimally invasive surgery and COVID-19. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO register. RESULTS: Altogether, 174 relevant citations were identi?ed and reviewed for this study, of which 22 articles were included. The analysis of the findings was presented in tabular form. We scrutinized the common recommendations for performing laparoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic in forms of pre-, intra- and postoperative phases. CONCLUSIONS: There is no scientific evidence to date for the transmission of COVID-19 by means of laparoscopic surgery. If safe, conservative management is the primary alternative during the pandemic. If indicated, laparoscopic surgery can be used with precautions because of supplementary benefits compared to open surgery. We concluded that recommended precautions should be respected while performing laparoscopy during the pandemic.","output":"283 Laparoscopic Surgery During Covid-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review of Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nipah virus (NiV) is a recently emerged zoonotic Paramyxovirus that causes regular outbreaks in East Asia with mortality rate exceeding 75%. Major cellular targets of NiV infection are endothelial cells and neurons. To better understand virus-host interaction, we analyzed the transcriptome profile of NiV infection in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells. We further assessed some of the obtained results by in vitro and in vivo methods in a hamster model and in brain samples from NiV-infected patients. We found that NiV infection strongly induces genes involved in interferon response in endothelial cells. Among the top ten upregulated genes, we identified the chemokine CXCL10 (interferon-induced protein 10, IP-10), an important chemoattractant involved in the generation of inflammatory immune response and neurotoxicity. In NiV-infected hamsters, which develop pathology similar to what is seen in humans, expression of CXCL10 mRNA was induced in different organs with kinetics that followed NiV replication. Finally, we showed intense staining for CXCL10 in the brain of patients who succumbed to lethal NiV infection during the outbreak in Malaysia, confirming induction of this chemokine in fatal human infections. This study sheds new light on NiV pathogenesis, indicating the role of CXCL10 during the course of infection and suggests that this chemokine may serve as a potential new marker for lethal NiV encephalitis.","output":"Lethal Nipah Virus Infection Induces Rapid Overexpression of CXCL10"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Postoperative pulmonary complications and mortality rates during the COVID-19 pandemic have been higher than expected, leading to mass cancellation of elective operating in the UK. To minimise this, the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital NHS Foundation Trust elective surgery hub and the executive team at London Bridge Hospital (LBH) created an elective operating framework at LBH, a COVID-19 minimal site, in which patients self-isolated for two weeks and proceeded with surgery only following a negative preoperative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction swab. The aim was to determine the rates of rates of postoperative COVID-19 infection. METHODS The collaboration involved three large hospital trusts, covering the geographic area of south-east London. All patients were referred to LBH for elective surgery. Patients were followed up by telephone interview at four weeks postoperatively. RESULTS Three hundred and ninety-eight patients from 13 surgical specialties were included in the analysis. The median age was 60 (IQR 29-71) years. Sixty-three per cent (252/398) were female. In total, 78.4% of patients had an American Society of Anesthesiologists grade of 1-2 and the average BMI was 27.2 (IQR 23.7-31.8) kg/m2. Some 83.6% (336/402) were 'major' operations. The rate of COVID-19-related death in our cohort was 0.25% (1/398). Overall, there was a 1.26% (5/398) 30-day postoperative all-cause mortality rate. Seven patients (1.76%) reported COVID-19 symptoms, but none attended the emergency department or were readmitted to hospital as a result. CONCLUSION The risk of contracting COVID-19 in our elective operating framework was very low. We demonstrate that high-volume major surgery is safe, even at the peak of the pandemic, if patients are screened appropriately preoperatively.","output":"30-Day postoperative COVID-19 outcomes in 398 patients from regional hospitals utilising a designated COVID-19 minimal surgical site pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The changes that have occurred in the business landscape due to COVID-19 present marketologists and entrepreneurs with new problems The forced trend of a sharp increase in online interaction with consumers should be used Such global shifts give rise to innovative tools for evaluating commercial results and transform old techniques to correspond to the new reality of the market This is the basic condition for a business to sustain in any industry This paper focuses on developing a theoretical description of the multi-stage interaction with the customer base In order to solve this problem, a mathematical model was developed at the base of which is a digital information interaction, starting with identifying the target audience and finishing with a completed commercial transaction Unlike the classical sales funnel, the algorithms presented allow a multi-dimensional conversion funnel to be used for more than just evaluating the results of business for the accounting period Thanks to a stream of arguments for the model in real time, it is becoming possible to optimize the commercial process by moving to the concept of leading economic indicators ?

Patencies of tibio-pedal arteries were documented pre-procedurally with palpation and/or ultrasound. With ultrasound guidance and micropuncture technique, a 5 French Glidesheath Slender (Terumo, USA) was placed and anti-spasmodic/anti-thrombotic medications were administered as previously reported for TR access. Hemostasis was achieved at embolization procedures end with a large TR band (Terumo, USA) reinforced with cloth tape. Proprietary catheters were used, though steam shaping of the base catheters was necessary for the initial cases. All 6 patients undergoing UAE for fibroids were discharged home the same day. Metrics evaluated were technical success, fluoroscopy time, clinical results and complications. Results: 8 of 9 UAEs were successfully performed via TP access;one patient required cross over to TF access for ipsilateral uterine artery catheterization. No clinically significant procedural complication occurred. Average fluoroscopy time was 38.3 minutes, though the last four cases performed with a proprietary cobra shaped catheter led to reduction of average fluoroscopy usage to 23.4 minutes. All patients with fibroids had either unchanged or palliated symptoms at short-term follow-up, and inpatients with acute bleeding were discharged shortly after the embolizations with cessation of hemorrhage.

HFRS has become a serious public health problem in China. Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of HFRS has not been completely clarified. The aim of this study is to investigate the changes of decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) and to further explore its potential roles in HFRS. The levels of serum DcR3 were measured by sandwich ELISA. We found serum DcR3 levels increased significantly, which reached peak value during the oliguric phase and in the critical group. Moreover, serum DcR3 levels were closely related to the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and parameters reflecting kidney injury including BUN, creatinine (Cr) and proteinuria. This study indicates that high levels of serum DcR3 have associations with the disease stages, severity and degree of kidney damage. Meanwhile, our results suggest that DcR3 may play a dual role in HFRS pathogenesis. First, DcR3 is involved in the inflammatory cascade response resulting in capillary permeability and kidney injury in the early stage. Secondly, HTNV infection induced DcR3 expression at the convalescent phase may act as a feed-back mechanism in anti-inflammatory response. Thus, a study of DcR3 is essential for a better understanding of HFRS pathogenesis.","output":"Elevated serum levels of decoy receptor 3 are associated with disease severity in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the enormous strain the COVID\\\\19 pandemic has put on healthcare worldwide, appropriate allocation of resources according to priority is of immense importance.

An exhaustive comparative evaluation of three niosome formulations differing in these parameters was performed, which included the analysis of their thermal stability, rheological behavior, mean particle size, dispersity, zeta potential, morphology, membrane packing capacity, affinity to bind DNA, ability to release and protect the genetic material, buffering capacity and ability to escape from artificially synthesized lysosomes. Finally, in vitro biological studies were, also, performed in order to determine the compatibility of the formulations with biological systems, their transfection efficiency and transgene expression. Results revealed that the incorporation of chloroquine in niosome formulations improved their biophysical properties and the transfection efficiency, while the substitution of one of the non-ionic surfactants and the phase of addition resulted in less biophysical variations.

Generating SSI rates often requires labor-intensive methods, but increasing numbers of publications reported SSI rates using administrative data. METHODS Index laminectomy and spinal fusion procedures were identified using Canadian Classification of Health Interventions (CCI) procedure codes for inpatients and outpatients in the province of Alberta, Canada between 2008 and 2015. SSIs occurring in the year post-surgery were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Canada (ICD-10-CA) diagnosis and CCI procedure codes indicative of post-op infection. Rates of SSIs and case characteristics were reported. RESULTS Over the eight-year study period, 21,222 index spinal procedures were identified of which 12,027 (56.7%) were laminectomy procedures, with 322 SSIs identified, an SSI rate of 2.7 per 100 procedures. Of the 9,195 (43.3%) fusion procedures, 298 were identified as an SSI, an SSI rate of 3.2 per 100 procedures. This study found SSI rates increased from 2008 and 2015, and rates were the highest in the 0-18 year age group. CONCLUSIONS The rates reported in this study were similar to published SSI rates using traditional surveillance methods, suggesting administrative data may be a viable method for reporting SSI rates following spinal procedures.

METHODS From 2009 to 2015, 100 elective hemiarch reconstructions for proximal aortic aneurysms were performed under moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest (MHCA). Cerebral perfusion was instituted with ACP via direct cannulation of the innominate artery. RESULTS Mean patient age was 63  13 years (72 men; 72%). Mean MHCA temperature was 27.3C  1.0C (median, 28C). Mean ACP time was 17  4 minutes and mean crossclamp time was 134  42 minutes. Proximal reconstruction included root replacement with composite valved graft (n = 47), valve sparing root reimplantation (n = 16), and aortic valve replacement (n = 19). In-hospital 30-day mortality (n = 1; 1%), stroke (1; 1%), reversible ischemic neurologic deficit (n = 1; 1%), coma (n = 0), and renal failure (n = 1; 1%) rates were low. There was no incidence of injury or dissection of the innominate artery. CONCLUSIONS Direct, central innominate artery cannulation for ACP yields excellent outcomes. This technique is safe, provides excellent cerebral protection during circulatory arrest and simplifies the circulatory management strategy for elective ascending aortic and hemiarch reconstruction.","output":"Direct innominate artery cannulation: An alternate technique for antegrade cerebral perfusion during aortic hemiarch reconstruction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Its infection depends on the binding of spike protein to the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) and neuropilin-1 (NRP1). Hydroxychloroquine has been applied as one of the COVID-19 treatment strategies. Here we aimed to evaluate hydroxychloroquine treatment on SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression in human primary pterygium and conjunctival cells and its potential influences. Expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and NRP1 proteins were found in the epithelial layer of both primary pterygium and conjunctiva tissues as well as in their isolated fibroblasts. High concentration of hydroxychloroquine treatment significantly reduced the viability of both primary pterygium and conjunctival cells. ACE2 protein expression was significantly decreased in both pterygium and conjunctival cells after hydroxychloroquine treatment. Hydroxychloroquine also reduced NRP1 protein expression in conjunctival cells. In contrast, TMPRSS2 protein expression showed slightly increased in conjunctival cells. Notably, ROS production and SOD2 expression was significantly elevated in both pterygium and conjunctival cells after hydroxychloroquine treatment. In summary, this study revealed the reduction of ACE2 and NRP1 expression by hydroxychloroquine in human primary pterygium and conjunctival fibroblasts; yet with the increase in TMPRSS2 expression and oxidative stress and decrease in cell viability.

However, there is very limited information on how much they vary within cities, which could inform targeted and equitable health policies. Our study aimed to analyse spatial variations in BMI and BP for adult women at the small area level in the city of Accra, Ghana. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We combined a representative survey of adult womens health in Accra, Ghana (2008 to 2009) with a 10% random sample of the national census (2010). We applied a hierarchical model with a spatial term to estimate the associations of BMI and systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) with demographic, socioeconomic, behavioural, and environmental factors. We then used the model to estimate BMI and BP for all women in the census in Accra and calculated mean BMI, SBP, and DBP for each enumeration area (EA). BMI and/or BP were positively associated with age, ethnicity (Ga), being currently married, and religion (Muslim) as their 95% credible intervals (95% CrIs) did not include zero, while BP was also negatively associated with literacy and physical activity. BMI and BP had opposite associations with socioeconomic status (SES) and alcohol consumption. In 2010, 26% of women aged 18 and older had obesity (BMI  30 kg/m(2)), and 21% had uncontrolled hypertension (SBP  140 and/or DBP  90 mm Hg). The differences in mean BMI and BP between EAs at the 10th and 90th percentiles were 2.7 kg/m(2) (BMI) and in BP 7.9 mm Hg (SBP) and 4.8 mm Hg (DBP). BMI was generally higher in the more affluent eastern parts of Accra, and BP was higher in the western part of the city. A limitation of our study was that the 2010 census dataset used for predicting small area variations is potentially outdated; the results should be updated when the next census data are available, to the contemporary population, and changes over time should be evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that variation of BMI and BP across neighbourhoods within Accra was almost as large as variation across countries among women globally. Localised measures are needed to address this unequal public health challenge in Accra.","output":"Small area variations and factors associated with blood pressure and body-mass index in adult women in Accra, Ghana: Bayesian spatial analysis of a representative population survey and census data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brain bioenergetic abnormalities have been observed frequently in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD); however, results have been inconsistent regarding whether decreased or increased metabolism was observed.

We recruited 50 subjects with a current diagnosis of MDD, not currently treated with psychotropic medication, between ages of 18 and 65 (meanSD age: 43.413.6; 46% female) and 30 healthy volunteers, matched for age and gender (39.012.5 years of age; 36.6% female).

Phosphocreatine and inorganic phosphate (Pi) varied in opposite directions across gray matter and white matter when MDD subjects were compared with controls. This finding suggests alterations in high-energy phosphate metabolism and regulation of oxidative phosphorylation in MDD patients. In addition, within the MDD group, gray matter Pi, a regulator of oxidative phosphorylation, correlated positively with severity of depression.

In such cases, when the study hypotheses can be answered with the exploration of a small number of genes, a targeted PCR-approach is appropriate. However, due to the complexity of environmental microbial communities, the design of specific primers is challenging and can lead to non-specific results. We designed PhyloPrimer, the first user-friendly platform to semi-automate the design of taxon-specific oligos (i.e., PCR primers) for a gene of interest. The main strength of PhyloPrimer is the ability to retrieve and align GenBank gene sequences matching the users input, and to explore their relationships through an online dynamic tree. PhyloPrimer then designs oligos specific to the gene sequences selected from the tree and uses the tree non-selected sequences to look for and maximize oligo differences between targeted and non-targeted sequences, therefore increasing oligo taxon-specificity (positive/negative consensus approach). Designed oligos are then checked for the presence of secondary structure with the nearest-neighbor (NN) calculation and the presence of off-target matches with in silico PCR tests, also processing oligos with degenerate bases. Whilst the main function of PhyloPrimer is the design of taxon-specific oligos (down to the species level), the software can also be used for designing oligos to target a gene without any taxonomic specificity, for designing oligos from preselected sequences and for checking predesigned oligos. We validated the pipeline on four commercially available microbial mock communities using PhyloPrimer to design genus- and species-specific primers for the detection of Streptococcus species in the mock communities.

Clinicians require an understanding of this phenomenon and various risk stratification approaches for recognizing these subjects. METHODS: We examined all Covid-19 patients sent initially to a ward who subsequently required care in the ICU. We examined the timing transfer and attempted to develop a risk score based on baseline variables to predict progressive disease. We evaluated the utility of the CURB-65 score at identifying the need for ICU transfer. RESULTS: The cohort included 245 subjects (mean age 59.0  14.2 years, 61.2% male) and 20% were eventually sent to the ICU. The median time to transfer was 2.5 days. Approximately 1/3rd of patients were not moved until day 4 or later and the main reason for transfer (79.2%) was worsening respiratory failure. A baseline absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of &#8804;0.8 103/ml and a serum ferritin &#8805;1000 ng/ml were independently associated with ICU transfer. Co-morbid illnesses did not correlate with eventual ICU care. Neither a risk score based on a low ALC and/or high ferritin nor the CURB-65 score performed well at predicting need for transfer. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 patients admitted to general wards face a significant risk for deterioration necessitating ICU admission and respiratory failure can occur late in this disease.

Since the onset of infections, several full-length sequences of viral genome have been made available which have been used to gain insights into viral dynamics. We utilised a meta-data driven comparative analysis tool for sequences (Meta-CATS) algorithm to identify mutations in 829 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from around the world. The algorithm predicted sixty-one mutations among SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We observed that most of the mutations were concentrated around three protein coding genes viz nsp3 (non-structural protein 3), RdRp (RNA-directed RNA polymerase) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2. We used various computational tools including normal mode analysis (NMA), C- discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) and all-atom molecular dynamic simulations (MD) to study the effect of mutations on functionality, stability and flexibility of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins including envelope (E), N and spike (S) proteins. PredictSNP predictor suggested that four mutations (L37H in E, R203K and P344S in N and D614G in S) out of seven were predicted to be neutral whilst the remaining ones (P13L, S197L and G204R in N) were predicted to be deleterious in nature thereby impacting protein functionality. NMA, C- DMD and all-atom MD suggested some mutations to have stabilizing roles (P13L, S197L and R203K in N protein) where remaining ones were predicted to destabilize mutant protein.

There is evidence that there is a complex bidirectional interaction between endometriosis and the microbiome. OBJECTIVE To systematically review the available literature on the endometriosis-microbiome interaction, with the aim of guiding future inquiries in this emerging area of endometriosis research. SEARCH STRATEGY MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched through May 2019. A manual search of reference lists of relevant studies was also done. SELECTION CRITERIA Published and unpublished literature in any language describing a comparison of the microbiome state in mammalian hosts with and without endometriosis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Identified studies were screened and assessed independently by two authors. Data was extracted and compiled in a qualitative synthesis of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS Endometriosis appears to be associated with an increased presence of Proteobacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus and Escherichia coli across various microbiome sites. The phylum Firmicutes and the genera Gardnerella also appear to have an association, however this remains unclear. CONCLUSIONS The complex bidirectional relationship between the microbiome and endometriosis has begun to be characterised by the studies highlighted in this systematic review.

These problems come to a head when focusing on university teacher students, since an expectable competence lag on their part, similarly arising from pandemic-caused distance learning in university teacher training, could affect their future teaching in schools, possibly then disadvantaging school students a second time. To determine changes of teacher studentsself-concept of professional knowledge, we used data of a repeated cross-sectional survey carried out in a period from 2018 to 2021, including several comparable cohorts of overall N = 395 teacher students. This design allowed for splitting the participants in two groups relating to times before and after switching to distance learning. Our results show that the switch to distance learning goes hand in hand with lower scores on almost every dimension of teacher studentsself-concept of professional knowledge, although, in parallel, their scores on variables such as openness to experiences, agreeableness, and conscientiousness increased significantly, indicating a certain degree of compliance with the new situation. Beyond that, we report on an evaluative survey among N = 84 teacher students carried out in July 2020, offering further insights into their situation during the first semester of distance learning. Its results primarily show which specific aspects of distance learning the students consider in need of improvement. On the other hand, it becomes clear that they experienced handicaps in various areas, accompanied by a significant decrease of their core self-evaluations when comparing them to a reference sample.

The extent and efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is far greater than previous coronaviruses that emerged in the 21(st) Century. Here, we modeled stability of SARS-CoV-2 on skin, paper currency, and clothing to determine if these surfaces may factor in the fomite transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Skin, currency, and clothing samples were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 under laboratory conditions and incubated at three different temperatures (4C 2C, 22C 2C, and 37C  2C). We evaluated stability at 0 hours (h), 4 h, 8 h, 24 h, 72 h, 96 h, 7 days, and 14 days post-exposure. SARS-CoV-2 was stable on skin through the duration of the experiment at 4C (14 days). Virus remained stable on skin for at least 96 h at 22C and for at least 8h at 37C. There were minimal differences between the tested currency samples. The virus remained stable on the $1 U.S.A. Bank Note for at least 96 h at 4C while we did not detect viable virus on the $20 U.S.A. Bank Note samples beyond 72 h. The virus remained stable on both Bank Notes for at least 8 h at 22C and 4 h at 37C. Clothing samples were similar in stability to the currency. Viable virus remained for at least 96 h at 4C and at least 4 h at 22C. We did not detect viable virus on clothing samples at 37C after initial exposure.

This entry event is mediated by a set of essential entry glycoproteins, including glycoprotein D (gD), gHgL, and gB. gHgL and gB are conserved among herpesviruses, but gD is unique to the alphaherpesviruses and is not encoded by all alphaherpesviruses. gD is a receptor-binding protein, the heterodimer gHgL serves as a fusion regulator, and gB is a class III viral fusion protein. Sequential interactions among these glycoproteins are thought to trigger the virus to fuse at the right place and time. Structural studies of these glycoproteins from multiple alphaherpesviruses has enabled the design and interpretation of functional studies. The structures of gD in a receptor- bound and in an unliganded form reveal a conformational change in the C terminus of the gD ectodomain upon receptor binding that may serve as a signal for fusion. By mapping neutralizing antibodies to the gHgL structures and constructing interspecies chimeric forms of gHgL, interaction sites for both gD and gB on gHgL have been proposed. A comparison of the post fusion structure of gB and an alternative conformation of gB visualized using cryo- electron tomography suggests that gB undergoes substantial refolding to execute membrane fusion.

The aim of this study is to get insight into the group of pediatric ED FVs and to determine risk factors associated with a revisit. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data of all children aged 0C18 years visiting the ED of a university hospital in the Netherlands between 2017 and 2020 were included in this observational study based on routine data extraction. Children with 4 or more ED visits within 365 days were classified as FVs. Descriptive analysis of the study cohort at patient- and visit-level were performed. Risk factors for a recurrent ED visit were determined using a Prentice Williams and Peterson gap time cox-based model. Our study population of 10,209 children with 16,397 ED visits contained 500 FVs (4.9%) accounting for 3,481 visits (21.2%). At patient-level, FVs were younger and more often suffered from chronic diseases (CDs). At visit-level, frequent visits were more often initiated by self-referral and were more often related to medical problems (compared to traumas). Overall, FVs presented at the ED more often because of an infection (41.3%) compared to non-FVs (27.4%), either associated or not with the body system affected by the CD. We identified the presence of a comorbidity (non-complex CD HR 1.66; 1.52C1.81 and complex CD HR 2.00; 1.84C2.16) as determinants with the highest hazard for a return visit. CONCLUSION: Pediatric ED FVs are a small group of children but account for a large amount of the total ED visits. FVs are younger patients, suffering from (complex) comorbidities and present more often with infectious conditions compared to non-FVs. Healthcare pathways, including safety-netting strategies for acute manifestations from their comorbidity, or for infectious conditions in general may contribute to support parents and redirect some patients from the ED.","output":"Characteristics of pediatric emergency department frequent visitors and their risk of a return visit: A large observational study using electronic health record data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Stress fractures are a common and potentially debilitating overuse injury to bone and occur frequently among military recruits and athletes. Recovery from a lower body stress fracture typically requires several weeks of physical rehabilitation. Teriparatide, a recombinant form of the bioactive portion of parathyroid hormone (1C34 amino acids), is used to treat osteoporosis, prevent osteoporotic fractures, and enhance fracture healing due to its net anabolic effect on bone. The study aim is to investigate the effect of teriparatide on stress fracture healing in young, otherwise healthy adults undergoing military training. METHODS: In a two-arm, parallel, prospective, randomised controlled, intention-to-treat trial, Army recruits (n = 136 men and women, 18C40 years) with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnosed lower body stress fracture (pelvic girdle, sacrum, coccyx, or lower limb) will be randomised to receive either usual Army standard care, or teriparatide and usual Army standard care. Teriparatide will be self-administered by subcutaneous injections (20 g/day) for 16 weeks, continuing to 24 weeks where a fracture remains unhealed at week 16. The primary outcome will be the improvement in radiological healing by two grades or more, or reduction to grade zero, 8 weeks after randomisation, assessed using Fredericson grading of MRI by radiologists blind to the randomisation. Secondary outcomes will be time to radiological healing, assessed by MRI at 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20 and 24 weeks, until healed; time to clinical healing, assessed using a clinical severity score of injury signs and symptoms; time to discharge from Army physical rehabilitation; pain, assessed by visual analogue scale; health-related quality of life, using the Short Form (36) Health Survey; and adverse events. Exploratory outcomes will include blood and urine biochemistry; bone density and morphology assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), and high-resolution pQCT; physical activity measured using accelerometers; and long-term future fracture rate. DISCUSSION: This study will evaluate whether teriparatide, in addition to standard care, is more effective for stress fracture healing than standard care alone in Army recruits who have sustained a lower body stress fracture.

Therefore, we assessed iron metabolism markers in COVID-19 patients for their ability to predict disease severity.

Patients were divided into outpatients (cohort A, n = 204), inpatients (cohort B, n = 81), and outpatients later admitted to hospital because of health deterioration (cohort C, n = 23). Iron metabolism parameters were severely altered in patients of cohort B and C compared to cohort A. In multivariate regression analysis including age, gender, CRP and iron-related parameters only serum iron and ferritin were significantly associated with hospitalization. ROC analysis revealed an AUC for serum iron of 0.894 and an iron concentration <6 mol/l as the best cutoff-point predicting hospitalization with a sensitivity of 94.7% and a specificity of 67.9%. When stratifying inpatients in a low- and high oxygen demand group serum iron levels differed significantly between these two groups and showed a high negative correlation with the inflammatory parameters IL-6, procalcitonin, and CRP. Unexpectedly, serum iron levels poorly correlate with hepcidin. We conclude that measurement of serum iron can help predicting the severity of COVID-19.

This study assessed the value of respiratory and other symptoms in predicting positive SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). It is hoped that if symptoms are predictive, they can be used in screening before testing. Methods Communities were included based on the alerts from community members through the rumour alert system set up by the state. All members of the households of the communities from where the alert came were eligible. Household members who declined to participate were excluded from the study. A standardised interviewer-administered electronic investigation form was used to collect sociodemographic information, clinical details and history for each possible case. Data was analysed to see the extent of agreement or correlation between reported symptoms and the results of PCR testing for SARS-COV-2. Results A total of 12,739 persons were interviewed. The most common symptoms were fever, general weakness, cough and difficulty in breathing. Different symptoms recorded different levels of sensitivity as follows: fever, 28.9%; cough, 21.7%; general body weakness, 10.9%; and sore throat, 10.9%. Sensitivity and specificity for fever, the most common symptom, were 28.3% and 50.2%, respectively, while similar parameters for general body weakness, the next most common symptom, were 10.9% and 73.2%, respectively. Conclusion From these findings, the predictive ability of symptoms for COVID-19 diagnosis was extremely weak. It is unlikely that symptoms alone will suffice to predict COVID-19 in a patient.

METHODS: A national cross-sectional survey was carried out In Israel during October 2020 using an internet panel of around 100,000 people, supplemented by snowball sampling. A sample of 957 adults aged 30 and over were recruited of whom 606 were Jews (49% males) and 351 were Arabs (38% males). RESULTS: The sample of Arabs was younger than for the Jewish respondents. Among the men, 27.3% of the Jewish and 23.1% of the Arab respondents wanted to be vaccinated immediately, compared with only 13.6% of Jewish women and 12.0% of Arab women. An affirmative answer to the question as to whether they would refuse the vaccine at any stage was given by 7.7% of Jewish men and 29.9% of Arab men, and 17.2% of Jewish women and 41.0% of Arab women.

This was more marked so for Arabs then Jews, and more so for women within the ethnic groups. While this was not a true random sample, the findings are consistent with the large ethnic differences in compliance with the vaccine, currently encountered and reinforce the policy implications for developing effective communication to increase vaccine adherence. Government policies directed at controlling the pandemic should include sector-specific information campaigns, which are tailored to ensure community engagement, using targeted messages to the suspected vaccine hesitant groups. Government ministries, health service providers and local authorities should join hands with civil society organizations to promote vaccine promotion campaigns.","output":"A study of ethnic, gender and educational differences in attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines in Israel - implications for vaccination implementation policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic created a need to improvise and redefine blended learning to be executed fully online.

Challenges exist, however, to widespread utilization. METHODS: This operations study 11/23/20-4/30/21 identified patients meeting monoclonal AB EUA criteria by test results or referral. Outreach to harder-hit neighborhoods included connecting with primary care teams and testing sites. Infusion centers with staff trained in infection control, rapid response and drug preparation were utilized. The primary study outcome was treatment of qualifying patients. Secondary outcomes included infusion complications, hospitalization/death, and symptom resolution. Investigational review board approval was obtained. RESULTS: 367 patients were treated: mean age of 63, 201(55%) male, 276(75%) white, 54(15%) black. All patients had a first positive direct SARS-CoV-2 test within 10 days, 232(63%) had > 1 high-risk qualification, 32(9%) were vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2.

Patient Characteristics [Image: see text] COVID-19 course [Image: see text] Community Need Index and Social Vulnerability Index by Zipcode [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that treatment with anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies is feasible in a high resource setting. There were no related SARS-CoV-2 exposures and therapy was well tolerated. Trials of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies have reported lower rates of hospitalizations in treated patients than we found. This may reflect the expanded time frame for EUA therapy as compared to clinical trials, differences in real world patients or viral variants. Given potential benefit in unvaccinated patients or those at risk for poor vaccine response, the equitable utilization of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody therapy in early COVID-19 should remain a focus for researchers and clinicians.

METHODS To assess the radiation leakage surrounding headshield and the radiation level after the beam stopper, measurements were made with GafChromic films. To evaluate the in-room radiation levels, the radiation leakage in the iso-center plane was measured with a large volume spherical ionization chamber (Exradin A6, Standard Imaging). A lead enclosure was constructed to shield the chamber from the low energy scatter radiation from the room. The radiation level at multiple locations was measured with the MLC fully closed and gantry at 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270 and 315 degrees. The leakage radiation passing through multiple concrete slabs with various thickness was recorded in a narrow beam geometry to determine the tenth value layer (TVL). RESULTS A uniform leakage (<0.05%) at 1m from electron beam line was measured surrounding the linac head with the max leakage measured at the top of the head enclosure. The highest radiation level (<0.08%) was measured near the edge of the beam stopper when projected to the measurement plane. The maximum radiation levels due to the head leakage at 15 locations inside the treatment room were recorded and a radiation map was plotted. The maximum leakage was measured at points that along the electron beam line while the gantry at 90 or 270 degree and at the end of head enclosure (0.314%, 0.4 m from electron beamline). The leakage TVL value is found to be 226 mm in a narrow beam geometry with the concrete density of 2.16g/cm3 or 134.6 lb/cu.ft. CONCLUSION An overall uniform leakage was measured surrounding linac head. The beam stopper shields the primary radiation with the highest valued measured near the edge of beam stopper.

Infectious episodes from 6 months before to 2 years after UCBT were reviewed. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients underwent UCBT; 47 had neutrophil engraftment. A total of 179 infectious episodes occurred in 55 patients, 73 (41%) within 30 days post-UCBT. Viruses caused 85 (47%) infections. Cytomegalovirus caused 32 infectious episodes and was most common from day 30 to 100. Human herpesvirus 6 occurred in 28 episodes, was most common within 30 days, and caused 1 death. Bacteria were responsible for 82 (46%) infections, most commonly bacteremias due to Staphylococcus spp, Enterococcus spp, and Enterobacteriaceae. Of 11 invasive fungal infections, 9 were aspergillosis, 4 of which were fatal. Overall mortality was 56% in the first year.

To further investigate the effects of ACEI/ARB on COVID-19 patients, we systematically reviewed relevant studies that met predetermined inclusion criteria in search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library databases, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. The search strategy included clinical data published through October 12, 2020. Twenty-six studies involving 8104 hypertensive patients in ACEI/ARB-treated group and 8203 hypertensive patients in non-ACEI/ARB-treated group were analyzed. Random-effects meta-analysis showed ACEI/ARB treatment was significantly associated with a lower risk of mortality in hypertensive COVID-19 patients (odds ratio [OR] = 0.624, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.457-0.852, p = .003, I2 = 74.3%).

This is reflected in reports that show that eating behaviours deteriorated significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic (including in Poland). Therefore, it is important to determine what factors may be conducive to healthy eating behaviours among people with different BMI. As previous studies show, the use of healthy eating related-apps and training programs may be a protective factor against the development of unhealthy eating behaviours. Therefore, it is worth checking whether their action will be a protective factor during COVID-19. The aim of this cross sectional study was to analyse whether the current use of healthy eating-related apps and previous participation in training in this field (educational activities) as well as body mass index may play a role in eating motives and behaviours among women during COVID-19.

Participants completed: the Eating Motivation Survey, the Emotional Overeating Questionnaire, the Mindful Eating Questionnaire, socio-demographic survey and questions about healthy eating-related apps and training (educational activities). Referring to the selected significant results, our study shows that during COVID-19, the use of healthy eating-related apps alone, as well as the use of apps and prior training participation promote healthy eating motives and behaviours. It suggests that promoting the use of healthy eating applications and the acquisition of knowledge and skills in this field could be one way of shaping resources that can be effectively used to deal with crisis situations.","output":"The role of body mass index, healthy eating-related apps and educational activities on eating motives and behaviours among women during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID) virus indiscriminately impacted people worldwide with unquantifiable and severe impacts on all aspects of our lives, regardless of socioeconomic status.

Here, ten major anthocyanins identified and quantified by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS) were mainly responsible for the coloration of purple fennel leaf. With the application of GC-MS, it was found that the reduced volatile phenylpropanoids including isoeugenol, trans-isoeugenol, and apiol chiefly account for the characteristic aroma changes of the purple fennel. Moreover, the characteristic anthocyanin coloration and aroma formation in purple fennel were systematically studied with the integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics. The critical genes associated with the biosynthesis and regulation of anthocyanins and volatile phenylpropanoids were isolated and studied carefully in transiently transfected tobacco cells and transgenic tomato plants. Together with the results of UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS, RT-qPCR, and yeast two hybrid (Y2H), it is proved that the metabolic flux redirection of phenylpropanoid pathway primarily regulated by a functional MYB-bHLH-WD40 complex consisting of AfTT8, AfMYB7, and AfTTG1 accounts for the characteristic anthocyanin coloration and aroma formation in purple fennel leaf.

In pregnancy, SARS-Cov-2 infection creates additional alarm due to concerns regarding the potential for transmission from the mother to the baby during both the antenatal and postpartum times. In general, breastfeeding is seldom disallowed because of infection of the mother. However, there are few exceptions with regards to certain infectious organisms with established transmission evidence from mother to infant and the link of infection of a newborn with significant morbidity and mortality. It is confirmed that pregnant women can become infected with SARS-CoV-2, although the debate on the possible vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is still open. In this regard, the literature is still poor. On the contrary, the information on the safety of breastfeeding even during infections seems reassuring when the mother takes the necessary precautions. However, there are still answered questions regarding the precautions to be taken during breastfeeding by COVID-19 patients. This paper reviews the existing answers to these and many other questions. This review therefore presents a summary of the present-day understanding of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and discusses the answers around the maternal transmission of COVID-19 and the potential threat of breastfeeding to babies born to infected pregnant mothers. In conclusion, intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection is less likely to occur during pregnancy. Most studies suggest that COVID-19 is not transmitted through breast milk. Correspondingly, COVID-19-infected neonates might acquire the infection via the respiratory route because of the postnatal contact with the mother rather than during the prenatal period. International organizations encourage breastfeeding regardless of the COVID-19 status of the mother or child as long as proper hygienic and safety measures are adhered to so as to minimize the chance of infant infection by droplets and direct contact with the infected mother.

Furthermore, we investigated NHE1 and GLUT1 expression in the myocardium of deceased COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Whole-blood quantitative assessment of NHE1 and GLUT1 RNA was performed using quantitative PCR in patients with respiratory infection upon first contact in the emergency department and subsequently stratified by SARS-CoV-2 infection status. Assessment of NHE1 and GLUT1 RNA using PCR was also performed in left ventricular myocardium of deceased COVID-19 patients. NHE1 expression is up-regulated in whole blood of patients with COVID-19 compared with other respiratory infections at first medical contact in the emergency department (control: 0.0021  0.0002, COVID-19: 0.0031  0.0003, P = 0.01). The ratio of GLUT1 to NHE1 is significantly decreased in the blood of COVID-19 patients who are subsequently intubated and/or die (severe disease) compared with patients with moderate disease (moderate disease: 0.497  0.083 vs. severe disease: 0.294  0.0336, P = 0.036).

In this study the authors compared utilization of mental health care, rehabilitation therapies, and other specialty medical services among children with craniosynostosis, children with plagiocephaly, and healthy controls. METHODS: The Optum Clinformatics Data Mart database was queried to identify 1340 patients with craniosynostosis, of whom 200 had syndromic craniosynostosis. Long-term utilization of mental health care, rehabilitation therapies, and other medical services up to the age of 6 years was calculated. Rates of utilization were compared to healthy controls (n = 1577) and children with plagiocephaly (n = 1249). RESULTS: Patients with syndromic and nonsyndromic craniosynostosis used mental health care, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, and other medical services at similar rates (p = 0.1198, p > 0.9999, p = 0.1097, and p = 0.8119, respectively). Mental health services were used more frequently by patients with craniosynostosis (11.0% in patients with syndromic craniosynostosis and 7.5% in those with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis) compared to patients in the plagiocephaly (5.0%, p = 0.0020) and healthy control (2.9%, p < 0.0001) cohorts. Rehabilitation therapies were more frequently used by patients with syndromic craniosynostosis and plagiocephaly (16.0% and 14.1%, respectively), which was significantly higher than use by healthy controls (p < 0.0001). Other medical subspecialty services (developmental pediatrics, ophthalmology, optometry, and audiology) were used by 37.0% of patients with craniosynostosis, compared with 20.9% (p < 0.0001) and 15.1% (p < 0.0001) of patients with plagiocephaly and healthy controls, respectively. Among patients with craniosynostosis, utilization did not differ by race or household income, but it was not uniform by age. Whereas ophthalmology utilization did not differ by age (p = 0.1003), mental health care was most commonly used among older children (p = 0.0107). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the authors demonstrate that rates of utilization of mental health care, rehabilitation therapies, and other medical subspecialty services are similar between patients with syndromic and those with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, but higher than in healthy controls. Although surgical correction may be considered an isolated event, providers and parents need to monitor all children with craniosynostosis-syndromic and nonsyndromic-for developmental and mental health support longitudinally.

Methods: This is a prospective, observational cohort study investigating short- and long-term AEs related to BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with IBD (study group) after first and second dose compared to healthy participants (study group). Patients were recruited at the time of attendance to clinic or infusion rooms. Short term (<3 weeks) localized and systemic AEs were assessed via questionnaire. Follow-up phone-based survey was made to collect data on long term (up to 24 weeks) AEs. Results A total of 408 patients answered the questionnaires, 204 patients in each group, the study and control group. No serious adverse events were reported in either the study nor the control group after the first or the second dose. Participants in the control group reported more frequent pain at the injection site than those in the study group after the first dose (58 (57%) vs 38 (37%) respectively, P-value= 0.005).

The moderate- vs. high-risk group reported significantly higher ratings of treatment perceptions (t = 2.03, p < .05, d = 0.60). Significant associations were found between increased pre-test depression and anxiety symptomology and reduced intervention utility (rs = -0.34 and -0.32, ps < .05). This study demonstrated feasibility, treatment perceptions and satisfaction of an online MBI for adolescents presenting with two risk levels. Higher-risk adolescents may need a higher-touch intervention than moderate-risk, who may be more likely to find online MBIs acceptable. The impact of adjunctive MBIs for adolescents on treatment attendance and mental health outcomes over longer periods is necessary to understand patterns in effective adolescent treatment options.

The modifications ensure an increased molecular and functional diversity at protein- and peptide-level. Prohormones are small pro-proteins that are expressed in many cell types, for instance endocrine cells, immune cells, myocytes and neurons. Here they mature to bioactive peptides (cytokines, hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters) that are released from the cells in an often regulated manner. The posttranslational processing of prohormones is cell-specific, however, and may vary during evolution and disease. Therefore, it is often inadequate to measure just a single peptide fragment as marker of endocrine, immune, and neuronal functions. In order to meet this challenge, we developed years back a simple \\"processing-independent analysis\\" (PIA) for accurate quantification of the total pro-protein product - irrespective of the degree and nature of the posttranslational processing.

The extent of this phenomenon and its mechanisms are unclear.Methodsa??anda??Results:This study prospectively included 50 consecutive STEMI patients admitted to our center for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at the peak of the Italian COVID-19 outbreak. At admission, a COVID-19 test was positive in 24 patients (48%), negative in 26 (52%). The primary endpoint was in-hospital all-cause mortality. Upon admission, COVID-19 subjects had lower PO2/FiO2 (169 [100-425] vs. 390 [302-477], P<0.01), more need for oxygen support (62.5% vs. 26.9%, P=0.02) and a higher rate of myocardial dysfunction (ejection fraction <30% in 45.8% vs. 19.2%, P=0.04). All patients underwent emergency angiography. In 12.5% of COVID-19 patients, no culprit lesions were detected, thus PCI was performed in 87.5% and 100% of COVID-19 positive and negative patients, respectively (P=0.10). Despite a higher rate of obstinate thrombosis in the COVID-19 group (47.6% vs. 11.5%, P<0.01), the PCI result was similar (TIMI 2-3 in 90.5% vs. 100%, P=0.19).

These can be aimed at detecting, identifying, and characterizing bacterial, fungal, and viral species. One technique that is suitable for high-throughput analysis is flow cytometry-based fluorescence in situ hybridization, or Flow-FISH. This technique employs (fluorescently labeled) probes directed against DNA or (m)RNA, for instance targeting a gene or microorganism of interest and provides information on a single-cell level. Furthermore, by combining Flow-FISH with antibody-based protein detection, proteins of interest can be measured simultaneously with genetic material. Additionally, depending on the type of Flow-FISH assay, Flow-FISH can also be multiplexed, allowing for the simultaneous measurement of multiple gene targets and/or microorganisms. Together, this allows for, e.g., single-cell gene expression analysis or identification of (sub)strains in mixed cultures. Flow-FISH has been used in mammalian cells but has also been extensively employed to study diverse microbial species. Here, the use of Flow-FISH for studying microorganisms is reviewed.

METHODS: The study consisted of three waves, a month apart, between June and August 2020, with 903, 718, and 684 participants in each wave, respectively. RESULTS: At T0, participants had a medium level of PTSS (M = 2.07, SD = 0.89), which increased at T1 (M = 2.46, SD = 0.97) and decreased at T2 (M = 2.24, SD = 0.93). Linear mixed-effects modeling showed that loss of resources, sense of loneliness, perceived COVID-19 threat, and uncertainty stress were significant predictors of PTSS over the three time-points. Significant interactions between these predictors (except sense of loneliness) and time were found: At higher levels of resource loss, uncertainty stress, and COVID-19 threat, there was a steeper increase in PTSS from baseline to 1 month.

Reports on the incidence of thrombotic complications are however not available. METHODS: We evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or systemic arterial embolism in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital. RESULTS: We studied 184 ICU patients with proven COVID-19 pneumonia of whom 23 died (13%), 22 were discharged alive (12%) and 139 (76%) were still on the ICU on April 5th 2020. All patients received at least standard doses thromboprophylaxis. The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome was 31% (95%CI 20-41), of which CTPA and/or ultrasonography confirmed VTE in 27% (95%CI 17-37%) and arterial thrombotic events in 3.7% (95%CI 0-8.2%). PE was the most frequent thrombotic complication (n = 25, 81%).

Maltodextrins utilization by Enterococcus faecalis has been identified as an important factor for colonization of mammalians hosts. Here we show that the LacI/GalR transcriptional regulator MalR, the maltose genes regulator, is also the main regulator of the operons encoding an ABC transporter (mdxEFG) and three metabolic enzymes (mmdH-gmdH-mmgT) required for the uptake and catabolism of maltotetraose and longer maltodextrins. The utilization of maltose and maltodextrins is consequently coordinated and induced by the disaccharide maltose, which binds to MalR. Carbon catabolite repression of the mdxEFG and mmdH-gmdH-mmgT operons is mediated by both, P-Ser-HPr/MalR and P-Ser-HPr/CcpA. The latter complex exerts only moderate catabolite repression which became visible when comparing maltodextrin operon expression in a malR- and a malR-&#916;ccpA double mutant grown in the presence of maltose, which is transported via a phosphotransferase system and thus favours the formation of P-Ser-HPr. Moreover, maltodextrin transport via MdxEFG slows rapidly when glucose is added, suggesting an additional regulation via inducer exclusion. This complex regulation of metabolic operons likely allows E. faecalis to fine-tune gene expression in response to changing environmental conditions.IMPORTANCE Enterococcus faecalis represents a leading cause of hospital acquired infections worldwide. Several studies highlighted the importance of carbohydrate metabolism in the infection process of this bacterium. The genes required for maltodextrin metabolism are particularly induced during mice infection and therefore should play an important role for pathogenesis. Since no data were hitherto available concerning the regulation of expression of the maltodextrin operons, we have conducted experiments to study the underlying mechanisms.","output":"Regulation of maltodextrin genes in Enterococcus faecalis by the combined action of the maltose genes regulator MalR and the pleiotropic regulator CcpA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Racial and ethnic inequities in COVID-19 mortality may be driven by occupation and education, but limited evidence has assessed these mechanisms. OBJECTIVE: To estimate whether occupational characteristics or educational attainment explained the associations between race and ethnicity and COVID-19 mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based retrospective cohort study of Californians aged 18 to 65 years linked COVID-19 deaths to population estimates within strata defined by race and ethnicity, gender, age, nativity in the US, region of residence, education, and occupation. Analysis was conducted from September 2020 to February 2022. EXPOSURES: Education and occupational characteristics associated with COVID-19 exposure (essential sector, telework option, wages). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All confirmed COVID-19 deaths in California through February 12, 2021. The study estimated what COVID-19 mortality would have been if each racial and ethnic group had (1) the COVID-19 mortality risk associated with the education and occupation distribution of White people and (2) the COVID-19 mortality risk associated with the lowest-risk educational and occupational positions. RESULTS: Of 25 235 092 participants (mean [SD] age, 40 [14] years; 12 730 395 [50%] men), 14 783 died of COVID-19, 8 125 565 (32%) had a Bachelors degree or higher, 13 345 829 (53%) worked in essential sectors, 11 783 017 (47%) could not telework, and 12 812 095 (51%) had annual wages under $51 700. COVID-19 mortality ranged from 15 deaths per 100 000 for White women and Asian women to 139 deaths per 100 000 for Latinx men. Accounting for differences in age, nativity, and region of residence, if all races and ethnicities had the COVID-19 mortality associated with the occupational characteristics of White people (sector, telework, wages), COVID-19 mortality would be reduced by 10% (95% CI, 6% to 14%) for Latinx men, but increased by 5% (95% CI, ?8% to 17%) for Black men. If all working-age Californians had the COVID-19 mortality associated with the lowest-risk educational and occupational position (Bachelors degree, nonessential, telework, and highest wage quintile), there would have been 43% fewer COVID-19 deaths among working-age adults (8441 fewer deaths; 95% CI, 32%-54%), with the largest absolute risk reductions for Latinx men (3755 deaths averted; 95% CI, 3304-4255 deaths) and Latinx women (2329 deaths averted; 95% CI, 2038-2621 deaths). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this population-based cohort study of working-age California adults, occupational disadvantage was associated with excess COVID-19 mortality for Latinx men. For all racial and ethnic groups, excess risk associated with low-education, essential, on-site, and low-wage jobs accounted for a substantial fraction of COVID-19 mortality.","output":"Occupation and Educational Attainment Characteristics Associated With COVID-19 Mortality by Race and Ethnicity in California"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the dependence structure, risk spillovers and conditional diversification benefits (CDBs) between oil and six non-ferrous metals futures markets (aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin, and zinc), using a variety of copula functions and Conditional Value at Risk (CoVaR) measure The results show significant lower tail dependence and upper tail independence between oil and non-ferrous metals markets The lower temporal dependence is positive and heterogeneous between oil and non-ferrous markets and intensified during the onset of the global financial crisis (GFC) for copper, lead, and tin markets The upside and downside spillovers from oil to non-ferrous markets and vice versa is significant and increased during times of GFC, oil price crash, and COVID-19 outbreak The highest spillover effects are observed for the aluminum market, which is very vulnerable to oil price instabilities Moreover, the spillover effects are asymmetric for all markets Finally, we find that the CDB for aluminum and nickel are quite similar, and for lead, tin and zinc are also closed the same The CDB is higher for nickel regardless of the portfolio composition and the probability level The diversification gains decrease during stress market periods Our findings have important implications in terms of funds allocation and portfolio design","output":"Risk spillovers and diversification between oil and non-ferrous metals during bear and bull market states"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two major supplements to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) were in the field during the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States: the 2019 waves of the PSID Child Development Supplement (CDS-19) and the PSID Transition into Adulthood Supplement (TAS-19).

Besides neurocognition, a matter of high clinical relevance, social cognition may also affect well-being and quality of life (QoL) in brain tumor patients. Abilities that enable individuals to establish and maintain social relationships are summarized under the umbrella term sociocognitive functioning. These abilities encompass the understanding and sharing of emotional and mental states of other individuals as well as skills to detect and resolve interpersonal problems. These sociocognitive abilities may be challenged in highly demanding life situations such as brain tumor diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, we summarize the literature on psychosocial burden and sociocognitive functioning in adult brain tumor patients. ABSTRACT: Brain tumors may represent devastating diseases and neuro-oncological research in the past solely focused on development of better treatments to achieve disease control. The efficacy of tumor-directed treatment was evaluated by progression-free and overall survival. However, as neuro-oncological treatment became more effective, preservation and improvement of quality of life (QoL) was noticed to represent an important additional outcome measure. The need to balance between aggressive tumor-directed treatment and preservation of QoL was increasingly acknowledged in brain tumor patients. QoL is comprised by many determinants; one of those may have been rather neglected so far: social cognition. Since diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors represent demanding life situations, patients may experience increased psychosocial burden and the negative consequences of illness on well-being may be buffered by intact social relationships. These skills to build and maintain supportive social relationships essentially depend on the ability to empathize with others and to recognize and appropriately address social conflicts, i.e., sociocognitive functioning. Therefore, sociocognitive functions may influence QoL and treatment outcome. In this article, we review the literature on psychosocial burden and sociocognitive functioning in adult brain tumor patients.","output":"Sociocognitive Functioning and Psychosocial Burden in Patients with Brain Tumors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) has impacted cancer care globally. The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of COVID\\\\19 on cancer healthcare from the perspective of patients with cancer. METHODS: A cross\\\\sectional survey was conducted between June 19, 2020, to August 7, 2020, using a questionnaire designed by patients awaiting cancer surgery. We examined the impact of COVID\\\\19 on five domains (financial status, healthcare access, stress, anxiety, and depression) and their relationship with various patient\\\\related variables. Factors likely to determine the influence of COVID\\\\19 on patient care were analyzed. RESULTS: A significant adverse impact was noted in all five domains (p = < 0.05), with the maximal impact felt in the domain of financial status followed by healthcare access. Patients with income levels of INR < 35 K (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.61, p < 0.05), and 35K\\\\ 100 K (AOR = 1.96, p < 0.05), married patients (AOR = 3.30, p < 0.05), and rural patients (AOR = 2.82, p < 0.05) experienced the most adverse COVID\\\\19\\\\related impact.

However, the cellular mechanism behind the sudden loss of smell has not yet been investigated. The initial step of odour detection takes place in the pseudostratified olfactory epithelium (OE) mainly composed of olfactory sensory neurons surrounded by supporting cells known as sustentacular cells. The olfactory neurons project their axons to the olfactory bulb in the central nervous system offering a potential pathway for pathogens to enter the central nervous system by bypassing the blood brain barrier. In the present study, we explored the impact of SARS-COV-2 infection on the olfactory system in golden Syrian hamsters. We observed massive damage of the OE as early as 2 days post nasal instillation of SARS-CoV-2, resulting in a major loss of cilia necessary for odour detection. These damages were associated with infection of a large proportion of sustentacular cells but not of olfactory neurons, and we did not detect any presence of the virus in the olfactory bulbs. We observed massive infiltration of immune cells in the OE and lamina propria of infected animals, which may contribute to the desquamation of the OE. The OE was partially restored 14 days post infection.

The topological diversity of POM clusters in minerals is rather restricted compared to the multitude of moieties reported for synthetic compounds, but the lists of synthetic and natural POMs do not overlap completely. The metal-oxo clusters in the crystal structures of the vanarsite-group minerals ([As3+V4+2V5+10As5+6O51]7-), bouazzerite and whitecapsite ([M3+3Fe7(AsO4)9O8-;n(OH)n]), putnisite ([Cr3+8(OH)16(CO3)8]8-), and ewingite ([(UO2)24(CO3)30O4(OH)12(H2O)8]32-) contain metal-oxo clusters that have no close chemical or topological analogues in synthetic chemistry. The interesting feature of the POM cluster topologies in minerals is the presence of unusual coordination of metal atoms enforced by the topological restraints imposed upon the cluster geometry (the cubic coordination of Fe3+ and Ti4+ ions in arsmirandite and lehmannite, respectively, and the trigonal prismatic coordination of Fe3+ in bouazzerite and whitecapsite). Complexity analysis indicates that ewingite and morrisonite are the first and the second most structurally complex minerals known so far. The formation of nanoscale clusters can be viewed as one of the leading mechanisms of generating structural complexity in both minerals and synthetic inorganic crystalline compounds.

METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of the cytopathological features of BAL in 20 COVID-19 patients and 20 members of a matched cohort from a critical ICU who had acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by other pulmonary conditions. RESULTS: A comparison of the controls (n = 20) and the COVID-19 patients (n = 20) revealed that the latter had a higher neutrophil count (median, 63.8% of the cell count) with lower percentages of macrophages and lymphocytes. An increase in the expression of CD68-positive, monocytic multinucleated giant cells (MGCs) was reported; megakaryocytes were not detected on CD61 staining. Perls staining showed isolated elements.

The substrate spectrum of both enzymes is indistinguishable and covers proteins involved in cytokines production, endocytosis, reorganization of the cytoskeleton, cell migration, cell cycle control, chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Gene silencing and drug treatment were performed in vitro and in vivo to unravel the role of MK2/MK3 in CHIKV infection. Gene silencing of MK2 and MK3 abrogated around 58% CHIKV progeny release from the host cell and a MK2 activation inhibitor (CMPD1) treatment demonstrated 68% inhibition of viral infection suggesting a major role of MAPKAPKs during late CHIKV infection in vitro. Further, it was observed that the inhibition in viral infection is primarily due to the abrogation of lamellipodium formation through modulation of factors involved in the actin cytoskeleton remodeling pathway. Moreover, CHIKV-infected C57BL/6 mice demonstrated reduction in the viral copy number, lessened disease score and better survivability after CMPD1 treatment. In addition, reduction in expression of key pro-inflammatory mediators such as CXCL13, RAGE, FGF, MMP9 and increase in HGF (a CHIKV infection recovery marker) was observed indicating the effectiveness of the drug against CHIKV.

The Lucy Project C a self-referral drop-in access pointwas a program to address this gap by enrolling patients for low-intensity psychological interventions during their treatment for LTCs. In this paper, we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the Lucy Project. METHODS: Using a pre-post design, we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention by calculating the base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) using outcomes data and expenses recorded by project staff. The target population was paediatric patients enrolled in the program with an average age of 9 years, treated over a time horizon of 6 months. Outcome data were collected via the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory, which was converted to health utility scores using an instrument found in the literature. The QALYs were estimated using these health utility scores and the length of the intervention. We calculate a second, practical-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio using streamlined costing figures with maximum capacity patient enrolment within a one-year time horizon, and capturing lessons learned post-trial. RESULTS: The base-case model showed an ICER of 21,220/Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) gained, while the practical model showed an ICER of 4,359/QALY gained. The practical model suggests the intervention garners significant gains in quality of life at an average cost of 309 per patient. Sensitivity analyses reveal use of staff time was the greatest determinant of the ICER, and the intervention is cost-effective 75% of the time in the base-case model, and 94% of the time in the practical-case model at a cost-effectiveness threshold of 20,000/QALY gained.

Methods: The Kerala State government included senior palliative care advisors in the COVID-19 task force and 22 palliative care professionals formed a virtual task force named Palli COVID Kerala as an immediate response to develop recommendations. Results: Developed a palliative care in COVID-19 resource toolkit which includes an e-book with palliative care recommendations, online training opportunities, short webinars and voice over power point presentations. Conclusion: Integrated Palliative care should be an essential part of any response to a humanitarian crisis. The e resource tool kit can be adapted for use in other low- and middle-income countries.","output":"Responding to palliative care training needs in the coronavirus disease 2019 era: The context and process of developing and disseminating training resources and guidance for low: The middle-income countries from Kerala, South India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Allergic airway disease is the most common chronic airway inflammatory disorder in developed countries. House dust mite, cockroach, and mold are the leading allergens in most tropical and subtropical countries, including Taiwan. As allergen avoidance is difficult for patients allergic to these perennial indoor allergens, allergen-specific immunotherapy (ASIT) is the only available allergen-specific and disease-modifying treatment. However, for patients sensitized to multiple allergens, ASIT using each corresponding allergen is cumbersome. In the present study, we developed a recombinant L. lactis vaccine against the three most common indoor aeroallergens and investigated its effectiveness for preventing respiratory allergy and safety in mice. Three recombinant clones of Der p 2 (mite), Per a 2 (roach), and Cla c 14 (mold) were constructed individually in pNZ8149 vector and then electroporated into host strain L.lactis NZ3900. BALB/c mice were fed with the triple vaccine 5 times per week for 4 weeks prior to sensitization. The effectiveness and safety profile were then determined. Oral administration of the triple vaccine significantly alleviated allergen-induced airway hyper-responsiveness in the vaccinated mice. The allergen-specific IgG2a was upregulated. IL-4 and IL-13 mRNA expressions as well as inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs decreased significantly in the vaccinated groups. No body weight loss or abnormal findings in the liver and kidneys were found in any of the groups of mice. This is the first report to describe a triple-aeroallergen vaccine using a food-grade lactococcal expression system. We developed a convenient oral delivery system and intend to extend this research to develop a vaccination that can be self-administered at home by patients.","output":"Effectiveness and safety of oral lactococci-based vaccine encoding triple common allergens to prevent airway allergy in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the times of serious health alarm, as it is happening in the COVID-19 pandemic, burden of healthcare is likely to explode. The current pandemic is having a profound effect on all aspects of society, including mental health and physical health.

METHODS: In our study, we have evaluated stress levels in 102 healthcare workers recruited in different rehabilitation departments (psychiatric and multidisciplinary). In particular, we evaluated the fatigue of compassion, vicarious trauma, burnout and hope (hopelessness) in the first two months of lookdown due to the COVID-19. RESULTS: The results obtained after the administration of the following evaluation scales: sCFs, CBI, Pro QOL, HBS, showed an overall increase in the scores in all professional figures. Significant compassion fatigue and burnout percentage is present in several groups. The highest levels of hopelessness in some professional figures, while higher educational levels can protect workers from the risk of developing high levels of work stress.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: District of Kungsholmen in Stockholm, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults aged 68 years and above (n=1231) who participated in the ad hoc COVID-19-related phone questionnaire administered by trained staff between May and June 2020 and who had previously attended the regular follow-up assessment of the Swedish National study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K) during 2016C2019. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Three dimensions of collateral damage: psychological burden (feelings of worry, stress and loneliness), reductions in social and physical activities, and reductions in medical and social care use since the beginning of the pandemic. Logistic regression models were used to test the association between age, sex, education and living arrangement, and the risk of collateral damage. RESULTS: Vast majority of participants adhered to the national public health recommendations, with over three-quarters practising self-isolation (n=928). Half of the sample reported psychological burden, 55.3% reported reductions in social or physical activity, and 11.3% reported decreased medical or social care use. Over three quarters of participants (77.8%) were affected by at least one of the three collateral damage dimensions. Female sex was the strongest sociodemographic predictor of both individual and co-occurring dimensions of collateral damage. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 and its restrictions during the first half of 2020 had a negative effect on the health and lives of a majority of the elderly living in central Stockholm. Women were at a higher risk of these negative consequences.

METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Clinicaltrials.gov from the inception of databases up until April 9, 2021. The intervention group was ivermectin and the control group was standard of care or placebo. The primary outcome was mortality reported as risk ratio (RR). RESULTS: There were 9 RCTs comprising of 1788 patients included in this meta-analysis. Ivermectin was associated with decreased mortality (RR 0.39 [95% 0.20C0.74], p = 0.004; I(2): 58.2%, p = 0.051).

In Sierra Leone, one of the three most affected countries, more than14,000 people got infected and almost 4,000 died. Risk communication and social mobilization efforts aimed to engage with the public and to educate people to prevent further transmission of the virus. Not much is known how being exposed to this type of information influenced people's knowledge, behaviors and risk perception around Ebola. Misinformation in the Ebola outbreak was widespread, but effective methods to counter real-life infectious disease misinformation have not been studied in a low-income setting.Aims: To determine the role of risk communication in the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone and to test the effectiveness of methods to debunk misinformation about infectious diseases.Methods: Four nationwide cross-sectional surveys among the general population of Sierra Leone were carried out at different timepoints of the Ebola outbreak (August 2014, n=1,413;October 2014, n=2,087;December 2014, n=3,540;July 2015, n=3,564). The four surveys were pooled (n=10,604) and the associations between exposure to various information sources and Ebola-specific knowledge, misconceptions, protective behavior and risk behavior were assessed using multilevel modeling. The associations between exposure to information sources and the perceived susceptibility to Ebola (i.e. risk perception), as well as the associations between Ebola-specific knowledge, misconceptions, behaviors and risk perception were measured in the pooled sample of the first three surveys (n=7,039).Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 Sierra Leonean journalists who reported during the outbreak. Using thematic analysis, their perceived roles were mapped. After the epidemic, a three-arm, prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT)(n=736) was carried out among adults in Freetown who were in possession of a smartphone with WhatsApp, to test whether 4-episode audio drama interventions could reduce the belief in typhoid-related misinformation.Results: Exposure to information sources was associated with increased Ebola-specific knowledge and protective behavior, but also - to a smaller extent - with misconceptions and risk behavior. Exposure to new media (e.g. mobile phones, internet) and community sources(e.g. religious/traditional leaders) as well as having Ebola-specific knowledge and engaging in frequent hand washing, was associated with increased risk perception. Having Ebola-specific misconceptions and avoiding burials on the other hand, was associated with lower risk perception (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 0.7, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.6-0.8 and AOR 0.8, 95% CI 0.6-1.0, respectively). Sierra Leonean journalists adopted various roles over the course of the outbreak;from being skeptical about the existence of an outbreak, to being eye-witnesses themselves. Through training about the virus, they later turned in to public mobilizers and instructors, stepping away from their journalistic independence. Results from the RCT showed that the audio drama interventions significantly reduced the belief in typhoid-related misinformation compared to the control group. In Intervention Group A (in which the audio dramas actively engaged with the misinformation) and in Intervention Group5B (where only the correct information was given), the belief that typhoid always co-occurs with malaria was significantly reduced (Intervention Group A: AOR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.5,Intervention Group B: AOR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.8). Actively engaging with the misinformation, instead of only focusing on the correct information, resulted in the largest reductions in belief in misinformation.

Unfortunately, there is still no specific treatment for COVID-19 till now, therefore, at this point, all potential therapies need to be critically considered. LL-37 is one of the best-studied human antimicrobial peptide (AMPs) that has a broad-spectrum activity against bacteria and viruses. The use of living, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is an effective approach for delivery of therapeutic proteins. The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of the Lactococcus lactis which has been genetically modified to produce the therapeutic human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 (herein after referred to cas001) in the patients of COVID-19. Methods: Firstly we constructed genetically modified food-grade probiotic, Lactococcus lactis, with sequence of seven tandem repeats of mature human LL-37 under control of the nisin-inducible nisA promoter to produce the cas001. A total of 20 healthy SD rats, half male and half female (There were five male and five female in the control group, the same in treatment group) were used to observe the acute toxic reaction and death after daily administration of cas001 for three weeks, which helps to provide necessary reference basis for clinical dose selection, verificaition of toxic reaction and possible target organs. According to the estimated clinical dosage of 1 x 108CFU /kg/day, considering the conversion of body surface area, the dose for rats should be multiplied by 6.17 to 6 x 108 CFU/kg/day. We administrated 100 times higher dose at 6 x 1010 CFU/kg/day to rats. In order to investigate the pharmacokinetics of cas001, male SD rats (body weight 250-300g, 1 x 1010 /animal, n=3) were given oral administration of LL-37 bacteria powder. The concentration of LL-37 in the blood before and after gavage was detected by ELISA kit (Hycult biotechnology Cat# HK321). Human clinical study was approved by Ethics committee of Chinese PLA General Hospital (S2020-074-04) and a total of 11 patients with mild symptoms were enrolled in Wuhan hankou hospital and Huoshenshan hospital. They were enrolled voluntarily and all patients signed informed consent. Among them, there were 5 males and 6 females, aged 55 {+/-} 12 (36-70) years old, and the duration from onset to medication enrollment was 35 {+/-} 19 (5-68) days. 6 patients were nucleic acid positive and 5 patients were nucleic acid negative when they were enrolled. All patients received the oral drug cas001 treatment according to requirement(1 x 109 CFU/capsule, 3 capsules/time, three times a day for 3weeks), with an average follow-up time of 33 {+/-} 15 days (see table 1 for the results). Findings: Western blot analysis shows that reasonable amount of LL-37 were induced by different concentrations of nisin, which means we have successfully constructed cas001. In the pre-clinical safety evaluation test, after three weeks administration of cas001, no adverse effects were observed on the rat's body weight, food and water intake, hematological or serum biochemical parameters. The results showed that the LD50 of cas001 was higher than that of the 100 times of the expected clinical dose of 6 x 1010 CFU/day. These results showed that cas001 could be safe in animal experiments. In addition, rat pharmacokinetics results showed that the serum concentration of LL-37 reached peak 2 hours after gavage of cas001 and returned to basal level 6 hours after gavage. During study period, the volunteers did not feel any discomfort while taking the cas001 capsules, and two hours after oral administration, the concentration of LL-37 were increased in healthy volunteers. cas001 shows definite effect in the improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms and is possible to have effects in improving the systemic symptoms and respiratory symptoms and may play a role in the improvement of results of nucleic acid test and lung CT test. 11 patients enrolled showed good compliance, tolerance, subjective feeling and actively interacted with the doctors. None of the patients had any adverse reactions. Conclusions Based on above observations, we conclude here that as an oral anti-viral agent, cas001 displayed good safety profiles. It is very hard to reach conclusion of clinical outcomes related to the cas001, although changes of several symptoms indicate encouraging findings.","output":"Preliminary evaluation of the safety and efficacy of oral human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 in the treatment of patients of COVID-19, a small-scale, single-arm, exploratory safety study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the normal functioning of various activities around the world, including teaching and learning activities.

The study involved 173 healthcare professionals who completed the two-dose vaccination course with BNT162b2, including 40 who previously experienced clinical COVID-19. The levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1S2 IgG (anti-S) and, in some cases, anti-SARS-CoV-S-RBD IgG (anti-S-RBD) were determined six months after complete vaccination. A level exceeding the cut-off values for both anti-S and anti-S-RBD was observed in 100% of subjects, but after setting the analysis to 5- and 10-fold cut-off levels, the percentage of subjects meeting this criterion was significantly higher for anti-S-RBD. The 100-fold cut-off level was achieved by only 21% and 16% for anti-S and anti-S-RBD, respectively. Anti-S and anti-S-RBD levels above ten times the positive cut-off were respectively observed in 91% and 100% individuals with a history of COVID-19, while among those without COVID-19, these values were 64% and 90%, respectively. Significantly higher incidence of values above 10 and 100 times the cut-off became apparent among people with a history of COVID-19.

Despite the established importance of community involvement in epidemic preparedness, we lack in-depth understanding of these communities experiences with and responses to COVID-19. We explored information and prevention needs, coping mechanisms with COVID-19 control measures and their impact on lived experiences among selected racialized/ethnic minority communities. METHODS: This qualitative rapid assessment conducted in Antwerp/Belgium used an interpretative and participatory approach. We included migrant communities with geographic origins ranging from Sub-Saharan Africa, North-Africa to the Middle East, Orthodox Jewish communities and professional community workers. Data were collected between May 2020CMay 2021 through key informant-, in-depth interviews and group discussions (N = 71). Transcripts were analyzed inductively, adopting a reflexive thematic approach. A community advisory board provided feedback throughout the research process. RESULTS: Participants indicated the need for tailored information in terms of language and timing. At the start of the epidemic, they perceived official public health messages as insufficient to reach all community members. Information sources included non-mainstream (social) media and media from home countries, hampering a nuanced understanding of virus transmission mechanisms and local and national protection measures. Participants felt the measures most negative impact on their livelihoods (e.g. loss of income, disruption of social and immigration support). Economic insecurity triggered chronic stress and fears at individual and family level. High degrees of distrust in authorities and anticipated stigma were grounded in previously experienced racial and ethnic discrimination. Community-based initiatives mitigated this impact, ranging from disseminating translated and tailored information, providing individual support, and successfully reaching community members with complex needs (e.g. the elderly, digitally illiterate people, those with small social networks or irregular legal status). CONCLUSION: Study participants narratives showed how coping with and responding to COVID-19 was strongly intertwined with socio-economic and ethnic/racial characteristics. This justifies conceptualizing COVID-19 a social disease. At the same time, communities demonstrated resilience in responding to these structural vulnerabilities. From a health equity perspective, we provide concrete policy recommendations grounded in insights into communities structural vulnerabilities and resilience.","output":"COVID-19 as a social disease: qualitative analysis of COVID-19 prevention needs, impact of control measures and community responses among racialized/ethnic minorities in Antwerp, Belgium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The protective efficacy of avian influenza virus (AIV) vaccines is unsatisfactory due to the presence of various serotypes generated by genetic reassortment.

The article is devoted to the analysis of the behaviour of representatives of the young generation - students of the Pozna University of Economics and Business - in the area of applications supporting the personal finance management process. Research purpose: The aim of the article is to assess the functionality, reliability and usability of PFM applications by the young generation as part of their financial education. Methods: The study presents students' attitudes towards financial applications, indicating their needs and practicality of using the application, especially in the period of social isolation, remote work resulting from COVID-19. The CAWI survey method was used, preceded by application testing by students. Conclusions: The survey results point to the very high popularity of financial applications that are offered by non-bank institutions. In addition, the pandemic period highlighted technical and substantive gaps in applications, such as the need to update the function of remote contact with the user in the area of current settlements and payments, advice and ongoing contact with a consultant, and remote assistance in formalities in the field of loans and deposits. According to the respondents, PFM applications supported the financial management process and the accumulation of savings, which had the advantage of raising economic and financial knowledge and financial skills for them.","output":"Aplikacje Wspomagaj?ce Zarz?dzanie Finansami Osobistymi C Perspektywa Edukacji Finansowej Studentw 1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since late December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 infection has spread to all parts of the country and overseas, and the outbreak continues.

SETTING: We use the data for COVID-19 daily symptom-onset cases for 100 Chinese cities and COVID-19 daily confirmed cases for 1005 US counties. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 69 498 cases in China and 740 843 cases in the USA are used for calculating the effective reproductive numbers. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Regression analysis of the impact of temperature and relative humidity on the effective reproductive number (R value). RESULTS: Statistically significant negative correlations are found between temperature/relative humidity and the effective reproductive number (R value) in both China and the USA. CONCLUSIONS: Higher temperature and higher relative humidity potentially suppress the transmission of COVID-19. Specifically, an increase in temperature by 1C is associated with a reduction in the R value of COVID-19 by 0.026 (95% CI (-0.0395 to -0.0125)) in China and by 0.020 (95% CI (-0.0311 to -0.0096)) in the USA; an increase in relative humidity by 1% is associated with a reduction in the R value by 0.0076 (95% CI (-0.0108 to -0.0045)) in China and by 0.0080 (95% CI (-0.0150 to -0.0010)) in the USA.

This study investigates the evolutionary links between Omicron variant and recently emerged SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 variants. The entire genome sequences of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 variants were obtained, aligned using Clustal Omega, pairwise comparison was computed, differences, identity percent, gaps, and mutations were noted, and the identity matrix was generated. The phylogenetics of Omicron variants were determined using a variety of evolutionary substitution models. The ultrametric and metric clustering methods, such as UPGMA and neighbor\\\\joining (NJ), using nucleotide substitution models that allowed the inclusion of nucleotide transitions and transversions as Kimura 80 models, revealed that the Omicron variant forms a new monophyletic clade that is distant from other SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 variants. In contrast, the NJ method using a basic nucleotide substitution model such as JukesCCantor revealed a close relationship between the Omicron variant and the recently evolved Alpha variant. Based on the percentage of sequence identity, the closest variants were in the following order: Omicron, Alpha, Gamma, Delta, Beta, Mu, and then the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 USA isolate. A genome alignment with other variants indicated the greatest number of gaps in the Omicron variant's genome ranging from 43 to 63 gaps. It is possible, given their close relationship to the Alpha variety, that Omicron has been around for much longer than predicted, even though they created a separate monophyletic group.

In this study, daily RGB images covering the entire growth of summer maize were collected using phenocams at sites in Shangqiu (2018, 2019 and 2020) and Nanpi (2020) in China. Four phenological dates, including six leaves, booting, heading and maturity of summer maize, were pre-defined and extracted from the phenocam-based images. The spectral indices, textural indices and integrated spectral and textural indices were calculated using the improved adaptive feature-weighting method. The double logistic function, harmonic analysis of time series, SavitzkyCGolay and spline interpolation were applied to filter these indices and pre-defined phenology was identified and compared with the ground observations. The results show that the DLF achieved the highest accuracy, with the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) being 0.86 and 9.32 days, respectively. The new index performed better than the single usage of spectral and textural indices, of which the R2 and RMSE were 0.92 and 9.38 days, respectively. The phenological extraction using the new index and double logistic function based on the PhenoCam data was effective and convenient, obtaining high accuracy. Therefore, it is recommended the adoption of the new index by integrating the spectral and textural indices for extracting maize phenology using PhenoCam data.

Methods: Data were obtained from a survey of a nationally representative sample of US adults (N = 942) conducted April 10-20, 2020 (about one-month after initial stay-at-home orders were implemented) using a probability-based Internet household panel (Ipsos KnowledgePanel). Multiple regression analysis tested the association between attitude, injunctive norm, descriptive norm, and self-efficacy and intention to stay home for the next month while controlling for demographic factors. We tested for a moderating effect of worker status on the relationships between the 4 RAA beliefs and intention. Results: Instrumental attitude, injunctive norm, descriptive norm, and self-efficacy demonstrated statistically significant independent associations with intention to stay home. Self-efficacy showed the highest independent association. However, this relation was modified by an interaction between self-efficacy and worker status, revealing that self-efficacy is particularly important for essential workers. Conclusions: These findings suggest that public health strategies to increase individuals' intention to stay home and encourage adherence to stay-at-home policies should focus on enhancing self-efficacy with communication and policy supports.

This condition results in a substantial burden to these women, and society at large. Although endometriosis was first identified over 160 years ago, substantial knowledge gaps remain, including confirmation of the disease's etiology. Research funding for endometriosis is limited, with funding from bodies like the National Institutes of Health (NIH) constituting only 0.038% of the 2022 health budgetfor a condition that affects 6.5 million women in the US alone and over 190 million worldwide. A major issue is that diagnosis of endometriosis is frequently delayed because surgery is required to histologically confirm the diagnosis. This delay increases symptom intensity, the risk of central and peripheral sensitization and the costs of the disease for the patient and their nation. Current conservative treatments of presumed endometriosis are pain management and birth control. Both of these methods are flawed and can be entirely ineffective for the reduction of patient suffering or improving ability to work, and neither addresses the severe infertility issues or higher risk of certain cancers. Endometriosis research deserves the funding and attention that befits a disease with its substantial prevalence, effects, and economic costs.

Our brief critical discussion is focused on the multiple roles of the NO signaling pathways in the maintenance of basal physiological states of readiness in diverse cell types mediating innate immunological functions and in the facilitation of proinflammatory-mediated adaptive immunological responses associated with viral infections. Prior studies have reinforced the critical importance of constitutive NO signaling pathways in the homeostatic maintenance of the vascular endothelium, and state-dependent changes in innate immunological responses have been associated with a functional override of NO-mediated inhibitory tone. Accordingly, convergent lines of evidence suggest that dysregulation of NO signaling pathways, as well as canonical oxidative effects of inducible NO, may provide a permissive cellular environment for viral entry and replication. In immunologically compromised individuals, functional override and chronic rundown of inhibitory NO signaling systems promote aberrant expression of unregulated proinflammatory pathways resulting in widespread metabolic insufficiencies and structural damage to autonomous cellular and organ structures. We contend that restoration of normative NO tone via combined pharmaceutical, dietary, or complex behavioral interventions may partially reverse deleterious physiological conditions brought about by viral infection linked to unregulated adaptive immune responses.","output":"Potential Immunoregulatory and Antiviral/SARS-CoV-2 Activities of Nitric Oxide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid quantification of viruses is vital for basic research on viral diseases as well as clinical application of virus\\\\based products.

It is uncertain whether the pediatric nephrology workforce will meet the growing needs of children with kidney disease without a substantial overhaul of the current reimbursement policies. In contrast to adult nephrology, the majority of pediatric nephrologists practice in an academic setting affiliated with a university and/or children's hospital. The pediatric nephrology service line is crucial to maintaining the financial health and wellness of a comprehensive children's hospital. However, in the current fee-for-service system, the clinical care for children with kidney disease is neither sufficiently valued, nor appropriately compensated. Current compensation models derived from the relative value unit (RVU) system contribute to the structural biases inherent in the current inequitable payment system. The perceived negative financial compensation is a significant driver of waning trainee interest in the field which is one of the least attractive specialties for students, with a significant proportion of training spots going unfilled each year and relatively stagnant growth rate as compared to the other pediatric subspecialties.

When passing through the endothelial layer during the diapedesis process lymphocytes can either follow a paracellular route or a transcellular one. There is a debate whether these two processes constitute one mechanism, or they form two evolutionary distinct migration pathways. We used artificial intelligence, phylogenetic analysis, HH search, ancestor sequence reconstruction to investigate further this intriguing question. We found that the two systems share several ancient components, such as RhoA protein that plays a critical role in controlling actin movement in both mechanisms. However, some of the key components differ between these two transmigration processes. CAV1 genes emerged during Trichoplax adhaerens, and it was only reported in transcellular process. Paracellular process is dependent on PECAM1. PECAM1 emerged from FASL5 during Zebrafish divergence. Lastly, both systems employ late divergent genes such as ICAM1 and VECAM1.

The analysis of the measurement invariance was performed using the Least Squares Estimation, and weighted by adjusted variance and polychoric correlations after assessing different measurement models for BSQ in each group. The scores of the final version were correlated with anthropometric indicators by the Pearson correlation coefficient. RESULTS As regards the dimensional analysis, all of the previous models for BSQ have favourable adjustment rates, although those with a single factor show more robust evidence. The configural invariance was accepted; suggesting that the one-dimensional structure is common for both men and women. However, 16-item factorial loadings were statistically different between the groups. Hence, they were discarded and an 18-item version (BSQ-18) was obtained, which is considered invariant as regards gender.

Artificial Chemistries are one of the most important tools for this purpose because they provide us with a basic framework to investigate under which conditions metabolisms capable of reproducing themselves, and ultimately, of evolving, can emerge. While there have been successful attempts at producing examples of emergent self-reproducing metabolisms, the set of rules involved remain too complex to shed much light on the underlying principles at work. In this paper, we hypothesize that the key property needed for self-reproducing metabolisms to emerge is the existence of an auto-catalyzed subset of Turing-complete reactions. We validate this hypothesis with a minimalistic Artificial Chemistry with conservation laws, which is based on a Turing-complete rewriting system called Combinatory Logic. Our experiments show that a single run of this chemistry, starting from a tabula rasa state, discovers -- with no external intervention -- a wide range of emergent structures including ones that self-reproduce in each cycle. All of these structures take the form of recursive algorithms that acquire basic constituents from the environment and decompose them in a process that is remarkably similar to biological metabolisms.","output":"Emergence of Self-Reproducing Metabolisms as Recursive Algorithms in an Artificial Chemistry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues, the selection of genomic variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) associated with higher transmission, more severe disease, re-infection, and immune escape are a cause for concern. Such variants have been reported from the UK (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351) and, Brazil (P.1/B.1.1.28). We performed this study to track the importation, spread, and emergence of variants locally. Methods: We sequenced whole genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from international travellers (n=75) entering Karnataka, South India, between Dec 22, 2020 and Jan 31, 2021, and from positive cases in the city of Bengaluru (n=108), between Nov 22, 2020- Jan 22, 2021, as well as a local outbreak. We present the lineage distribution and analysis of these sequences. Results: Genomes from the study group into 34 lineages. Variant B.1.1.7 was introduced by international travel (24/73, 32.9%). Lineage B.1.36 and B.1 formed a major fraction of both imported (B.1.36: 20/73, 27.4%; B.1: 14/73, 19.2%), and circulating viruses (B.1.36: 45/103; 43.7%,. B.1: 26/103; 25.2%). The lineage B.1.36 was also associated with a local outbreak. We detected nine amino acid changes, previously associated with immune escape, spread across multiple lineages. The N440K change was detected in 45/162 (27.7%) of the sequences, 37 of these were in the B.1.36 lineage (37/65, 56.92%) Conclusions: Our data support the idea that variants of concern spread by travel. Viruses with amino acid replacements associated with immune escape are already circulating.

Tannins are a group of polyphenolic compounds that are widely present in plant region and possess various biological activities including antimicrobial, anti-parasitic, anti-viral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulation, etc. Therefore, tannins are the major research subject in developing natural alternative to in-feed antibiotics. Strong protein affinity is the well-recognized property of plant tannins, which has successfully been applied to ruminant nutrition to decrease protein degradation in the rumen, and thereby improve protein utilization and animal production efficiency. Incorporations of tannin-containing forage in ruminant diets to control animal pasture bloat, intestinal parasite and pathogenic bacteria load are another 3 important applications of tannins in ruminant animals. Tannins have traditionally been regarded as anti-nutritional factor for monogastric animals and poultry, but recent researches have revealed some of them, when applied in appropriate manner, improved intestinal microbial ecosystem, enhanced gut health and hence increased productive performance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients with peripheral arterial occlusions presenting to a multi-hospital health care system in New York City between February 1st, 2020 and April 30th, 2020. Patient data and computed tomography angiography (CTA) exams in this subset were then collected and analyzed. RESULTS: For the months of February, March, and April 2020, we identified 9 patients (ages 37C93 yrs) at our health care system who underwent extremity CTA for large vessel upper or lower extremity arterial occlusion and were diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient medical histories and clinical parameters were evaluated to identify common risk factors including obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. Patients presented with increased inflammatory markers including ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) as well as increased D-dimer.

However, limited data exists on the benefits of lifestyle behavior change delivered using telehealth and web-based applications on blood pressure (BP). Methods: We conducted a 2-site randomized controlled trial in the Geisinger Health System (January 2019 to March 2021) to compare the efficacy of a self-guided vs. a dietitian telehealth approach using web-based applications in 187 participants with 24-hour systolic BP 120-160 mmHg and body mass index [] 25 kg/m2. Both arms received recommendations to improve diet based on a web-based food frequency questionnaire, and access to an online weight management program. The telehealth arm received weekly telephone calls with a dietitian who used motivational interviewing. The primary outcome was 12-week change in 24-hour systolic BP. Secondary outcomes included changes in sleep/awake systolic BP and diastolic BP, self-reported physical activity, healthy eating index (HEI)-2015 score, and weight. Results: A total of 187 participants (mean age 54.6 [SD 13.2] years, 52% female, 23% on BP medications, mean body mass index 34.5 [6.5] kg/m2, mean HEI-2015 score 60.8 [11.1] units) were randomized with 156 (83.4%) completing the trial.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical outcomes and factors associated with outcomes among children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 in 6 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was a retrospective record review of data from 25 hospitals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Uganda from March 1 to December 31, 2020, and included 469 hospitalized patients aged 0 to 19 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection. EXPOSURES: Age, sex, preexisting comorbidities, and region of residence. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: An ordinal primary outcome scale was used comprising 5 categories: (1) hospitalization without oxygen supplementation, (2) hospitalization with oxygen supplementation, (3) ICU admission, (4) invasive mechanical ventilation, and (5) death. The secondary outcome was length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Among 469 hospitalized children and adolescents, the median age was 5.9 years (IQR, 1.6-11.1 years); 245 patients (52.4%) were male, and 115 (24.5%) had comorbidities. A total of 39 patients (8.3%) were from central Africa, 172 (36.7%) from eastern Africa, 208 (44.3%) from southern Africa, and 50 (10.7%) from western Africa. Eighteen patients had suspected (n = 6) or confirmed (n = 12) multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Thirty-nine patients (8.3%) died, including 22 of 69 patients (31.9%) who required intensive care unit admission and 4 of 18 patients (22.2%) with suspected or confirmed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Among 468 patients, 418 (89.3%) were discharged, and 16 (3.4%) remained hospitalized. The likelihood of outcomes with higher vs lower severity among children younger than 1 year expressed as adjusted odds ratio (aOR) was 4.89 (95% CI, 1.44-16.61) times higher than that of adolescents aged 15 to 19 years. The presence of hypertension (aOR, 5.91; 95% CI, 1.89-18.50), chronic lung disease (aOR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.65-5.37), or a hematological disorder (aOR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.04-9.24) was associated with severe outcomes.

Few studies explored the perception of appropriateness by professionals in pediatric palliative care, revealing the conflict sometimes faced when confronted with the uncertainty of prognosis and end-of-life decisions. AIMS The objective of this study is firstly to investigate the perception that doctors, nurses and psychologists, operating in Italian pediatric hospices, have of the appropriateness of the care they provide. Secondly, to understand what repercussions the perception of non-appropriateness has at individual and team level. METHODS A qualitative study was conducted between 2019 and 2020 through semi-structured interviews with a convenience sample of 17 professionals working it Italian pediatric hospices. RESULTS The interviewees do not refer to a common concept of appropriateness, but compare the latter to: the quality of life, the global care of the assisted person, the proportionality of care, the early recognition of the need for palliative care. The discussion within the team emerges as a privileged place to manage the discomfort of individual professionals in the face of treatment choices in conflict with their own values. CONCLUSION the non-referring to a univocal conception of appropriateness deprives professionals of an objective criterion to resolve the most difficult decisions.

OBJECTIVES: Here we report a facile and potentially scalable method to fabricate biodegradable, breathable, and biocidal cellulose nonwovens (BCNWs) to address both environmental and hygienic problems of commercially available face masks. METHODS: TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nonwovens are rendered antiviral/antibacterial via covalent bonding with disinfecting polyhexamethylene guanidine or neomycin sulfate through carbodiimide coupling chemistry.

A log-linear multiple regression model was estimated where the log of the ratio of hospitalized patients per inhabitant, since the beginning of the epidemic up to July 27, has been considered as a dependent variable. Among the independent variables, the ones that have been taken into account are the spreading of the virus, the rate of people over 50 years of age, the concentration of PM2.5, the rate of population living by the sea, the rate of green public space for each resident and the ratio of population living at a high altitude.

If average limits of PM2.5 concentration allowed by the current European regulations (25 g/m3) were respected in all Italian provinces, that would have led to 7339 less hospitalizations for COVID-19 (-11%). On the contrary, near the coast there were lower hospitalized cases in the referred period. In the hypothetical case that no Italians lived near the sea, about 1363 (+2%) more hospitalizations would have been recorded in the analysis period in addition to the effect of a lower PM concentration. This paper wanted to investigate which are the areas with a higher risk of hospitalization in Italy, so as to help the Italian Government to strengthen Health System measures, predicting the most suffering areas and health care systems. According to the results, this is directly related to the severity of symptoms which decreased with the long-time exposure to the sea.","output":"The Effects of Air Pollution, Sea Exposure and Altitude on COVID-19 Hospitalization Rates in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundCOVID-19 Convalescent Plasma (CCP) was an early and widely adopted putative therapy for severe COVID-19. Results from randomized control trials and observational studies have failed to demonstrate a clear therapeutic role for CCP for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Underlying these inconclusive findings is a broad heterogeneity in the concentrations of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) between different CCP donors. The present study was designed to evaluate nAb titer threshold for clinically effective CCP. MethodsWe conducted a double-blind, phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of nAb titer-defined CCP in adults admitted to an academic referral hospital. Patients positive on a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test and with symptoms for < 10 days were eligible. Participants received either CCP with nAb titers []1:160-1:640 (standard titer group) or >1:640 (high titer group) in addition to standard of care treatments. Adverse events were contrasted by CCP titer. The primary clinical outcome was time to hospital discharge, with mortality and respiratory support evaluated as secondary outcomes. FindingsBetween August 28 and December 4, 2020, 316 participants were screened, 55 received CCP, with 41 and 14 receiving standard versus high titer CCP, respectively. Participants were a median of 61 years of age (IQR 52-67), 36% women, 25% Black and 33% Hispanic. Severe adverse events (SAE) ([] grade 3) occurred in 4 (29%) and 23 (56%) of participants in the high versus standard titer groups, respectively by day 28 (Risk Difference -0.28 [95% CI -0.56, 0.01]). There were no observed treatment-related AEs. By day 55, time to hospital discharge was shorter among participants receiving high versus standard titer, accounting for death as a competing event (hazard ratio 1.94 [95% CI 1.05, 3.58], Grays p=0.02). InterpretationIn this phase 2 trial in a high-risk population of patients admitted for Covid-19, we found earlier time to hospital discharge and lower occurrences of life-threatening SAEs among participants receiving CCP with nAb titers >1:640 compared with participants receiving CCP with lower nAb titer CCP. Though limited by a small study size these findings support further study of high-nAb titer CCP defined as >1:640 in the treatment of COVID-19. FundingThis clinical study was supported by the UNC Health Foundation and the North Carolina Policy Collaboratory at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with funding from the North Carolina Coronavirus Relief Fund established and appropriated by the North Carolina General Assembly. The laboratory assays for neutralizing antibody titers and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody-binding assays were partially supported by The NIH NCI/NIAID SeroNet Serocenter of Excellence Award U54 CA260543. Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSCOVID-19 Convalescent Plasma (CCP) has emergency use authorization from the FDA for early treatment of COVID-19 in either outpatient or inpatient settings. Evidence supporting the use of CCP for severe COVID-19 is mixed and still emerging. One major limitation in interpreting published clinical trials and the clinical role of CCP is incomplete understanding of necessary neutralizing antibody (nAb) titer for clinically effective CCP. Observational studies suggest that higher antibody-content CCP is more effective than lower antibody-content CCP, or that very low antibody-content CCP is harmful. We searched PubMed articles published between February 1, 2020, and April 15, 2022, using the terms \\"COVID-19\\", \\"convalescent plasma\\", \\"SARS-CoV-2\\", and \\"CCP\\" alone and in combination. Our search yielded 6,468 results which we filtered to 280 and 162 by selecting Clinical Trial and Randomized Controlled Trial article types, respectively. Among these, we identified 25 open-label or blinded efficacy or effectiveness studies in hospitalized patients that were relevant to our study. Preliminary reports show wide variability in the antibody content of CCP used in clinical trials, the assays used to define CCP antibody content, and the estimates of clinical outcomes following CCP therapy for hospitalized patients. Only one study deliberately infused CCP with nAb > 1:640. Post-hoc analyses of potent monoclonal antibody therapy in hospitalized patients in the UK showed survival benefit when monoclonal antibody was infused to patients who had not yet seroconverted by spike antibody ELISA, suggesting that if dosed appropriately, antibody-based therapies may have a role in improving outcomes of severe COVID-19. Added value of this studyThis phase 2 study showed that CCP with high nAb titer (>1:640) provided more rapid recovery to hospital discharge and fewer COVID-19 attributable AEs than CCP with nAb titer between the FDA-recommended minimum standard and 4-fold higher ([]1:160-1:640). The hazard ratio of time to hospital discharge from baseline through day 55, accounting for death as a competing event, contrasting patients receiving high versus standard CCP titer was 1.94 (95% CI 1.05-3.58). Adjusted hazard ratios of high versus standard titer CCP receipt for time to hospital discharge were consistent with the primary unadjusted findings. Mortality through 55 days was lower in the high titer group, but with a wide confidence interval that did not reach statistical significance. Implications of all available evidenceOur data that CCP with nAb >1:640 expedites recovery of patients admitted with COVID-19 compared with CCP with nAb []1:160-1:640 suggests that a threshhold of nAb []1:160 may be too low to define CCP as high titer. Analyses in larger CCP trials should consider full reporting of nAb in CCP units administered at individual study participant level, and specifically whether CCP contained nAb >1:640. Further investigation of CCP with nAb >1:640 is warranted given that raising the threshhold of nAb, or a correlative specific anti-spike antibody assay, used to qualify high titer CCP in clinical trials could inform policy guidance and clinical use of CCP.","output":"Outcomes of convalescent plasma with defined high- versus lower-neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 among hospitalized patients: CoronaVirus Inactivating Plasma (CoVIP), double-blind phase 2 study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the global status to a new position where Sri Lanka has been impacted many ways among which Agriculture is a prime when the food security is concerned.

Moreover, research and development of non-task-oriented dialogue systems are also actively conducted. One of the problems with these systems is that it is difficult to switch topics naturally. In this study, we focus on interview dialogue systems. In an interview dialogue, the dialogue system can take the initiative as an interviewer. The main task of an interview dialogue system is to obtain information about the interviewee via dialogue and to assist this individual in understanding his or her personality and strengths. In order to accomplish this task, the system needs to be flexible and appropriate for detecting topic switching and topic breaks. Given that topic switching tends to be more ambiguous in interview dialogues than in task-oriented dialogues, existing topic modeling methods that determine topic breaks based only on relationships and similarities between words are likely to fail. In this study, we propose a method for detecting topic breaks in dialogue to achieve flexible topic switching in interview dialogue systems. The proposed method is based on multi-task learning neural network that uses embedded representations of sentences to understand the context of the text and utilizes the intention of an utterance as a feature. In multi-task learning, not only topic breaks but also the intention associated with the utterance and the speaker are targets of prediction. The results of our evaluation experiments show that using utterance intentions as features improves the accuracy of topic separation estimation compared to the baseline model.","output":"Topic Break Detection in Interview Dialogues Using Sentence Embedding of Utterance and Speech Intention Based on Multitask Neural Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that hit the world in 2020 triggered a massive dissemination of information (an infodemic) about the disease that was channeled through the print, broadcast, web, and social media.

This study evaluates the effect of TB on the mortality rate, survival time, and predictors of survival in patients with AIDS living in different areas in S?o Paulo State (SPS). METHODS: Retrospective cohort of adolescents and adults with AIDS, diagnosed between 2003 and 2007 and followed-up until 2014. Data were obtained from the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Mortality rates were estimated by person-years. Survival analysis used the date of diagnosis as the reference for the construction of KaplanCMeier curves. The Cox model was used for the investigation of survival-associated factors. RESULTS: A total of 35,515 patients were included, of whom 63.0% were male; 64.7% at the age group of 30 to 49 years, 64.4% were white, 12.9% co-infected with TB, and 37.6% had CD4 count above 200 cells/mm(3) at diagnosis of AIDS. The 12-year survival probabilities were 74.1% and 55.7% among patients without and with TB co-infection, respectively. After adjustment for sex, age and year of diagnosis, the following exposures were independently associated with lower survival: residing in municipalities of the Interior (Hazard ratio (HR) = 1.43) and Coastal Area (HR = 1.9); illiteracy (HR = 2.61); being co-infected with TB (HR = 1.70); CD4 count below 200 cells/mm(3) at AIDS diagnosis (HR = 2.31); viral load above 500 copies/ml at AIDS diagnosis (HR = 1.99); HAART1 regimen (one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or boosted old protease inhibitors) (HR = 1.94). CONCLUSION: The impact of TB on survival of AIDS was heterogeneous, and affected by age, years of formal education, early AIDS diagnosis, and proper ARV treatment. These factors may not fully explain the different survival outcomes in each of the four regions within the same state. These results may subsidize focused interventions and public health policies conveying specific needs in each of the areas.","output":"Mortality and survival of tuberculosis coinfected patients living with AIDS in S?o Paulo, Brazil: a 12-year cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses are mainly a big family of viruses that are highly capable of causing illness both in animals and humans. The scientific name of the most recently discovered corona virus disease is COVID-19.

However, large-scale changes of the kinetochore architecture (such as its shape or dimensions) may also contribute to the value of delta. To assess contributions of these non-elastic changes, we compare behaviour of delta values in human kinetochores with small yet mechanically malleable kinetochores against compound kinetochores in Indian muntjac (IM) cells whose architecture remains constant. Due to the micrometre-scale length of kinetochore plates in IM, their shape and orientation are discernible in conventional light microscopy, which enables precise measurements of IKT independent of contributions from changes in overall architecture of the organelle. We find that delta in IM kinetochores remains relatively constant when microtubule-mediated forces are suppressed by Taxol, but it prominently decreases upon detachment of microtubules. By contrast, large decreases of delta observed in Taxol-treated human cells coincide with prominent changes in length and curvature of the kinetochore plate. These observations, supported by computational modelling, suggest that at least 50% of the decrease in delta in human cells reflects malleable reorganization of kinetochore architecture rather than elastic recoil due to IKT.","output":"Effects of malleable kinetochore morphology on measurements of intrakinetochore tension."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heparanase is the only human enzyme known to hydrolyse heparin sulfate and is involved in many important physiological processes.

The effect of the wagon windows status (i.e. closed or open) is also studied. It is found that under all conditions, open windows are always favored to decrease the infection spreading potential.

We suspect that the sharp deterioration of virus toxicity is related to point mutation and the deletion of the untranslated region of the virus genome. Through sequence analysis of mega-genome data, we found that the genome length of COVID-19 was deleted, which mainly occurred in the untranslated regions at both ends. Sequence similarity analysis further indicated that short UTR length strain emerged by deleting strain with long sequence length. This process is irreversible;the genome with a short sequence length could not restore to the long sequence length. By studying the relationship between genome length and mortality, we found a good correlation between them statistically, which demonstrated that the deletion of the untranslated region of the virus significantly affected the toxicity of the virus. We extracted the viral genome length of patients with different symptoms from the GISAID database for analysis to confirm this relationship. It discovered that the viral genome length of hospitalized patients was significantly more extensive than that of asymptomatic patients. In contrast, the viral genome length of asymptomatic patients was considerably longer than that of ordinary patients with symptoms. To further prove this idea, we performed a genome-level mutation scanning to systematically evaluate the influence of mutations at each position on virulence. After Pearson correlation analysis and chi-square investigation, UTR deletion was the primary driving force in alternating virus virulence. All those statistical evidence support the UTR deletion theory in SARS-COV-2.

For promoting the optimization of infection prevention measures by identifying acts and situations with high risk of infection, we conducted a survey and analysis to understand the detailed process of infection spread in these cases. METHODS: A structured interview was conducted for the special training participants on their health status, changes in symptoms, training methods, and behavior history in their private lives. Additionally, a patrol of the training facility was carried out to understand the training environment, and antibody tests were conducted on the close contacts for more accurately grasping the spread of infection, by identifying subclinical infected persons. RESULTS: Within 10 days of COVID-19 onset in the first patient, 15 of the 19 original training participants developed symptoms, and 14 patients tested positive for RT-PCR. PCR tests were also performed on four patients who did not develop the disease - two were positive and negative, each. The two negatives turned positive on a later antibody test, suggesting that there was an asymptomatic infection. In addition, all five patients who participated in the training for only a day developed symptoms and tested positive for PCR in a few days. Of the 64 people who underwent testing for antibodies as close contacts, all but one who was living together with a patient were negative on antibody testing. CONCLUSIONS: The onset of COVID-19 occurred after the start of practice-based training continuously; therefore, the practice-based training was thought to be the main cause of the transmission. We speculate that the main factors behind the rapid spread of infection are as follows: during practice-based training, increased ventilation made it difficult to wear a mask; repeated loud vocalizations at close range; and the training pair was not fixed.

We adopt the IBGE database from 2016, which contains the weekly flow of people between cities in terrestrial vehicles. The present work aims to investigate the correspondences of the networks' measures, like strength, degree, and betweenness with the emergence of cities with confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Brazil, and special attention is given to the state of Sao Paulo. We show that the results are better when certain thresholds are applied to the networks' flows to neglect the lowest-frequency travels. The correspondences presented statistical significance for most measures up to a certain period. Until the end of April, the best matchings are with the strength measure (total flow related to a node/city) under a high flow threshold in the Sao Paulo state, when the most connected cities are reached. After this stage, the lower thresholds become more suitable, indicating a possible signature of the outbreak interiorization process. Surprisingly, some countryside cities such as Campina Grande (state of Paraiba), Feira de Santana (state of Bahia), and Caruaru (state of Pernambuco) have higher strengths than some states' capitals. Furthermore, some cities from the Sao Paulo state such as Presidente Prudente and Ribeirao Preto are captured in the top-rank positions of all the analyzed network measures under different flow thresholds. Their importance in mobility is crucial and they are potential super spreaders like the states' capitals.

We estimated the potential impact of COVID-19-related disruptions to HIV prevention/treatment services and sexual partnerships on HIV incidence and HIV-related deaths among key populations including female sex workers (FSW), their clients, men who have sex with men (MSM), and overall. SETTING: Yaound (Cameroon) and Cotonou (Benin). METHODS: We used mathematical models of HIV calibrated to city- and risk-population-specific demographic/behavioural/epidemic data. We estimated the relative change in 1-year HIV incidence and HIV-related deaths for various disruption scenarios of HIV prevention/treatment services and decreased casual/commercial partnerships, compared to a scenario without COVID-19. RESULTS: A 50% reduction in condom use in all partnerships over 6 months would increase 1-year HIV incidence by 39%, 42%, 31% and 23% among MSM, FSW, clients, and overall in Yaound respectively, and 69%, 49% and 23% among FSW, clients and overall respectively in Cotonou. Combining a 6-month interruption of ART initiation and 50% reduction in HIV prevention/treatment use would increase HIV incidence by 50% and HIV-related deaths by 20%. This increase in HIV infections would be halved by a simultaneous 50% reduction in casual and commercial partnerships. CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in condom use following COVID-19 would increase infections among key populations disproportionately, particularly FSW in Cotonou, who need uninterrupted condom provision. Disruptions in HIV prevention/treatment services have the biggest impacts on HIV infections and deaths overall, only partially mitigated by equal reductions in casual/commercial sexual partnerships.

Le Guin's 1973 short story \\"The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas\\" depicts a utopian city where the happiness of most of the citizens depends on the misery of a child who lives in a broom closet. We activate the story in the midst of a global pandemic which is laying bare the pre-existing conditions of precarity under gendered settler racial capitalism. We interpret Le Guin's story through an intersectional feminist disability lens, emphasizing the necessity of attending to disability and the carceral institutionalization of disabled people as key to understanding how precarity is distributed. We make the case that \\"Omelas\\" represents places of disability confinement, specifically the institutionalization of disabled people in psychiatric and congregate facilities for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. By examining two such institutions in Salem, Oregon (Omelas spelled backwards), we make explicit the connections between capitalist precarity and carceral disablement. We argue that disability is key to understanding the capitalist crisis because disablement and the construction of the ability/disability binary has been a key mechanism for constructing disposability in the crisis of capitalism. Turning from crisis of late stage capitalism to the crisis of genre, we show that Le Guin's story forces us to confront the role of ongoing eugenics and ableism in the imagination of feminist abolition. We show how \\"Omelas\\" offers a different kind of abolitionist horizon in the form of the \\"ones who walk away.\\" We, however, push to identify with the child in the broom closet and not the ones for whom the story poses a dilemma.

To ensure safe and effective use of upper-room UVGI, it is necessary to devise a simulation technique that enables engineers, designers, and users to explore the impact of different design and operational parameters. We have developed a simulation technique for calculating UV-C fluence rate within the volume of the upper zone and planar irradiance in the lower occupied zone. Our method is based on established ray-tracing light simulation methods adapted to the UV-C wavelength range. We have included a case study of a typical hospital patient room. In it, we explored the impact of several design parameters: ceiling height, device location, room configuration, proportions, and surface materials. We present a spatially mapped parametric study of the UV-C irradiance distribution in three dimensions. We found that the ceiling height and mounting height of the UVGI fixtures combined can cause the largest variation (up to 22%) in upper zone fluence rate. One of the most important findings of this study is that it is crucial to consider interreflections in the room. This is because surface reflectance is the design parameter with the largest impact on the occupant exposure in the lower zone: Applying materials with high reflectance ratio in the upper portion of the room has the highest negative impact (over 700% variation) on increasing hot spots that may receive over 6 mJ/cm2 UV dose in the lower occupied zone.","output":"Spatial analysis of the impact of UVGI technology in occupied rooms using ray-tracing simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims at identifying the level of psychological and professional stress in light of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

We sought to examine associations between long-term consumption of milk and fermented dairy products and risk of breast cancer by estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status and assess whether these associations varied by body weight. METHODS: The population-based Swedish Mammography Cohort included 33,780 women (88.2% postmenopausal), with no history of cancer or diabetes at baseline (1997). Long-term consumption of dairy products was assessed using a self-administered food-frequency questionnaire in 1987 and 1997. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: During 16.6 years of follow-up (559,286 person-years), 1870 total breast cancer cases were diagnosed (1162 ER+/PR+; 195 ER-/PR-).

However, the nature of these symptoms is still unknown. The purpose of the study was to identify limiting causes of cardiopulmonary origin for the performance of physical exercise in post-COVID-19 condition that could explain the symptomatic persistence of dyspnea or fatigue-related symptoms. Thirty-two non-hospitalized patients with post-COVID-19 condition (i.e., still presenting a chronic symptomatic phase lasting >90 days since debut of symptoms that lasted for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis) completed a clinical examination including echocardiography, submaximal and maximal cardiorespiratory fitness tests (Ekblom-Bak and Bruces protocols), and a battery of validated questionnaires about fatigue and exercise intolerance. Four participants (12.5%) reported an abnormal cardiac response to exercise during the submaximal test, which aroused suspicion of the presence of chronotropic incompetence. All of them were confirmed with a positive diagnosis maximal exercise test after cardiology screening, even with a comprehensive clinical examination, resting ECG, and echocardiogram, without other findings. No statistical differences were found in any physiological variables or questionnaire values, between patients with positive and negative diagnoses. Chronotropic incompetence and other autonomic disorders may appear in patients with mild forms of COVID-19 presentation and may persist in the long term, being responsible for exercise intolerance after resolution of acute infection.

Dynamic stretch and recoil of the arterial wall during pulsation (in normal conduit arteries, stretch 20% above diastolic diameter) maintains homeostasis; a static arterial wall is associated with remodeling. PPHN is diagnosed by echocardiography as decreased pulmonary artery wall displacement during systole, causing decreased pulmonary arterial pressure acceleration time in a stiff artery. We hypothesized that a normal amplitude of pulsatile stretch is protective against ER stress, while the loss of stretch is a trigger for hypoxia-induced stress responses. Using a novel in vitro model of pulmonary arterial myocytes subject to repetitive stretch-relaxation cycles within a normoxic or hypoxic environment, we examined the relative impact of hypoxia (pulmonary circuit during unresolved PPHN) and cyclic mechanical stretch (diminished in PPHN) on myocyte homeostasis, specifically on signaling proteins for autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Stretch induced autophagosome abundance under electron microscopy. Hypoxia, in presence or absence of pulsatile stretch, decreased unfolded protein response (UPR) hallmark BIP (GRP78) in contractile phenotype pulmonary arterial myocytes. Inositol requiring enzyme-1  (IRE1) was not activated; but hypoxia induced eif2 phosphorylation, increasing expression of ATF4 (activating transcription factor-4). This was sensitive to inhibition by autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1. We conclude that in the pulmonary circuit, hypoxia induces one arm of the UPR pathway and causes ER stress. Pulsatile stretch ameliorates the hypoxic UPR response, and while increasing presence of autophagosomes, does not activate canonical autophagy signaling pathways. We propose that simultaneous application of hypoxia and graded levels of cyclic stretch can be used to distinguish myocyte signaling in the deformable pulmonary artery of early PPHN, versus the inflexible late stage PPHN artery.","output":"Effect of pulsatile stretch on unfolded protein response in a new model of the pulmonary hypertensive vascular wall"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tourism can transcend governmental boundaries by bringing people closer together through the understanding of different cultures, heritages, and beliefs. Therefore, it is potentially one of the most important vehicles for promoting peace among the peoples of the world. Although previous South Korean governments have historically proposed a variety of actions to contribute to peace on the Korean Peninsula, there has been little success. However, the Mt. Gumgang tourism development, the hallmark of the Sunshine Policy of former president of South Korea, Dae Jung Kim, is different from previous tourism initiatives as it has had more tangible and practical outcomes that have contributed to the promotion of peace on the divided Peninsula. To this end, the South Korean government has applied the insights of neofunctionalism to the Mt. Gumgang tourism development. This is an approach to integration theory from the perspective of liberalism that has been heralded in international politics. According to this approach, it is expected that the Mt. Gumgang tourism development can be used as a tool to maintain peaceful circumstances, which results in spill-over effects, enlargement of activity scopes, and a heightened level of commitment on the Korean Peninsula. The purpose of this study is to empirically test the hypothesis that the Mt. Gumgang tourism development contributes to the peace of the Korean Peninsula by employing the theory of neofunctionalism. To test this hypothesis, this study proposes a Peace Index and investigates the spill-over effects by utilizing the Mt. Gumgang tourism development as a test case. The results of this study indicate that the view that tourism contributes to peace is valid but tenuous since the impact of the Mt. Gumgang tourism development in the promotion of peace was less significant than expected.

Their serial plasma samples (n = 535) collected during the hospitalization period were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using immunoassays. The dynamics of antibodies with the progress and severity of disease was analyzed. Findings Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1% (161/173), 82.7% (143/173) and 64.7% (112/173), respectively. Twelve patients who had not seroconverted were those only blood samples at the early stage of illness were collected. The seroconversion sequentially appeared for Ab, IgM and then IgG, with a median time of 11, 12 and 14 days, respectively. The presence of antibodies was < 40% among patients in the first 7 days of illness, and then rapidly increased to 100.0%, 94.3% and 79.8% for Ab, IgM and IgG respectively since day 15 after onset. In contrast, the positive rate of RNA decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day 7 to 45.5% (25/55) during days 15 to 39.

Widespread uptake of COVID-19 vaccines is necessary to prevent ongoing community transmission. Little is known about the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines among immigrant communities, many of which have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Our goal was to gauge COVID-19 vaccine intentions among Brazilian immigrant women living in the U.S. Methods: We conducted an online survey in Portuguese and English among a convenience sample of Brazilian immigrant women ages 18 years and older. Women were recruited through online advertisements by community-based organizations and social media groups to complete a survey that assessed intention to get a COVID-19 vaccine, attitudes toward vaccines, and perceptions about the pandemic. Results: Of the total sample (N=364), most (70.9%) indicated they would take a COVID-19 vaccine. In bivariate analyses, vaccine intentions were significantly associated with perceptions about the severity of the pandemic, trusted sources of health information, and number of years lived in the U.S. Multinomial logistic regression models revealed that those who did not intend to be vaccinated had lived a longer time in the U.S. (OR: -0.12 95% CI: -0.19, -0.05), perceived the pandemic to be only a minor problem (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 0.51, 2.37), and trusted information from social networks (OR: -2.04, 95% CI: -3.35, -0.73) and private news sources (OR: -1.76, 95% CI: -2.85, -0.68).

While the Nextstrain and GISAID portals offer widely used systems for the classification of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, both present relevant limitations. Here we propose a highly reproducible method for the systematic classification of SARS-CoV-2 viral types. To demonstrate the validity of our approach, we conduct an extensive comparative genomic analysis of more than 20,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Our classification system delineates 12 clusters and 4 super-clusters in SARS-CoV-2, with a highly biased spatio-temporal distribution worldwide, and provides important observations concerning the evolutionary processes associated with the emergence of novel viral types. Based on the estimates of SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate and genetic distances of genomes of the early pandemic phase, we infer that SARS-CoV-2 could have been circulating in humans since August-November 2019. The observed pattern of genomic variability is remarkably similar between all clusters and super-clusters, being UTRs and the s2m element, a highly conserved secondary structure element, the most variable genomic regions. While several polymorphic sites that are specific to one or more clusters were predicted to be under positive or negative selection, overall, our analyses also suggest that the emergence of novel genome types is unlikely to be driven by widespread convergent evolution and independent fixation of advantageous substitutions. While, in the absence of rigorous experimental validation, several questions concerning the evolutionary processes and the phenotypic characteristics (increased/decreased virulence) remain open, we believe that the approach outlined in this study can be of relevance for the tracking and functional characterization of different types of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.","output":"Comparative genomics provides an operational classification system and reveals early emergence and biased spatio-temporal distribution of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Science museums aim to provide educational experiences for both children and adults.

The total lipid content in the hepatopancreas as well as the triglyceride, cholesterol and free fatty acid levels in the hemolymph were determined. Lipids stored in the hepatopancreas and hemolymph decreased with decreasing temperature, with changes in the 9 C group most pronounced, indicating that lipids are the main energy source for crayfish at low temperatures. Furthermore, enzyme activity of lipase, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and lipoprotein esterase, and gene expression analysis of fatty acid synthase gene, acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene and carnitine palmitoyltransferase gene showed that the digestion, synthesis and oxidation of lipids in the hepatopancreas were inhibited under low temperature stress, but expression of sphingolipid delta-4 desaturase (DEGS) was increased, indicating an increase in the demand for highly unsaturated fatty acids at low temperatures. Analysis of the expression of genes related to the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling pathway revealed that the adiponectin receptor gene was rapidly upregulated at low temperatures, which may in turn activate the expression of the downstream AMPK gene, thereby inhibiting lipid anabolism.","output":"Cold stress regulates lipid metabolism via AMPK signalling in Cherax quadricarinatus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article provides a letter to the new president of the U S for resetting federal higher education policy in the 2020s Topics discussed include importance of higher education for individual mobility and national economic prosperity;impact of COVID-19 pandemic on budgets of colleges and universities in the U S as decline in revenue of universities;and importance of federal regulations for higher education marketplace, educational quality, and protection of students","output":"Letter to the President: Resetting Federal Higher Education Policy in the 2020s"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002C2003 has had a significant impact worldwide.

The association of antihypertensive medications with outcomes in patients with hypertension is not fully described. However, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), responsible for host entry of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) leading to COVID-19, is postulated to be upregulated in patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Here, we evaluated the occurrence of pulmonary adverse drug events (ADEs) in patients with hypertension receiving ACEIs/ARBs to determine if disparities exist between individual drugs within the respective classes using data from the FDA Spontaneous Reporting Systems. For this purpose, we proposed the proportional reporting ratio to provide a statistical summary for the commonality of an ADE for a specific drug as compared to the entire database for drugs in the same or other classes. In addition, a statistical procedure, multiple logistic regression analysis, was employed to correct hidden confounders when causative covariates are underreported or untrusted to correct analyses of drug-ADE combinations. To date, analyses have been focused on drug classes rather than individual drugs which may have different ADE profiles depending on the underlying diseases present. A retrospective analysis of thirteen pulmonary ADEs showed significant differences associated with quinapril and trandolapril, compared to other ACEIs and ARBs. Specifically, quinapril and trandolapril were found to have a statistically significantly higher incidence of pulmonary ADEs compared with other ACEIs as well as ARBs (P < 0.0001) for group comparison (i.e., ACEIs vs. ARBs vs. quinapril vs. trandolapril) and (P  0.0007) for pairwise comparison (i.e., ACEIs vs. quinapril, ACEIs vs. trandolapril, ARBs vs. quinapril, or ARBs vs. trandolapril).

Objectives: To understand how communication among families, patients, and the ICU team was enabled during the pandemic. The secondary objectives were to understand strategies used to facilitate virtual visiting and associated benefits and barriers. Methods: A multicenter, cross-sectional, and self-administered electronic survey was sent (June 2020) to all 217 UK hospitals with at least one ICU. Results: The survey response rate was 54%; 117 of 217 hospitals (182 ICUs) responded. All hospitals imposed visiting restrictions, with visits not permitted under any circumstance in 16% of hospitals (28 ICUs); 63% (112 ICUs) of hospitals permitted family presence at the end of life. The responsibility for communicating with families shifted with decreased bedside nurse involvement. A dedicated ICU family-liaison team was established in 50% (106 ICUs) of hospitals. All but three hospitals instituted virtual visiting, although there was substantial heterogeneity in the videoconferencing platform used. Unconscious or sedated ICU patients were deemed ineligible for virtual visits in 23% of ICUs. Patients at the end of life were deemed ineligible for virtual visits in 7% of ICUs. Commonly reported benefits of virtual visiting were reducing patient psychological distress (78%), improving staff morale (68%), and reorientation of patients with delirium (47%). Common barriers to virtual visiting were related to insufficient staff time, rapid implementation of videoconferencing technology, and challenges associated with family members ability to use videoconferencing technology or access a device. Conclusions: Virtual visiting and dedicated communication teams were common COVID-19 pandemic innovations addressing the restrictions to family ICU visiting, and they resulted in valuable benefits in terms of patient recovery and staff morale. Enhancing access and developing a more consistent approach to family virtual ICU visits could improve the quality of care, both during and outside of pandemic conditions.","output":"Communication and Virtual Visiting for Families of Patients in Intensive Care during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A UK National Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED Many viruses utilize cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily as receptors. In particular, viruses of different classes exploit nectins. The large DNA viruses, herpes simplex and pseudorabies viruses, use ubiquitous nectins 1 and 2. The negative-strand RNA virus measles virus (MeV) uses tissue-specific nectin-4, and the positive-strand RNA virus poliovirus uses nectin-like 5 (necl-5), also known as poliovirus receptor. These viruses contact the BC, C'C\\", and FG loops on the upper tip of their receptor's most membrane-distal domain. This location corresponds to the newly defined canonical adhesive interface of nectins, but how viruses utilize this interface has remained unclear. Here we show that the same key residues in the BC and FG loops of nectin-4 govern binding to the MeV attachment protein hemagglutinin (H) and cell entry, nectin-4 homodimerization, and heterodimerization with nectin-1. On the other hand, residues in the C'C\\" loop necessary for homo- and heterotypic interactions are dispensable for MeV-induced fusion and cell entry. Remarkably, the C'C\\" loop governs dissociation of the nectin-4 and H ectodomains. We provide formal proof that H can interfere with the formation of stable nectin-1/nectin-4 heterodimers. Finally, while developing an alternative model to study MeV spread, we observed that polarized primary pig airway epithelial sheets cannot be infected. We show that a single amino acid variant in the BC loop of pig nectin-4 fully accounts for restricted MeV entry. Thus, the three loops forming the adhesive interface of nectin-4 have different roles in supporting MeV H association and dissociation and MeV-induced fusion. IMPORTANCE Different viruses utilize nectins as receptors. Nectins are immunoglobulin superfamily glycoproteins that mediate cell-cell adhesion in vertebrate tissues. They interact through an adhesive interface located at the top of their membrane-distal domain. How viruses utilize the three loops forming this interface has remained unclear. We demonstrate that while nectin-nectin interactions require residues in all three loops, the association of nectin-4 with the measles virus hemagglutinin requires only the BC and FG loops. However, we discovered that residues in the C'C\\" loop modulate the dissociation of nectin-4 from the viral hemagglutinin. Analogous mechanisms may support cell entry of other viruses that utilize nectins or other cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily as receptors.","output":"Different roles of the three loops forming the adhesive interface of nectin-4 in measles virus binding and cell entry, nectin-4 homodimerization, and heterodimerization with nectin-1."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The objective of this review is to examine the epidemiology and pathogenesis of liver injury in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the impact of COVID-19 on patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) and liver transplant recipients. RECENT FINDINGS: Abnormal liver chemistries occur in up to 60% of COVID-19 patients and are typically mild. COVID-19-associated liver injury may be because of direct viral cytopathic effect, immune-mediated damage, hypoxia, drug-induced liver injury (DILI), or exacerbation of CLD. COVID-19 patients with CLD and who are liver transplant recipients are at risk for severe disease and mortality. COVID-19 precipitated hepatic decompensation in 20-46% of cirrhotic patients. Alcohol consumption and cases of acute alcohol-associated hepatitis increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors are well tolerated to use during COVID-19 but immunomodulators have been associated with mortality. Less than 50% of transplant recipients produce adequate antibody titers after COVID-19 vaccination. SUMMARY: COVID-19 patients with CLD should be monitored for liver injury and hepatic decompensation. Patients with CLD and liver transplant recipients should be considered for targeted COVID-19 pharmacotherapeutics and advised vaccination against COVID-19, including a third booster dose. CLD treatments and immunosuppression in liver transplant recipients could generally continue without interruption during COVID-19 infection, with the possible exception of immunomodulators.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 and the liver"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus that has spread globally, infecting more than 150000 people, and being declared pandemic by the WHO.

BACKGROUND The concept of reablement, which has emerged during the last two decades globally, has recently been defined by health experts from 11 countries through a Delphi study. Reablement is seen as a way to support integrated frameworks that achieve person-centred, long-term care and assistance across community settings. International research indicates there is some evidence of developing models of reablement that include staff training and individual components of client assessment. However, evidence of integrating reablement into interdisciplinary practice continues to be sparse. METHODS The review adopted the preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) approach. Inclusion criteria for the review related to community care, primary care, long-term care, and residential care. Populations of interest included service providers, interdisciplinary staff, trainers, and assessors. RESULTS A total of 11 papers were reviewed. The studies varied in their approach to reablement training and client assessment frameworks. Three studies included assessment of staff well-being. All included evidence-based, person-centred components that can be integrated across health care settings. Single disciplinary approaches were used in all studies and some included training evaluation. CONCLUSION This review has identified that currently reablement models are not yet embedded as frameworks for practice by community service providers in primary health care settings. Different programmes of training and assessment are being designed based on single disciplinary approaches and the context in which they are delivered. Further developmental work is required to integrate the components of discipline-specific training programmes within interdisciplinary frameworks. This will achieve not only an integrated framework for delivery across settings but also further the success of 'ageing in place' policy.","output":"A scoping review exploring reablement models of training and client assessment for older people in primary health care."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Web\\\\based cognitive tests have potential for standardized screening in neurodegenerative disorders.

His partial pressure of O2 to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2) was 156. He developed subcutaneous emphysema (SE) and pneumomediastinum on day 5 of mechanical ventilation at ventilatory settings of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 15 cmH(2)O, plateau pressure (Pplat) 25 cmH(2)O and pulmonary inspiratory pressure (PIP) 30 cmH(2)O. He was managed with blow-hole incisions, with subsequent clinical resolution of subcutaneous emphysema. The second patient was a 58-year-old woman who was also mechanically ventilated due to hypoxemic respiratory failure from COVID-19, with PaO2/FiO2 of 81.

Our previous study indicated that salt stress increased the content of active ingredients. However, the regulatory mechanism remains unclear. In this study, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of the aerial parts of G. uralensis treated with 150 mM NaCl for 0, 2, 6, and 12 h was performed to identify the key genes and metabolic pathways regulating pharmacological active component accumulation. The main active component detection showed that liquiritin was the major ingredient and exhibited more than a ten-fold significant increase in the 6 h NaCl treatment. Temporal expression analysis of the obtained 4245 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained by RNA-seq revealed two screened profiles that included the significant up-regulated DEGs (UDEGs) at different treatment points. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of these UDEGs identified phenylpropanoid metabolism and flavonoid biosynthesis as the most significantly enriched pathways in 2 h treated materials. Interestingly, the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway that is related to ABA synthesis was also discovered, and the ABA content was significantly promoted after 6 h NaCl treatment. Following ABA stimulation, the content of liquiritin demonstrated a significant and immediate increase after 2 h treatment, with the corresponding consistent expression of genes involved in the pathways of ABA signal transduction and flavonoid biosynthesis, but not in the pathway of glycyrrhizic acid biosynthesis.

Its impact on diagnosis and timely care delivery for patients (pts) with cancer is unknown. We assessed the pandemic's impact on time from advanced diagnosis to systemic treatment initiation (TTI) for pts with newly diagnosed advanced solid cancers. Methods: We performed a controlled interrupted time series analysis using the nationwide Flatiron Health electronic health record-derived deidentified database, which originated from 280 US cancer clinics. The study sample included pts  18 years diagnosed with advanced solid cancers from Jan 1-Jul 31 in 2019 or in 2020, excluding a 30-day period (Mar 8-Apr 7) encompassing the start of most state stay-athome orders. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate standardized predicted probabilities of TTI within 30 days of advanced diagnosis before (Jan-Mar) and during (Apr-Jul) the pandemic in 2020, compared to historical controls in 2019, adjusted for age, sex, race, insurance, performance status, and cancer type. Interactions by cancer type and race examined heterogeneity of effects. Results: The study included 12,977 pts (median age 69 yrs [IQR 61- 77];47.4% female;59.4% non-Hispanic white). At the time of analysis, fewer advanced cancer diagnoses were recorded in 2020 (Jan-Mar 2,409;Apr-Jul 3,027) than in 2019 (Jan-Mar 2,910;Apr-Jul 4,631). Compared to Apr-Jul 2019, pts diagnosed with advanced cancer during the COVID-19 period were more likely to have De novo (vs recurrent) disease (67.3% vs 56.8%). In adjusted models, the COVID-19 period was associated with an increased probability of treatment within 30 days (adjusted differencein-differences +5.2 percentage points [ppts]). TTI improvements were not observed for pts with advanced breast cancer or Black pts, but effect differences across subgroups were not statistically significant (Table). Conclusions: Among pts diagnosed with advanced cancer, the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with shorter time to systemic therapy initiation. These treatment patterns may reflect the fewer advanced cancer diagnoses and higher proportion of De novo cancers observed during this period.

Remdesivir has got FDA approval as the first COVID-19 anti-viral agent in adult and paediatric patients (aged 12 years and weighing at least 40 kg) requiring hospitalization. OBJECTIVE The present prospective, observational, cross sectional study was planned to evaluate the impact of early initiation of Remdesivir on clinical outcomes in moderate to severe COVID 19 patients requiring ICU care. Materials and Methods: In this study, 100 consecutive symptomatic RT-PCR positive COVID 19 patients requiring admission to Intensive care unit based on predefined criteria were included for evaluation. All such moderate to severely ill patients were given Remdesivir intravenously as a 200-mg loading dose on day 1, followed by a 100-mg maintenance dose for the next four days along with other standard care. The main outcome measure analysed was the impact of early initiation of Remdesivir on recovery assessed by number of days in hospital, recovery, biochemical improvements and death. Results: Out of total 100 patients, 84 patients recovered with Remdesivir along with supportive treatment and were discharged from the hospital. Mean age of patients at presentation 53.5 14.8 years with 5:1 male preponderance. Mean duration of hospital stay was 11.6  5.9 days. D-dimer, CRP, Ferritin, IL-6 decreased significantly post treatment with P values <0.05, <0.001, <0.001, <0.01 respectively when compared to values at admission.

OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review to synthesize the available data on the efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Two reviewers searched for published and pre-published relevant articles between December 2019 and 8 June 2020. The data from the selected studies were abstracted and analyzed for efficacy and safety outcomes. Critical appraisal of the evidence was done by Cochrane risk of bias tool and Newcastle Ottawa Scale. The quality of evidence was graded as per the GRADE approach. RESULTS: We reviewed 12 observational and 3 randomized trials which included 10,659 patients of whom 5713 received CQ/HCQ and 4966 received only standard of care. The efficacy of CQ/HCQ for COVID-19 was inconsistent across the studies.

John Snow conducted pioneering investigations on cholera epidemics in England and particularly in London in 1854 in which he demonstrated that contaminated water was the key source of the epidemics. His thorough investigation of an epidemic in the Soho district of London led to his conclusion that contaminated water from the Broad Street pump was the source of the disease and, consequently, the removal of the handle led to cessation of the epidemic. He further studied cholera in London homes that were receiving water from two water supply systems; one from the sewage contaminated portion of the Thames River and the other that drew its water upstream from an uncontaminated part of the river. Rates of infection among clients of the distribution system drawing contaminated water far exceeded the, rates among those served by the company whose water intake was from above the contaminated section of the river. This demonstration reinforced the goals of the sanitation movement, which developed sewage drainage systems and water purification systems in cities and towns in the following decades, therewith vastly reducing the threats of cholera, typhoid and many other waterborne diseases. Despite progress being made globally, the public health problems of waterborne disease, including cholera, are by no means gone today, even in high-income countries. The tragic introduction of cholera after the earthquake devastation in Haiti in 2010 resulted in many thousands of cases and deaths from cholera indicating the still-present dangers of diseases spread into disaster situations. Cholera and other waterborne diseases remain some of the heaviest burdens of disease and death in low-income countries, especially after natural disasters or warfare as in Yemen in 2017 and are continuing challenges for global health.","output":"John Snow, Cholera, the Broad Street Pump; Waterborne Diseases Then and Now"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sixty-two strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were isolated from diseased chickens at different farms in southern China during 2011C2012, and 66.1 % of the isolated strains were associated with typical nephritis. Analysis of the S1 gene sequences amplified from the 62 isolated strains together with 40 reference strains published in Genbank showed nucleotide homologies ranging from 63.5 to 99.9 % and amino acid homologies ranging from 57.9 to 100 %. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all Chinese IBV strains were clustered into six distinct genetic groups (ICVI). Most of the isolated strains belonged to group I, and the isolation of group V strains was increased compared with an earlier period of surveillance. Current vaccine strains used in China (H120, H52, W93, and Ma5) formed the group Mass which is evolutionarily distant from Chinese isolates. Alignment of S1 amino acid sequences revealed polymorphic and diverse substitutions, insertions, and deletions, and the S1 protein of major pandemic strains contained 540 amino acids with a cleavage site sequence of HRRRR or RRF(L/S)RR. Further analysis showed that recombination events formed a new subgroup. Taken together, these findings suggest that various IBV variants were co-circulating and undergoing genetic evolution in southern China during the observation period. Therefore, long-term continuing surveillance is significantly important for prevention and control of IBV infection.","output":"Analysis of S1 gene of avian infectious bronchitis virus isolated in southern China during 2011C2012"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several countries in Africa have either deployed or considering using digital contact-tracing (DCT) as part of their Covid-19 containment strategy, amidst calls for the use of technology to improve the efficiency of traditional contact-tracing We discuss some of the complexities entailed in using DCT in Africa Adopting a socio-technical perspective, we argue that if DCT design and deployment are not well thought out, it can lead to unintended consequences, particularly in a continent like Africa with disproportionate levels of digital divides and other structural inequalities We suggest that any adoption of DCT by African countries must take account of their compatibility with local resources, values, social structure, and domestic political factors Accordingly, we propose a process of translation whereby DCT adaptation is made to accommodate the unique institutional and technological characteristics of African countries by leveraging local practices learned from previous pandemics like Ebola to develop a blended epidemiological approach to (digital) contact-tracing","output":"Digital contact-tracing and pandemics: institutional and technological preparedness in Africa.

Obtaining data on specific source(s) and transmission dynamics of MERS-CoV during nosocomial outbreaks has been challenging. We performed a clinical, epidemiological and phylogenetic investigation of an outbreak of MERS-CoV at a University Hospital in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Clinical, epidemiological and infection control data were obtained from patients and Healthcare workers (HCWs). Full genome sequencing was conducted on nucleic acid extracted directly from MERS-CoV PCR-confirmed clinical samples and phylogenetic analysis performed. Phylogenetic analysis combined with published MERS-CoV genomes was performed. HCWs compliance with infection control practices was also assessed. RESULTS: Of 235 persons investigated, there were 23 laboratory confirmed MERS cases, 10 were inpatients and 13 HCWs. Eight of 10 MERS inpatients died (80% mortality). There were no deaths among HCWs. The primary index case assumed from epidemiological investigation was not substantiated phylogenetically. 17/18 MERS cases were linked both phylogenetically and epidemiologically. One asymptomatic HCW yielded a MERS-CoV genome not directly linked to any other case in the investigation. Five HCWs with mild symptoms yielded >75% full MERS-CoV genome sequences. HCW compliance with use of gowns was 62.1%, gloves 69.7%, and masks 57.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors and sources, including a HCW MERS-CoV 'carrier phenomenon', occur during nosocomial MERS-CoV outbreaks. Phylogenetic analyses of MERS-CoV linked to clinical and epidemiological information is essential for outbreak investigation.

Indoor occupancy information measurement methods based on cameras mainly consist of cameras at the room entrance and cameras at the room interior. However, each method has particular advantages and limitations. In this paper, we propose a four-step occupancy detection and estimation system based on cameras. Firstly, we develop an occupancy detection method to filter the non-occupied frames and to provide the switching value. Secondly, we design a motion detection method to detect entering or leaving events at the room entrance. Thirdly, Fully Convolutional Head Detector (FCHD) is used to detect the indoor human heads. Finally, considering the occupancy number information depends on the previous results, we propose a fusion estimation method that combines the motion detection and static estimation by calculating the Kalman filter and Occupancy Frequency Histogram (OFH). The novel fusion method takes the advantages of two methods and overcomes its own limitations, so that it can compensate each other to reach the high-accuracy results. The accumulative error and the shaking results are cleared, and then some headlike objects are filtered. The proposed fusion method reaches an occupancy detection accuracy of 97.8%;reaches an occupancy estimation Score of 78.52% and 79.18%;reaches an occupancy estimation the Mean Square Error (MSE) of 0.21 and 0.23.

To evaluate the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community, we investigated the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using the sera of KNHANES participants. Methods: The subjects were recruited between April 24, 2020, and December 12, 2020. A total of 5,284 subjects aged 10-90 years from 17 regions participated in the survey. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were screened using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay. Positive samples were verified using four different SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays and the plaque reduction neutralizing test (PRNT). The final seropositivity criteria were defined as a positive screening test and at least one positive out of the five additional tests. Results: The distribution of survey participants was as follows: 49.2% (2,600/5,284) were from a metropolitan area, 48.9% were middle-aged (in their 40s and 60s) and 19.3% were in their 20s or younger.

Licensing trials suggest that use of BAM reduces hospitalizations when compared with placebo (1.6% vs 6.3%). However, the real world impact of BAM is not well-described. In this study, risk factors, outcomes, and hospitalization rates among high-risk outpatients presenting with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who received BAM were examined. METHODS: This is a single center retrospective analysis of all patients who received BAM monotherapy between 11/11/2020 and 3/16/2021. Electronic health records were reviewed for baseline demographics, EUA indications, comorbidities, and outcomes to include infusion reactions, hospitalizations, and deaths occurring within 29 days of BAM administration. Moderate COVID-19 was defined as having any infiltrate on chest imaging prior to BAM administration. Chi-squared or Fishers exact tests were used to compare categorical values as appropriate, and Mann-Whitney U for continuous variables. RESULTS: Of the 101 patients who received BAM (median age 64 years; 21% black; 4% Hispanic; 55% male), 13 were subsequently admitted. 22 patients (22%) had moderately severe disease as evidenced by abnormal imaging. Severity on presentation, number of indications for therapy, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, and number of co-morbidities were significantly associated with subsequent admission (table 1). No patients had adverse infusion reactions. Of those hospitalized, 8 (61.5%) were for COVID-19, the median duration of hospitalization was 2 days, and 4 received guideline-directed treatment for COVID-19 (table 2). Table 1.

Some countries proposed universal mask wearing as a protection measure of public health to strengthen national prevention efforts and to limit the wider spread of the epidemic. In order to reveal the epidemic prevention efficacy of masks, this paper systematically evaluates the experimental studies of various masks and filter materials, summarises the general characteristics of the filtration efficiency of isolation masks with particle size, and reveals the actual efficacy of masks by combining the volume distribution characteristics of human exhaled droplets with different particle sizes and the SARS-CoV-2 virus load of nasopharynx and throat swabs from patients. The existing measured data show that the filtration efficiency of all kinds of masks for large particles and extra-large droplets is close to 100%. From the perspective of filtering the total number of pathogens discharged in the environment and protecting vulnerable individuals from breathing live viruses, the mask has a higher protective effect. If considering the weighted average filtration efficiency with different particle sizes, the filtration efficiencies of the N95 mask and the ordinary mask are 99.4% and 98.5%, respectively. The mask can avoid releasing active viruses to the environment from the source of infection, thus maximising the protection of vulnerable individuals by reducing the probability of inhaling a virus. Therefore, if the whole society strictly implements the policy of publicly wearing masks, the risk of large-scale spread of the epidemic can be greatly reduced. Compared with the overall cost of social isolation, limited personal freedoms and forced suspension of economic activities, the inconvenience for citizens caused by wearing masks is perfectly acceptable.","output":"Why does the spread of COVID-19 vary greatly in different countries?

More importantly, self-control moderated the perceived severity of the COVID-19 C mental health problems association, with the said link attenuating as the levels of self-control increased.

It is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by persistent inflammation of the airways and disturbances in redox status, leading to hyperresponsiveness of bronchi and airway obstruction. Apart from classical risk factors such as air pollution, family history, allergies, or obesity, disturbances of the levels of micronutrients lead to impairments in the defense mechanisms of the affected organism against oxidative stress and proinflammatory stimuli. In the present review, the impact of micronutrients on the prevalence, severity, and possible risk factors of asthma is discussed. Although the influence of classical micronutrients such as selenium, copper, or zinc are well known, the effects of those such as iodine or manganese are only rarely mentioned.

We define optimal treatment and optimal treatment initiation time, identify biologic programs which determine heterogeneous clinical responses and predict biomarkers of those programs. Finally, we evaluate the utility of model biomarkers for identifying high-risk patients in a clinical database of COVID-19 patients.Findings: We predict patient phenotypes with disparate clinical responses to the same therapy. Older and hyperinflammed patients respond better to immunomodulation than obese and diabetic patients. Optimal treatment initiation time is driven by neutrophil recruitment dynamics, extra-pulmonary cytokine expression, systemic microthrombosis and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in older patients, and by RAS, systemic microthrombosis and trans IL6 signaling for hyperinflamed patients. For older and hyperinflamed patients, IL6 modulating therapy is optimal when initiated very early (<4th day of infection) and broad immunosuppression therapy (corticosteroids) is better later in the disease (between 7thC 9thday of infection). We show that biologic programs identified by the model correspond to clinically identified markers of disease severity,Interpretation: Modeling of COVID-19 pathobiology suggests combinations of patient phenotypes which may lead to disparate outcome when included in a trial with a single intervention protocol.

Our objectives were to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of risankizumab and its impact on the quality of life of patients with psoriasis in a real-world setting. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 154 patients from 18 centers in the Czech Republic who had undergone biologic therapy with risankizumab for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Baseline characteristics included data on comorbidities, demographics, previous therapies, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score. The proportion of patients achieving a 90% improvement in their PASI score from baseline (PASI 90) and complete resolution (PASI 100) after 16, 28, and 52 weeks was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 95 men and 59 women with mean body mass index (BMI) of 29.6 were enrolled in our analysis. The mean age of the patients was 48.5 years and the mean time from diagnosis until initiation of risankizumab therapy was 22.5 years. After 16 weeks, 63.8 and 44.7% patients achieved PASI 90 and PASI 100 responses, respectively. Improvement continued with time, and the proportion of patients with PASI 90 and PASI 100 responses increased to 82.4 and 67.6%, respectively, at week 52. A significant reduction was observed over time in the DLQI. Patients achieving PASI 100 response at week 16 had a higher reduction in the DLQI score than those with PASI 90 response (? 15.9 vs. ? 11.8). PASI 90 and PASI 100 responses were independent of the BMI and previous biologic therapy. No new safety issues were identified. CONCLUSIONS: In this patient population, risankizumab was effective and safe in a real-world setting, and a high number of patients achieved PASI 90 and PASI 100 responses. A higher reduction in the DLQI was seen in patients with PASI 100 response, which supports the evidence that this value should be the new therapeutic goal.","output":"Risankizumab for the Treatment of Moderate-to-Severe Psoriasis: Real-Life Multicenter Experience from the Czech Republic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The key factor distinguishing family firms from others is the familys involvement in the governance of their firm through participation in ownership, management, and board (if any) along with their intentions for maintaining family control over the firm across generations.

The study aimed to examine the correlation between 18F-FDG PET-CT-defined heterogeneity parameters and the prognostic significance in patients with colorectal cancer. Methods The study included 188 patients with colorectal cancer who received surgery and 18F-FDG PET/CT examinations. Preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT conventional and metabolic heterogeneity parameters were collected, including maximum, peak, and mean standardized uptake value (SUVmax, SUVpeak, and SUVmean), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), heterogeneity index-1 (HI-1) and heterogeneity index-2 (HI-2), and clinicopathological information. Correlations between these parameters and patient survival outcomes were inferred. Results The associations between 18F-FDG PET/CT parameters and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Tumor thrombus (P < 0.001), tumor stage (P=0.001), MTV (P=0.003), HI-1 (P=0.032), and HI-2 (P=0.001) differed between the two groups with and without recurrence.

However no human population is fully isolated from other human or animal populations. We use compartmental models to derive simple rules for the basic reproduction number in populations where an endemic disease is sustained by a combination of local transmission within the population and exposure from some other source: either a reservoir exposure or imported cases. We introduce the idea of a reservoir-driven or importation-driven disease: diseases that would become extinct in the population of interest without reservoir exposure or imported cases (since R 0 < 1 ), but nevertheless may be sufficiently transmissible that many or most infections are acquired from humans in that population. We show that in the simplest case, R 0 < 1 if and only if the proportion of infections acquired from the external source exceeds the disease prevalence and explore how population heterogeneity and the interactions of multiple strains affect this rule. We apply these rules in two case studies of Clostridium difficile infection and colonisation: C. difficile in the hospital setting accounting for imported cases, and C. difficile in the general human population accounting for exposure to animal reservoirs. We demonstrate that even the hospital-adapted, highly-transmissible NAP1/RT027 strain of C. difficile had a reproduction number <1 in a landmark study of hospitalised patients and therefore was sustained by colonised and infected admissions to the study hospital. We argue that C. difficile should be considered reservoir-driven if as little as 13.0% of transmission can be attributed to animal reservoirs.","output":"Some simple rules for estimating reproduction numbers in the presence of reservoir exposure or imported cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite impressive performance on standard benchmarks, deep neural networks are often brittle when deployed in real-world systems.

Previous literature mainly focused on the cause of national aggregate emission changes. However, research about the effect of fiscal expenditures on science and technology (FESTs) on environmental pollution is rare. Considering the large gap among cities in China, it is necessary to investigate whether and how FESTs affect environmental pollution among cities. We adopted three kinds of typical environmental pollutants including sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) emissions, wastewater emission, and atmospheric particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM(2.5)). Using the data of 260 prefecture-level cities over ten years in China, we found that FESTs play a significantly positive role in reducing sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) emissions and PM(2.5) concentrations, but fail to alleviate wastewater emissions. Specifically, for every 1% increase in FESTs, SO(2) emissions were reduced by 5.317% and PM(2.5) concentrations were reduced by 5.329%. Furthermore, we found that FESTs reduced environmental pollution by impeding fixed asset investments and by promoting research and development activities (R&D). Moreover, the impacts of FESTs on environmental pollution varied across regions and sub-periods. Our results are robust to a series of additional checks, including alternative econometric specifications, generalized method of moments (GMM) analysis and overcoming potential endogeneity with an instrumental variable.

Lactobacillus iners-dominated microbial communities are associated with poorer outcomes, including higher risk of bacterial vaginosis (BV), compared with vaginal microbiota rich in L. crispatus. Unfortunately, standard-of-care metronidazole therapy for BV typically results in dominance of L. iners, probably contributing to post-treatment relapse. Here we generate an L. iners isolate collection comprising 34 previously unreported isolates from 14 South African women with and without BV and 4 previously unreported isolates from 3 US women. We also report an associated genome catalogue comprising 1,218 vaginal Lactobacillus isolate genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes from >300 women across 4 continents. We show that, unlike L. crispatus, L. iners growth is dependent on L-cysteine in vitro and we trace this phenotype to the absence of canonical cysteine biosynthesis pathways and a restricted repertoire of cysteine-related transport mechanisms. We further show that cysteine concentrations in cervicovaginal lavage samples correlate with Lactobacillus abundance in vivo and that cystine uptake inhibitors selectively inhibit L. iners growth in vitro. Combining an inhibitor with metronidazole promotes L. crispatus dominance of defined BV-like communities in vitro by suppressing L. iners growth.

Recent technologies and advanced computerized algorithms follow Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to improve medical diagnosis platforms. This technology is making the diagnosis practice of brain issues easier for medical practitioners to analyze and identify diseases with an assured degree of precision and performance. METHODS: As the existing CT image analysis models use standard procedures to detect hemorrhages, the need for DL-based data analysis is essential to provide more accurate results. Generally, the existing techniques are limited with image training efficiency, image filtering procedures, and runtime system tuning modules. On the scope, this work develops a DL-based automated analysis of CT scan slices to find various levels of brain hemorrhages. Notably, this proposed system integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architectures as Integrated Generative Adversarial-Convolutional Imaging Model (IGACM) for extracting the CT image features for detecting brain hemorrhages. RESULTS: This system produces good results and takes lesser training time than existing techniques. This proposed system effectively works over CT images and classifies the abnormalities with more accuracy than current techniques. The experiments and results deliver the optimal detection of hemorrhages with better accuracy. It shows that the proposed system works with 5% to 10% of the better performance compared to other diagnostic techniques. CONCLUSION: The complex nature of CT images leads to noncorrelated feature complexities in diagnosis models. Considering the issue, the proposed system used GAN-based effective sampling techniques for enriching complex image samples into CNN training phases. This concludes the effective contribution of the proposed IGACM technique for detecting brain hemorrhages than the existing diagnosis models.","output":"Detecting and Extracting Brain Hemorrhages from CT Images Using Generative Convolutional Imaging Scheme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease that has become a global public health concern after being first reported in China and has subsequently spread worldwide.

Patients with cancer were considered at high risk on sparse evidence, and despite a small number of emerging observational studies, the true incidence and impact of COVID-19 in the 'at-risk' population of patients with cancer is yet to be defined. METHODS: Epidemiological and clinical data were collected prospectively for patients attending the Royal Marsden Hospital and three network hospitals between March 1st and April 30th 2020 that were confirmed to have Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection. Significance of clinical and pathological characteristics was assessed using the Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test, whilst univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to further assess risk. The number of patients attending in March/April 2020 for face-to-face attendances was also extracted. FINDINGS: During the 2-month study period, 867 of 13,489 (6.4%) patients met the criteria leading to swab testing. Of the total at-risk population, only 113 of 13,489 (0.84%) were swab positive, 101 of 13,489 (0.75%) required hospital admission and 29 of 13,489 (0.21%) died of COVID-19. Of the patients that attended the hospital to receive cytotoxic chemotherapy alone or in combination with other therapy, 59 of 2001 (2.9%) were admitted to the hospital for COVID-19-related issues and 20 of 2001 (1%) died.

To curb the spread of communicable diseases effectively, timely surveillance and prediction of the risk of pandemics are essential.

This study describes analytical findings of time-series plots and spatial-temporal maps to illustrate or visualize pandemic connectedness. We analyzed data retrieved from the web-based Collaborative Arrangement for the Prevention and Management of Public Health Events in Civil Aviation dashboard, which contains up-to-date and comprehensive meta-information on civil flights from 193 national governments in accordance with the airport, country, city, latitude, and the longitude of flight origin and the destination. We used the database to visualize pandemic connectedness through the workflow of travel data collection, network construction, data aggregation, travel statistics calculation, and visualization with time-series plots and spatial-temporal maps. We observed similar patterns in the time-series plots of worldwide daily flights from January to early-March of 2019 and 2020. A sharp reduction in the number of daily flights recorded in mid-March 2020 was likely related to large-scale air travel restrictions owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. The levels of connectedness between places are strong indicators of the risk of a pandemic. Since the initial reports of COVID-19 cases worldwide, a high network density and reciprocity in early-March 2020 served as early signals of the COVID-19 pandemic and were associated with the rapid increase in COVID-19 cases in mid-March 2020.

CONCLUSIONS: The stability of these reconstituted vaccines reported here may improve the efficiency of the ground transportation and distribution of the vaccines, which may lead to shorter and more homogeneous vaccinations in cities and rural areas.","output":"Reconstituted mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may maintain stability after continuous movement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The pandemic phase 3mitigationby the SARS-Coronavirus?2 is currently taking on speed in Germany. Skewed distributions of key epidemiological parameters of the virus and patient care are a challenge for the control of the outbreak as well as keeping the system functional. METHODS: The skewed parameterspre-patency period, incubation period, duration of viral shedding and time to admission to hospitalare analyzed in regard to their impact and possible countermeasures. RESULTS: The skewed distributions are exclusively time related variables. They are a handicap for outbreak control as well patient management. Optimization between residual open flanks and the efforts to close them is difficult. The main stakeholders are the local health departments, the diagnostic laboratories, the health care infrastructure and finally the citizens in regard to the burden due to non-pharmaceutical interventions including quarantine and isolation. The duration of quarantine and isolation should urgently be shortened for health care workers (HCW) as well as people in critical infrastructure by ready (re-) testing. Calculated risks have to be taken within a phase 3 of a pandemic to keep a system going. CONCLUSIONS: The skewed distributions are a special challenge for infectious disease control. In the case of ending quarantine and isolation in phase 3 of the pandemic, they should be judged specifically in regard to the client/patient. Cumulative distribution functions are very helpful in this regard.","output":"Herausforderungen in der Seuchenkontrolle und der jetzigen Pandemie durch verzerrte Verteilungen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on daily life. Restrictions imposed to help minimise virus transmission have limited both population movement and employment, as well as altering the potential mechanisms of high-energy trauma. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pelvic and acetabular trauma. Materials and methods A retrospective observational study of the incidence, causality, patient profile, fracture morphology, and treatment strategy of pelvic and acetabular trauma managed in a national tertiary referral specialist pelvic and acetabular centre between the 1(st) of March and 1(st) of August 2020 was undertaken and compared to corresponding time periods in the two preceding years. Results A total of 78 patients were referred for management following pelvic and acetabular trauma during the study period with a mean age of 52 years (SD +/- 24.2). Overall, 45% and 42% of patients were referred following isolated pelvic or acetabular fractures respectively. The most frequent mechanism of injury was a fall from height (>1m) (42%), with 53% of patients suffering from concomitant injuries and 32% requiring surgical management. While there was a statistically significant difference in mechanism of injury (P=0.026), there was no significant difference in overall incidence, fracture types, incidence of concomitant injuries, or overall proportion requiring surgical intervention during the study period when compared to previous years. Conclusion While some variation in the mechanisms of injury have been observed, the overall incidence, patient, fracture, and injury profiles associated with pelvic and acetabular trauma appear to have remained consistent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the number and proportion of those requiring surgical treatment of these fractures have remained stable. Understanding the continued burden of these potentially severe injuries may help guide injury prevention, treatment, and resource allocation as the pandemic continues.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Pelvic and Acetabular Trauma: Experiences From a National Tertiary Referral Centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 26S proteasome, in charge of intracellular protein degradation, plays significant roles in the modulation of various cellular activities as well as in the interplay between virus and host. However, studies about the relationship between 26S proteasome and classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is limited up to now. MG132 is a proteasome inhibitor and has been extensively used in studies about replication of many viruses. Herein, we investigated the role of MG132 in CSFV replication and results showed that MG132 significantly decreased virus titers and viral RNA copies in CSFV-infected PK-15 cells. Further studies demonstrated that MG132 upregulated the expression of several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), in CSFV-infected cells. Since the activation of ISGs is controlled by the JAK-STAT signal pathway, we next examined the effect of MG132 on the expression and localization of key molecular STAT1 in the infected cells using Western blot and confocal laser scanning microscopy, respectively. Results showed that CSFV infection and viral NS4A protein decreased the protein level of STAT1, and MG132 promoted the accumulation of STAT1 in the nucleus of cells adjacent to the CSFV-infected cells. Besides, MG132 did not affect the expressions of IFN-, STAT1, Mx1, OAS1, and PKR genes in cells without CSFV. In conclusion, we identify that MG132 significantly inhibits CSFV replication in vitro, in which the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and the subsequent upregulation of expressions of ISGs might play significant roles, providing a potential preventive method for CSF.","output":"MG132 Attenuates the Replication of Classical Swine Fever Virus in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study focuses on learning with the Global Change app, an interactive tool for fostering climate change knowledge. Numerous studies have contributed to the question on what type of instruction is best to achieve learning gains. The findings are mixed. We applied the app in university courses and investigated which instructional setting a discovery learning approach (no supplementary guidance) or an approach that leans more toward direct instruction is more effective (+ supplementary guidance). Thus, we distinguished between conceptual and procedural guidance within our direct instruction approach. Our study was implemented in a digital learning environment with 110 students participating in the study. We applied a 2  2 experimental design with different types of guidance as treatment (conceptual and procedural). An online questionnaire was administered in pretest and posttest to measure climate change knowledge as well as different variables. Our results show that the app provided gains in climate change knowledge in a short period of time regardless of treatment. Further, students who received no supplementary guidance acquired more knowledge about climate change than the groups that received supplemental guidance (either conceptual, procedural, or both). Learning gain correlated significantly negatively with cognitive load across the whole sample, but there were no significant differences between groups.

Photoplethysmography (PPG)-based smartphone apps are promising tools to enable early detection and follow-up of arrhythmias. OBJECTIVE: By using a PPG-based smartphone app, we aimed to gain more insight into the prevalence of AF and other rhythm-related complications upon discharge home after cardiac surgery and evaluate the implementation of this app into routine clinical care. METHODS: In this prospective, single-center trial, patients recovering from cardiac surgery were asked to register their heart rhythm 3 times daily using a Food and Drug AdministrationCapproved PPG-based app, for either 30 or 60 days after discharge home. Patients with permanent AF or a permanent pacemaker were excluded. RESULTS: We included 24 patients (mean age 60.2 years, SD 12 years; 15/23, 65% male) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and/or valve surgery. During hospitalization, 39% (9/23) experienced postoperative AF. After discharge, the PPG app reported AF or atrial flutter in 5 patients. While the app notified flutter in 1 patient, this was a false positive, as electrocardiogram revealed a 2nd-degree, 2:1 atrioventricular block necessitating a permanent pacemaker. AF was confirmed in 4 patients (4/23, 17%) and interestingly, was associated with an underlying postoperative complication in 2 participants (pneumonia n=1, pericardial tamponade n=1). A significant increase in the proportion of measurements indicating sinus rhythm was observed when comparing the first to the second month of follow-up (P<.001). In the second month of follow-up, compliance was significantly lower with 2.2 (SD 0.7) measurements per day versus 3.0 (SD 0.8) measurements per day in the first month (P=.002). The majority of participants (17/23, 74%), as well as the surveyed primary care physicians, experienced positive value by using the app as they felt more involved in the postoperative rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of smartphone-based PPG technology enables detection of AF and other rhythm-related complications after cardiac surgery. An association between AF detection and an underlying complication was found in 2 patients. Therefore, smartphone-based PPG technology may supplement rehabilitation after cardiac surgery by acting as a sentinel for underlying complications, rhythm-related or otherwise.","output":"Remote Heart Rhythm Monitoring by Photoplethysmography-Based Smartphone Technology After Cardiac Surgery: Prospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To explore the risk perceptions and COVID-19 prevention practices of dormitory residents in Indonesia.

Hi-C data were used to identify topologically associated domains (TADs) encompassing the LD blocks and overlapping genes. Results: Fibroblasts, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells showed significant enrichment for enhancer-associated marks within stroke-associated LD blocks. Genes within encompassing TADs reflected vessel homeostasis, cellular turnover, and enzymatic activity.

FINDINGS: Despite the determined efforts of provincial and city governments to ensure that food reached people who were locked down in Wuhan, or subject to restrictions on movement in Nanjing, households experienced some decline in food security. Most households found they could not access their preferred foods. But a minority of households did not get enough to eat. Government had contingency plans for the pandemic that ensured that most people had sufficient, if not preferred, food. But not all households were fully covered.

Individuals with a vulnerable immune system, such as very young children and the elderly, and those with an immune deficiency, are at increased risk of contracting a respiratory infection. Most respiratory infections are relatively mild and affect the upper respiratory tract only, but other infections can be more serious. These can lead to pneumonia and be life-threatening in vulnerable groups. Rather than focus entirely on treating the symptoms of infectious disease, optimizing immune responsiveness to the pathogens causing these infections may help steer towards a more favorable outcome. Nutrition may have a role in such prevention through different immune supporting mechanisms. Nutrition contributes to the normal functioning of the immune system, with various nutrients acting as energy sources and building blocks during the immune response. Many micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) act as regulators of molecular responses of immune cells to infection. It is well described that chronic undernutrition as well as specific micronutrient deficiencies impair many aspects of the immune response and make individuals more susceptible to infectious diseases, especially in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. In addition, other dietary components such as proteins, pre-, pro- and synbiotics, and also animal- and plant-derived bioactive components can further support the immune system. Both the innate and adaptive defense systems contribute to active antiviral respiratory tract immunity. The initial response to viral airway infections is through recognition by the innate immune system of viral components leading to activation of adaptive immune cells in the form of cytotoxic T cells, the production of neutralizing antibodies and the induction of memory T and B cell responses. The aim of this review is to describe the effects of a range different dietary components on anti-infective innate as well as adaptive immune responses and to propose mechanisms by which they may interact with the immune system in the respiratory tract.","output":"Ingestion, Immunity, and Infection: Nutrition and Viral Respiratory Tract Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores the effectiveness of photographs as instruments of public diplomacy through an analysis of Chinas visual storytelling during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Thromboelastography and viscometry were also used to study coagulation parameters and plasma viscosity. We conclude that structural pathologies found in platelets and erythrocytes, together with spontaneously formed amyloid microclots, may be central to vascular changes observed during COVID-19 progression, including thrombotic microangiopathy, diffuse intravascular coagulation, and large-vessel thrombosis, as well as ground-glass opacities in the lungs.

Choosing the appropriate loss function to enhance discrimination power is one of the most significant factors in deep learning networks. This paper proposes a novel iris identification framework that integrates the light-weight MobileNet architecture with customized ArcFace and Triplet loss functions. By combining two loss functions, it is possible to improve the compactness within a class and the discrepancies between classes. To reduce the amount of preprocessing, the normalization step is omitted and segmented iris images are used directly. In contrast to the original SoftMax loss, the EER for the combined loss from ArcFace and Triplet is decreased from 1.11% to 0.45%, and the TPR is increased from 99.77% to 100%.

Focus group participants emphasized the importance of teamwork and a flexible and coordinated approach to care. Participants described collaboration within and among institutions, as well as partnerships with governmental, private, and nonprofit organizations. Hierarchies were advantageous to decision\\\\making and information dissemination. Clinicians were inspired by their patients and explained creative trade\\\\offs and workarounds used to maintain high\\\\quality care. CONCLUSIONS: Factors previously described as contributing to resilient health care manifested differently in each institution but were described in all resource settings. These insights can guide pediatric oncology teams worldwide as they provide cancer care during the next phases of the pandemic. Understanding these elements of resilience will also help providers respond to inevitable future stressors on health care systems.","output":"Resilient health care in global pediatric oncology during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The ability to forecast changing trends of COVID-19 can help drive efforts to sustain the increasing burden on the healthcare system, specifically the clinical laboratories. We aimed to assess whether the trends of SARS-CoV-2 testing in Pakistan can be predicted using COVID-19 symptoms as search terms and analyzing the data from Google Trends. METHODS: The number of weekly SARS-CoV-2 tests performed were retrieved from online COVID-19 data resource. Google Trends data for the search terms with most common COVID-19 symptoms was analyzed for cross-correlation with the number of tests performed nationally. RESULTS: A total of 10,066,255 SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests were analyzed. Search terms of fever, headache, and shortness of breath displayed a statistically significant correlation with total number of tests performed with a 1-week time lag.

Governments have often played loose with their state's constitution in the name of warding off an urgent threat. But after decades of increasing interconnectedness and emerging transnational governance, today one sees new forms of emergency politics that are cross-border in range. From the European Union to the World Health Organization, from supranational institutions to state governments acting in concert, the logic of emergency is embraced in international contexts, with Covid-19 the latest occasion. This Forum offers an entry-point into this emerging phenomenon. Taking as its point of departure two recent books, it examines the origins, forms, effects and normative stakes of emergency politics beyond the state. Among the matters discussed are the concept of emergency politics, the historical context of its contemporary forms, the patterns of decision-making associated with it, the implications for the legitimacy of transnational institutions, and the constitutional and political ways in which it might be contained.

Rapid, sensitive, and accurate detection of lung tissue and cell changes is essential for the effective diagnosis and treatment of PF. Currently, the commonly-used high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) imaging has been challenging to distinguish early PF from other pathological processes in the lung structure. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using hyperpolarized gases is hampered by the higher cost to become a routine diagnostic tool. As a result, the development of new PF imaging technologies may be a promising solution. Here, we summarize and discuss recent advances in fluorescence imaging as a talented optical technique for the diagnosis and evaluation of PF, including collagen imaging, oxidative stress, inflammation, and PF-related biomarkers. The design strategies of the probes for fluorescence imaging (including multimodal imaging) of PF are briefly described, which can provide new ideas for the future PF-related imaging research.

The purpose of this research was to explore the challenges faced by microentrepreneurs during MCO and their coping strategies used to overcome these challenges. This study utilized the qualitative case study approach and collected interview data among the identified microentrepreneurs that met the criterion sampling. The findings uncover that these microentrepreneurs typically faced challenges related to restricted cash flows, lack of customers and supplies shortage issues which impacted their income and business operations during MCO. These challenges were addressed using coping strategies, namely having the ability to control stress, developing a strong spiritual relationship with God, applying problem solving thinking skills, utilizing social capital (offline and online), and optimizing digital marketing.

Demographic and clinical data, laboratory data, including ultrasound scans of the lower extremities, and outcome variables were obtained, comparisons were made between DVT and non-DVT groups. Results: Of the 143 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (aged 63  14 years; 74 [51.7%] man), 66 patients developed lower extremity DVT (46.1%, included 23 [34.8%] with proximal DVT and 43 [65.2%] with distal DVT).Compared with patients who with no DVT, patients with DVT were older and had a lower oxygenation index, a higher rate of cardiac injury, and worse prognosis including an increased proportion of deaths (23 [34.8%] vs 9 [11.7%], P = 0.001) and a decreased proportion of patients discharged (32 [48.5%] vs 60 [77.9%], P < 0.001).

If early pregnancy sequela in the current COVID-19 pandemic are modeled from the 2004 Coronavirus outbreak data, then SARS-CoV-2 infection proximate to blastocyst nidation is likely to cause implantation failure or spontaneous abortion. Our model explains why this outcome is less attributable to virus-associated maternal pulmonary distress and instead derives from systemic inflammation and interference with trophectoderm-endometrium molecular signaling required for implantation. COVID-19 is often accompanied by high levels of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha and other cytokines, a process implicated in pulmonary collapse and systemic organ failure. Yet when regarded in an early reproductive context, this \\"cytokine storm\\" of COVID-19 triggers a pro-coagulative state hostile to normal in utero blastocyst/fetal development.

This model classifies such lesions as permissive at term but catastrophic near embryo implantation or early first trimester pregnancy. Clinical experience with recurrent pregnancy loss offers workable interventions to address this challenge, but success will depend on prompt and accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.

METHODS Therefore, the disease surveillance was conducted in the area of Banten, West Java, Central Java, East Java, and Jakarta Province, Indonesia from 2014 to 2019. Subsequently, the genetic characterization of the H5N1 viruses was performed by sequencing all 8 segments of the viral genome. RESULTS As a result, the H5N1 viruses were detected in most of LBMs in both bird' cloacal and environmental samples, in which about 35% of all samples were positive for influenza A and, subsequently, about 52% of these samples were positive for H5 subtyping. Based on the genetic analyses of 14 viruses isolated from LBMs, genetic diversities of the H5N1 viruses were identified including clades 2.1.3 and 2.3.2 as typical predominant groups as well as reassortant viruses between these 2 clades. CONCLUSIONS As a consequence, zoonotic transmission to humans in the market could be occurred from the exposure of infected birds and/or contaminated environments.

DATA SYNTHESIS: To understand how inequities affect health, it is necessary to know the unequal distribution of their social determinants among population groups. In the case of children, the parental pathway of determinants is central. The non-equitable way in which many families or social groups live, determined by social and economic inequalities, produces unequal health outcomes, particularly for children. This is observed between and within countries. Children from the most vulnerable population groups consistently have worse health conditions. Interventions aimed at children's health must go beyond care and act in an integrated manner on poverty and on social and economic inequalities, aiming to end systematic and unfair differences.

This risk increased to 2.26 (95%IC 1.49;3.40) in 2020. The risk of stress was 1.90 (95%IC 1.42;2.55) in 2019 and 1.66 (95%IC1.34;2.07) in 2020. The sleep duration was not associated with mental health disorders in the adjusted analyses. CONCLUSION: The results provide important evidence that sleep quality can influence mental health of adults. The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have had a considerable impact on this association.","output":"Relationship between sleep duration and quality and mental health before and during COVID-19 pandemic: Results of population-based studies in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Document: Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019] pandemic, several of America's most essential nonprofits have closed their doors Food banks have been hit particularly hard, despite demand for meals and groceries being at an all-time high Volunteerism, food donations, and meal delivery have become increasingly difficult with people following safe social distancing guidelines Food banks' frontline workers are implementing strict new protocols, while trying to maintain a steady supply of food and delivery workers, inflating operating costs According to the New York City Mission Society, nearly one-third of food pantries nationally have closed since the outbreak of coronavirus [ ] While some philanthropists have announced generous gifts to combat the coronavirus pandemic, the majority of charities and nonprofits are still struggling Charitable giving has plummeted by nearly 75%, even as the need for nonprofit services is growing exponentially In a 2018 Nonprofit Finance Fund survey, 75% of nonprofits said they would run out of cash in less than six months without fundraising Most nonprofits operate with razor-thin margins, pouring everything into their mission as quickly as possible This pandemic is quickly depleting nonprofits' savings, making it difficult for these organizations to provide aid and services to the public In this paper, The New Center takes a look at one small tax change Congress could make in 2020 to provide an urgent cash infusion to nonprofits across America Nonprofit organizations;COVID-19 (Disease);Taxation--Law and legislation","output":"Centering on Coronavirus: One Small Tax Change Could Make a Big Difference for Struggling Nonprofits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate nursing students' understanding of the prevention of COVID-19, as well as their anxiety towards the disease and their perception of their professional identity in the wake of the pandemic, in Zhengzhou, China.

Various proinflammatory stimuli can promote thrombosis by inducing luminal endothelial expression of tissue factor (TF), which interacts with circulating coagulation factor VII to trigger extrinsic coagulation. The signalling mechanism whereby these stimuli evoke TF expression entails activation of NADPH oxidase, upstream from activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor that drives the induced transcription of the TF gene. When single-stranded RNA viruses are taken up into cellular endosomes, they stimulate endosomal formation and activation of NADPH oxidase complexes via RNA-responsive toll-like receptor 7. It is therefore proposed that SARS-CoV-2 infection of endothelial cells evokes the expression of TF which is contingent on endosomal NADPH oxidase activation. If this hypothesis is correct, hydroxychloroquine, spirulina (more specifically, its chromophore phycocyanobilin) and high-dose glycine may have practical potential for mitigating the elevated thrombotic risk associated with COVID-19.","output":"Thrombotic complications of COVID-19 may reflect an upregulation of endothelial tissue factor expression that is contingent on activation of endosomal NADPH oxidase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: The relative importance of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large firms is a recurrent topic in the small business economics literature This paper presents a real and financial social accounting matrix (FSAM) capable of distinguishing the direct and indirect effects that are transferred from micro-, small, medium, and large firms to the rest of the economy We use the hypothetical extraction method (HEM) to explore the sequence of reactions associated with shocks that arise from the COVID-19 lockdown Using a structural model for the Spanish economy, we identify the role of different firm size categories in the aggregate gross domestic product (GDP) Our results allow us to reconcile the mixed narrative that accompanies the evaluation of the role played by these categories in economic activity by revealing that both SMEs and large firms are important for supporting economic activity In particular, SMEs help explain 43% of the income and two-thirds of the unemployment decline caused by the COVID-19 pandemic Our findings also show the importance of conditioning SME industrial policy to sectoral analysis Plain English summary: The effects of the macroeconomic lockdown and its transmission to the rest of the economy differ by firm size and across sectors Using the Spanish context for micro-, small, medium, and large firms, we distinguish the direct and indirect effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic The main implications are the following: (1) Research: results emphasize that SMEs and large firms are both important to support economic activity but, in order to account for the relative effects on SMEs, it is crucial to consider the specific sector that receives the disruption 2) Policy: SMEs are an important focus of business support policies within the EU According to our estimations, disruptions in SMEs produce larger reductions in demand These results could support credit policies for SMEs with a strong impact on the aggregate economy due to their greater productive and financial linkages with the domestic economy ?

STUDY DESIGN: A suitcase laboratory Diagnostics-in-a-Suitcase (56 cm  45.5 cm  26.5 cm) containing all reagents and devices necessary for performing a reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay was developed. As an example, two RT-RPA assays were established for the detection of hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) genes of the novel avian influenza (H7N9) virus. RESULTS: The sensitivities of the H7 and the N9 RT-RPA assays were 10 and 100 RNA molecules, respectively. The assays were performed at a single temperature (42 C). The results were obtained within 2C7 min. The H7N9 RT-RPA assays did not show a cross-detection either of any other respiratory viruses affecting humans and/or birds or of the human or chicken genomes. All reagents were used, stored, and transported at ambient temperature, that is, cold chain independent. In addition, the Diagnostics-in-a-Suitcase was operated by a solar-powered battery.

Incidence rates of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke, all with concurrent thrombocytopenia, were estimated among the general population of persons in a database between 2017 and 2019. A range of additional potential adverse events of special interest for COVID\\\\19 vaccinations were also studied in a similar manner. FINDINGS: A total of 38 611 617 individuals were included. Background rates ranged from 1.0 (95% CI: 0.7C1.4) to 8.5 (7.4C9.9) per 100 000 person\\\\years for DVT with thrombocytopenia, from 0.5 (0.3C0.6) to 20.8 (18.9C22.8) for PE with thrombocytopenia, from 0.1 (0.0C0.1) to 2.5 (2.2C2.7) for SVT with thrombocytopenia, and from 1.0 (0.8C1.2) to 43.4 (40.7C46.3) for myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke with thrombocytopenia.

Various health disciplines including physical therapists are still exploring the best way to manage this new disease. The role and involvement of physical therapists in the management of COVID-19 are not yet well defined and are limited in many hospitals. This article reports a physical therapy service specially commissioned by the Health Commission of Sichuan Province to manage COVID-19 during patients stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) at the Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu in China. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were classified into 4 categories under a directive from the National Health Commission of the Peoples Republic of China. Patients in the severe and critical categories were admitted to the ICU irrespective whether mechanical ventilation was required. Between January 31, 2020, and March 8, 2020, a cohort of 16 patients was admitted to the ICU at the Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu. The median (minimum to maximum) hospital and ICU stays for these patients were 27 (11C46) and 15 (6C38) days, respectively. Medical management included antiviral, immunoregulation and supportive treatment of associated comorbidities. Physical therapist interventions included body positioning, airway clearance techniques, oscillatory positive end-expiratory pressure, inspiratory muscle training, and mobility exercises. All patients had at least 1 comorbidity. Three of the 16 patients required mechanical ventilation and were excluded for outcome measures that required understanding of verbal instructions. In the remaining 13 patients, respiratory outcomesincluding the Borg Dyspnea Scale, peak expiratory flow rate, Pao(2)/Fio(2) ratio, maximal inspiratory pressure, strength outcomes, Medical Research Council Sum Score, and functional outcomes (including the Physical Function in Intensive Care Test score, De Morton Mobility Index, and Modified Barthel Index)were measured on the first day the patient received the physical therapist intervention and at discharge. RESULTS: At discharge from the ICU, while most outcome measures were near normal for the majority of the patients, 61% and 31% of these patients had peak expiratory flow rate and maximal inspiratory pressure below 80% of the predicted value and 46% had De Morton Mobility Index values below the normative value. CONCLUSION: The respiratory and physical functions of some patients remained poor at ICU discharge, suggesting that long-term rehabilitation may be required for these patients. IMPACT: Our experience in the management of patients with COVID-19 has revealed that physical therapist intervention is safe and appears to be associated with an improvement in respiratory and physical function in patients with COVID-19 in the ICU.","output":"Physical Therapist Management of COVID-19 in the Intensive Care Unit: The West China Hospital Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) is used for real-time evaluation of neuronal tracts and reflexes in the anesthetized patient, when a neurologic exam is not possible.

Transcranial visual evoked potentials are not reliable for evaluating the integrity of the prechiasmatic visual system. Electroretinography (ERG) has been used in animal models for monitoring retinal ischemia and can be used in humans as well to monitor for prechiasmatic ischemia of the retinae and optic nerves.

In this prospective study, we compare the gastric capacity evaluated with barium sulfate or computer-aided tomography (CAT) scan early and 24 months after operation compared to the changes in body weight and BMI reduction in a small group of 15 consecutive patients submitted to sleeve gastrectomy. METHODS Fifteen successive obese patients submitted to laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy were included. They were studied in order to measure the residual gastric capacity with barium sulfate and CAT scan early (3 days) and late (2 years) after surgery. RESULTS The early postoperative gastric volume was 108 +/- 25 ml (80-120 ml) and 116.2 +/- 78.24 assessed with barium sulfate and CAT scan, respectively. The gastric capacity at the late control increased to 250 +/- 85 and 254 +/- 56.8 assessed with the same techniques. However, patients remained stable with a BMI close to 25 without regain of weight at least at the time of observation.

Quercetin was quantified as the best among the three drugs, suited for repurposing with DV of -70.19, followed by NAC with DV of -39.99 and 2-DG with DV of -13.71. The drugs were also assessed for their safety and efficacy balance (in terms of therapeutic index) using network properties. It was found that quercetin was a forerunner than other two drugs.","output":"A Network-Biology led Computational Drug repurposing Strategy to prioritize therapeutic options for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The combination of the COVID-19 crisis and the Black Lives Matter movement has thrown a spotlight on racial inequalities in the NHS Here BME nurse Julie Roye discusses the extent of the problem and the steps necessary to affect lasting change","output":"Are we doing enough for our BME workforce in nursing?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current theories of influenza viral epidemiology have not explained the persistence, seasonality, and explosive outbreaks of virus over large geographic areas.

However, there are no data on sex-specific differences in ACE2 expression. If there is a sex difference in the expression of ACE2 in the lung, this could theoretically explain the gender disparity in COVID-19 disease.

BPA can contaminate food, beverage, air, and soil. It accumulates in several human tissues and organs and is potentially harmful to human health through different molecular mechanisms. Due to its hormone-like properties, BPA may bind to estrogen receptors, thereby affecting both body weight and tumorigenesis. BPA may also affect metabolism and cancer progression, by interacting with GPR30, and may impair male reproductive function, by binding to androgen receptors. Several transcription factors, including PPAR?3, C/EBP, Nrf2, HOX, and HAND2, are involved in BPA action on fat and liver homeostasis, the cardiovascular system, and cancer. Finally, epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, histones modification, and changes in microRNAs expression contribute to BPA pathological effects.

New Zealand had a rapid and effective lockdown that meant the virtual elimination of community transmission. METHOD: Twenty-seven semi-structured interviews were undertaken with low-income people in June-July 2020 immediately after lockdown was lifted. RESULTS: Life during lockdown was challenging for study participants. They were fearful of the virus and experienced mental distress and isolation. Most participants felt safe at home and reported coping financially while still experiencing financial stress. Participants were resourceful and resilient. They coped with lockdown by using technology, self-help techniques and support from others. New Zealand's welfare state ensured participants had access to health services and welfare payments, but there were challenges. Welfare payments did not fully meet participants' needs, and support from charitable organisations was critical. Participants were overwhelmingly positive about the Government's response and advised the Government to take the same approach in the future. This is a particularly reassuring finding from some of the most vulnerable New Zealanders. CONCLUSIONS: An early and hard lockdown, the welfare state, compassion and clearly communicated leadership were keys to a successful lockdown for the low-income people in this study.

We estimate the sensitivity of the network to transient gravitational-wave signals for the third (O3), fourth (O4) and fifth observing (O5) runs, including the planned upgrades of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. We study the capability of the network to determine the sky location of the source for gravitational-wave signals from the inspiral of binary systems of compact objects, that is binary neutron star, neutron starCblack hole, and binary black hole systems. The ability to localize the sources is given as a sky-area probability, luminosity distance, and comoving volume. The median sky localization area (90% credible region) is expected to be a few hundreds of square degrees for all types of binary systems during O3 with the Advanced LIGO and Virgo (HLV) network. The median sky localization area will improve to a few tens of square degrees during O4 with the Advanced LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (HLVK) network. During O3, the median localization volume (90% credible region) is expected to be on the order of [Formula: see text] for binary neutron star, neutron starCblack hole, and binary black hole systems, respectively.

The aim of this short report was to assess the attitudes toward pulmonary rehabilitation following COVID-19 among Ecuadorian physicians. A cross-sectional study was conducted, in which a 5-question survey was used to assess the level of agreement to specific statements with a 5-point Likert scale. Out of the 282 participants, 48.2% (n=136) were male, with a mean of 12.6 (SD=11.3) years of experience. More than half of physicians (63.8%, n=180; (2)(2) = 139.224, p=0.000) considered that diagnosis and treatment of patients with sub-acute and chronic COVID-19 pulmonary sequelae is not clear. Additionally, 94.3% (n=266; (2)(2) = 497.331, p=0.000) agreed that pulmonary rehabilitation must be considered as a relevant strategy in long-term care following an acute infection, with 92.6% (n=261; (2)(2) = 449.772, p=0.000) stating it will improve the likelihood of survival and return to baseline health. In conclusion, we found that considerable majority of physicians held positive attitudes to the role of pulmonary rehabilitation and considered it as a relevant strategy in long-term care following COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES: To study the best approach for the diagnosis of human metapneumovirus infections by both conventional and molecular methods, along with the human metapneumovirus circulation rate in northern Italy and the severity of human metapneumovirus respiratory infections in a pediatric patient population. STUDY DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were taken from 306 pediatric patients during the winterCspring season 2003C2004, and examined for conventional respiratory viruses by direct fluorescent staining and cell culture, while human coronavirus and human metapneumovirus were sought by RT-PCR. RESULTS: RT-PCR detected human metapneumovirus in 40/306 (13.1%) children positive for respiratory viruses, with an incidence intermediate between that of respiratory syncytial virus (58 patients, 18.9%) and that of influenzavirus infections (29 patients, 9.5%). Phylogenetic analysis showed cocirculation of both human metapneumovirus types (A and B) as well as their relevant subtypes (A1CA2 and B1CB2). Clinically, human metapneumovirus was found to be second to human respiratory syncytial virus alone, as a cause of respiratory tract infections, while duration of virus excretion appeared to correlate with severity of infection, and virus load in NPA with the stage of respiratory infection. CONCLUSION: (i) Human metapneumovirus is a major viral pathogen in the Italian pediatric patient population; (ii) the severity of lower respiratory tract infections approaches that of human respiratory syncytial virus; (iii) there are preliminary indications that the duration of virus excretion may reach 2C3 weeks and that the level of viral load in NPA correlates with the clinical stage of human metapneumovirus infection.","output":"Detection and pathogenicity of human metapneumovirus respiratory infection in pediatric Italian patients during a winterCspring season"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung ultrasound (LUS) plays a critical role in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

METHODS: We studied high TIL treatments (metabolic suppression, hypothermia (< 35 C), intensive hyperventilation (PaCO(2) < 4 kPa), and secondary decompressive craniectomy) in patients receiving ICP monitoring in the ICU stratum of the CENTER-TBI study. A random effect logistic regression model was used to determine between-centre variation in their use. A propensity score-matched model was used to study the impact on outcome (6-months Glasgow Outcome Score-extended (GOSE)), whilst adjusting for case-mix severity, signs of brain herniation on imaging, and ICP. RESULTS: 313 of 758 patients from 52 European centres (41%) received at least one high TIL treatment with significant variation between centres (median odds ratio = 2.26). Patients often transiently received high TIL therapies without escalation from lower tier treatments. 38% of patients with high TIL treatment had favourable outcomes (GOSE  5). The use of high TIL treatment was not significantly associated with worse outcome (285 matched pairs, OR 1.4, 95% CI [1.0C2.0]). However, a sensitivity analysis excluding high TIL treatments at day 1 or use of metabolic suppression at any day did reveal a statistically significant association with worse outcome. CONCLUSION: Substantial between-centre variation in use of high TIL treatments for TBI was found and treatment escalation to higher TIL treatments were often not preceded by more conventional lower TIL treatments. The significant association between high TIL treatments after day 1 and worse outcomes may reflect aggressive use or unmeasured confounders or inappropriate escalation strategies. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Substantial variation was found in the use of highly intensive ICP-lowering treatments across European ICUs and a stepwise escalation strategy from lower to higher intensity level therapy is often lacking. Further research is necessary to study the impact of high therapy intensity treatments.

We examine the impact of COVID-19 on a single, large-volume heart transplant program. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed examining all adult heart transplants performed at a single institution between March 2020 and June 2020. This was compared to the same time frame in 2019. We examined incidence of primary graft dysfunction, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and 30-day survival. RESULTS: From March to June 2020, 43 orthotopic heart transplants were performed compared to 31 performed during 2019. Donor and recipient demographics demonstrated no differences. There was no difference in 30-day survival. There was a statistically significant difference in incidence of postoperative CRRT (9/31 vs. 3/43; p = .01).

CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that a single, large-volume transplant program was able to grow volume with little difference in donor variables and clinical outcomes following transplant. While multiple reasons are possible, most likely the reduction of volume at other programs allowed us to utilize organs to which we would not have previously had access.

However, it is not easy to make significant changes in a city while building a transportation system, and the transit-guided urban development expected by the TOD concept has not been completely realized. The transformation of nearby areas with the guidance of transit is also becoming the choice of many Chinese cities, especially for cities that have only had subways for a few years. Unlike other international metropolitan cities, with metro systems of considerable scale, the modernization process of most of the small and medium-sized cities in China is being carried out simultaneously with metro-based public transportation guidance. For cities which are still in their initial stage of the backbone public transportation system, there is not enough previous experience and evidence to support the suitability of TOD typological analysis based on the node-place model. More research based on the node-place model has also shown practical applications of the TOD in developed cities. However, there are very few studies that analyse cities in which rail transit and urban development are both in a period of rapid growth. The goal of this research is to identify which metro stations in these cities are suitable for TOD improvement and optimization. This article attempts to expand the willingness of residents on the basis of the traditional node-place model as one of the judgment indicators for evaluating whether existing stations and surrounding areas are suitable for TOD improvement. At the same time, traditional statistical analysis is combined with GIS and machine learning technology. Using this method, we propose the TOD improvement-oriented station area classification and identification method based on TOD typology theory. The results show that Ningbo's subway stations can be divided into four categories according to the suitability for TOD improvement, and we selected seven stations suitable for TOD improvement according to the characteristics of the node-place model.

METHODS Prospective observational study in 18 multiple trauma patients with head injury admitted to Neurocritical Care Unit of Hospital Sao Joao in Porto. Multimodal systemic and brain monitoring of primary variables [heart rate, arterial blood pressure, ICP, CPP, pulse amplitude, end tidal CO?, brain temperature, brain tissue oxygenation pressure, cerebral oximetry (CO) with transcutaneous near-infrared spectroscopy and cerebral blood flow (CBF)] and secondary variables related to cerebral compensatory reserve and cerebrovascular reactivity were supported by dedicated software ICM+ ( www.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk/icmplus) . The compiled data were analyzed in patients who developed plateau waves. RESULTS In this study we identified 59 plateau waves that occurred in 44% of the patients (8/18). During plateau waves CBF, cerebrovascular resistance, CO, and brain tissue oxygenation decreased. The duration and magnitude of plateau waves were greater in patients with working cerebrovascular reactivity. After the end of plateau wave, a hyperemic response was recorded in 64% of cases with increase in CBF and brain oxygenation.

These responses include strengthening access to community-based nutrition services that support the early detection and treatment of undernourished children and emergency food distribution, including fortified foods with vitamins and minerals, to vulnerable households, particularly those with children under 5 years. Moreover, counseling and promotion programmes should be reinforced to revitalise community nutrition education in areas such as gestation, exclusive breast-feeding and complementary feeding, and hygienic practices involving handwashing, proper sanitation and other basic behavioural changes. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many countries especially those in the regions of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa in which there has been an ongoing burden of child undernutrition. However, malnutrition is preventable and can be eliminated through a multisectoral strategic approach. The effective execution of a multisectoral approach towards preventing childhood malnutrition will require not only a financial investment but also the collective efforts from different ministries of the governments, UN-affiliated agencies and non-governmental organisations.","output":"The risk to child nutrition during and after COVID-19 pandemic: what to expect and how to respond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 lockdown in Wuhan, transportation, industrial production and other human activities declined significantly, as did the NO2 concentration. In order to assess the relative contributions of different factors to reductions in air pollutants, we implemented sensitivity experiments by Random Forest (RF) models, with the comparison of the contributions of meteorological conditions, human mobility, and emissions from industry and households between different periods. In addition, we conducted scenario analyses to suggest an appropriate limit for control of human mobility. Different mechanisms for air pollutants were shown in the pre-pandemic, pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-pandemic periods. Wind speed and the Within-city Migration index, representing intra-city mobility intensity, were excluded from stepwise multiple linear models in the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods. The results of sensitivity experiments show that, in the COVID-19 lockdown period, 73.3% of the reduction can be attributed to decreased human mobility. In the post-pandemic period, meteorological conditions control about 42.2% of the decrease, and emissions from industry and households control 40.0%, while human mobility only contributes 17.8%. The results of the scenario analysis suggest that the priority of restriction should be given to human mobility within the city than other kinds of human mobility. The reduction in the NO2 concentration tends to be smaller when human mobility within the city decreases by more than 70%. A limit of less than 40% on the control of the human mobility can achieve a better effect, especially in cities with severe traffic pollution.","output":"Analyzing the Contribution of Human Mobility to Changes in Air Pollutants: Insights from the COVID-19 Lockdown in Wuhan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the initial surge in cases of coronavirus (COVID-19), the outbreak has been managed differently in different countries. In the USA, it has been managed in many different ways between states, cities and even counties. This disparity is slowly becoming more and more pronounced with the advent of antibody testing. Although many argue over the potential merits of antibody testing as an immunity passport to allow the economy to restart, there are other implications that stand at the heart of the bioethical debate that are often overlooked. Particularly with COVID-19, there are many uncertainties and the discourse alone of antibodies presumes misinformation that may outweigh the epidemiological benefits of antibody testing.

Here, we report that the pyroptosis execution protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a new binding partner of ASFV-encoded protein S273R (pS273R), which belongs to the SUMO-1 cysteine protease family. Further experiments demonstrated that ASFV pS273R-cleaved swine GSDMD in a manner dependent on its protease activity. ASFV pS273R specifically cleaved GSDMD at G107-A108 to produce a shorter N-terminal fragment of GSDMD consisting of residues 1 to 107 (GSDMD-N(1C107)). Interestingly, unlike the effect of GSDMD-N(1C279) fragment produced by caspase-1-mediated cleavage, the assay of LDH release, cell viability, and virus replication showed that GSDMD-N(1C107) did not trigger pyroptosis or inhibit ASFV replication.

Three ports were used: one 12 mm at the umbilicus for the camera, one 12 mm placed 5 cm above and to the right of the umbilicus and one 5 mm port to the left. A Ligasure? 5 mm (Covidien?) was used to take down the falciform ligament initially staying close to the abdominal wall and then stopping at the bifurcation of the two layers of peritoneum. The triangular ligament was incised to create a window between diaphragm and liver. Unlike open surgery the entire ligament was not mobilised at this stage. A line was scored on the left of the falciform ligament. Transection of the parenchyma was achieved with Ligasure?. Once the liver parenchyma was thinned, an endostapler - EndoGIA? Gold (Covidien?) - was be used to complete the transection. It was also possible to dissect out individual vessels and ligate with Hem-o-lok? (Teleflex?) clips in one case. The cut surface was examined for bleeding or bile leaks. A small pencil drain was placed. RESULTS Three patients had laparoscopic resections. All were female. Two cases were haemangioma with one diagnosed preoperatively and the other not having typical features on imaging. The third case was a large adenoma in a patient with hepatic adenomatosis.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study conducted between May 18 and June 26, 2020, during which HCWs at a large inner-city teaching hospital in NYC received voluntary antibody testing. The main outcome was presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies indicating previous infection. Seroprevalence and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for seropositivity by type and location of work were calculated using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of 2,749 HCWs tested, 831 tested positive, yielding a crude seroprevalence of 30.2% (95% CI, 29%-32%). Seroprevalence ranged from 11.1% for pharmacy staff to 44.0% for nonclinical HCWs comprised of patient transporters and housekeeping and security staff, with 37.5% for nurses and 20.9% for administrative staff. Compared to administrative staff, aORs (95% CIs) for seropositivity were 2.54 (1.64-3.94) for nurses; 2.51 (1.42-4.43) for nonclinical HCWs; between 1.70 and 1.83 for allied HCWs such as patient care technicians, social workers, registration clerks and therapists; and 0.80 (0.50-1.29) for physicians. Compared to office locations, aORs for the emergency department and inpatient units were 2.27 (1.53-3.37) and 1.48 (1.14-1.92), respectively. CONCLUSION: One-third of hospital-based HCWs were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 by the end of the first wave in NYC.

Virtual healthcare was rapidly implemented but much is unknown about the quality of care provided in telehealth visits. We sought to describe changes in visits throughout the pandemic and evaluate the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing. METHODS: We utilized EHR data from a large health care system that provides primary care via pediatric, family medicine, and urgent care clinics. We included outpatient visits from 1/1/19 - 4/30/21 for children < 20 years. The COVID-19 era was defined as after March 2020. Visits were labeled as virtual according to coded encounter or visit type variables. The appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions was assigned using a previously published ICD-10 classification scheme that defines each prescription as appropriate, potentially appropriate, or inappropriate (Chua, et al. BMJ, 2019). RESULTS: There were 805,130 outpatient visits during the study period. The mean rate of antibiotic prescriptions in the pre-pandemic period was 23% (range 17-26% per month) and 11% (range 9-15%) in the COVID-19 era. Mean rates of inappropriate prescribing were 17% (range 14-20% per month) and 20% (range 19-22%), respectively (Figure 1). Coded virtual visits during the COVID-19 era were uncommon (1-2%) with the exception of April and May 2020 (11% and 5%, respectively). During the COVID-19 era, approximately 9% of telehealth visits resulted in antibiotics, compared to 11% of in-person visits (Table 1). Virtual visits had lower rates of inappropriate and appropriate prescribing, but higher rates of potentially appropriate prescribing (Table 1). Visits and associated antibiotic prescribing in the pre-pandemic and COVID-19 era [Image: see text] Appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing in the COVID-19 era, by visit type [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Rates and volume of antibiotic prescribing in outpatient pediatric visits have declined in the COVID-19 era, while rates of inappropriate prescribing have increased slightly. Our study suggests use of telehealth for pediatric visits was minimal and led to higher prescribing rates for potentially appropriate indications. This could be explained by a lack of clinical certainty in conditions such as otitis media and pharyngitis in virtual visits. DISCLOSURES: Bethany A.

Methods/Principle Findings: The review included studies published in English, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish. Records were identified through systematic literature searches in six databases. Results are summarized narratively and using meta-analytic strategies. We found studies only for the 1918 and 2009 pandemics. Of 14 studies on the 2009 pandemic including data on both medical and social risk factors, after controlling for medical risk factors 8 demonstrated independent impact of SES. A random effect analysis of 46 estimates from 35 studies found a pooled mean odds ratio of 1.4 (95% CI: 1.2-1.7), comparing the lowest to the highest SES, but with substantial effect heterogeneity across studies, reflecting differences in outcome measures and definitions of case and control samples. Analyses by pandemic period (1918 or 2009) and by level of SES measure (individual or ecological) indicate no differences along these dimensions. Studies using healthy controls tend to find low SES associated with worse influenza outcome, and studies using infected controls find low SES associated with more severe outcomes. Studies comparing severe outcomes (ICU or death) to hospital admissions are few but indicate no clear association. Studies with more unusual comparisons (e.g., pandemic vs seasonal influenza, seasonal influenza vs other patient groups) report no or negative associations. Conclusions/Significance: Results show that social risk factors help to explain pandemic outcomes in 1918 and in 2009 although the mechanisms and types of social vulnerabilities leading to disparities in outcomes may differ over time. Studies of the 2009 pandemic also showed that social vulnerability could not always be explained by medical risk factors.

Since the ongoing climate warming is known to alter nutritional environments encountered by ectotherms, a precise understanding of the integrated effects of these two factors on ectotherm performance is essential for improving the accuracy of predictions regarding how ectotherms will respond to climate warming. Here we employed response surface methodology to examine how multiple life-history traits were expressed across a grid of environmental conditions representing full combinations of six ambient temperatures (13, 18, 23, 28, 31, 33 C) and eight dietary protein:carbohydrate ratios (P:C = 1:16, 1:8, 1:4, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 8:1) in Drosophila melanogaster. Different life-history traits were maximized in different regions in the two-dimensional temperature-nutrient space. The optimal temperature and P:C ratio identified for adult lifespan (13 C and 1:16) were lower than those for early-life female fecundity (28 C and 4:1). Similar divergence in thermal and nutritional optima was found between body mass at adult emergence (18 C and P:C 1:1) and the rate of pre-adult development (28 C and P:C 4:1). Pre-adult survival was maximized over a broad range of temperature (18-28 C) and P:C ratio (1:8-8:1).

These multiple operationalizations have augmented confusion and decision-makers are not sure which one to rely on for optimal results. Additionally, due to its evolutionary nature, research has not kept up with the pace to substantiate this evolution empirically, leaving a void for researchers to proceed for a quantitative investigation to extend its boundaries. The present research takes up this challenge and provides an empirical evidence to prove its progression. As IM is multi-faceted in nature, this research chips in two brand new dimensions, informational justice and developmental opportunities, to the IM mix, while a third dimension that has only once been studied in connection with an IM work, is also enfolded. To this end, a top-down high order confirmatory factor analysis was done to identify the underlying structure of IM dimensions. Findings of the study revealed that the hypothesized five dimensions of IM are confirmed dimensions of IM concept. This empirical stamp will embolden researchers to devise measurement scales preferably sensitive to its growing character, and capitalize on its prowess to adapt to the novelties and peculiarities of a specific industry.

In the U.S., RSV hospitalizations are well characterized; yet, emergency department (ED) and outpatient (OP) visits are underrecognized. We evaluated the burden of RSV across three distinct healthcare settings during one respiratory season. METHODS: From 12/16/19-4/30/20, we conducted a prospective RSV surveillance study among Davidson County, TN infants under one year who presented to an inpatient (IP), ED, or one of four OP clinics with either fever or any upper respiratory (i.e., cough, earache, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat) and/or lower respiratory [i.e., wheezing, crackles, rales, diminished breath sounds, shortness of breath (SOB)] symptoms. Demographic and illness history were collected during parental/guardian interviews, followed by medical chart abstraction. Nasal swabs were collected and tested for RSV using Luminex? NxTAG RPP. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on 3/16/20 enrollment at three of the four OP clinics ceased. RESULTS: A total of 627 infants were screened, of whom 473 (75%) were confirmed eligible, 364 (77%) enrolled, 361 (99%) were tested for RSV of which 101 (28%) were RSV+ (IP=37, ED=18, OP=46) (Figure 1). Compared to RSV-negative subjects, RSV+ subjects were younger (6.6 vs. 4.9 months, p< 0.001), 56% were male and 48% white. By setting, infants in the OP setting were older than those seen in the IP and ED [(p=0.002), Figure 2]. Compared to infants in the OP setting, hospitalized infants were more likely to present with SOB and rhonchi/rales, but less likely to have only upper respiratory symptoms (Figure 3) and be African American (p=0.046). Infants in the IP setting had a higher proportion of clinical RSV diagnostic testing (73%) compared to the ED (39%) and OP (28%) settings (p< 0.001). Figure 1.

Proportion of Davidson County Infants with RSV Showing each Clinical Symptom, by Healthcare Setting [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Two-thirds of RSV+ infants sought care from either an OP or ED setting, with nearly all hospitalized infants presenting with both upper and lower respiratory symptoms. The underutilization of diagnostic testing in the OP settings may underestimate the true burden of RSV.

It appeared that some higher educational institutions and a certain part of their students were almost ready to go online as these institutions had been developing their online platforms thus integrating traditional face-to-face classes with computer-assisted learning as well as integrating massive open or shared online courses into their curricular. At the same time, many other universities and institutes proved to be absolutely unprepared to shift online as they and their students had neither their own educational environment and online resources developed by their teaching staff nor any experience of working in an external online environment and choosing courses appropriate for their educational purposes. It turned out that most existing online courses could not be successfully used for implementing into most universities curricula and for teaching a majority of technical students as they simply reproduced the traditional classroom learning process and missed all advantages and opportunities afforded by online learning environments. The authors objective for this research in progress is to identify the key features and describe structure, content and assessment specifics of an academical online course for technical students. This paper provides tips on how to organize the course content into a proper structure stressing what types of teaching materials could be uploaded to the educational platform and goes into its assessment specifics.

Regionalization of critical care is a possible solution; regionalization has been implemented for trauma and neonatal intensive care, and it is under active discussion for medical and cardiac critical care. However, regionalization is only one possible approach to reorganizing critical care services. This commentary introduces the technique of network analysis as a framework for the following: (1) understanding how critically ill patients move between hospitals, (2) defining the roles hospitals play in regional care delivery, and (3) suggesting systematic improvements that may benefit population health. We examined transfers of critically ill Medicare patients in Connecticut in 2005 as a model system. We found that patients are systematically transferred to more capable hospitals. However, we find the standard distinction of hospitals into either secondary hospitals or tertiary hospitals poorly explains observed transfer patterns; instead, hospitals show a continuum of roles. We further examine the implications of the network pattern in a simulation of quarantine of a hospital to incoming transfers, as occurred during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic. Network perspectives offer new ways to study systems to care for critically ill patients and provide additional tools for addressing pragmatic problems in triage and bed management, regionalization, quality improvement, and disaster preparedness.","output":"Uncharted Paths*: Hospital Networks in Critical Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding short, single-stranded RNA molecules that may serve as biomarkers for various inflammatory and molecular mechanisms underlying bone and tissue remodeling consequent to orthodontic force application. METHODS: A thorough literature search in major databases was conducted in March 2021 to generate evidence for miRNAs in orthodontics, with prior PROSPERO registration. The initial search revealed 920 articles, subjected to strict selection criteria according to PRISMA, and resulted in final inclusion of four studies. Quality assessment by QUADAS-2 classified three studies as unclear risk-of-bias while the applicability was high. Further, bioinformatic analysis was performed to identify the target genes from the miRNA database (miRDB) and TargetScan databases and their protein-protein interaction pathways with the STRING analysis. RESULTS: Multiple miRNAs in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) of orthodontic patients were seen, including miRNA-21, 27(a/b), 29(a/b/c), 34,146(a/b), 101, and 214 along with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 14 in one study. A statistically significant increase in expression of miRNA-29a/b/c,101, 21 from pre-treatment (before initiation of retraction) was seen to reach a peak at 4C6 weeks (wk) of retraction. On the contrary, miRNA-34a showed downregulation from the 1 day to 4 wk of retraction and also, negatively correlated with MMPs-2,9,14 levels at the same observation times. The distance of canine movement showed mild correlation with miRNA-27a/b, 214 at 2 wk of retraction. Bioinformatics revealed 1213 mutual target genes which were analyzed for inter-relational pathways using Cytoscape plugin, MCODE. Further, 894 prominent protein interactions were identified from the STRING database and SMAD4, IGF1, ADAMTS6, COL4A1, COL1A1, COL3A1, FGFR1, COL19A1, FBN1, COL5A1, MGAT4A, LTBP1, MSR1, COL11A1, and COL5A3 were recognized as the hub genes. Their interactions were able to isolate multiple miRNAs: hsa-miR-34a-5p, hsa-miR-29b-2-5p, hsa-miR-29b-3p, hsa-miR-34a-3p, hsa-miR-27a-5p, hsa-miR-29a-5p, hsa-miR-29b-1-5p, hsa-miR-29c-3p, hsa-miR-214-5p, hsa-miR-27a-3p, hsa-miR-29a-3p, hsamiR-146-5p, which were found promising as biomarkers for tooth movement. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support using miRNAs as biomarkers in varied orthodontic study designs and for inter-relationships with pathological settings like periodontal disease, pre-malignancies, or conditions like obesity or metabolic irregularities, etc. The identified target genes and their protein interaction pathways can be used to propose precision therapies, focusing on ideal tooth movement with minimal iatrogenic side-effects.

The evolutionary burst of species diversity and the struggle for existence, as proposed by Darwin, generated a complex host defense system. Host survival during infection in vital organs, such as the lung, requires a delicate balance between host defense, which is essential for the detection and elimination of pathogens and host tolerance, which is critical for minimizing collateral tissue damage. Whereas the cellular and molecular mechanisms of host defense against many invading pathogens have been extensively studied, our understanding of host tolerance as a key mechanism in maintaining host fitness is extremely limited. This may also explain why current therapeutic and preventive approaches targeting only host defense mechanisms have failed to provide full protection against severe infectious diseases, including pulmonary influenza virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections.

The methodologies were focused on image interpretation, virtual fieldwork, and accuracy assessment. The preprocessing of remote sensing images included a radiometric correction and image sharpening. Radiometric correction was implemented to convert the original image value to the Bottom of Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance value. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, fieldwork could not be conducted, hence we replaced it using virtual fieldwork in order to classify objects on Landsat satellite imagery manually. After the virtual fieldwork, we analyzed the direction and the area of pyroclastic deposits in order to produce a map of pyroclastic deposits of Merapi Volcano. The result indicates that the pyroclastic deposits of the Merapi Volcano in 2011 were spread to the southeast, west and north. While in 2020, the deposits were directed to the west.

However, these exhibit substantial cytotoxicity. As this cytotoxicity may be attributed to 5'-phosphorylation, we designed and synthesized one-carbon homologated 6'-fluorinated-aristeromycin analogues. This modification prevents 5'-phosphorlyation by cellular kinases, whereas the inhibitory activity towards S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) hydrolase will be retained. The enantiomerically pure 6'-fluorinated-5'-homoaristeromycin analogues 3a-e were synthesized via the electrophilic fluorination of the silyl enol ether with Selectfluor, using a base-build up approach as the key steps. All synthesized compounds exhibited potent inhibitory activity towards SAH hydrolase, among which 6'-?-fluoroadenosine analogue 3a was the most potent (IC50 = 0.36 M). Among the compounds tested, 6'-?-fluoro-homoaristeromycin 3a showed potent antiviral activity (EC50 = 0.12 M) against the CHIKV, without noticeable cytotoxicity up to 250 M. Only 3a displayed anti-CHIKV activity, whereas both3a and 3b inhibited SAH hydrolase with similar IC50 values (0.36 and 0.37 M, respectively), which suggested that 3a's antiviral activity did not merely depend on the inhibition of SAH hydrolase. This is further supported by the fact that the antiviral effect was specific for CHIKV and some other alphaviruses and none of the homologated analogues inhibited other RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and ZIKV.

To evaluate the preventive effectiveness of the use of a drug containing recombinant interferon alfa-2b (IFN-a2b) and an antioxidant complex in pregnant women during their stay in the family focus of a new coronavirus infection. Materials and methods. 75 pregnant women were under observation, in whose family there were patients infected with the virus that causes a new coronavirus infection. Treatment of sick relatives was carried out at home, as the disease in them proceeded in an uncomplicated form. The main group was formed by 37 pregnant women who treated the nasal mucosa with a preparation containing recombinant IFN-a2b in the amount of 5000 IU and an antioxidant complex (alpha-tocopherol acetate, citric and benzoic acids). The comparison group was formed by 38 pregnant women who did not use any drugs for prophylactic purposes. All patients observed generally accepted rules of personal hygiene and behavior. The duration of prophylactic use of the indicated medicinal product depended on obtaining a negative result for the causative agent of a new coronavirus disease, an infected family member. A smear from the nasopharynx and oropharynx was examined to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA by PCR once every 5-7 days. Results. COVID-19 vaccination did not exclude infection with the SARS-CoV-2. Preventive treatment of the nasal mucosa with an IFN-a2b containing drug reduced the risk of infection with this viral agent in vaccinated patients who were in household contact with a patient with COVID-19 by 6 times. Asymptomatic and mild course of a new coronavirus infection was observed in 3 (25%) and 7 (58.3%) patients of 12 infected women from the main group and in 8 (22.9%) and 18 (51.4%) patients of 35 infected women from the comparison group, respectively.

In the present study, novel haptens of zearalenone with longer linkers and with alternative tethering sites have been designed for immunizing and assay conjugate preparation. All of these molecules were purified and spectroscopically verified, and a structure-activity relationship evaluation was carried out. This approach revealed that the hapten with the linker at the carbonyl group generated antibodies with a higher affinity than the hapten functionalized at the phenyl moiety. Antibodies produced with the latter hapten, on the other hand, showed lower cross-reactivity values to the major zearalenone metabolites. Finally, similar immunoassay sensitivity was achieved with all of the antibodies when heterologous haptens were employed.

Nowadays, in light of the dramatic rise in the number of IoT devices, several problems have been raised in cloud architectures. By introducing fog computing as a mediate layer between the user devices and the cloud, one can extend cloud computing's processing and storage capability. Offloading can be utilized as a mechanism that transfers computations, data, and energy consumption from the resource-limited user devices to resource-rich fog/cloud layers to achieve an optimal experience in the quality of applications and improve the system performance. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive study to evaluate fog offloading mechanisms' current and recent works. Each selected paper's pros and cons are explored and analyzed to state and address the present potentialities and issues of offloading mechanisms in a fog environment efficiently. We classify offloading mechanisms in a fog system into four groups, including computation-based, energy-based, storage-based, and hybrid approaches. Furthermore, this paper explores offloading metrics, applied algorithms, and evaluation methods related to the chosen offloading mechanisms in fog systems. Additionally, the open challenges and future trends derived from the reviewed studies are discussed.","output":"Towards effective offloading mechanisms in fog computing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 presents novel challenges and opportunities for the use of phylogenetics to understand and control its spread.

The Bacteremia Antibiotic Length Actually Needed for Clinical Effectiveness (BALANCE) pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) determined that it was feasible to enroll and randomize intensive care unit (ICU) patients with bloodstream infection to 7 versus 14 days of treatment, and served as the vanguard for the ongoing BALANCE main RCT. We performed this BALANCE-Ward pilot RCT to examine the feasibility and impact of potentially extending the BALANCE main RCT to include patients hospitalized on non-ICU wards. METHODS: We conducted an open pilot RCT among a subset of six sites participating in the ongoing BALANCE RCT, randomizing patients with positive non-Staphylococcus aureus blood cultures on non-ICU wards to 7 versus 14 days of antibiotic treatment. The co-primary feasibility outcomes were recruitment rate and adherence to treatment duration protocol. We compared feasibility outcomes, patient/pathogen characteristics, and overall outcomes among those enrolled in this BALANCE-Ward and prior BALANCE-ICU pilot RCTs. We estimated the sample size and non-inferiority margin impacts of expanding the BALANCE main RCT to include non-ICU patients. RESULTS: A total of 134 patients were recruited over 47 site-months (mean 2.9 patients/site-month, median 1.0, range 0.1C4.4 patients/site-month). The overall recruitment rate exceeded the BALANCE-ICU pilot RCT (mean 1.10 patients/site-month, p < 0.0001). Overall protocol adherence also exceeded the adherence in the BALANCE-ICU pilot RCT (125/134, 93% vs 89/115, 77%, p = 0.0003). BALANCE-Ward patients were older, with lower Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, and higher proportions of infections caused by Escherichia coli and genito-urinary sources of bloodstream infection. The BALANCE-Ward pilot RCT patients had an overall 90-day mortality rate of 17/133 (12.8%), which was comparable to the 90-day mortality rate in the ICU pilot RCT (17/115, 14.8%) (p = 0.65). Simulation models indicated there would be minimal sample size and non-inferiority margin implications of expanding enrolment to increasing proportions of non-ICU versus ICU patients. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to enroll non-ICU patients in a trial of 7 versus 14 days of antibiotics for bloodstream infection, and expanding the BALANCE RCT hospital-wide has the potential to improve the timeliness and generalizability of trial results.

In this study, by means of cellular depletion, the cluster of differentiation (CD) tetraspanins CD9, CD63, and CD151 were found to reduce HPV16 infection in HeLa cells by 50 to 80%. Moreover, we tested recombinant proteins or peptides of specific tetraspanin domains on their effect on the most oncogenic HPV type, HPV16, and HCMV. We found that the C-terminal tails of CD63 and CD151 significantly inhibited infections of both HPV16 and HCMV. Although CD9 was newly identified as a key cellular factor for HPV16 infection, the recombinant CD9 C-terminal peptide had no effect on infection. Based on the determined half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)), we classified CD63 and CD151 C-terminal peptides as moderate to potent inhibitors of HPV16 infection in HeLa and HaCaT cells, and in EA.hy926, HFF (human foreskin fibroblast) cells, and HEC-LTT (human endothelial cell-large T antigen and telomerase) cells for HCMV, respectively. These results indicate that HPV16 and HCMV share similar cellular requirements for their entry into host cells and reveal the necessity of the cytoplasmic CD151 and CD63 C-termini in virus infections.

As a virus that transmits by respiratory droplets and aerosols, determining the duration of viable virus shedding from the respiratory tract is critical for patient prognosis, and informs infection-control measures both within healthcare settings and the public domain. METHODS: We prospectively examined upper and lower airway respiratory secretions for both viral RNA and infectious virions in mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the University Hospital of Wales. Samples were taken from the oral cavity (saliva), oropharynx (subglottic aspirate), or lower respiratory tract (nondirected bronchoalveolar lavage [NBAL] or bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL]) and analyzed by both quantitative PCR (qPCR) and plaque assay. RESULTS: 117 samples were obtained from 25 patients. qPCR showed extremely high rates of positivity across all sample types; however, live virus was far more common in saliva (68%) than in BAL/NBAL (32%). Average titers of live virus were higher in subglottic aspirates (4.5  10(7)) than in saliva (2.2  10(6)) or BAL/NBAL (8.5  10(6)) and reached >10(8) PFU/mL in some samples. The longest duration of shedding was 98 days, while most patients (14/25) shed live virus for 20 days. CONCLUSIONS: ICU patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 can shed high titers of virus both in the upper and lower respiratory tract and tend to be prolonged shedders. This information is important for decision making around cohorting patients, de-escalation of personal protective equipment, and undertaking potential aerosol-generating procedures.","output":"Mechanically Ventilated Patients Shed High-Titer Live Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for Extended Periods From Both the Upper and Lower Respiratory Tract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Document: California employers are required to establish and implement an Injury and Illness Prevention Program (IIPP) to protect employees from all worksite hazards, including infectious diseases This guidance does not impose any new legal obligations It contains information for construction employers on ways to update their IIPPs to include information on employee training and preventing the spread of coronavirus (SARS-CoV2), the virus that causes COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019], at construction sites This is mandatory in most California workplaces since COVID-19 is widespread in the community COVID-19 (Disease);Epidemics;United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration;Construction industry","output":"COVID-19 Infection Prevention in Construction: Safety and Health Guidance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this feature article, the quality infrastructure (QI) of India is discussed.

Objectives: To address issues associated with cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic and to assess the implementation of measures aimed at containment of COVID-19 diffusion while allowing continuation of quality cancer care. Methods: A national survey among oncology departments in Israel was conducted between 12 April 2020 and 14 April 2020. Eighteen heads of hospital-based oncology departments completed a self-report questionnaire regarding their institute's preparedness for treatment of cancer patients during the COVI 0-19 pandemic. Results: In this national survey, prevention measures against COVID-19 spread were taken prior to patients' arrival and at arrival or while staying in the departments. Most participants (78-89%) reported using a quick triage of patients and caregivers prior to their entrance to the oncology units, limiting the entrance of caregivers, and reducing unnecessary visits to the clinic.

AIM: The objective of this study was to determine how perceived and experienced sexual satisfaction changed with the advent of COVID-19 among heterosexual married individuals in Kenya. METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional survey. Data was collected virtually using monkey survey from social groups. A total of 194 participants responded to the survey. OUTCOMES: The difference in overall sexual satisfaction as well as satisfaction with sex frequency; sex process; and time, place and ambience around sexual intercourse before and during COVID-19. RESULTS: Most of the participants (73.4%) reported that they were satisfied with their marital sex before COVID-19 but the proportion of those reporting satisfaction dropped to 58.4% when they were asked about their experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among participants surveyed during the pandemic itself, therefore, 41.3% reported that they were currently sexually dissatisfied whereas just 26.6% reported that they were dissatisfied even prior to the pandemic. There was a significant difference in the overall distributions before and during COVID-19 (2 = 38.86, P< .001). CLINICAL TRANSLATION: COVID-19 pandemic should be considered an etiology of sexual dissatisfaction and possibly sexual dysfunctions and COVID-19 control measures should incorporate ways of enhancing sexual well-being. CONCLUSION: There was perceived increase in dissatisfaction with sex which could be a pointer to the falling quality of life during COVID-19 pandemic especially among the most sexually active men aged 31C50 years living in places where COVID-19 control measures are being stringently implemented.

Nowadays, the limits of the \\"just in time\\" strategy can be observed. To remedy this, it is necessary to understand the characteristics of this economic crisis in its current context. In addition, the pandemic with its effect in prolonged waves caused a more or less severe recession depending on the country, which led to a drop in global energy demand by 6% and an 8% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. Also, the forecasts are not optimistic for the water sector, which is no exception. Climate change models indicate that precipitation could decrease by more than 20% by 2050. The challenge for Algeria in the years to come is to adapt to a decrease in renewable water resources. The country must mobilize unconventional water resources (desalination and reuse of wastewater) which will be a strategic component in water management. In addition, the development of unconventional resources leads to an increase in electrical energy demand of 12% by year, which must count in the national energy balance.

National and State governed laws imposed social distancing measures, quarantining citizens, and isolating infected persons. Apart from its physical impact, COVID-19 pandemic has brought numerous changes to peoples lives affecting people both physically and psychologically. A key component of quality of life of burn survivors consist of maintaining a long-term burn center connection through support groups. Our burn center developed a virtual format for aftercare to provide psychological support during the pandemic. METHODS: Regular attendees and new burn survivors were contacted by the aftercare specialist from an American Burn Associated verified burn center. Participants were surveyed on the best mode of contact and current addresses were obtained. Happy Mail was mailed to support group participants 3 times/month. Items included in these packages ranged from motivational sayings, gift cards, essential oils, candies, art projects, and reminders to log onto the virtual support groups. The gift packages also included a mental health check-in icebreaker. These gift packages took the place of our in-person support groups and contained all materials needed to engage and guide participation in the virtual monthly support group. Participants were then invited to join a social media support group for our local burn center. RESULTS: Burn survivors continued to receive quality psychosocial support to cope with and process feelings as well as validate emotions. Attendees regularly expressed gratitude in receiving Happy Mail as it brought a feeling of connectiveness to a group of burn survivors who rely on each other for peer support. The gift packages also served as a reminder of the upcoming virtual aftercare support groups as our attendance did not see a decline at monthly meetings.

There are currently no internationally recognized governance mechanisms (policies, ethical standards, evaluation, and regulation) for developing and using AI technologies in health care. A lack of international consensus creates technical and social barriers to the use of health AI while potentially hampering market competition. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to review current health data and AI governance mechanisms being developed or used by Global Digital Health Partnership (GDHP) member countries that commissioned this research, identify commonalities and gaps in approaches, identify examples of best practices, and understand the rationale for policies. METHODS: Data were collected through a scoping review of academic literature and a thematic analysis of policy documents published by selected GDHP member countries. The findings from this data collection and the literature were used to inform semistructured interviews with key senior policy makers from GDHP member countries exploring their countries experience of AI-driven technologies in health care and associated governance and inform a focus group with professionals working in international health and technology to discuss the themes and proposed policy recommendations. Policy recommendations were developed based on the aggregated research findings. RESULTS: As this is an empirical research paper, we primarily focused on reporting the results of the interviews and the focus group. Semistructured interviews (n=10) and a focus group (n=6) revealed 4 core areas for international collaborations: leadership and oversight, a whole systems approach covering the entire AI pipeline from data collection to model deployment and use, standards and regulatory processes, and engagement with stakeholders and the public. There was a broad range of maturity in health AI activity among the participants, with varying data infrastructure, application of standards across the AI life cycle, and strategic approaches to both development and deployment. A demand for further consistency at the international level and policies was identified to support a robust innovation pipeline. In total, 13 policy recommendations were developed to support GDHP member countries in overcoming core AI governance barriers and establishing common ground for international collaboration. CONCLUSIONS: AI-driven technology research and development for health care outpaces the creation of supporting AI governance globally. International collaboration and coordination on AI governance for health care is needed to ensure coherent solutions and allow countries to support and benefit from each others work. International bodies and initiatives have a leading role to play in the international conversation, including the production of tools and sharing of practical approaches to the use of AI-driven technologies for health care.","output":"Governing Data and Artificial Intelligence for Health Care: Developing an International Understanding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Data on multiple myeloma (MM) in sub-Sahara Africa is scarce.

Maternal diet in the 1st and 2nd trimesters was assessed by inconsecutive 2-day 24-hour dietary recalls. The Chinese diet balance index for pregnancy (DBI-P) was used to assess the diet quality of the participants. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to explore the independent effects of DBI-P components on LBW and SGA. The prevalence of LBW and SGA was 3.8% and 6.0%, respectively. Dietary intakes of the participants were imbalanced. The proportions of participants having insufficient intake of vegetables (87.3% and 86.6%), dairy (95.9% and 96.7%), and aquatic foods (80.5% and 85.3%) were high in both trimesters. The insufficiency of fruit intake was more severe in the 2nd trimester (85.2%) than in the 1st trimester (22.5%) (P<0.05). After adjusting for potential confounders, the intake of fruits and dairy in the 2nd trimester was negatively associated with the risk of LBW (OR=0.850, 95% CI: 0.723-0.999) and SGA (OR=0.885, 95% CI: 0.787-0.996), respectively.

It is a small hydrophobic protein displaying ion channel activity that has proven highly relevant in virus-host interaction and virulence. Ion transport through E channel was shown to alter Ca2+ homeostasis in the cell and trigger inflammation processes. Here, we study transport properties of the E viroporin in mixed solutions of potassium and calcium chloride that contain a fixed total concentration (mole fraction experiments). The channel is reconstituted in planar membranes of different lipid compositions, including a lipid mixture that mimics the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) membrane where the virus localizes within the cell. We find that the E ion conductance changes non-monotonically with the total ionic concentration displaying an Anomalous Mole Fraction Effect (AMFE) only when charged lipids are present in the membrane. We also observe that E channel insertion in ERGIC-mimic membranes - including lipid with intrinsic negative curvature - enhances ion permeation at physiological concentrations of pure CaCl2 or KCl solutions, with a preferential transport of Ca2+ in mixed KCl-CaCl2 solutions. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that the presence of calcium modulates the transport properties of the E channel by interacting preferentially with charged lipids through different mechanisms including direct Coulombic interactions and possibly inducing changes in membrane morphology.","output":"Transport mechanisms of SARS-CoV-E viroporin in calcium solutions: Lipid-dependent Anomalous Mole Fraction Effect and regulation of pore conductance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 led to changes in the way blood samples are collected.

If the stress experience is not adequately compensated, it can have a negative impact on postoperative recovery, as can untreated comorbid mental disorders. METHODS: A selective literature review on emotional distress and mental comorbidities in heart surgery patients and a scoping review on the spectrum and effectiveness of perioperative psychological interventions to compensate and reduce the stress experience. RESULTS: Mental factors such as depressive symptoms or anxiety disorders are associated with an elevated risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients treated for heart disease. Mental comorbidities occur more frequently in these patients than in the general population. Following the manifestation of chronic heart disease (CHD), for example, 15-20% of the patients display severe depressive disorders. A few psychotherapeutic interventions to reduce anxiety and depression, emotional distress, consumption of analgesics, and extubation time have been found effective, with low to moderate evidence quality. Many different psychological interventions have proved useful in clinical practice, including multimodal, multiprofessional interventions incorporating medications, education, sports, and exercise as well as psychosocial therapy including stress management. Individual psychotherapy during the period of acute inpatient treatment after myocardial infarction is also effective. CONCLUSION: Because psychosocial factors are important, the current guidelines recommend systematic screening for mental symptoms and comorbidities in advance of heart transplantation or the implantation of ventricular assist devices (VAD).

However, whether the blood-sucking arthropods on the body surface of bats also carry these viruses, and the relationship between viruses carried by the blood-sucking arthropods and viruses carried by bats, have not been reported. This study collected 686 blood-sucking arthropods on the body surface of bats from Yunnan Province, China between 2012 and 2015, and they included wingless bat flies, bat flies, ticks, mites, and fleas. The viruses carried by these arthropods were analyzed using meta-transcriptomic approach, and 144 highly diverse positive-sense single-stranded RNA, negative-sense single-stranded RNA, and double-stranded RNA viruses were found, of which 138 were potentially new viruses. These viruses were classified into 14 different virus families or orders, including Bunyavirales, Mononegavirales, Reoviridae, and Picornavirales. Further analyses found that Bunyavirales were the most abundant virus group (84% of total virus RNA) in ticks, whereas narnaviruses were the most abundant (52-92%) in the bat flies and wingless bat flies libraries, followed by solemoviruses (1-29%) and reoviruses (0-43%). These viruses were highly structured based on the arthropod types. It is worth noting that no bat-borne zoonotic viruses were found in the virome of bat-infesting arthropod, seemly not supporting that bat surface arthropods are vectors of zoonotic viruses carried by bats. IMPORTANCE Bats are reservoir of many important viral pathogens. To evaluate whether bat-parasitic blood-sucking arthropods participate in the circulation of these important viruses, it is necessary to conduct unbiased virome studies on these arthropods. We evaluated five types of blood-sucking parasitic arthropods on the surface of bats in Yunnan, China and identified a variety of viruses, some of which had high prevalence and abundance level, although there is limited overlap in virome between distant arthropods. While most of the virome discovered here are potentially arthropod-specific viruses, we identified three possible arboviruses, including one orthobunyavirus and two vesiculoviruses (family Rhabdoviridae), suggesting bat-parasitic arthropods carry viruses with risk of spillage, which warrants further study.","output":"Virome of bat-infesting arthropods: highly divergent viruses in different vectors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the German government released the Corona-Warn-App, a smartphone application that warns users if they have come into contact with other users tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Surprisingly, a GRB pulse's light curve morphology can be accurately predicted by the pulse asymmetry and the stretching/compression needed to align the structural components preceding the temporal mirror with the time-reversed components following it. Such a prediction is only possible because GRB pulses exhibit temporal symmetry. Time-asymmetric pulses include FREDs, rollercoaster pulses, and asymmetric u-pulses, while time-symmetric pulses include u-pulses and crowns. Each morphological type is characterized by specific asymmetries, stretching parameters, durations, and alignments between the smooth and structured components, and a delineation in the asymmetry/stretching distribution suggests that symmetric pulses and asymmetric pulses may belong to separate populations.

This is known the Shapley value that imputes the contribution of each asset, by looking at all the possible portfolios in which securities might participate. In this paper I use the Shapley value to decompose the risk and return of optimal portfolios that result from minimizing ordinary least squares. These regression portfolios are identical to tangency portfolios obtained by maximizing the Sharpe ratio of holdings on the mean-variance efficient frontiers. The Shapley value of individual assets is computed using the statistics resulting from the regressions. The value imputation prices assets by their comprehensive contribution to portfolio risk and return. This procedure allows investors to make unbiased decisions when analyzing the inherent risk of their holdings.

We studied the difference in risk perception in these two groups and how this related to demographic variables and psychological factors such as stress, anxiety, and death anxiety. To this aim, we administered an online questionnaire about COVID-19 together with other questionnaires assessing the psychological condition of participants. First, we found that the exposition to infection risk, due to living area or job, increased the perceived stress and anxiety (i.e., medical staff in North Italy was more stressed and anxious with respect to both medical- and non-medical participants from Center and South Italy). Then, we conducted hierarchical logistic regression models on our data to assess the response odds ratio relatively to each regressor on each dependent variable. We found that health workers reported higher risk perception, level of worry, and knowledge as related to COVID-19 infection compared to the general population. Psychological state, sex, and living area were less related to these factors. Instead, judgments about behaviors and containment rules were more linked to demographics, such as sex.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A clinical decision support tool for imaging, CareSelect (National Decision Support Co., Madison, WI), was integrated in silent mode into the electronic health record from September 2018 through August 2019. Each non-contrast head CT order received a score from the clinical decision support tool based on the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria. Descriptive statistics for all levels of appropriateness scores were compiled with an emphasis on low-utility exams. A micro-costing assessment was conducted using time-driven activity-based costing on head CT without contrast examinations. RESULTS: Within the 11-month time period, 3,186 head CT examinations without contrast were ordered for emergency center patients. Among these orders, 28% (896/3,186) were classified as low-utility studies. The base case CT pathway time was 43 min and base case total cost was $193.35. The base case opportunity cost of these low-utility exams extrapolated annually amounts to $188,902 for our institution.

As an infection control measure, universal pre-procedural and admission SARS-CoV-2 testing for pediatric patients was implemented in April and August 2020, respectively. Limited data exist on the utility screening programs in the pediatric population. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients (birth to 18 years) admitted to a tertiary care academic medical center from April 2020 to May 2021 that had one or more SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care or polymerase chain reaction tests performed. We describe demographic data, positivity rates and repeat testing trends observed in our cohort. RESULTS: A total of 2,579 SARS-CoV-2 tests were performed among 1,027 pediatric inpatients. Of these, 51 tests (2%) from 45 patients (4.3%) resulted positive. Community infection rates ranged from 4.5-60 cases/100,000 persons/day during the study period. Hispanic patients comprised 16% of the total children tested, but were disproportionately overrepresented (40%) among those testing positive (Figure1). Of 654 children with repeated tests, 7 (0.1%) converted to positive from a prior negative result. Median days between repeat tests was 12 (IQR 6-45), not necessarily performed during the same hospital stay. Five of these 7 patients had tests repeated < 3 days from a negative result, of which only 2 had no history of recent infection by testing performed at an outside facility. Pre-procedural tests accounted for 35% of repeat testing, of which 0.9% were positive. Repeated tests were most frequently ordered for patients in hematology/oncology (35%) and solid organ transplant/surgical (33%) wards, each with < 3% positive conversion rate.

However, few studies have included important trauma-related characteristics such as known perpetrator, fear of life or injury, and negative reactions to disclosure.

METHOD: Participants (N = 2,880) completed four annual surveys during late adolescence and the transition to young adulthood as part of an ongoing longitudinal study. Latent class analysis was used to extract classes of victimization and trauma-related characteristics. Latent class regression was used to understand how demographic covariates were related to class membership. Finally, discrete-time survival mixture analysis was used to assess latency to opioid use from ages 17 to 24 years, and how demographic and protective factors influenced opioid use across emergent classes. RESULTS: The four-class solution fit the data best: sexual abuse and indirect violence + high trauma characteristics (n = 79, 3.6%); high all + high trauma characteristics (n = 177; 8.1%); chronic emotional abuse + trusted perpetrator (n = 263; 12.1%); and low all (n = 1,656; 76.1%).

The environmental fungus Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) has been reported as the main driver of fungal coinfection in patients suffering from viral infections caused by Cytomegalovirus, Influenza or more recently SARS-CoV2. The airway epithelium is the first common point of contact between inhaled pathogens and the host. Aberrant airway epithelial cell (AEC) responses against fungal challenge have been described in patients susceptible to aspergillosis. Therefore, it is likely that a dysregulation of AEC responses during fungal-viral coinfection represents a potent driver for the development of fungal disease. Here we used an in vitro model of Af-viral infection of AECs to determine outcomes of spore internalisation, killing and viral replication during coinfection. Our data indicate that viral stimulation, while boosting Af uptake by AECs, limits Af spore killing by those cells, favouring fungal persistence and growth. Type I viral-induced interferon release was significantly decreased in the presence of Af hyphal forms suggesting a possible role of Af secreted factors in modulating viral pathogenicity. We next explored the impact of Af challenge in SARS-CoV2 replication within airway epithelial cells using nano-luciferase as a measure of viral replication. We found that Af increased SARS-CoV2 pathogenicity in a strain-dependent manner. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a mutual inhibition of antifungal and antiviral AEC responses during Af-viral coinfection and also suggest that some fungal factors might be key regulators of co-pathogenicity during in lung infection.","output":"Mutual inhibition of airway epithelial responses supports viral and fungal co-pathogenesis during coinfection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[ ]research has shown that over the long term, everyday organizational stressors, such as dealing with supervisors or lack of training, can have as much of a negative impact on officer health and wellness as significant external events (e g Shane, 2010) [ ]it is necessary to understand both acute and chronic stressors and how they impact officers in different countries, regions, cultures and roles Work-related stressors have been shown to negatively affect a number of key health outcomes for officers, including sleep, cardiovascular disease risk factors (e g obesity, hypertension), mood disorders like anxiety and depression and serious mental health outcomes like suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior (see Violanti et al , 2017) In sum, looking across the research, it is clear that stress is a key component of short- and long-term performance and decision-making [ ]understanding and subsequently reducing officer stress holds promise not only for improving the lives of officers themselves but also for addressing some of the toughest issues facing policing today Because of the number of relevant papers and the importance of officer stress, health and wellness today, the Special Issue covers not only the papers in this volume but also seven additional papers which were published in 44:1","output":"Guest editorial: An introduction to the special issue: stress, health and wellness in policing: understanding and addressing complex issues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scorpions are well known for their dangerous stings that can result in severe consequences for human beings, including death.

We hypothesized that patient preparedness would be equivalent after preoperative counseling phone calls versus preoperative counseling office visits before prolapse surgery. METHODS This was an equivalence randomized controlled trial of women undergoing pelvic organ prolapse surgery. Participants were randomized to receive standardized counseling via a preoperative phone call or office visit. The primary outcome was patient preparedness measured on a 5-point Likert scale by the Patient Preparedness Questionnaire at the postoperative visit. A predetermined equivalence margin of 20% was used. Two 1-sided tests for equivalence were used for the primary outcome. RESULTS We randomized 120 women. The study was concluded early because of COVID-19 and subsequent surgery cancellations. There were 85 participants with primary outcome data (43 offices, 42 phones). Mean age was 62.0 years (1.0) and 64 (75.3%) had stage III or stage IV prolapse. The primary outcome, patient preparedness measured at the postoperative visit, was equivalent between groups (office, n = 43 [97.7%]; phone, n = 42 [97.6%], P < 0.001). Most women reported they would have preferred a phone call (n = 66, 65.5%) with more women in the phone group expressing this preference than the office group (office 40.5% vs phone 90.5%, P < 0.001). Ultimately, nearly all women (96.5%) were satisfied with their method of counseling. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative counseling phone calls were equivalent to office visits for patient preparedness for pelvic organ prolapse surgery. This study demonstrates patient acceptance of phone calls for preoperative counseling.

As little immunity had developed in most populations, re-establishing higher contact carried substantial risks, and therefore many locations began to see resurgence in COVID-19 cases. We present a Bayesian method to estimate the leeway to reopen, or alternatively the strength of change required to re-establish COVID-19 control, in a range of jurisdictions experiencing different COVID-19 epidemics. We estimated the timing and strength of initial control measures such as widespread distancing and compared the leeway jurisdictions had to reopen immediately after NPI measures to later estimates of leeway. Finally, we quantified risks associated with reopening and the likely burden of new cases due to introductions from other jurisdictions. We found widely varying leeway to reopen. After initial NPI measures took effect, some jurisdictions had substantial leeway (e.g., Japan, New Zealand, Germany) with > 0.99 probability that contact rates were below 80% of the threshold for epidemic growth. Others had little leeway (e.g., the United Kingdom, Washington State) and some had none (e.g., Sweden, California). For most such regions, increases in contact rate of 1.5-2 fold would have had high (> 0.7) probability of exceeding past peak sizes. Most jurisdictions experienced June-August trajectories consistent with our projections of contact rate increases of 1-2-fold. Under such relaxation scenarios for some regions, we projected up to a??100 additional cases if just one case were imported per week over six weeks, even between jurisdictions with comparable COVID-19 risk. We provide an R package covidseir to enable jurisdictions to estimate leeway and forecast cases under different future contact patterns.

In 2016 epidemics of Zika virus emerged, and in 2020, a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We compared patterns of scientific publications for the two infections to analyse the evolution of the evidence. METHODS: We annotated publications on Zika virus and SARS-CoV-2 that we collected using living evidence databases according to study design. We used descriptive statistics to categorise and compare study designs over time. RESULTS: We found 2286 publications about Zika virus in 2016 and 21,990 about SARS-CoV-2 up to 24 May 2020, of which we analysed a random sample of 5294 (24%). For both infections, there were more epidemiological than laboratory science studies. Amongst epidemiological studies for both infections, case reports, case series and cross-sectional studies emerged first, cohort and case-control studies were published later. Trials were the last to emerge. The number of preprints was much higher for SARS-CoV-2 than for Zika virus. CONCLUSIONS: Similarities in the overall pattern of publications might be generalizable, whereas differences are compatible with differences in the characteristics of a disease.

Staff testing is critical in identifying and isolating infected individuals, whilst also reducing unnecessary workforce depletion. Tygerberg Hospital implemented an online pre-registration system to expedite staff and cluster testing. We aimed to identify specific presentations associated with a positive or negative result for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study design involving all clients making use of the hospitals pre-registration system during May 2020. RESULTS: Of 799 clients, most were young and females with few comorbidities. Nurses formed the largest staff contingent in the study, followed by administrative staff, doctors and general assistants. Doctors tested earlier compared with other staff (median: 1.5 vs. 4 days). The most frequent presenting symptoms included headache, sore throat, cough and myalgia. Amongst those testing positive (n = 105), fever, altered smell, altered taste sensation, and chills were the most common symptoms. Three or more symptoms were more predictive of a positive test, but 12/145 asymptomatic clients also tested positive. CONCLUSION: Staff coronavirus testing using an online pre-registration form is a viable and acceptable strategy. Whilst some presentations are less likely to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, no symptom can completely exclude it.

There have been classic clinical cases that have met the case definition of COVID-19 but real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) tests of nasopharyngeal swabs were negative. Objectives: This study aimed to share pathological observations of autopsies performed at the 37 Military Hospital's Department of Anatomical Pathology on three presumed COVID-19 cases in Accra, Ghana. Method: Complete autopsies with detailed gross and histopathological analysis were conducted between April 2020 and May 2020 on three suspected COVID-19 cases, of which two had initial negative (rRT-PCR) nasopharyngeal tests. Postmortem bronchopulmonary samples of two cases were collected and tested by rRT-PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Results: The two postmortem bronchopulmonary samples tested for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR were positive. Though no postmortem bronchopulmonary sample was taken from the third case, a close contact tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in later contact tracing. For all three cases, lung histopathological findings were consistent with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Conclusion: The outcome of COVID-19 testing is dependent on the sample type and accuracy of sampling amongst other factors. Histopathological findings vary and may be dependent on a patient's modifying factors, as well as the duration of infection.

In June, 2020, a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA; Lumipulse G SARS-CoV-2 Ag kit, Fujirebio, Tokyo, Japan) was developed that can detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleoproteins in NPS or saliva samples within 35 min. In this study, we assessed the utility of CLEIA in mass SARS-CoV-2 screening. Methods: We did a diagnostic accuracy study to develop a mass-screening strategy for salivary detection of SARS-CoV-2 by CLEIA, enrolling hospitalised patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19, close contacts identified at community health centres, and asymptomatic international arrivals at two airports, all based in Japan. All test participants were enrolled consecutively. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of CLEIA compared with RT-qPCR, estimated according to concordance (Kendall's coefficient of concordance, W), and sensitivity (probability of CLEIA positivity given RT-qPCR positivity) and specificity (probability of CLEIA negativity given RT-qPCR negativity) for different antigen concentration cutoffs (019 pg/mL, 067 pg/mL, and 400 pg/mL; with samples considered positive if the antigen concentration was equal to or more than the cutoff and negative if it was less than the cutoff). We also assessed a two-step testing strategy post hoc with CLEIA as an initial test, using separate antigen cutoff values for test negativity and positivity from the predefined cutoff values. The proportion of intermediate results requiring secondary RT-qPCR was then quantified assuming prevalence values of RT-qPCR positivity in the overall tested population of 10%, 30%, and 50%. Findings: Self-collected saliva was obtained from 2056 participants between June 12 and Aug 6, 2020. Results of CLEIA and RT-qPCR were concordant in 2020 (982%) samples (Kendall's W=099). Test sensitivity was 854% (76 of 89 positive samples; 90% credible interval [CrI] 780-903) at the cutoff of 019 pg/mL; 764% (68 of 89; 682-828) at the cutoff of 067 pg/mL; and 528% (47 of 89; 441-613) at the cutoff of 40 pg/mL. Test specificity was 913% (1796 of 1967 negative samples; 90% CrI 902-923) at the cutoff of 019 pg/mL, 992% (1952 of 1967; 988-995) at the cutoff of 067 pg/mL, and 1000% (1967 of 1967; 998-1000) at the cutoff of 400 pg/mL. Using a two-step testing strategy with a CLEIA negativity cutoff of 019 pg/mL (to maximise sensitivity) and a CLEIA positivity cutoff of 400 pg/mL (to maximise specificity), the proportions of indeterminate results (ie, samples requiring secondary RT-qPCR) would be approximately 11% assuming a prevalence of RT-qPCR positivity of 10%, 16% assuming a prevalence of RT-qPCR positivity of 30%, and 21% assuming a prevalence of RT-qPCR positivity of 50%. Interpretation: CLEIA testing of self-collected saliva is simple and provides results quickly, and is thus suitable for mass testing. To improve accuracy, we propose a two-step screening strategy with an initial CLEIA test followed by confirmatory RT-qPCR for intermediate concentrations, varying positive and negative thresholds depending on local prevalence. Implementation of this strategy has expedited sample processing at Japanese airports since July, 2020, and might apply to other large-scale mass screening initiatives.

SARS-CoV-2 has been linked with coagulation disturbances including arterial thrombosis, leading to considerable interest in antithrombotic therapy for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the independent thromboembolic risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with influenza remains incompletely understood. We evaluated the adjusted risks of thromboembolic events after a diagnosis of COVID-19 compared with influenza in a large retrospective cohort. METHODS: We used a US-based electronic health record (EHR) dataset linked with insurance claims to identify adults diagnosed with COVID-19 between April 1, 2020 and October 31, 2020. We identified influenza patients diagnosed between October 1, 2018 and April 31, 2019. Primary outcomes [venous composite of pulmonary embolism (PE) and acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT); arterial composite of ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction (MI)] and secondary outcomes were assessed 90 days post-diagnosis. Propensity scores (PS) were calculated using demographic, clinical, and medication variables. PS-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: There were 417,975 COVID-19 patients (median age 57y, 61% women), and 345,934 influenza patients (median age 47y, 66% women). Compared with influenza, patients with COVID-19 had higher venous thromboembolic risk (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.38C1.70), but not arterial thromboembolic risk (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95C1.10). Secondary analyses demonstrated similar risk for ischemic stroke (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.98C1.25) and MI (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85C1.03) and higher risk for DVT (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.19C1.56) and PE (HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.57C2.10) in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: In a large retrospective US cohort, COVID-19 was independently associated with higher 90-day risk for venous thrombosis, but not arterial thrombosis, as compared with influenza.

The concentration of persin, a natural fungicidal toxin present in avocado, was also determined on several parts of the fruit and avocado meal. Nine intact female beagles (4.9  0.6 yr and 11.98  1.76 kg) were randomly grouped in a 3  3 replicated Latin square design. Periods were 14 d long, with 10 d of adaptation followed by 4 d of total fecal and urine collection for apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) calculations. Fresh fecals were analyzed for fermentative end-products. The BPD (87.0 g/d) caused higher (P < 0.05) fecal output (as-is basis) than AMD (62.3 g/d) and CD (58.0 g/d).

Additionally, it exerts effects in neuroinflammation, regulating the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In AD patients, its expression is increased in the hippocampus/entorhinal cortex more than in the frontal cortex, a phenomenon not observed in age-matched control brains, indicating an association with AD pathology. It is upregulated in peripheral blood cells of patients affected by AD, thus reflecting its increase at central neuronal level. This review offers an overview on the main AD biomarkers and the potential role of A(2A) adenosine receptor as a new marker and therapeutic target.","output":"A(2A) Adenosine Receptor as a Potential Biomarker and a Possible Therapeutic Target in Alzheimers Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The publisher regrets that this article has been temporarily removed.

Retrospective, observational study of all patients admitted to our hospital for &#8805; 24 h from March 1 to May 31, 2020 with SARS-CoV-2. The objective was to evaluate clinical outcomes and mortality in COVID-19 patients receiving chronic anticoagulation (AC) or antiplatelet therapy (AP) prior to hospital admission. A total of 1612 patients were evaluated. The mean (standard deviation; SD) age was 66.5 (17.1) years. Patients were divided into three groups according to the use of antithrombotic therapy prior to admission (AP, AC, or no-antithrombotic treatment). At admission, 9.6% of the patients were taking anticoagulants and 19.1% antiplatelet therapy. The overall mortality rate was 19.3%. On the multivariate analysis there were no significant differences in mortality between the antithrombotic groups (AC or AP) and the no-antithrombotic group (control group). Patients on AC had lower ICU admission rates than the control group (OR: 0.41, 95% CI, 0.18-0.93). Anticoagulation therapy prior to hospitalization for COVID-19 was associated with lower ICU admission rates. However, there were no significant differences in mortality between the patients receiving chronic antithrombotic therapy and patients not taking antithrombotic medications. These findings suggest that chronic anticoagulation therapy at the time of COVID-19 infection may reduce disease severity and thus the need for ICU admission.","output":"Impact of pre-admission antithrombotic therapy on disease severity and mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TGEV is a coronavirus that is still widely spread in pig farming.

TGEV Miller was passaged in piglets several times to reveal high infection. Finally, TGEV GFP is a recombinant strain that obtained its main body from TGEV PUR 46-MAD, but its spike protein from TGEV PUR-C11 that showed high mortality in piglets in vivo. Our results were in complete consensus of these statements. TGEV Miller mildly and TGEV GFP extensively infected the cells in the jejunum based on the amount of positive stained epithelial cells. However, for TGEV PUR 46-MAD no nucleocapsid protein was detected in the epithelial cells of the tissue.

In long-term chemical bioassays conducted with B6C3F(1) mice, H. hepaticus has been regarded as a confounding factor because of its tumor-promoting activity. In order to determine if woodchucks harbor a Helicobacter sp. that might play a role in potentiating hepatic inflammation or neoplasia, a study was undertaken to determine whether woodchucks' livers were infected with a Helicobacter sp. Frozen liver samples from 20 (17 WHV-infected and 3 noninfected) woodchucks, 10 with WHV-associated hepatic tumors and 10 without tumors, were cultured by microaerobic techniques and analyzed by using genus- and species-specific helicobacter PCR primers. A 1,200-bp Helicobacter sp.-specific sequence was amplified from 14 liver samples. Southern hybridization confirmed the specific identity of the PCR products. Nine of the 10 livers with tumors had positive Helicobacter sp. identified by PCR, whereas 5 of the 10 livers without tumors were positive. By use of 16S rRNA species-specific primers for H. marmotae, two additional liver samples from the nontumor group had positive PCR amplicons confirmed by Southern hybridization. A urease-, catalase-, and oxidase-positive bacterium was isolated from one liver sample from a liver tumor-positive woodchuck.

These siRNAs were termed esiRNA-R, esiRNA-S and esiRNA-N respectively. RdRp, spike and nucleocapsid DNA fragments were inserted into the plasmid pGL3-Control, obtained plasmids pGL-R, pGL-S and pGL-N can express hybrid mRNAs luciferase-RdRp, spike and -nucleocapsid in cells. Above plasmids and esiRNAs were co-transfected to HEK293F cells with reference plasmid pRL-TK. Firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activity were measured.

Expression of pGLS was reduced to 11% by esiRNA-S. Expression of pGL-N was reduced to 40% by esiRNA-N. Control esiRNAs didn't affect luciferase expression; Hybrid mRNAs' abundance was dramatically reduced by corresponding esiRNAs.

An up-to-date understanding of how best to target this therapy (e.g. arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) or peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) aim) in these patients is urgently required. OBJECTIVES To address how oxygen therapy should be targeted in adults with ARDS (particularly ARDS secondary to COVID-19 or other respiratory viruses) and requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit, and the impact oxygen therapy has on mortality, days ventilated, days of catecholamine use, requirement for renal replacement therapy, and quality of life. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to 15 May 2020 for ongoing or completed randomized controlled trials (RCTs). SELECTION CRITERIA Two review authors independently assessed all records in accordance with standard Cochrane methodology for study selection. We included RCTs comparing supplemental oxygen administration (i.e. different target PaO2 or SpO2 ranges) in adults with ARDS and receiving mechanical ventilation in an intensive care setting. We excluded studies exploring oxygen administration in patients with different underlying diagnoses or those receiving non-invasive ventilation, high-flow nasal oxygen, or oxygen via facemask. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS One review author performed data extraction, which a second review author checked. We assessed risk of bias in included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We used the GRADE approach to judge the certainty of the evidence for the following outcomes; mortality at longest follow-up, days ventilated, days of catecholamine use, and requirement for renal replacement therapy. MAIN RESULTS We identified one completed RCT evaluating oxygen targets in patients with ARDS receiving mechanical ventilation in an intensive care setting. The study randomized 205 mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS to either conservative (PaO2 55 to 70 mmHg, or SpO2 88% to 92%) or liberal (PaO2 90 to 105 mmHg, or SpO2  96%) oxygen therapy for seven days. Overall risk of bias was high (due to lack of blinding, small numbers of participants, and the trial stopping prematurely), and we assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low. The available data suggested that mortality at 90 days may be higher in those participants receiving a lower oxygen target (odds ratio (OR) 1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 3.27). There was no evidence of a difference between the lower and higher target groups in mean number of days ventilated (14.0, 95% CI 10.0 to 18.0 versus 14.5, 95% CI 11.8 to 17.1); number of days of catecholamine use (8.0, 95% CI 5.5 to 10.5 versus 7.2, 95% CI 5.9 to 8.4); or participants receiving renal replacement therapy (13.7%, 95% CI 5.8% to 21.6% versus 12.0%, 95% CI 5.0% to 19.1%). Quality of life was not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We are very uncertain as to whether a higher or lower oxygen target is more beneficial in patients with ARDS and receiving mechanical ventilation in an intensive care setting. We identified only one RCT with a total of 205 participants exploring this question, and rated the risk of bias as high and the certainty of the findings as very low. Further well-conducted studies are urgently needed to increase the certainty of the findings reported here.

OBJECTIVE: Measure the effect of implementing an eConsult program on access to specialty care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using an interrupted time series design with data from 2016 to 2020, this study analyzed 50 260 referral requests submitted during the year before and the year after eConsult implementation at 19 New York City Health + Hospitals (NYC H+H) specialty clinics that spanned 7 NYC H+H hospital facilities and 6 unique specialties. EXPOSURES: Referral request was submitted to a specialty clinic in the year following eConsult implementation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Main outcomes included the fraction of referral requests resolved without an in-person visit following eConsult implementation; and, among requests triaged to have an in-person visit, the fraction of referrals with a successfully scheduled appointment, mean wait time to a specialty appointment, and the fraction of referral requests with a completed specialty visit. Changes associated with eConsult implementation were estimated using multivariate linear regression adjusting for patient age, gender, and specialty clinic fixed effects. RESULTS: Across 19 NYC H+H specialty clinics, 26 731 referral requests were submitted in the year before and 23 529 referrals were submitted in the year after eConsult implementation. Following eConsult implementation, 13% of all requests were resolved electronically. Among requests requiring a follow-up visit, the fraction with an appointment successfully scheduled increased by 15.8%, from 66.5% to 82.3% (P < .001). The mean time to an appointment decreased from 61.0 days pre-eConsult to 54.1 days post-eConsult, an adjusted 8.2-day shorter wait time (or 13.3% reduction) following eConsult adoption (P < .001). The percentage of referrals with a completed follow-up visit with a specialist within 90 days of the request did not change (38.4% vs 37.9%, P = .07). Changes in outcomes were mitigated during months when most clinics underwent an electronic health record transition after implementing eConsult. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this quality improvement study, implementation of eConsults at a large multi-specialty safety-net system was associated with improvements in appointment scheduling rates and wait times. Despite an additional electronic health record transition, eConsults are a promising health care delivery tool for increasing access to specialty care.","output":"Association of eConsult Implementation With Access to Specialist Care in a Large Urban Safety-Net System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current surveillance methods may not capture the full extent of COVID-19 spread in high-risk settings like food establishments. Thus, we propose a new method for surveillance that identifies COVID-19 cases among food establishment workers from news reports via web-scraping and natural language processing (NLP). First, we used web-scraping to identify a broader set of articles (n = 67,078) related to COVID-19 based on keyword mentions. In this dataset, we used an open-source NLP platform (ClarityNLP) to extract location, industry, case, and death counts automatically. These articles were vetted and validated by CDC subject matter experts (SMEs) to identify those containing COVID-19 outbreaks in food establishments. CDC and Georgia Tech Research Institute SMEs provided a human-labeled test dataset containing 388 articles to validate our algorithms. Then, to improve quality, we fine-tuned a pretrained RoBERTa instance, a bidirectional transformer language model, to classify articles containing  1 positive COVID-19 cases in food establishments. The application of RoBERTa decreased the number of articles from 67,078 to 1,112 and classified ( 1 positive COVID-19 cases in food establishments) articles with 88% accuracy in the human-labeled test dataset. Therefore, by automating the pipeline of web-scraping and COVID-19 case prediction using RoBERTa, we enable an efficient human in-the-loop process by which COVID-19 data could be manually collected from articles flagged by our model, thus reducing the human labor requirements. Furthermore, our approach could be used to predict and monitor locations of COVID-19 development by geography and could also be extended to other industries and news article datasets of interest. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Using Event-Based Web-Scraping Methods and Bidirectional Transformers to Characterize COVID-19 Outbreaks in Food Production and Retail Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evidence suggests that potential health complications after COVID-19 illness might require ongoing clinical care.

Our goal was to compare the contrasting increase in emergency telehealth volume with the decreasing ED volumes to identify staffing strategies that can be used in future epidemics. Methods: We performed interrupted time series analyses to compare the associations of COVID-19 surges on daily ED and telehealth volumes at Denver Health Medical Center (DHMC) in Denver, Colorado, and the University of Colorado Hospital (UCH) in Aurora, Colorado. Consecutive adults from January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2020 were included, with time periods corresponding to baseline volumes (January 1, 2019 to March 24, 2020), and first (March 25, 2020 to June 15, 2020), second (June 16, 2020 to September 12, 2020), and third (September 13, 2020 to December 31, 2020) COVID-19 surges according to Colorado epidemiological data. We performed pairwise comparisons between baseline versus each COVID-19 surge for ED and telehealth daily volumes, using linear regression to account for secularity and non-parametric statistics to compare median values. Results: DHMC ED daily volumes differed between baseline (median, 346 [interquartile range {IQR}, 325- 367]), and first (219 [196-237];p<.0001), second (281 [264-298];p<.0001), and third (284 [260-301];p<.0001) COVID-19 surges. DHMC telehealth median daily volumes also differed between baseline (181 [156-199]), and first (257 [231-285];p<.0001), second (227 [202-256];p<.0001), and third (241 [208-274];p<.0001) COVID-19 surges. Similarly, UCH ED median daily volumes differed between baseline (276 [257-292]), and first (207 [188-223];p<.0001), second (243 [227-255];p<.0001), and third (245 [225-264];p<.0001) COVID-19 surges. Lastly, UCH telehealth median daily volumes also differed between baseline (9 [6-15]), and first (97 [65-141];p<.0001), second (60 [51-69];p<.0001), and third (74 [62-89];p<.0001) COVID-19 surges (Figure). Conclusions: ED volumes decreased and remained depressed through all 3 COVID-19 surges in Colorado, and in response, COVID-19 was associated with an unprecedented increase for emergency telehealth and virtual services. Patients adopted telehealth as an alternative to seek care while trying to stay protected from infection. Shifting providers in this manner, from physical ED to acute-care telehealth shifts, may allow EDs to meet dynamically changing patient volumes during future pandemics.

While many established vaccines use boost / dose 2 timings that are typically in the 3 to 120 months range , dose 2 timings for both trials were less than 30 days as part of a crucial effort to rapidly develop a vaccine with significant efficacy. Data from both trials showed excellent dose 1 efficacy;however, neither of the related Safety and Efficacy publications highlighted this dose 1 efficacy excellence.The trials, manufacturing, and distribution programs have rapidly delivered millions of doses to points of care. However, the ability to administer these doses at localities as rapidly as they can be distributed has been shown as the largest current challenge to achieving the widespread vaccination. Improvements could reduce mortality rates that presently exceed 2000 per day, avoid serious cases at a time where hospital census is at full capacity or beyond, and minimize long-term sequelae.This study suggests that it is possible to achieve these and other goals by recognizing the evidence for COVID-19 vaccine deferred boost timing and using a more conventional, decades-tested, boost timing on the order of months.

Great attention has been given to professional identity in medical school because it plays an important role in the transition from student to doctor. Nonetheless, the necessity of acquiring a tremendous amount of knowledge and skill during medical school training does not create sufficient opportunities for students to develop their professional identities. Thus, this paper pays careful attention to how students learning experiences in medical school affect this development. The research questions are as follows. 1) How do medical students perceptions of doctors change or strengthen after entering medical school in the process of professional identity development? 2) What kinds of knowledge have medical students accumulated while attending medical school? How do their learning experiences affect professional identity development? 3) What is a doctors role and the careers meaning to medical students, and what understanding does this awareness bring to their learning experiences and lives as future doctors? METHODS: In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 Korean students in their fourth year of medical school; all had more than one year of experience in clinical settings. The students learning experiences and professional identity development were used to analyze the data using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: When students first entered medical school, they perceived their identities as given to them by society. However, various learning experiences during the medical school years affected them, causing them to think about becoming a doctor according to their own perceptions and the meaning of becoming a doctor in the profession. Although an isolated medical community and a competitive student culture hindered them from searching for their professional identities, informal learning experiences, including active interaction with patients, senior doctors, and others outside the medical community, enabled them to develop their professional identities. The medical students experienced a conflict between individual and professional values as they considered what kind of doctor they would be in the future.

In particular, we formally show how such reaction-diffusion models are recovered in an appropriate diffusive limit. The kinetic transport model is therefore considered within a spatial network, characterizing different places such as villages, cities, countries, etc. The transmission conditions in the nodes are analyzed and defined. Finally, the model is solved numerically on the network through a finite-volume IMEX method able to maintain the consistency with the diffusive limit without restrictions due to the scaling parameters.

Estimation of the SAR is an important part of understanding and controlling the transmission of infectious diseases. In practice, it is most often estimated using binomial models such as logistic regression, which implicitly attribute all secondary infections in a household to the primary case. In the simplest case, the number of secondary infections in a household with m susceptibles and a single primary case is modeled as a binomial(m, p) random variable where p is the SAR. Although it has long been understood that transmission within households is not binomial, it is thought that multiple generations of transmission can be neglected safely when p is small. We use probability generating functions and simulations to show that this is a mistake. The proportion of susceptible household members infected can be substantially larger than the SAR even when p is small. As a result, binomial estimates of the SAR are biased upward and their confidence intervals have poor coverage probabilities even if adjusted for clustering. Accurate point and interval estimates of the SAR can be obtained using longitudinal chain binomial models or pairwise survival analysis, which account for multiple generations of transmission within households, the ongoing risk of infection from outside the household, and incomplete follow-up. We illustrate the practical implications of these results in an analysis of household surveillance data collected by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic.","output":"Estimating and interpreting secondary attack risk: Binomial considered biased"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remdesivir is one of a few antiviral drugs approved for treating severe cases of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in hospitalized patients.

The investigation was designed to explore whether remdesivir causes mitochondrial toxicity, using both genomic and functional parameters in the assessment. Human-derived HepG2 liver cells were exposed for up to 48 h in culture to increasing concentrations of remdesivir. At sub-cytotoxic concentrations (<1 M), the drug failed to alter either the number of copies or the expression of the mitochondrial genome. mtDNA copy number was unaffected as was the relative rates of expression of mtDNA-encoded and nuclear encoded subunits of complexes I and IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Consistent with this is the observation that remdesivir was without effect on mitochondrial respiration, including basal respiration, proton leak, maximum uncoupled respiration, spare respiratory capacity or coupling efficiency.

Presence of advice on managing orthodontic appliance breakages, information on outpatient appointment changes and video consultations was also assessed. The checklist was used to undertake a cross-sectional analysis of all available webpages of hospitals with an orthodontic department in England between September 2020 to October 2020.

The COVID-19 virus is still mutating, particularly the delta and omicron variants, which are known for their high level of contagiousness, but policymakers and governments are resolute in combating the pandemic's spread through a recent massive vaccination campaign of their population. We used extreme machine learning (ELM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), long short-term neural network (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), convolution neural network (CNN) and deep neural network (DNN) methods on time series data from the start of the pandemic in France, Russia, Turkey, India, United states of America (USA), Brazil and United Kingdom (UK) until September 3, 2021 to predict the daily new cases and daily deaths at different waves of the pandemic in countries considered while using root mean square error (RMSE) and relative root mean square error (rRMSE) to measure the performance of these methods. We used the spectral analysis method to convert time (days) to frequency in order to analyze the peaks of frequency and periodicity of the time series data. We also forecasted the future pandemic evolution by using ELM, MLP, and spectral analysis. Moreover, MLP achieved best performance for both daily new cases and deaths based on the evaluation metrics used. Furthermore, we discovered that errors for daily deaths are much lower than those for daily new cases. While the performance of models varies, prediction and forecasting during the period of vaccination and recent cases confirm the pandemic's prevalence level in the countries under consideration.

This study aims to understand differential post-operative changes in eyelid contour for MMCR and ELR surgery. METHODS In this cross-sectional cohort study, patients affected by involutional ptosis were randomized into two groups: those who underwent ELR or MMCR surgery. Pre-operative and late post-operative photographs were obtained. Digital analysis of the lid contour was performed by measuring the vertical distance from a line intersecting the center of the pupil to the eyelid margin at 10 positions at 2 mm intervals. Mean distance at each position was compared pre- and post-operatively between the groups. RESULTS The final sample included 60 eyes from 39 patients, 30 eyes per group. At each time point there was significant variation in height across the eyelid (p < 0.05). A significant (p < 0.05) group difference in vertical height was noted only at the 2 and 4 mm temporal positions in the post-operative analysis, with the ELR group being slightly higher. There were no significant differences in MRD1, pre- or post-operatively, between the ELR and MMCR groups.

After a follow-up gastroscopy revealed the persistence of the lesion, we decided to incorporate into the treatment a gel-like substance containing, among others, hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate, and observed that the lesion resolved completely. CONCLUSIONS: This report highlights that Cameron lesions should be considered in patients with hiatal hernia who have iron-deficiency anemia and can be diagnosed on upper endoscopy. Further clinical studies are required to determine the role of combined poloxamer 407 with hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate in the management of Cameron lesions.","output":"A 61-Year-Old Woman with Chronic Iron-Deficiency Anemia Due to a Cameron Lesion and a Response to Oral Application of Combined Poloxamer 407 with Hyaluronic Acid and Chondroitin Sulfate Following Single Treatment with Pantoprazole: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"E-commerce has gained momentum with the rapid development of technology, and nowadays, we are permanently connected, with constant access to information and a wide range of products. Not only does a desktop computer offer us this possibility, but the latest-generation tablets and mobile phones create a broad framework. This paper investigates Romanian consumers attitudes towards adopting mobile technology for commerce (m-commerce), taking into account its development in the last few years, especially among younger generations. The main objectives of the research are to identify the preference for m-commerce use among Generation Z, establish the ways and the devices used by Gen Z individuals to inform about the products and services and order them, and analyze the factors influencing the use of m-commerce applications. The research methodology consists of conducting an empirical analysis using a distributed survey among youngsters from Generation Z in Romania. We used descriptive statistics, such as the analysis of frequency and the mean of variables, artificial neural network analysis (ANN), and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), to validate the hypotheses. The research results indicate a solid inclination for m-commerce among Generation Z.

The most recent literature points to troubling evidence that policies adopted to address the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may have contributed to diverting eating habits toward a poorer diet. Considering the historically unique SARS-CoV-2 pandemic lockdown scenario, and the health burden imposed by UPFs on human health, it is critical to investigate how the epidemic has influenced UPF intake directly. Reviewing the literature, we aimed to assess the changes in the consumption of UPFs during the pandemic lockdown compared to previous habits in the general population. Methods: Consulting six databases, we examined articles investigating the consumption of UPFs according to the NOVA classification both before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and during lockdowns. In total, 28 reports were included in the final analysis. Results: A clear trend of an increasing consumption of sweets (chocolate, candy, cookies, pastries, cakes, desserts, and confectionery, 31.75% increase vs. 21.06% decrease), packaged fatty or salty snacks (23.71% increase vs. 20.73% decrease), and baked goods (bread products, pizza, and sandwiches, 28.03% increase vs. 13.5% decrease) emerged, versus a decrease in ready-to-eat dishes (16.2% increase vs. 22.62% decrease) and ready-made meals (10.6% increase vs. 31.43% decrease), such as instant soups, canned foods, fast food, and chips, as well as sugary drinks in general (14.55% increase vs. 22.65% decrease). No trend was observed for processed meat consumption. Conclusion: The current pandemic scenario raises concerns about the increased consumption of UPFs, especially sweets, snacks, and baked goods, and points to an urgent need to implement policy strategies to manage the trade in these foods from a preventive perspective.","output":"Public Health Response to the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: Concern about Ultra-Processed Food Consumption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Due to a complex set of processes involved with the recording of health information in the Electronic Health Records (EHRs), the truthfulness of EHR diagnosis records is questionable. We present a computational approach to estimate the probability that a single diagnosis record in the EHR reflects the true disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using EHR data on 18 diseases from the Mass General Brigham (MGB) Biobank, we develop generative classifiers on a small set of disease-agnostic features from EHRs that aim to represent Patients, pRoviders, and their Interactions within the healthcare SysteM (PRISM features). RESULTS: We demonstrate that PRISM features and the generative PRISM classifiers are potent for estimating disease probabilities and exhibit generalizable and transferable distributional characteristics across diseases and patient populations. The joint probabilities we learn about diseases through the PRISM features via PRISM generative models are transferable and generalizable to multiple diseases. DISCUSSION: The Generative Transfer Learning (GTL) approach with PRISM classifiers enables the scalable validation of computable phenotypes in EHRs without the need for domain-specific knowledge about specific disease processes.

The outcome was in-hospital mortality. Fine and Gray competing risks multivariate model (with discharge as a competing event) was used to develop a prediction rule for in-hospital mortality. Discrimination and calibration were assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and by Brier score in both the derivation and validation cohorts. Seven variables were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality: age (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.08, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.07-1.09), male sex (HR 1.62, 95%CI 1.30-2.00), duration of symptoms before hospital admission <10 days (HR 1.72, 95%CI 1.39-2.12), diabetes (HR 1.21, 95%CI 1.02-1.45), coronary heart disease (HR 1.40 95% CI 1.09-1.80), chronic liver disease (HR 1.78, 95%CI 1.16-2.72), and lactate dehydrogenase levels at admission (HR 1.0003, 95%CI 1.0002-1.0005).

The R0 in this study was estimated to be between 2 and 3 in Qom. Of the four countries studied, the lowest R0 was estimated in South Korea (1.5-2) and the highest in Iran (4-5). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that R0 is sensitive to the applied mean generation time. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to estimate R0 in Qom.

Recently, cytokine storm by the host immune system has been linked with high viral load, loss of lung function, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure, and subsequent fatal outcome. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify potential FDA approved drugs that can be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment using an in-silico analysis. METHODS: In this study, virtual screening of selected FDA approved drugs was performed by targeting the main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2 and the key molecules involved in the Cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. Based on our preliminary screening supported by extensive literature search, we selected FDA approved drugs to target the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) and the key players of cytokine storm, TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1. These compounds were examined based on systematic docking studies and further validated using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanic/generalized/Born/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/G/P/BSA) free energy calculations. RESULTS: Based on the findings, Rifampicin and Letermovir appeared as the most promising drug showing a very good binding affinity with the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1. However, it is pertinent to mention here that our findings need further validation by in vitro analysis and clinical trials.

Adhesive bacteria and their biofilms on the surface of food processing equipment are the sources of cross-contamination, leading to the risk for humans. Slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW) has been proposed as a novel sanitizer in the food and agriculture industry. In this study, we investigated the changes in the physical properties of SAEW under different conditions and the disinfection abilities of SAEW against spore-forming and non-spore-forming pathogens. Furthermore, we examined the disinfection abilities of SAEW after 12 months of shelf life on a mixed-species biofilm of Listeria monocytogenes Scott A and Staphylococcus aureus. The results showed that SAEW at 30 and 50 ppm achieved all-kill of the spore-forming pathogen Bacillus cereus within 30 s. Changes in the ACC and pH of the produced SAEW were generally affected by the storage conditions. Both spore-forming and non-spore-forming pathogens were not detected under treatment with 50 ppm SAEW for 5 min under HDPE-closed conditions throughout the whole storage period. Moreover, 25 mg/L SAEW can inactivate L. monocytogenes Scott A and S. aureus biofilm cells in ~2.45 and 2.57 log CFU/mL in biofilms within 5-min treatment. However, the decline of the two bacteria in the mixed-species biofilm was 1.95 and 1.43 log CFU/mL, respectively. The changes in the cell membrane permeability of the mixed-species biofilm under treatment with SAEW were observed by using atomic force microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. L. monocytogenes Scott A was more sensitive to SAEW in the mixed-species biofilm cells. These findings exhibited strong antibiofilm activities of SAEW in impairing biofilm cell membranes, decreasing cell density, and eliminating biofilm, which suggest that SAEW is an excellent antibacterial agent in the food processing industries.","output":"Stability and Antibiofilm Efficiency of Slightly Acidic Electrolyzed Water Against Mixed-Species of Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Self-supervised learning methods have witnessed a recent surge of interest after proving successful in multiple application fields.

To search for potential anti-fibrotic compounds, we performed a high-throughput compound screen in primary human HSC myofibroblasts and identified 19 small molecules that induce HSC inactivation, including the polyether ionophore nanchangmycin (NCMC).

This study aimed to investigate the variation in radiation therapy fractionation in breast cancer patients in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, and to estimate survival outcome and cost implications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a population-based cohort of patients who received radiation therapy for breast cancer (2009-2013), as captured in the NSW Central Cancer Registry. A logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with fractionation type. Survival outcome was estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. Cost per treatment and potential cost saving associated with evidence-based fractionation was estimated. RESULTS: A total of 10,482 patients were available for analysis, divided into 3 cohorts (breast alone: N = 7000; breast + nodes: N = 1119; all chestwall: N = 2363). In multivariable analysis, increasing age, laterality (right), year of treatment (2013), early stage, lower socioeconomic status, and regional area of residence were independent predictors of hypofractionation for breast alone radiation therapy. For the breast + nodes and chest wall cohorts, common factors that predicted the use of hypofractionation were increasing age. In multivariable survival analysis, there was no difference between the fractionation regimens at 5 years.

Therefore, this study designed to further improvement of culture conditions and designing a cost-effective culture medium with minimum changes in pathogenicity for in vitro culture of P. berghei. RESULTS: Results indicated that the rate of parasitaemia in our modified method remained statistically stable between days one to seven (P = 0.07). The current modified cultivation method was more efficient in maintaining of parasites for further days. Furthermore, in current method the stability of parasitaemia rate during day1 to day7 was in better rate compared to that in Ronan Jambou et al. and the differences between two methods were statistically significant (P = 0.001). The virulence of cultivated parasites in our modified method remained similar to frozen stock parasites as positive control group. No significant differences were seen in survival time between two groups of mice those were infected with either cultivated parasites or stock freeze parasites (P = 0.39) with the mean survival time of 20.83  3.84 and 19.66  1.21 days, respectively.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort of patients with COVID-19 seen from 3 March to 29 October 2020. We described the distribution of underlying comorbidities, quality of care metrics, demographic and social determinants of health (SDOH) indicators across race groups. We also described clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients including length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, readmission and mortality. We performed multivariable analyses for hospitalisation risk among all patients with COVID-19 and stratifyied by race and sex. SETTING: KPGA, an integrated healthcare system. PARTICIPANTS: 5712 patients who all had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Of them, 57.8% were female, 58.4% black, 29.5% white, 8.5% Hispanic and 3.6% Asian. RESULTS: Black patients had the highest proportions of living in neighborhoods under the federal poverty line (12.4%) and in more deprived locations (neighbourhood deprivation index=0.4). Overall, 14.4% (n=827) of this cohort was hospitalised. Asian patients had the highest rates of ICU admission (53.1%) and mechanical ventilation (21.9%). Among all patients, Hispanics (adjusted 1.60, 95% CI (1.08, 2.37)), blacks (1.43 (1.13, 1.83)), age in years (1.03 (1.02, 1.04)) and living in a zip code with high unemployment (1.08 (1.03, 1.13)) were associated with higher odds of hospitalisation. COVID-19 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2.59 (1.67, 4.02)), chronic heart failure (1.79 (1.31, 2.45)), immunocompromised (1.77 (1.16, 2.70)), with glycated haemoglobin >8% (1.68 (1.19, 2.38)), depression (1.60 (1.24, 2.06)), hypertension (1.5 (1.21, 1.87)) and physical inactivity (1.25 (1.03, 1.51)) had higher odds of hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: Black and Hispanic KPGA patients were at higher odds of hospitalisation, but not mortality, compared with other race groups. Beyond previously reported sociodemographics and comorbidities, factors such as quality of care, lifestyle behaviours and SDOH indicators should be considered when designing and implementing interventions to reduce COVID-19 racial disparities.","output":"Clinical, behavioural and social factors associated with racial disparities in COVID-19 patients from an integrated healthcare system in Georgia: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted people?s daily routines and infused their lives with considerable insecurity and uncertainty However, individuals? responses to the pandemic vary widely The present study investigates the role of personality traits for key aspects of people?s responses to the COVID-19 crisis In a prospective design using a large-scale panel study (N?=?2217) that represents the heterogeneity of the adult population in Germany, we examined whether Big Five domains and facets measured prior to the pandemic predicted individuals? responses to the pandemic in terms of: (a) perceptions of infection risks;(b) behavioral changes to prevent infection;(c) beliefs in the effectiveness of policy measures to combat the further spread of coronavirus;and (d) trust in relevant policymakers and institutions regarding the handling of coronavirus Results revealed that personality explained only a small portion (between 0 6% and 3 8%) of the variance in the four outcomes Nonetheless, several Big Five domains and facets had at least small-to-moderate, and theoretically plausible, associations with the outcomes Overall, Agreeableness and its Trust facet showed the most robust associations with the four outcomes Most trait?outcome associations were also robust to controlling for three possible confounders (sex, age, and risk-group membership)","output":"Does personality predict responses to the COVID-19 crisis?

Sialic acids are a group of nine-carbon acidic &#945;-keto sugars, usually located at the end of glycans of cell surface glycoconjugates and serve as attachment sites for previous HCoVs. It is therefore speculated that sialic acids on the host cell surface could serve as co-receptors or attachment factors for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry as well. Recent in-silico modeling, molecular modeling predictions and microscopy studies indicate potential sialic acid-binding by SARS-CoV-2 upon cell entry. In particular, a flat sialic acid-binding domain was proposed at the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein, which may lead to the initial contact and interaction of the virus on the epithelium followed by higher affinity binding to ACE2 receptor, likely a two-step attachment fashion. However, recent in vitro and ex vivo studies of sialic acids on ACE2 receptor confirmed an opposite role for SARS-CoV-2 binding. In particular, neuraminidase treatment of epithelial cells and ACE2-expressing 293 T cells increased SARS-CoV-2 binding. Further, the ACE2 glycosylation mutants indicate that sialic acids on ACE2 receptor prevent ACE2-spike protein interaction. On the other hand, a most recent study indicates that gangliosides could serve as ligands for receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

However, there is no effective educational program for developing relevant skills and knowledge among these nurses. Therefore, this study aims to assess the feasibility of a newly developed web-based self-learning program to promote the involvement of public health nurses in the local healthcare planning process. METHODS: A pilot randomized control trial randomly allocated eligible public health nurses to intervention and control wait-list groups [1:1]. The former will be exposed to six web-based learning modules from July to October 2021. After collecting post-test data, the wait-list group will be exposed to the same modules to ensure learning equity. The primary outcome will be evaluated by implementing a validated and standardized scale designed to measure public health policy competencies at the baseline and post-intervention, while secondary outcome will be measured on an action scale to demonstrate the necessity of healthcare activities. The third outcome will be the knowledge and skills related to local healthcare planning by public health nurses. The participants will provide feedback through free descriptions on the trial feasibility and a web-based self-learning program to identify improvement points for continual refinement.

Although there are effective treatment approaches for PTSD, such as Prolonged Exposure (PE) and Cognitive Processing Therapy, many providers trained in these approaches do not use them, or use them without sufficient fidelity, and veterans drop out of these treatments at very high rates. The time intensive nature of these treatments is frequently cited as a barrier to receiving the treatment among veterans and delivering the treatment among providers. According, there is an urgent need to establish more efficient and effective PTSD treatment approaches in order to meet the needs of veterans seeking care. Written exposure therapy (WET) is an efficient, exposure-based treatment, and may represent a plausible alternative treatment option to address PTSD in veterans. Although WET has been found to be effective and non-inferior to more time intensive trauma-focused treatment, it has not yet been investigated with a veteran sample. In an ongoing randomized controlled trial (RCT) we are investigating whether WET is non-inferior in treating PTSD compared with the more time intensive PE. The study sample will include 150 men and women veterans diagnosed with PTSD who are randomly assigned to either WET (n = 75) or PE (n = 75). Participants are assessed prior to treatment and 10-, 20-, and 30-weeks after the first treatment session. The primary outcome is PTSD symptom severity assessed with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5.

An evidence-based symptom criteria for identifying HCWs for testing, based on the probability of positive COVID-19 test results, would allow for a more appropriate use of testing resources. METHODS: This was an observational study of outpatient COVID-19 testing of HCWs. Prior to testing, HCWs were asked about the presence of 10 symptoms. Their responses were then compared to their subsequent pharyngeal swab COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test results. These data were used to derive and evaluate a symptom-based testing criteria. RESULTS: A total of 961 HCWs were included in the analysis, of whom 225 (23%) had positive test results. Loss of taste or smell was the symptom with the largest positive likelihood ratio (3.33). Dry cough, regardless of the presence or absence of other symptoms, was the most sensitive (74%) and the least specific (32%) symptom. The existing testing criteria consisting of any combination of one or more of three symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, dry cough) was 93% sensitive and 9% specific (area unce the curve [AUC] = 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.59 to 0.67). The derived testing criteria consisting of any combination of one or more of two symptoms (fever, loss of taste or smell) was 89% sensitive and 48% specific (AUC = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.71 to 0.78).

The regulation regarding healthcare wastes in Turkey was updated in 2005 in accordance with the European Union (EU) waste directives, but it still falls behind meeting the requirements of current waste treatment technologies. Therefore, this study aims to reveal deficiencies, inconsistencies, and improper applications of healthcare waste management in the western part of the Turkish Black Sea Region. In this study, it was revealed that nearly 1 million people live in the region, resulting in 5 million hospital admissions annually. All the healthcare waste produced (1000 tons yr(-1)) is treated in an autoclave plant. However, treating some categories of healthcare wastes in autoclave units mismatches with the EU waste regulations, as alternative treatment technologies are not technically able to treat all types of healthcare wastes. A proper waste management system, therefore, requires an internal segregation scheme to divert these wastes from the main healthcare waste stream. The existing malpractice in the region could cause serious health problems if no measure is taken urgently. It is expected that healthcare waste management in the region and then all across Turkey will be improved with the significant deficiencies and inconsistencies pointed out in this research. IMPLICATIONS In developed countries, specific rules and regulations have already been implemented along with the recommendations for handling of healthcare waste.

Objective: Perform a meta-analysis of the available randomized clinical trial evidence for fluvoxamine in the outpatient management of COVID-19. Data Sources: World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. Study Selection: Completed outpatient trials with available results which compared fluvoxamine to placebo. Data Extraction and Synthesis: We followed the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. We extracted study details in terms of inclusion criteria, trial demographics and the pre-specified outcome of all-cause hospitalization. Risk of bias was assessed by the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. We conducted a frequentist random effects meta-analysis, as well as two sensitivity analyses using a Bayesian random effects meta-analysis with different estimates of prior probability: a weakly neutral prior (50% chance of efficacy with 95% confidence interval for Risk Ratio [RR] between 0.5 and 2) and a moderately optimistic prior (85% chance of efficacy). We contextualized the results by estimating the probability of any effect (RR []1) and moderate effect (RR []0.9) on reducing hospitalization. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): All cause hospitalization. Results: 2196 participants were included from 3 identified trials. The risk ratios for hospitalization were 0.75 (95%CI, 0.57-0.97) for the frequentist analysis, 0.78 (95%CI 0.58-1.08) for the Bayesian weakly neutral prior, and 0.73 (95%CI, 0.53-1.01) for the Bayesian moderately optimistic prior. Depending on the scenario, the probability of any effect on hospitalization ranged from 94.1% to 98.3% and a moderate effect from 81.6% to 91.1%. Conclusions and Relevance: Under a variety of assumptions, fluvoxamine shows a high probability of preventing hospitalization in outpatients with COVID-19. While ongoing randomized trials are important to evaluate alternative doses, explore the effectiveness in vaccinated patients, and provide further refinement to these estimates, fluvoxamine could be recommended as a treatment option, particularly in resource-limited settings or persons without access to SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody therapy or direct antivirals.","output":"Fluvoxamine for Outpatient COVID-19 to Prevent Hospitalization: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CNN-based transfer learning method plays a significant role in the detection of various objects such as cars, dogs, motorcycles, face and human detection in nighttime images by using visible light camera sensors.

In this study we aimed to evaluate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of siRNA both in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: To identify the most effective molecule out of a panel of 15 in silico designed siRNAs, an in vitro screening system based on vectors expressing SARS-CoV-2 genes fused with the firefly luciferase reporter gene and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells was used. The most potent siRNA, siR-7, was modified by Locked nucleic acids (LNAs) to obtain siR-7-EM with increased stability and was formulated with the peptide dendrimer KK-46 for enhancing cellular uptake to allow topical application by inhalation of the final formulation - siR-7-EM/KK-46. Using the Syrian Hamster model for SARS-CoV-2 infection the antiviral capacity of siR-7-EM/KK-46 complex was evaluated. RESULTS: We identified the siRNA, siR-7, targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) as the most efficient siRNA inhibiting viral replication in vitro. Moreover, we showed that LNA-modification and complexation with the designed peptide dendrimer enhanced the antiviral capacity of siR-7 in vitro. We demonstrated significant reduction of virus titer and lung inflammation in animals exposed to inhalation of siR-7-EM/KK-46 in vivo.

In this study, we evaluated changes in endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in a cohort of convalescent COVID-19 patients undergoing pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). METHODS: After swab test negativization, convalescent COVID-19 patients referring to a post-acute care facility for PR were consecutively screened for inclusion. Study procedures were performed at the time of hospitalization and discharge. RESULTS: We enrolled 82 convalescent COVID-19 patients (85.4% males, mean age 60.4 years). After PR, a significant improvement in most pulmonary function tests and exercise capacity was documented. FMD changed from 2.48% +/- 2.01 to 4.24% +/- 2.81 (p &lt; 0.001), corresponding to a 70.9% increase. Significantly higher changes in FMD were found in patients without a history of vascular events as compared to those with (+2.04% +/- 2.30 vs. +0.61% +/- 1.83, p = 0.013). Values of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1%), forced vital capacity (FVC%) and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO%) significantly and directly correlated with FMD both at baseline and after PR. Patients with normal FEV1% (&gt;=80% predicted) during the overall study period or those normalizing FEV1% after PR showed a more significant FMD change as compared to patients with persistently impaired FEV1% (&lt;80% predicted) (p for trend = 0.029). This finding was confirmed in a multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically evaluated endothelial function improves after PR in convalescent COVID-19 patients.

Methods: Physicians were queried about their current approach to prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE in patients with COVID-19 using an online survey tool distributed through multiple international organizations between April 10 and 14, 2020. Results: 515 physicians responded from 41 countries.

The trimer structure shows an extensive hydrophobic core along the 3-fold axis that resembles that of a trimeric leucine/isoleucine zipper, but with tetrad, not heptad, repeat. The trimeric core is strong in bicelles, resisting hydrogen-deuterium exchange for weeks. Although highly stable, structural guided mutagenesis identified single mutations that can completely dissociate the TMD trimer. Multiple studies have shown that the membrane anchor of viral fusion protein can form highly specific oligomers, but the exact function of these oligomers remain unclear.

Using the example of a clinic for visceral, transplantation, thorax and vascular surgery (VTTG), the performance development of inpatient care in the first 7 weeks in comparison to the previous year as well as an evaluation of the compensation measures laid down by law were evaluated. METHODOLOGY: Based on the performance figures, a comparison was made between the period from 16 March to 3 May 2019 and the same period in 2020. Changes in the number of cases, case mix, case mix index and day mix index as well as the bed occupancy days were recorded. The monetary measures from the COVID-19 Hospital Relief Act were applied to these changes and the adequacy was evaluated. RESULTS: Compared to the previous year there was a decrease in inpatient admissions of 120 patients during the observation period. As a result there was a decrease of 370 points in case mix and 1433 days of occupancy. For the whole VTTG this resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately 0.8a?million ?, which was completely compensated by the flat rate payment for empty beds. The individual areas of the VTTG showed a heterogeneous picture in relation to the compensation for the loss of revenue. Elective units in particular showed a shortfall up to 128,163a?? with respect to inpatient treatment for 7 weeks. CONCLUSION: The measures taken by the Government are an important support for the economic security of German hospitals. The lack of differentiation of measures by specialty leads to a heterogeneous picture in compensation for VTTG revenues and has to be understood as an alarm signal especially for elective surgical healthcare.","output":"Wie stark trifft die Corona-Pandemie die chirurgische Klinik eines universit?ren Maximalversorgers? : Eine Analyse der ersten 7 Wochen./ [How severe is the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on the department of surgery of a university hospital? : An analysis of the first 7 weeks]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19), a 2020 pandemic, has been linked to another global health problem, the diabetes pandemic.

Therefore, this study investigated the influence of inspiratory muscle-loaded exercise training (IMLET) on peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), respiratory responses, and exercise performance under normoxic (N) and hypoxic (H) exercise conditions. We hypothesised that IMLET enhances respiratory muscle strength and improves respiratory response, thereby improving VO2peak and work capacity under H condition. Methods Sixteen university track runners (13 men and 3 women) were randomly assigned to the IMLET (n = 8) or exercise training (ET) group (n = 8). All subjects underwent 4 weeks of 20-min 60% VO2peak cycling exercise training, thrice per week. IMLET loaded 50% of maximal inspiratory pressure during exercise. At pre- and post-training periods, subjects performed exhaustive incremental cycling under normoxic (N; 20.9  0%) and hypoxic (H; 15.0  0.1%) conditions. Results Although maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) significantly increased after training in both groups, the extent of PImax increase was significantly higher in the IMLET group (from 102  20 to 145  26 cmH2O in IMLET; from 111  23 to 127  23 cmH2O in ET; P < 0.05). In both groups, VO2peak and maximal work load (Wmax) similarly increased both under N and H conditions after training (P < 0.05). Further, the extent of Wmax decrease under H condition was lower in the IMLET group at post-training test than at pre-training (from - 14.7  2.2% to - 12.5  1.7%; P < 0.05). Maximal minute ventilation in both N and H conditions increased after training than in the pre-training period.

We sought to compare the results of cfNGS to conventional diagnostic test results and describe the impact of cfNGS on clinical care in a diverse pediatric population at a large academic childrens hospital. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of hospitalized subjects at a tertiary pediatric hospital to determine the diagnostic yield of cfNGS and its impact on clinical care. RESULTS: We describe the clinical application of results from 142 cfNGS tests in the management of 110 subjects over an 8-month study period.

Computational chemistry can assist in the identification of moieties able to lead to new drugs to fight the disease. Fullerenes and carbon nanomaterials can interact with proteins and are considered promising antiviral agents. Here, we propose the possibility to repurpose fullerenes to clog the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 protease, M(pro). Through the use of docking, molecular dynamics, and energy decomposition techniques, it is shown that C(60) has a substantial binding energy to the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, M(pro), higher than masitinib, a known inhibitor of the protein. Furthermore, we suggest the use of C(70) as an innovative scaffold for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). At odds with masitinib, both C(60) and C(70) interact more strongly with SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) when different protonation states of the catalytic dyad are considered. The binding of fullerenes to M(pro) is due to shape complementarity, i.e., vdW interactions, and is aspecific. As such, it is not sensitive to mutations that can eliminate or invert the charges of the amino acids composing the binding pocket. Fullerenic cages should therefore be more effective against the SARS-CoV-2 virus than the available inhibitors such as masinitib, where the electrostatic term plays a crucial role in the binding.","output":"Fullerenes against COVID-19: Repurposing C(60) and C(70) to Clog the Active Site of SARS-CoV-2 Protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People from rural areas of Nepal struggle to have access to adequate medical care on time.

Design/methodology/approach Based on the classical leadership theory, two channel leadership strategies, i.e. LPL and SL, are considered. The proposed framework first derives the equilibrium price and service quality level decision among the supplier, the logistics provider and the retailer. Then it compares both leadership strategies in terms of the equilibrium prices and service quality theoretically. This article also presents a case study of Arabian dates pricing and supply chain to test the theoretically derived propositions. Findings Selection of suitable leadership strategy is a critical factor for profit maximization of the supply chain drivers and proper optimization of equilibrium price and service quality. Here, the product's quality and the market's socio-economic condition play an important role in selecting a suitable leadership strategy. A random transformation of the physical market to an e-commerce portal creates a wide variation of the market's socio-economic parameters, affecting the equilibrium pricing and the logistics provider's service quality. Research limitations/implications This study proposes a post-COVID-19 resilient agri-supply chain framework considering price and quality-dependent stochastic market demand, incorporating a wide range of socio-economic factors in the model to counteract the effect of rapid behavior change of agri-market due to COVID-19 norms. This research examines the effect of different channel leadership strategies to facilitate suitable decisions on prices and service quality and retrieve the profit of the supplier, retailer and logistics provider. The future models can incorporate competitiveness in logistics outsourcing, fourth-party logistics (4PL) and contract farming in the agri-supply chain. Each of the extensions can open avenues in different directions. Practical implications As the post-COVID-19 market and the customer behavior is randomly changing, and the traditional market is rapidly converting into supermarkets and e-commerce portals, this paper examines the model with a wide variety of e-commerce portals with multi-variation of product. It is conclusive that the product's quality and the market's socio-economic behavior significantly impact the equilibrium decision. The drivers of the supply chain must take them into account before choosing a particular channel leadership strategy. Originality/value This study considers a multi-product and multi-market (e-commerce) model by integrating a wide variety of products and the market's socio-economic parameters. The model is tested in a price and quality-dependent stochastic market condition, contributing to the literature by reconciling two different channel leadership strategies into the global logistics of fresh agri-product.","output":"A resilient pricing and service quality level decision for fresh agri-product supply chain in post-COVID-19 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: One of the main pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the severe course of COVID-19 is the hyper-inflammatory syndrome associated with progressive damage of lung tissue and multi-organ dysfunction. IL-17 has been suggested to be involved in hyper-inflammatory syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the IL-17 inhibitor netakimab in patients with severe COVID-19. Study design. In our retrospective case-control study we evaluated the efficacy of netakimab in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 outside the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients in the experimental group were treated with standard of care therapy and netakimab at a dose of 120 mg subcutaneously. RESULTS: 171 patients with severe COVID-19 were enrolled in our study, and 88 of them received netakimab. On the 3 day of therapy, body temperature, SpO2/FiO2, NEWS2 score, and CRP improved significantly in the netakimab group compared to the control group. Other clinical outcomes such as transfer to ICU (11.4% vs 9.6%), need for mechanical ventilation (10.2% vs 9.6%), 28-day mortality (10.2% vs 8.4%), did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSION: In hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, anti-IL-17 therapy might mitigate the inflammatory response and improve oxygenation, but do not affect the need for mechanical ventilation and mortality.","output":"Anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibodies in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19: A pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The newly emergent human virus SARS-CoV-2 is resulting in high fatality rates and incapacitated health systems.

We analysed key parameters of epidemic spread to estimate the contribution of different transmission routes and determine requirements for case isolation and contact-tracing needed to stop the epidemic. We conclude that viral spread is too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing, but could be controlled if this process was faster, more efficient and happened at scale. A contact-tracing App which builds a memory of proximity contacts and immediately notifies contacts of positive cases can achieve epidemic control if used by enough people. By targeting recommendations to only those at risk, epidemics could be contained without need for mass quarantines ('lock-downs') that are harmful to society.

A secondary aim was to investigate whether associations varied by age. METHODS The cohort comprised COVID-19 positive Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients (N=9,347). For each outcome, we fit piecewise logistic regression models with restricted cubic splines (knots at BMIs of 23, 30, 39), adjusting for: age, sex, comorbidities, VHA nursing home residence, and race/ethnicity. Supplemental analyses included age-by-BMI interaction terms (alpha=0.05). RESULTS We found evidence of a nonlinear J-curve association between BMI and likelihood of hospitalization and mortality. BMI was associated with increased odds for hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality among patients with BMIs 30-39, but decreased odds of hospitalization and mortality for patients with BMIs 23-30. Patients under age 75 with BMIs 30-39 had increased odds for mortality with increasing BMI. CONCLUSION Odds for severe outcomes with COVID-19 infection increased with increasing BMI for people with, but not without obesity. This non-linear relationship should be tested in future research.

We evaluated that optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) measurement, which can reflect intracranial pressure, may be a criterion for decision of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) success. METHODS: 28 adult patients suffering long overt standing ventriculomegaly (LOVA) who performed ETV were included in this retrospective study. The patients were divided into two groups as successful (group A) and failed ETV group (group B) according to their postoperative evaluation. ONSD was measured on pre- and post-operative computed tomography (CT) and Evan's index (EI), diameter of third ventricule (V3), the patency of ETV stoma and periventricular edema were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: The mean ONSD was measured as 6.390.92mm for the right eye, 6.500.91mm for the left eye on preoperative CT. The mean ONSD by CT (after surgery) was 4.890.87mm for the right eye, 5.020.1mm for the left eye (p<0.05). Postoperative group A and group B were compared according to ONSD measurement; mean ONSD in group A was 4.520.69mm for the right and 4.590.9mm for the left, mean ONSD in group B was 5.820.51mm for the right and 6.10.32mm for the left (p<0.05). The best ONSD value for detecting failed ETV was 5.40mm (sensitivity 90%, specifity 75%, AUROC 0.938) for right and 5.91mm (sensitivity 90%, specifity 75%, AUROC 0.950) for left. EE was measured as 0.390.12mm on preoperative MRI and 0.390.12mm on postoperative MRI (p=0.3). V3 was measured as 14.72.47mm on preoperative MRI and 10.471.99mm on postoperative MRI (p<0.05).

This study explored the experiences and perspectives of volunteer contact tracers in order to identify facilitators, challenges, and novel solutions for implementing COVID-19 contact tracing. METHODS: As part of a study to evaluate an emergently established volunteer contact tracing program for COVID-19 in New Haven, Connecticut, April-June 2020, we conducted focus groups with 36 volunteer contact tracers, thematically analyzed the data, and synthesized the findings using the RE-AIM implementation framework. RESULTS: To successfully reach cases and contacts, participants recommended identifying clients outreach preferences, engaging clients authentically, and addressing sources of mistrust. Participants felt that the effectiveness of successful isolation and quarantine was contingent on minimizing delays in reaching clients and on systematically assessing and addressing their nutritional, financial, and housing needs. They felt that successful adoption of a volunteer-driven contact tracing model depended on the ability to recruit self-motivated contact tracers and provide rapid training and consistent, supportive supervision. Participants noted that implementation could be enhanced with better management tools, such as more engaging interview scripts, user-friendly data management software, and protocols for special situations and populations. They also emphasized the value of coordinating outreach efforts with other involved providers and agencies. Finally, they believed that long-term maintenance of a volunteer-driven program requires monetary or educational incentives to sustain participation. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies to qualitatively examine implementation of a volunteer-run COVID-19 contact tracing program. Participants identified facilitators, barriers, and potential solutions for improving implementation of COVID-19 contact tracing in this context. These included standardized communication skills training, supportive supervision, and peer networking to improve implementation, as well as greater cooperation with outside agencies, flexible scheduling, and volunteer incentives to promote sustainability.","output":"Implementation of a volunteer contact tracing program for COVID-19 in the United States: A qualitative focus group study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 lockdown has led all the citizens (mobile subscribers) of India to stay at home and rather work from home. The people have started consuming more channel utilization (in mobile communication) through a continuous long duration conversations and more internet data through more streaming content as well as logging on to work from home. It was also reflected in how data demand from residential areas rose as compared to commercial areas. Consequently the bandwidth and channel saturation has evolved out to be a severe problem thereby affecting the work performance of all online offices and multi-national companies. This research paper proposes the simulation based experimental study of DITMC technique for mitigating this effect with a special concern in North Western Rajasthan part of India. The simulation results show that significant enhancement of 60.52% in channel utilization and bandwidth optimization is possible with negligible overhead of 0.23%. This technique also enables the telecom operators to ponder research in this field that will promisingly lead to manage augmented number of mobile subscribers (independent of any lockdown period) in limited bandwidth thereby using the spectrum efficiently.","output":"Mitigating the Effect of COVID Lockdown Period on Channel and Bandwidth Utilization in Mobile Communication Network in North Western Rajasthan (India)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work, a novel imidazolium bonding method was proposed for the synthesis of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) stationary phases.

We used VAERS data to examine cardiac AEs, primarily myocarditis, reported following injection of the first or second dose of the COVID-19 injectable products. Myocarditis rates reported in VAERS were significantly higher in youths between the ages of 13 to 23 (p<0.0001) with 80% occurring in males. Within 8 weeks of the public offering of COVID-19 products to the 12-15-year-old age group, we found 19 times the expected number of myocarditis cases in the vaccination volunteers over background myocarditis rates for this age group. In addition, a 5-fold increase in myocarditis rate was observed subsequent to dose 2 as opposed to dose 1 in 15-year-old males. A total of 67% of all cases occurred with BNT162b2. Of the total myocarditis AE reports, 6 individuals died (1.1%) and of these, 2 were under 20 years of age - 1 was 13. These findings suggest a markedly higher risk for myocarditis subsequent to COVID-19 injectable product use than for other known vaccines, and this is well above known background rates for myocarditis. COVID-19 injectable products are novel and have a genetic, pathogenic mechanism of action causing uncontrolled expression of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein within human cells. When you combine this fact with the temporal relationship of AE occurrence and reporting, biological plausibility of cause and effect, and the fact that these data are internally and externally consistent with emerging sources of clinical data, it supports a conclusion that the COVID-19 biological products are deterministic for the myocarditis cases observed after injection.","output":"A Report on Myocarditis Adverse Events in the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) in Association with COVID-19 Injectable Biological Products"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Exposure to phthalate esters may be linked to the risk of high blood pressure (HBP), but limited evidence is available in Chinese children. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between nine phthalate metabolites (mPAEs) and systolic/diastolic BP, pulse pressure (PP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and the risk of HBP. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 1044 primary school children (6-8 years old) were enrolled from Shenzhen, China, between 2016 and 2017. Nine mPAEs were analyzed from urine using ultra-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. A multivariable linear regression model was used to explore the associations between phthalate exposure and systolic/diastolic BP, PP, and MAP. A binary logistic regression model was used to examine the associations between phthalate exposure and the risk of HBP. RESULTS: Monomethyl phthalate (MMP) concentrations were significantly higher in HBP children than normal BP children. MMP, monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP), monobutyl phthalate (MnBP), mono(5-carboxy-2-ethylpentyl) phthalate, mono-[(2-carboxy methyl)hexyl] phthalate (MCMHP), the sum of four short-chain mPAEs (&#8721;LMW), and the sum of all nine mPAEs (&#8721;9mPAEs) were significantly positively associated with increases in systolic BP z-score, while only MMP was significantly positively associated with diastolic BP z-score.

We performed a timely analysis of the Bavarian telestroke TEMPiS \\"working diagnosis\\" database. METHODS: Twelve hospitals from the TEMPiS network were selected. Data collected for January through April in years 2017 through 2020 were extracted and analyzed for presumed and definite ischemic stroke (IS), amongst other disorders. In addition, recommendations for intravenous thrombolysis (rtPA) and endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) were noted and mobility data of the region analyzed. If statistically valid, group-comparison was tested with Fisher's exact test considering unpaired observations and ap-value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Upon lockdown in mid-March 2020, we observed a significant reduction in recommendations for rtPA compared to the preceding three years (14.7% [2017-2019] vs. 9.2% [2020], p = 0.0232). Recommendations for EVT were significantly higher in January to mid-March 2020 compared to 2017-2019 (5.4% [2017-2019] vs. 9.3% [2020], p = 0.0013) reflecting its increasing importance.

The following data on patients with orthopedic diseases were collected: outpatient visits, hospital admission, and surgical modalities. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a 22%-29% and 20%-26% reduction in outpatients, 22%-27% and 25%-37% reduction in admissions, and 26%-35% and 18%-34% reduction in surgeries, respectively, at both hospitals. The weekly mean number of patients was significantly smaller during the COVID-19 pandemic for all types of surgery and elective surgeries at the university hospital, and for all types of surgery, elective surgeries, and total knee arthroplasties at the community hospital. Further, patients visiting the community hospital during the pandemic were significantly younger, for all types of surgery, elective surgeries, and total knee arthroplasties.

We evaluate the effect of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. PATIENTS AND METHODS: French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point. RESULTS: Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported in the litterature for untreated patients. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. CONCLUSION: Despite its small sample size, our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.","output":"Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Landmark reports from reputable sources have concluded that the United States wastes hundreds of billions of dollars every year on medical care that does not improve health outcomes While there is widespread agreement over how wasteful medical care spending is defined, there is no consensus on its magnitude or categories A shared understanding of the magnitude and components of the issue may aid in systematically reducing wasteful spending and creating opportunities for these funds to improve public health To this end, we performed a review and crosswalk analysis of the literature to retrieve comprehensive estimates of wasteful medical care spending We abstracted each source's definitions, categories of waste, and associated dollar amounts We synthesized and reclassified waste into 6 categories: clinical inefficiencies, missed prevention opportunities, overuse, administrative waste, excessive prices, and fraud and abuse Aggregate estimates of waste varied from $600 billion to more than $1 9 trillion per year, or roughly $1800 to $5700 per person per year Wider recognition by public health stakeholders of the human and economic costs of medical waste has the potential to catalyze health system transformation (Am J Public Health 2020;110:17431748 https://doi org/102105/AJPH 2020 305865)","output":"Excess Medical Care Spending: The Categories, Magnitude, and Opportunity Costs of Wasteful Spending in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lipid enveloped viruses contain a lipid bilayer coat that protects their genome to help facilitate entry into the new host cell.

Although many methods have been proposed to solve this problem, three important challenges have not been well addressed so far: (1) most existing methods are based on recurrent network, which is time-consuming to train long sequences due to not allowing for full parallelism; (2) personalized preferences generally are not considered reasonably; (3) existing methods rarely systematically studied how to efficiently utilize various auxiliary information (e.g., user ID and timestamp) in trajectory data and the spatio-temporal relations among non-consecutive locations. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel method named SanMove, a self-attention network based model, to predict the next location via capturing the long- and short-term mobility patterns of users. Specifically, SanMove introduces a long-term preference learning module, and it uses a self-attention module to capture the users long-term mobility pattern which can represent personalized location preferences of users. Meanwhile, SanMove uses a spatial-temporal guided non-invasive self-attention (STNOVA) to exploit auxiliary information to learn short-term preferences.

Large variations in COVID-19 prevalence and incidence have been reported across and within many countries worldwide; however, this remains poorly understood. The variability and susceptibility across the world have been mainly attributed to differing socioeconomic status, burden of chronic diseases, access to health care, strength of health care systems, and early or late adoption of control measures. Environmental factors such as pollution, ambient temperature, humidity, and seasonal weather patterns at different latitudes may influence how severe the pandemic is and the incidence of infection in any part of the world. In addition, recent epidemiological data have been used to propose that altitude of residence may not only influence those environmental features considered key to lesser viral transmission, but also susceptibility to more severe forms of COVID-19 through hypoxic-hypobaria driven genomic or nongenomic adaptations specific to high-altitude populations.

METHODS: Twenty individuals with SCI were randomized to receive rTMS (REAL, n = 11) or sham stimulation (SHAM, n = 9) and usual care for 4 weeks. rTMS (20 Hz, 1800 pulses per session) or sham stimulation was delivered over leg M1 MondayCFriday before lower limb resistance training or physical therapy. Lower limb maximal muscle strength (MVC) and gait function were assessed pre- and post intervention. Lower extremity motor score (LEMS) was assessed at admission and at discharge. RESULTS: One individual dropped out due to seizure. More prominent increases in total leg (effect size (ES): 0.40), knee flexor (ES: 0.29), and knee extensor MVC (ES: 0.34) were observed in REAL compared to SHAM; however, repeated-measures ANOVA revealed no clear main effects for any outcome measure (treatment p > 0.15, treatment  time p > 0.76, time p > 0.23).

However, the underlying mechanism of such association remains largely unknown. Most disease-associated genetic variants have been shown to reside in noncoding regions, leading to the hypothesis that regulation of gene expression may be the primary biological mechanism. Current methods to characterize gene expression mediating the effect of genetic variant on diseases, often analyzed one gene at a time and ignored the network structure. The impact of genetic variant can propagate to other genes along the links in the network, then to the final disease. There could be multiple pathways from the genetic variant to the final disease, with each having the chain structure since the first node is one specific SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) variant and the end is disease outcome. One key but inadequately addressed question is how to measure the between-node connection strength and rank the effects of such chain-type pathways, which can provide statistical evidence to give the priority of some pathways for potential drug development in a cost-effective manner. RESULTS: We first introduce the maximal correlation coefficient (MCC) to represent the between-node connection, and then integrate MCC with K shortest paths algorithm to rank and identify the potential pathways from genetic variant to disease. The pathway importance score (PIS) was further provided to quantify the importance of each pathway. We termed this method as MCC-SP. Various simulations are conducted to illustrate MCC is a better measurement of the between-node connection strength than other quantities including Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, distance correlation, mutual information, and maximal information coefficient.

Since CXCL1 and CXCL2/3, acting through CXCR2, are potent neutrophil chemoattractants, we investigated their role in dsRNA-induced lung injury, where dsRNA (Poly IC) is a well-described synthetic agent mimicking acute viral infection. METHODS: We used 6C8 week old female BALB/c mice to intratracheally inject either single-stranded (ssRNA) or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into the airways. The lungs were then harvested at designated timepoints to characterize the elicited chemokine response and resultant lung injury following dsRNA exposure as demonstrated qualititatively by histopathologic analysis, and quantitatively by FACS, protein, and mRNA analysis of BAL fluid and tissue samples. We then repeated the experiments by first pretreating mice with an anti-PMN or corresponding control antibody, and then subsequently pretreating a separate cohort of mice with an anti-CXCR2 or corresponding control antibody prior to dsRNA exposure. RESULTS: Intratracheal dsRNA led to significant increases in neutrophil infiltration and lung injury in BALB/c mice at 72 h following dsRNA, but not in response to ssRNA (Poly C; control) treatment. Expression of CXCR2 ligands and CXCR2 paralleled neutrophil recruitment to the lung. Neutrophil depletion studies significantly reduced neutrophil infiltration and lung injury in response to dsRNA when mice were pretreated with an anti-PMN monoclonal Ab. Furthermore, inhibition of CXCR2 ligands/CXCR2 interaction by pretreating dsRNA-exposed mice with an anti-CXCR2 neutralizing Ab also significantly attenuated neutrophil sequestration and lung injury.

The accurate diagnosis of influenza is critical to the timely clinical treatment of patients and the control of outbreaks to protect public health. Commercially available rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) that are operated by visual readout are widely used in clinics to screen influenza infections, but RIDTs suffer from imperfect analytical sensitivity, especially when the virus concentration in the sample is low. Fortunately, the sensitivity can be simply improved through an add-on signal amplification step, i.e., thermal contrast amplification (TCA). To demonstrate the advantage of TCA for influenza diagnosis, we conducted a prospective cohort study on 345 clinical specimens collected for influenza A and B testing during the 2017C2018 influenza season. All samples were tested using the Quidel QuickVue Influenza A + B test, followed by a TCA readout, and then confirmatory polymerase chain reaction testing. Through the TCA detecting sub-visual weak positives, TCA reading improved the overall influenza sensitivity by 53% for influenza A and 33% for influenza B over the visual RIDTs readings. Even though the specificity was compromised slightly by the TCA protocol (relative decrease of 0.09% for influenza A and 0.01% for influenza B), the overall performance was still better than that achieved by visual readout based on comparison of their plots in receiver operating characteristic space and F1 scores (relative increase of 14.5% for influenza A and 12.5% for influenza B). Performing a TCA readout on wet RIDTs also improved the overall TCA performance (relative increase in F1 score of 48%).

Long-run effects of COVID-19 and climate change could further slow growth. Moreover, some sustainability scientists assert that slower growth, stagnation, or even de-growth is an environmental imperative. Whether slow growth is inevitable or planned, we argue that democracies should prepare for additional fiscal and social stress--some of which is already apparent. Focusing on developed democracies, we propose that preparations should include efforts to: (i) reduce inequality;(ii) socially integrate diverse populations and build shared identities;(iii) increase economic opportunity for youth;(iv) improve return on investment in taxation and public spending;(v) strengthen formal democratic institutions;and (vi) invest in improving non-economic drivers of subjective well-being.

METHODS: Following the shift to virtual care, Kaiser Permanente Washington implemented a series of workflow changes to administer standard screening and monitoring questionnaires at virtual visits and to complete structured suicide risk assessments for patients reporting frequent suicidal ideation. These new workflows included automated distribution of questionnaires via the electronic health record (EHR) patient portal and automated alerts to clinicians regarding indicators of high risk. RESULTS: In March 2020, in-person mental health visits were rapidly and completely replaced by video and telephone visits. The proportion of mental health visits with completed screening and monitoring questionnaires fell from approximately 80% in early 2020 to approximately 30% in late March, then gradually recovered to approximately 60% by the end of 2020. Among patients reporting frequent suicidal ideation on monitoring questionnaires, the proportion with a recorded suicide risk assessment fell from over 90% in early 2020 to approximately 40% in late March, then gradually recovered to nearly 100% by the end of 2020.

The risk of VTE is also higher in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) due to risk factors such as sepsis, vasopressor use, mechanical ventilation, and cardiac or renal failure. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and enoxaparin are both used for VTE prophylaxis in critically ill obese patients. UFH 7,500 units subcutaneous every 8 hours or enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg/day are suggested regimens in obese patients for VTE prophylaxis. There is limited evidence for a preferred regimen or optimal dose adjustments in obese patients. The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of VTE prevention between highdose UFH and weight-adjusted enoxaparin in these patients. To our knowledge, this study will be the first to look at the clinical outcome of VTE incidence when comparing high-dose UFH and weight-adjusted enoxaparin in critically ill obese patients. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective, IRBapproved study conducted from July 30, 2015 to January 24, 2021. Adult obese patients who received high-dose UFH (7,500 units every 8 hours) or weight-adjusted enoxaparin (0.5 mg/kg/day) for VTE prophylaxis were eligible for study inclusion. Exclusion criteria included pregnant patients, incarcerated persons, patients with clotting disorders, trauma and orthopedic patients, and CoVID-19 positive patients. The primary outcome was incidence of VTE during hospital stay. Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay, hospital mortality, and bleeding. Subgroups included admitting ICUs (medical ICU, surgical ICU, or cardiovascular ICU) and patients with a BMI > 50. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients were included in each group. No significant difference in the incidence of VTE was noted: 2 (4%) patients in the high-dose UFH group versus 1 (2%) in the weight-adjusted enoxaparin group (p=1). There was no significant difference in the length of stay, hospital mortality, and bleeding between groups. The incidence of VTE did not differ between ICU subgroups or in patients with a BMI > 50.

It is the etiological agent of several diseases, among which viral arthritis and malabsorption syndrome are the most commercially important, causing considerable economic losses in the poultry industry. Although a small but increasing number of reports have characterized some aspects of ARV infection, global changes in protein expression in ARV-infected host cells have not been examined. The current study used a proteomics approach to obtain a comprehensive view of changes in protein levels in host cells upon infection by ARV. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The proteomics profiles of DF-1 chicken fibroblast cells infected with ARV strain S1133 were analyzed by two-dimensional differential-image gel electrophoresis. The majority of protein expression changes (1.5 fold, p<0.05) occurred at 72 h post-infection. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry identified 51 proteins with differential expression levels, including 25 that were upregulated during ARV infection and 26 that were downregulated. These proteins were divided into eight groups according to biological function: signal transduction, stress response, RNA processing, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, and cytoskeleton organization. They were further examined by immunoblotting to validate the observed alterations in protein expression. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first report of a time-course proteomic analysis of ARV-infected host cells. Notably, all identified proteins involved in signal transduction, RNA processing, and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway were downregulated in infected cells, whereas proteins involved in DNA synthesis, apoptosis, and energy production pathways were upregulated. In addition, other differentially expressed proteins were linked with the cytoskeleton, metabolism, redox regulation, and stress response. These proteomics data provide valuable information about host cell responses to ARV infection and will facilitate further studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying ARV pathogenesis.","output":"Proteomics Analysis of the DF-1 Chicken Fibroblasts Infected with Avian Reovirus Strain S1133"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic forced a sudden increase of remote activities including work, learning and also scientific conferences.

Methods: A national online survey was distributed in May 2020. Participants included 1188 adults (mean age 37.4 years, SD 15.1;980/1188, 82.5% female) and 963 adolescents (mean age 16.2 years, SD 1.2;685/963, 71.1% female). Participants reported demographic characteristics, use of digital platforms for physical activity over the previous month, and adherence to moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and muscle-strengthening exercise (MSE) guidelines. Multilevel logistic regression models examined differences in guideline adherence between those who used digital platforms (ie, users) to support their physical activity compared to those who did not (ie, nonusers). Results: Digital platforms include streaming services for exercise (eg, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook);subscriber fitness programs, via an app or online (eg, Centr and MyFitnessPal);facilitated online live or recorded classes, via platforms such as Zoom (eg, dance, sport training, and fitness class);sport- or activity-specific apps designed by sporting organizations for participants to keep up their skills (eg, TeamBuildr);active electronic games (eg, Xbox Kinect);and/or online or digital training or racing platforms (eg, Zwift, FullGaz, and Rouvy). Overall, 39.5% (469/1188) of adults and 26.5% (255/963) of adolescents reported using digital platforms for physical activity.

Since viruses are highly dependent on the host small RNAs (microRNAs) for their replication and propagation, in this study, top miRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 genome and top miRNAs targeting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in lungs of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, were predicted. Methods: All human mature miRNA sequences were acquired from miRBase database. MiRanda tool was used to predict the potential human miRNA binding sites on the SARS-CoV-2 genome. EdgeR identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection from GEO147507 data. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and DEGs annotation analysis were performed using ToppGene and Metascape tools. Results: 160 miRNAs with a perfect matching in the seed region were identified. Among them, there was 15 miRNAs with more than three binding sites and 12 miRNAs with a free energy binding of -29 kCal/Mol. MiR-29 family had the most binding sites (11 sites) on the SARS-CoV-2 genome. MiR-21 occupied four binding sites and was among the top miRNAs that targeted up-regulated DEGs. In addition to miR-21, miR-16, let-7b, let-7e, and miR-146a were the top miRNAs targeting DEGs. Conclusion: Collectively, more experimental studies especially miRNA-based studies are needed to explore detailed molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the role of DEGs including STAT1, CCND1, CXCL-10, and MAPKAPK2 in SARS-CoV-2 should be investigated to identify the similarities and differences between SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses.","output":"High affinity of host human microRNAs to SARS-CoV-2 genome: An in silico analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Radiomic models outperform clinical data for outcome prediction in high-grade gliomas (HGG). However, lack of parameter standardization limits clinical applications. Many machine learning (ML) radiomic models employ single classifiers rather than ensemble learning, which is known to boost performance, and comparative analyses are lacking in the literature. We aimed to compare ML classifiers to predict clinically relevant tasks for HGG: overall survival (OS), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation, O-6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation, epidermal growth factor receptor vIII (EGFR) amplification, and Ki-67 expression, based on radiomic features from conventional and advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our objective was to identify the best algorithm for each task. One hundred fifty-six adult patients with pathologic diagnosis of HGG were included. Three tumoral regions were manually segmented: contrast-enhancing tumor, necrosis, and non-enhancing tumor. Radiomic features were extracted with a custom version of Pyradiomics and selected through Boruta algorithm. A Grid Search algorithm was applied when computing ten times K-fold cross-validation (K=10) to get the highest mean and lowest spread of accuracy. Model performance was assessed as AUC-ROC curve mean values with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Extreme Gradient Boosting (xGB) obtained highest accuracy for OS (74,5%), Adaboost (AB) for IDH mutation (87.5%), MGMT methylation (70,8%), Ki-67 expression (86%), and EGFR amplification (81%).

RESULTS: There were no differences in sociodemographic factors between women undergoing a diagnostic procedure compared to those not undergoing a procedure. As the perceived risk for having a baby with genetic problem increased by one point, the estimated odds of having the diagnostic procedure increased by 43% controlling for the perceived risk of procedure related loss (p < .0001). Similarly, as the perceived risk of miscarriage increased by one point, the odds of having the diagnostic procedure decreased by 40%, controlling for the perceived risk of having a baby with a genetic problem (p < .0001).

The three features of pneumonia (GGO, semi-consolidation and consolidation) and the percentage of well-aerated lung were quantified using a HU threshold based software. ROC curves identified the optimal cut-off values of CT parameters to predict hypoxia worsening and hospital discharge. Multiple Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyze the capability of CT quantitative features, demographic and clinical variables to predict the time to hospital discharge. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients (median age 56-years-old, 51 men) with COVID-19 pneumonia at CT were enrolled. The quantitative features of COVID-19 pneumonia were not associated to age, sex and time-from-symptoms onset, whereas higher number of comorbidities was correlated to lower well-aerated parenchyma ratio (rho = -0.234, p = 0.04) and increased semi-consolidation ratio (rho = -0.303, p = 0.008).

Our study aimed to evaluate the geographical distribution of cataract surgeons and prospectively identify the factors associated with the increased productivity in cataract surgery and efficiency in outpatient ophthalmic services in rural Chinese hospitals. METHODS: Data were prospectively collated from various hospital datasets and the census registered by the geographical unit county. Prior to mapping, the geographical location data of counties were cross-linked with the equivalent ophthalmologist and service output data to create categories and map multiple data attributes. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed to characterise the data stratified by county. Linear regression analyses were used to explore the factors associated with the increased productivity/efficiency. RESULTS: The ophthalmologists, surgical productivity of ophthalmologists and outpatient efficacy of ophthalmologists significantly varied across counties. During the period between 2016 and 2018, the median (IQR) change in surgical productivity of and outpatient efficacy of ophthalmologists were 31.627 (?3.33 to 29.94) and 118.08 (?132.30 to 740.89). In the simple regression analysis for predictors of a high productivity change, only the increased number of phaco machine had statistical significance (p=0.003). In addition, only the gross domestic product per capita in 2016 was associated with an increased improvement in efficiency of outpatient services (p=0.008).

However, the relationship between the intraoperative high fraction of inspiratory oxygen (FiO(2)) and living-donor-liver-transplantation (LDLT) outcome remains unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 199 primary adult-to-adult LDLT cases in Kyoto University Hospital between January 2010 and December 2017 were enrolled in this study. The intraoperative FiO(2) was averaged using the total amount of intraoperative oxygen and air and defined as the calculated FiO(2) (cFiO(2)). The cutoff value of cFiO(2) was set at 0.5. RESULTS: Between the cFiO(2) <0.5 (n = 156) and 0.5 group (n = 43), preoperative recipients background, donor factors, and intraoperative parameters were almost comparable. Postoperatively, the cFiO(2) 0.5 group showed a higher early allograft dysfunction (EAD) rate (P = 0.049) and worse overall graft survival (P = 0.036) than the cFiO(2) <0.5 group. Although the cFiO(2) 0.5 was not an independent risk factor for EAD in multivariable analysis (OR 2.038, 95%CI 0.992C4.186, P = 0.053), it was an independent risk factor for overall graft survival after LDLT (HR 1.897, 95%CI 1.007C3.432, P = 0.048). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that intraoperative high FiO(2) may be associated with worse graft survival after LDLT.

To prepare for this crisis, it is important to analyze the disease burden trend of drug-susceptible tuberculosis (DS-TB) and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Measuring disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and economic burden on MDR-TB patients can help reduce the incidence of TB. Accordingly, in this study, we measured the DALYs and economic burden on DS-TB and MDR-TB patients in 2014C2017 using a combination of National Health Insurance claims data, Annual Report on the Notified TB data, and Statistics Korea's mortality data. The incidence-based DALY approach implemented involved the summation of years of life lost and years lived with disability. For measuring economic burden, direct and indirect costs incurred by patients were totaled. From 2014 to 2017, DALYs per 100,000 people with DS-TB were 56, 49, 46, and 40, respectively, and DALYs per 100,000 people with MDR-TB were 3, 2, 2, and 2, respectively. The economic burden for the DS-TB population from 2014 to 2017 was $143.89 million, $136.36 million, $122.85 million, and $116.62 million, respectively, while that for MDR-TB was $413.44 million, $380.25 million, $376.46 million and $408.14 million, respectively. The results showed a decreasing trend in DALYs and economic burden for DS-TB, whereas MDR-TB was still found to be burdensome without a specific trend. With respect to age, the economic burden for both DS-TB and MDR-TB was higher among men than among women till  79 years. Conversely, the economic burden for women aged 80 years was higher as compared to their male counterparts. In conclusion, the incidence and spread of TB in all areas of society must be suppressed through intensive management of MDR-TB in the older population. We hope that the national TB management project will proceed efficiently when the infectious disease management system is biased to one side due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Comparison of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and Economic Burden on People With Drug-Susceptible Tuberculosis and Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The forehead is an important determinant of masculine or feminine look of the face.

From both industry and academia, many efforts have been taken to quantify the characteristics of SS in a standardised manner, but the study is hindered by the lack of an objective definition. METHODS A review of the scientific literature regarding different parameters attributed to the loss of skin integrity and linked with exhibition of SS was conducted. Articles included were screened for mechanical stimulation of the skin, with objective quantification of tissue responses using biophysical or imaging techniques. Additionally, studies where cohorts of SS and non-SS individuals were reported have been critiqued. RESULTS The findings identified that the structure and function of the stratum corneum and its effective barrier properties are closely associated with SS. Thus, an array of skin tissue responses has been selected for characterization of SS due to mechanical stimuli, including: transepidermal water loss, hydration, redness, temperature, and sebum index. Additionally, certain imaging tools allow quantification of the superficial skin layers, providing structural characteristics underlying SS. CONCLUSION This review proposes a multimodal approach for identification of SS, providing a means to characterise skin tissue responses objectively. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been suggested as a suitable tool for dermatological research with clinical applications.

The greater amount of CP being fed to preweaned calves may alter their nitrogen (N) balance, and excess N may be excreted in the urine. The objective of this study was to determine N utilization in preweaned calves fed diets varying in the amount of CP and MR fed. This study used 24 newborn dairy heifer calves blocked by birth and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: (1) 446 g dry matter (DM) of a conventional MR (CON; 20% CP, 20% fat), (2) 669 g DM of a moderately high protein MR (moderate; MOD; 26% CP, 18% fat), or (3) 892 g DM of a moderately high protein MR (aggressive; AGG; 26% CP, 18% fat). All calves had ad libitum access to starter and water. Both MR and starter were medicated with decoquinate. During weaning (d 43C49), the morning MR feeding ceased. On d 50, all MR feedings ended; however, starter and water intakes were continuously recorded until d 56. At 5 wk of age, urine was collected using urinary catheters for 3 d and chromium oxide was administered by bolus at 2 g/d for 7 d to estimate N efficiency. Calves fed MOD and AGG had similar starter intakes, feed efficiencies, and ADG, with the combined treatments having reduced starter intakes (258 vs. 537 g/d), greater ADG (674 vs. 422 g/d), and improved feed efficiency (0.57 vs. 0.45 gain:feed) compared with CON calves preweaning. However, DMI and water intake were similar across all treatments. Results from the N utilization phase showed that MOD and AGG treatments had similar but lower N efficiency compared with CON calves (45.5 vs. 52.7%). This could be due to MOD- and AGG-fed calves having greater urine volume and thereby, greater combined urine N output compared with CON calves (17.6 vs. 12.1 g/d). In summary, feeding >0.66 kg (DM) from a 26% CP MR increased ADG and improved feed efficiency during the preweaning period but reduced starter intake and lowered N efficiency.","output":"Nitrogen utilization, preweaning nutrient digestibility, and growth effects of Holstein dairy calves fed 2 amounts of a moderately high protein or conventional milk replacer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple introductions of SARS-COV-2 Omicron variant BA.1 and BA.1.1. lineages to Finland were detected in early December 2021.

Owing to different single responses convey different cognition of individual users (i.e., audiences), the captured evidence belongs to the perspective of individual cognition. However, individuals' cognition of social things is not always able to truly reflect the objective. There may be one-sided or biased semantics in their opinions on a claim. The captured evidence correspondingly contains some unobjective and biased evidence fragments, deteriorating task performance. In this paper, we propose a Dual-view model based on the views of Collective and Individual Cognition (CICD) for interpretable claim verification. From the view of the collective cognition, we not only capture the word-level semantics based on individual users, but also focus on sentence-level semantics (i.e., the overall responses) among all users and adjust the proportion between them to generate global evidence. From the view of individual cognition, we select the top-$k$ articles with high degree of difference and interact with the claim to explore the local key evidence fragments. To weaken the bias of individual cognition-view evidence, we devise inconsistent loss to suppress the divergence between global and local evidence for strengthening the consistent shared evidence between the both.

This is especially important for multiple pathogen assays designed to reduce assay time and costs. In this paper, we present a successful algorithm for detecting pathogens and reporting the maximum level of detail possible using multi-pathogen resequencing microarrays. The algorithm filters the sequence of base calls from the microarray and finds entries in genetic databases that most closely match. Taxonomic databases are then used to relate these entries to each other so that the microorganism can be identified. Although developed using a resequencing microarray, the approach is applicable to any assay method that produces base call sequence information.

This is in order to simplify, reduce time and amplify the use of advanced analyses in the echo lab. Purpose: to compare results of the fully automated analysis and manual tracing analysis using a new intuitive software. Methods: 28 consecutive previously healthy patients less than 18 years old who were screened at our Center for cardiac evaluation within 6 months after an asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic COVID19 infection were enrolled. All they were in sinus rhythm. Standard transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed for each patient using Canon Aplio i900, software 2D Wall Motion Tracking. Optimized apical 4-, 3- and 2- chamber views, mitral valve inflow pattern and LVOT Doppler interrogation were collected. Off-line data analysis of each examination was performed by both fully automated analysis (AI) and pediatric cardiologists with experience in echocardiography i.e. by manual tracing, evaluation and adjustment of the track by the operator (Echocardiographers). Operators were blinded to the AI analysis. To measure intraobserver variability, evaluations of 16 patients datasets were performed twice by both operators and AI. Results: Patients' demographic data were: age 9,8+/-4,7 years;males 22 (78%);height 134,3+/- 34,9 cm;weight 41,8+/-28,7 kg;BSA 1,2+/-0,4 mq, HR 85+/-15/min. The time taken for off-line analysis by AI and echocardiographers was 4-5 and 13-20 minutes, respectively. Reproducibility of echocardiographers' analysis was found to be excellent for left ventricle assessment (IC from 0,88 to 0,98);moderate for LVOT mean gradient (IC 0,73), RV end diastolic area (IC 0,69) and right atrial strain (IC 0,59);poor for deceleration time (IC 0,5), left ventricle strain (IC 0,49), RV FAC and strain (IC from 0,27 to 0,45). Conversely, reproducibility of the AI analysis was found to be excellent for any parameter (ICC from 0,87 to 0,99) (Table 1). About the mitralic valve inflow pattern assessment, despite the excellent reproducibility of AI analysis, the margin of error was found to be high. Particularly, a systematic error was observed with a tendency of the AI to overestimate deceleration time (DT-AI 176,6  63,8 vs DTEcocardiographers 150,4  24,3). Conclusion(s): Fully automated analysis is technically simple, less time consuming and highly reproducible. AI analysis of the mitralic inflow pattern should be optimized, having found a systematic error in the calculation of deceleration time. Reproducibility is the strong point of AI. This reduces the variability of manual measurements between different sonographers and at different times.","output":"Validation of a new intuitive software for automatic heart function analysis.

Pre-pandemic studies suggest a high prevalence of common mental disorders, including anxiety and depression in South Asian countries, which may aggravate during this pandemic. This systematic meta-analytic review was conducted to estimate the pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression in South Asian countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: We systematically searched for cross-sectional studies on eight major bibliographic databases and additional sources up to October 12, 2020, that reported the prevalence of anxiety or depression in any of the eight South Asian countries. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled proportion of anxiety and depression. RESULTS: A total of 35 studies representing 41,402 participants were included in this review. The pooled prevalence of anxiety in 31 studies with a pooled sample of 28,877 was 41.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 34.7C48.1, I(2) = 99.18%). Moreover, the pooled prevalence of depression was 34.1% (95% CI: 28.9C39.4, I(2) = 99%) among 37,437 participants in 28 studies. Among the South Asian countries, India had a higher number of studies, whereas Bangladesh and Pakistan had a higher pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression. No studies were identified from Afghanistan, Bhutan, and Maldives. Studies in this review had high heterogeneity, high publication bias confirmed by Egger's test, and varying prevalence rates across sub-groups. CONCLUSION: South Asian countries have high prevalence rates of anxiety and depression, suggesting a heavy psychosocial burden during this pandemic. Clinical and public mental health interventions should be prioritized alongside improving the social determinants of mental health in these countries.

METHODS All students enrolled in the class were invited to complete one brief survey at the end of the semester to determine their testing preference. RESULTS Of the 138 first-professional year students completing the survey, 79% (109 of 138) preferred computer-based testing, 9% had no preference, 6% (8 of 138) preferred paper-and-pencil testing, and the remainder (8 of 138) stated it depended on what was being tested. Ninety-one percent of students did not perceive the testing method to impact their grades.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine if self-reported symptoms could help monitor the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in France. METHODS: Users were asked questions about underlying conditions, sociodemographic status, zip code, and COVID-19 symptoms. Depending on the symptoms reported and the presence of coexisting disorders, users were told to either stay at home, contact a general practitioner (GP), or call an emergency phone number. Data regarding COVID-19-related hospitalizations were retrieved from the Ministry of Health. RESULTS: As of March 29, 2020, the application was opened 4,126,789 times; 3,799,535 electronic questionnaires were filled out; and 2,477,174 users had at least one symptom. In total, 34.8% (n=1,322,361) reported no symptoms. The remaining users were directed to self-monitoring (n=858,878, 22.6%), GP visit or teleconsultation (n=1,033,922, 27.2%), or an emergency phone call (n=584,374, 15.4%).

We performed a scoping review to map the range, features, coverage, protective effects and equity of policies that aim to provide income security for adults whose ill health prevents them from participating in gainful work. A total of 134 studies were included, providing data from 95% of LMICs. However, data across the majority of these countries were severely limited. Collectively the included studies demonstrate that coverage of contributory income-security schemes is low, especially for informal and low-income workers. Meanwhile, non-contributory schemes targeting low-income groups are often not explicitly designed to provide income support in periods of ill health, they can be difficult to access and rarely provide sufficient income support to cover the needs of eligible recipients. While identifying an urgent need for more research on illness-related income security in LMICs, this review concludes that scaling up and diversifying the range of income security interventions is crucial for improving coverage and equity. To achieve these outcomes, illness-related income protection must receive greater recognition in health policy and health financing circles, expanding our understanding of financial hardship beyond direct medical costs.","output":"Income security during periods of ill health: a scoping review of policies, practice and coverage in low-income and middle-income countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has grown into a pandemic and without a specific cure, disease management is the need of the hour through symptomatic interventions. Studies with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have highlighted the role of herbal medicines either in combination with antiviral drugs or by themselves in curtailing the severity of infection and associated inflammation. Divya-Swasari-Vati is an Indian ayurvedic formulation used in the treatment of chronic cough and lung inflammation, which is one of the first symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infections. METHODS: In this study, we used a A549 cell xenotransplant in the swim bladder of zebrafish and modeled the SARS-CoV-2 infection by injecting the fish with a recombinant spike protein. The different groups were given normal feed or feed mixed with either dexamethasone (as the control drug) or Divya-Swasari-Vati. The changes in behavioral fever, infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells in the swim bladder, degeneration or presence of necrotic cells in the kidney, and gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines were studied to determine the rescue of the diseased phenotype. RESULTS: Challenge with the spike protein caused changes in the swim bladder cytology with infiltrating pro-inflammatory cells, skin hemorrhage, and increase in behavioral fever. This was also accompanied by increased mortality of the disease control fish. Treatment with Divya-Swasari-Vati reversed most of the disease symptoms including damage to the kidney glomerulocytes, and complete reversal of behavioral fever. Dexamethasone, used as a comparator, was only able to partly rescue the behavioral fever phenotype. Divya-Swasari-Vati also suppressed the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-, levels in a dose-dependent manner, under in vivo and in vitro conditions. CONCLUSION: The study showed that the A549 xenotransplanted zebrafish injected with the recombinant spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is an efficient model for the disease; and treatment with Divya-Swasari-Vati medicine rescued most of the inflammatory damage caused by the viral spike protein while increasing survival of the experimental fish.","output":"Calcio-Herbal Medicine Divya-Swasari-Vati Ameliorates SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein-Induced Pathological Features and Inflammation in Humanized Zebrafish Model by Moderating IL-6 and TNF- Cytokines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Epidemiological studies show that BCG-vaccinated population seems to be more likely protected from COVID-19 infection, but WHO gave a stark warning on use of BCG vaccine without confirmed COVID-19 trials. The aim of the study is to evaluate whether TB vaccination, performed several years earlier, could confer protection against COVID-19. Methods: After the Ethical Committee authorization, professional orders were used to contact physicians with an online survey. Specialty, COVID-19 infection and previous BCG vaccination were recorded. Statistical data analysis was performed. Results: 1906 physicians answered the questionnaire, (M = 1068; F = 838; mean age 50.7  13.3 years; range 24C87), more than half (1062; 55.7%) experienced BCG vaccination. Professional activity was recorded, and only 49 subjects (2.6%) of them were infected by SARS-CoV2. Among the group of infected people, asymptomatic form occurred in 12 subjects (24.5%); a pauci-symptomatic form in 24 subjects (49.0%); and a severe form (pneumonia and/or respiratory distress) in 13 (26.5%). Considering only the clinically relevant form of COVID-19, period prevalence was 2.2% (23/1062) in the vaccinated group and 1.7% (14/844) in the unvaccinated group (OR: 1.31, 95% C.I.: 0.68C2.63, p = 0.427). Conclusion: Our experience does not confirm the possible protective role of BCG vaccination, performed years earlier, against COVID-19. Although recent epidemiological studies point out in BCG-vaccinated population a lower prevalence of SARS-CoV2 infection, in our cohort of physicians no significant difference was found in terms of prevalence of COVID-19 infection. Our data underline the necessity to follow the WHO warning about the indiscriminate use of BCG vaccine, until clear evidence of protection by BCG vaccination against COVID-19 is fully demonstrated.","output":"A Survey Among Italian Physicians During COVID-19 Outbreak.

This work, which contributes to the prevention and control of COVID-19, proposes a novel modified epidemiological model that predicts the epidemics evolution over time in India. A mathematical model was proposed to analyze the spread of COVID-19 in India during the lockdowns implemented by the government of India during the first and second waves. What makes this study unique, however, is that it develops a conceptual model with time-dependent characteristics, which is peculiar to Indias diverse and homogeneous societies. The results demonstrate that governmental control policies and suitable public perception of risk in terms of social distancing and public health safety measures are required to control the spread of COVID-19 in India. The results also show that Indias two strict consecutive lockdowns (21 days and 19 days, respectively) successfully helped delay the spread of the disease, buying time to pump up healthcare capacities and management skills during the first wave of COVID-19 in India. In addition, the second waves severe lockdown put a lot of pressure on the sustainability of many Indian cities. Therefore, the data show that timely implementation of government control laws combined with a high risk perception among the Indian population will help to ensure sustainability.

Seven participants (four females; three males), working within academies in the English Premier League, took part in semi-structured interviews about their experience of delivering sport psychology services within elite soccer academies. Results demonstrated that the provision of sport psychology is continually evolving, yet there are a number of factors that appear to inhibit the full integration of the discipline into academy soccer. Six key themes were identified: The breadth of sport psychology provision; what is sport psychology; the stigma surrounding sport psychology services; psychological literacy; the elite youth soccer environment; and the delivery of sport psychology under the Elite Player Performance Plan.

METHODS In this case-control study, n = 36 patients with a preoperative mechanical tibiofemoral angle (mTFA)  15 who underwent TKA between December 2002 and December 2012 were included. The control group (mTFA < 15) of n = 60 patients was created using case matching. Radiological [mechanical tibiofemoral angle (mTFA) and ankle joint orientation to the ground (G-AJLO)] and clinical parameters [Foot Function Index (FFI), Knee Society Score, Forgotten Joint Score, and Range of Motion (ROM)] were analysed. The mean follow-up time was 59 months (IQR [56, 62]). RESULTS The degree of correcting the mTFA by TKA significantly correlated with the postoperative FFI (R = 0.95, p < 0.05), although the knee and ankle joint lines were corrected to neutral orientations. A cut-off value of 16.5 [AUC 0.912 (0.85-0.975 95% CI), sensitivity = 0.8, specificity = 0.895] was calculated, above which the odds ratio (OR) for developing ankle symptoms increased vastly [OR 34.0 (9.10-127.02 95% CI)]. ROM restrictions of the subtalar joint displayed a strong significant correlation with the FFI (R = 0.74, p < 0.05), demonstrating that decreased ROM of the subtalar joint was associated with aggravated outcomes of the ankle joint. CONCLUSIONS In this study, higher degrees of leg axis correction in TKA were associated with increased postoperative ankle symptoms.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed individual case and cluster data from statutory notifications from August to November 2020 in Rhineland-Palatinate - the period preceding the second SARS-CoV-2 wave. We also conducted an into-depth survey on contextual details of household transmission in a representative sample of 149 private household clusters that had occurred during this period. RESULTS: During the study period, 18,695 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases were notified, 3,642 of which occurred in 911 clusters (private households (67.3%), the workplace (7.8%), elderly homes (1.8%), others (23.2%). Demographically, clustered cases were representative of all notified cases. Two-thirds (77/113, 68%) of sample response clusters involved more than one private household. These caused on average more close contact persons (mean 13.5, SD 15.8) and secondary cases (3.9, SD 0.4) than clusters involving one household only (5.113.8 and 2.90.2). About one in six multi-household clusters in the private setting (13/77) followed a social gathering (e.g. birthday party). Breaches of one or more of the three major barrier concepts (mask, ventilation, and distance) were identified in most (10/13) of these social gatherings. SARS-CoV-2 clusters following social gatherings were overrepresented during the second half of the study period.

However, patients who need re-operation for this complication have a high rate of postoperative complications. We report a case series of three patients who underwent fluoroscopic balloon dilation (FBD) for early jejunojejunostomy obstruction (JJO) after gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction (R-Y reconstruction). CASE PRESENTATION Three patients were referred to our hospital for surgery for gastric cancer. Robot-assisted distal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection and antecolic R-Y reconstruction were performed in two patients, and robot-assisted total gastrectomy with D1+ lymph node dissection and antecolic R-Y reconstruction was performed in one patient. The jejunojejunostomy was created as a side-to-side anastomosis using a linear 45-mm stapler. The entry hole was closed with a knotless barbed suture, and serosal-muscle layer suture reinforcement with an absorbable suture was performed at the jejunojejunostomy. Subsequently, all the patients were diagnosed with JJO by computed tomography and upper gastrointestinal series. The average time to JJO from gastrectomy was 5 days (range 2-7); initial clinical symptoms were vomiting in all three cases, with simultaneous upper abdominal pain in one case. We successfully performed FBD in all three cases after unsuccessful conservative treatment using an ileus tube. The clinical symptoms improved soon after FBD, and all the patients were able to avoid re-operation. The average period to FBD from JJO was 10 days (range 4-14). The average procedure time was 46 min (range 29-68), and the average duration to oral intake from FBD was 4 days (range 2-5). The average duration of hospital stay after FBD was 12 days (range 9-15). There were no complications in any of the cases. CONCLUSION FBD might be a feasible procedure to avoid surgery for early small bowel obstruction after gastrectomy with R-Y reconstruction.","output":"Fluoroscopic balloon dilation for early jejunojejunostomy obstruction after gastrectomy with roux-en-Y reconstruction: a case series of three patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CEACAM1a glycoproteins are members of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and the carcinoembryonic antigen family.

This study estimates progress and gaps in reaching the UNAIDS 2020 target of 90% knowledge of status, and the efficiency of HIV testing services in sub-Saharan Africa, where two thirds of all people living with HIV reside. METHODS: For this modelling study, we used data from 183 population-based surveys (including more than 27 million participants) and national HIV testing programme reports (315 country-years) from 40 countries in sub-Saharan Africa as inputs into a mathematical model to examine trends in knowledge of status among people living with HIV, median time from HIV infection to diagnosis, HIV testing positivity, and proportion of new diagnoses among all positive tests, adjusting for retesting. We included data from 2000 to 2019, and projected results to 2020. FINDINGS: Across sub-Saharan Africa, knowledge of status steadily increased from 57% (95% credible interval [CrI] 46C70) in 2000 to 84% (82C86) in 2020. 12 countries and one region, southern Africa, reached the 90% target. In 2020, knowledge of status was lower among men (79%, 95% CrI 76C81) than women (87%, 85C89) across sub-Saharan Africa. People living with HIV aged 15C24 years were the least likely to know their status (65%, 62C69), but the largest gap in terms of absolute numbers was among men aged 35C49 years, with 701 000 (95% CrI 611 000C788 000) remaining undiagnosed. As knowledge of status increased from 2000 to 2020, the median time to diagnosis decreased from 96 years (91C10) to 26 years (18C35), HIV testing positivity declined from 90% (77C10) to 28% (21C39), and the proportion of first-time diagnoses among all positive tests dropped from 89% (77C96) to 42% (30C55). INTERPRETATION: On the path towards the next UNAIDS target of 95% diagnostic coverage by 2025, and in a context of declining positivity and yield of first-time diagnoses, disparities in knowledge of status must be addressed. Increasing knowledge of status and treatment coverage among older men could be crucial to reducing HIV incidence among women in sub-Saharan Africa, and by extension, reducing mother-to-child transmission.

DVT prevalence has been shown to be markedly higher than in mechanically ventilated influenza patients (6C8%). Unusually high inflammatory and prothrombotic phenotype represents a striking feature of COVID-19 patients, as reflected by markedly elevated reactive protein C, fibrinogen, interleukin 6, von Willebrand factor, and factor VIII. Moreover, in critically ill patients, venous stasis has been associated with the prothrombotic phenotype attributed to COVID-19, which increases the risk of thrombosis. Venous stasis results among others from immobilization under muscular paralysis, mechanical ventilation with high positive end-expiratory pressure, and pulmonary microvascular network injuries or occlusions. Venous return to the heart is subsequently decreased with increase in central and peripheral venous pressures, marked proximal and distal veins dilation, and drops in venous blood flow velocities, leading to a spontaneous contrast sludge pattern in veins considered as prothrombotic. Together with endothelial lesions and hypercoagulability status, venous stasis completes the Virchow triad and considerably increases the prevalence of DVT and PE in critically ill COVID-19 patients, therefore raising questions regarding the optimal doses for thromboprophylaxis during ICU stay.","output":"Pathophysiological Processes Underlying the High Prevalence of Deep Vein Thrombosis in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We sequenced the genomes of 5,085 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strains causing two coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease waves in metropolitan Houston, TX, an ethnically diverse region with 7 million residents The genomes were from viruses recovered in the earliest recognized phase of the pandemic in Houston and from viruses recovered in an ongoing massive second wave of infections The virus was originally introduced into Houston many times independently Virtually all strains in the second wave have a Gly614 amino acid replacement in the spike protein, a polymorphism that has been linked to increased transmission and infectivity Patients infected with the Gly614 variant strains had significantly higher virus loads in the nasopharynx on initial diagnosis We found little evidence of a significant relationship between virus genotype and altered virulence, stressing the linkage between disease severity, underlying medical conditions, and host genetics Some regions of the spike protein-the primary target of global vaccine efforts-are replete with amino acid replacements, perhaps indicating the action of selection We exploited the genomic data to generate defined single amino acid replacements in the receptor binding domain of spike protein that, importantly, produced decreased recognition by the neutralizing monoclonal antibody CR3022 Our report represents the first analysis of the molecular architecture of SARS-CoV-2 in two infection waves in a major metropolitan region The findings will help us to understand the origin, composition, and trajectory of future infection waves and the potential effect of the host immune response and therapeutic maneuvers on SARS-CoV-2 evolution","output":"Molecular architecture of early dissemination and massive second wave of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a major metropolitan area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We assess the impact of COVID-19 response measures implemented in Germany and Switzerland on cumulative COVID-19-related hospitalization and death rates.

Reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is now widely used as the gold standard for detecting viruses. Although a multiplex assay is essential for identifying virus types and subtypes, the poor multiplicity of RT-qPCR makes it laborious and time-consuming. In this paper, we describe the development of a multiplex RT-qPCR platform with hydrogel microparticles acting as independent reactors in a single reaction. To build target-specific particles, target-specific primers and probes are integrated into the particles in the form of noncovalent composites with boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The thermal release characteristics of DNA, primer, and probe from the composites of primer-BNNT and probe-CNT allow primer and probe to be stored in particles during particle production and to be delivered into the reaction. In addition, BNNT did not absorb but preserved the fluorescent signal, while CNT protected the fluorophore of the probe from the free radicals present during particle production. Bicompartmental primer-incorporated network (bcPIN) particles were designed to harness the distinctive properties of two nanomaterials. The bcPIN particles showed a high RT-qPCR efficiency of over 90% and effective suppression of non-specific reactions. 16-plex RT-qPCR has been achieved simply by recruiting differently coded bcPIN particles for each target. As a proof of concept, multiplex one-step RT-qPCR was successfully demonstrated with a simple reaction protocol.","output":"Highly Selective Multiplex Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction with a Nanomaterial Composite Hydrogel for Precise Diagnosis of Viral Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The use of monoclonal antibody for COVID-19 showed conflicting results in prior studies and its efficacy remains unclear. We aimed to comprehensively determine the efficacy and safety profile of monoclonal antibodies in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Sixteen RCTs were analyzed using RevMan 5.4 to measure the pooled estimates of risk ratios (RRs) and standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs. Results: The pooled effect of monoclonal antibodies demonstrated mortality risk reduction (RR=0.89 (95%CI 0.82-0.96), I2=13%, fixed-effect). Individually, tocilizumab reduced mortality risk in severe to critical disease (RR=0.90 (95%CI 0.83-0.97), I2=12%, fixed-effect)) and lowered mechanical ventilation requirements (RR=0.76 (95%CI 0.62-0.94), I2=42%, random-effects). Moreover, it facilitated hospital discharge (RR=1.07 (95%CI 1.00-1.14), I2=60%, random-effects).

Humor can soften the isolation experienced by both patients and staff. When used sensitively, respecting the gravity of the situation, humor can build the connection among the caregiver, patient, and family. However, insensitive joking is offensive and distressing, and experience suggests a variable acceptance of humor by patients with life-threatening illnesses, making humor a high-risk strategy, and it can be a pejorative maker of an adversive power differential.

Some conditions are associated with worse prognosis such as heart failure and left ventricular assist device (LVAD) recipients. Case Report A 31-year-old male patient without comorbidities was admitted due to cardiogenic shock and pneumonia. He required IABP and ECMO. The patient recovered from organ dysfunctions and ECMO was weaned off. He persisted dependent on dobutamine and IABP. Echocardiogram showed severe left ventricular dysfunction and moderate right ventricular dysfunction (RVD), but right heart catheterization revealed no pulmonary hypertension. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was negative and myocardiopathy investigation was inconclusive after endomyocardial biopsy. LVAD implantation was planned as a bridge to transplant. A Heart Mate 3 was successfully implanted. The patient presented fever in the operating room and persisted febrile for 3 days. COVID-19 was suspected and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was positive. He was extubated on 3rd postoperative day (POD) and echocardiogram showed only mild RVD. On 5th POD, he became hypoxemic requiring high flow nasal cannula, and chest X-ray revealed multiple pulmonary bilateral opacities. Antibiotics and corticosteroids were prescribed. Echocardiogram showed severe RVD and hemodynamic instability led to milrinone and dobutamine requirement in maximal doses. On 10th POD endotracheal intubation was required. The patient experienced severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple complications: shock, bacterial pneumonia, hemothorax, pneumothorax due to barotrauma and bloodstream infection. He had no thromboembolic events. After 48 days he was free from mechanical ventilation and from inotropes. Echocardiogram showed moderate RVD and pulmonary artery systolic pressure 35mmHg. After 51 days he was discharged from the intensive care unit and is now in rehabilitation program. Summary Severe cases of COVID-19 are associated with a cytokine storm and a prothrombotic state. LVAD recipients are at particular risk of unfavorable outcomes. Besides the higher risk of thromboembolic events, LVAD recipients are more vulnerable to RVD in the setting of ARDS.

Therefore, the aim of our work is to investigate functional aspects of the trimodulin IgA component, a new plasma-derived polyvalent immunoglobulin preparation containing ~56% IgG, ~23% IgM and ~21% IgA. The functional role of IgA was investigated by analyzing the interaction of IgA with FcRI, comparing trimodulin with standard intravenous IgG (IVIG) preparation and investigating Fc receptor (FcR)-dependent functions by excluding IgM-mediated effects. Trimodulin demonstrated potent immunomodulatory, as well as anti-pathogenic effects in our neutrophil model (neutrophil-like HL-60 cells). The IgA component of trimodulin was shown to induce a strong FcRI-dependent inhibitory immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAMi) signaling, counteract lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation and mediate phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus. The fine-tuned balance between immunomodulatory and anti-pathogenic effects of trimodulin were shown to be dose-dependent.

Typically, when disruptive innovations are introduced, their performance is initially less than existing standard technologies, but because of their ability to bring the cost down, and with gradual improvement, they end up replacing established service standards.Disruptive technologies have their fingerprints in health care. Pathology and laboratory medicine are fertile soils for disruptive innovations because they are heavily reliant on technology. Disruptive innovations have resulted in a revolution of our diagnostic ability and will take laboratory medicine to the next level of patient care. There are several examples of disruptive innovations in the clinical laboratory. Digitizing pathology practice is an example of disruptive technology, with many advantages and an extended scope of applications. Next-generation sequencing can be disruptive in two ways. The first is by replacing an array of laboratory tests, which each requires expensive and specialized instruments and expertise, with a single cost-effective technology. The second is by disrupting the current paradigm of the clinical laboratory as a diagnostic service by taking it into a new era of preventive or primary care pathology. Other disruptive innovations include the use of dry chemistry reagents in chemistry analyzers and also point of care testing. The use of artificial intelligence is another promising disruptive innovation that can transform the future of pathology and laboratory medicine. Another emerging disruptive concept is the integration of two fields of medicine to create an interrelated discipline such as \\"histogenomics and radiohistomics.\\" Another recent disruptive innovation in laboratory medicine is the use of social media in clinical practice, education, and publication.There are multiple reasons to encourage disruptive innovations in the clinical laboratory, including the escalating cost of health care, the need for better accessibility of diagnostic care, and the increased demand on the laboratory in the era of precision diagnostics. There are, however, a number of challenges that need to be overcome such as the significant resistance to disruptive innovations by current technology providers and governmental regulatory bodies. The hesitance from health care providers and insurance companies must also be addressed.Adoption of disruptive innovations requires a multifaceted approach that involves orchestrated solutions to key aspects of the process, including creating successful business models, multidisciplinary collaborations, and innovative accreditation and regulatory oversight. It also must be coupled with successful commercialization plans and modernization of health care structure. Fostering a culture of disruptive innovation requires establishing unique collaborative models between academia and industry. It also requires uncovering new sources of unconventional funding that are open to high-risk high-reward projects. It should also be matched with innovative thinking, including new approaches for delivery of care and identifying novel cohorts of patients who can benefit from disruptive technology.","output":"Disruptive innovations in the clinical laboratory: catching the wave of precision diagnostics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The hypothalamus mediates important exercise-induced metabolic adaptations, possibly via hormonal signals. Hypothalamic leptin receptor (LepR)- and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1)-expressing neurons are directly responsive to growth hormone (GH) and deletion of GH receptor (GHR) in these cells impairs neuroendocrine responses during situations of metabolic stress. In the present study, we determined whether GHR ablation in LepR- or SF1-expressing cells modifies acute and chronic metabolic adaptations to exercise. Male mice carrying deletion of GHR in LepR- or SF1-expressing cells were submitted to 8 weeks of treadmill running training. Changes in aerobic performance and exercise-induced metabolic adaptations were determined. Mice carrying GHR deletion in LepR cells showed increased aerobic performance after 8 weeks of treadmill training, whereas GHR ablation in SF1 cells prevented improvement in running capacity. Trained mice carrying GHR ablation in SF1 cells exhibited increased fat mass and reduced cross-sectional area of the gastrocnemius muscle. In contrast, deletion of GHR in LepR cells reduced fat mass and increased gastrocnemius muscle hypertrophy, energy expenditure and voluntary locomotor activity in trained mice. Although glucose tolerance was not significantly affected by targeted deletions, glycemia before and immediately after maximum running tests was altered by GHR ablation. In conclusion, GHR signaling in hypothalamic neurons regulates the adaptation capacity to aerobic exercise in a cell-specific manner.

The first, the test-negative case-control design (TND) is the easiest to implement;it only demands collecting information about potential risk factors for COVID-19 from the tested symptomatic persons. The second, standard case-control studies with population controls, requires the collection of data on one or more population controls for each person who is tested in the test facilities, so that test-positives and test-negatives can each be compared with population controls. The TND will detect differences in risk factors between symptomatic persons who have COVID-19 (test-positives) and those who have other respiratory infections (test-negatives). However, risk factors with effect sizes of equal magnitude for both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections will not be identified by the TND. Therefore, we discuss how to add population controls to compare with the test-positives and the test-negatives, yielding two additional case-control studies. We describe two options for population control groups: one composed of accompanying persons to the test facilities, the other drawn from existing country-wide health care databases. We also describe other possibilities for population controls.

The protection of this vulnerable segment of population, including a rapid access to COVID-19 vaccination, needs to be recognized as a real public health priority. The role of mental health services in providing information and activating supportive interventions for patients with mental illness is also crucial. Particularly, a multidisciplinary therapeutic team including mental health providers, general practitioners, hospital physicians, and social services would be needed to ensure adequate networks and cares continuity. Actions to contrast stigma can be arduous and exhausting because they must counteract the gravitational pull of customs, prejudices, and ingrained cultural beliefs, and may therefore appear to be moving in an unnatural direction, like the water in Eschers lithograph entitled Waterfall. Nevertheless, there is no less strenuous way to go against the grain.","output":"Stigma, mental illness, and COVID-19 from a frontline clinician perspective: a way to go against the grain?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) inhibitors are essential in the treatment of human norovirus (HuNoV). This study aimed to map out HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors that could potentially be responsible for the inhibitory activity of HuNoV RdRp. It is necessary to develop robust machine learning and in silico methods to predict HuNoV RdRp compounds. In this study, Na?ve Bayesian and random forest models were built to categorize norovirus RdRp inhibitors from the non-inhibitors using their molecular descriptors and PubChem fingerprints. The best model observed had accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity values of 98.40%, 97.62%, and 97.62%, respectively. Meanwhile, an external test set was used to validate model performance before applicability to the screened HCV compounds database. As a result, 775 compounds were predicted as NoV RdRp inhibitors. The pharmacokinetics calculations were used to filter out the inhibitors that lack drug-likeness properties. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation investigated the inhibitors binding modes and residues critical for the HuNoV RdRp receptor. The most active compound, CHEMBL167790, closely binds to the binding pocket of the RdRp enzyme and depicted stable binding with RMSD 0.8C3.2 ?, and the RMSF profile peak was between 1.0C4.0 ?, and the conformational fluctuations were at 450C460 residues. Moreover, the dynamic residue cross-correlation plot also showed the pairwise correlation between the binding residues 300C510 of the HuNoV RdRp receptor and CHEMBL167790. The principal component analysis depicted the enhanced movement of protein atoms. Moreover, additional residues such as Glu510 and Asn505 interacted with CHEMBL167790 via water bridge and established H-bond interactions after the simulation. http://zinc15.docking.org/substances/ZINC000013589565.","output":"Predicting New Anti-Norovirus Inhibitor With the Help of Machine Learning Algorithms and Molecular Dynamics SimulationCBased Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has imposed a very substantial direct threat to the physical health of those infected, although the corollary impact on mental health may be even more burdensome. Here we focus on assessing the mental health impact of COVID-19 and of other epidemics in the community. We searched five electronic databases until December 9, 2020, for all peer-reviewed original studies reporting any prevalence or correlates of mental disorders in the general population following novel epidemics in English, Chinese or Portuguese. We synthesised prevalence estimates from probability samples during COVID-19 and past epidemics. The meta-analytical effect size was the prevalence of relevant outcomes, estimated via random-effects model. I(2) statistics, Doi plots and the LFK index were used to examine heterogeneity and publication bias. This study is pre-registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020179105. We identified 255 eligible studies from 50 countries on: COVID-19 (n = 247 studies), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; n = 5), Ebola virus disease (n = 2), and 1918 influenza (n = 1). During COVID-19, we estimated the point prevalence for probable anxiety (20.7%, 95% CI 12.9C29.7), probable depression (18.1%, 13.0C23.9), and psychological distress (13.0%, 0C34.1). Correlates for poorer mental health include female sex, lower income, pre-existing medical conditions, perceived risk of infection, exhibiting COVID-19-like symptoms, social media use, financial stress, and loneliness. Public trust in authorities, availability of accurate information, adoption of preventive measures and social support were associated with less morbidity. The mental health consequences of COVID-19 and other epidemics could be comparable to major disasters and armed conflicts. The considerable heterogeneity in our analysis indicates that more random samples are needed. Health-care professionals should be vigilant of the psychological toll of epidemics, including among those who have not been infected.","output":"Mental disorders following COVID-19 and other epidemics: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Little is known about the superiority of balloon angioplasty vs. stent implantation for femoropopliteal (FP) lesions according to subgroup. Methods and Results: This study involved 1,018 de novo (balloon angioplasty, n=462; stent implantation, n=556) and 114 in-stent restenosis (ISR) FP lesions (balloon angioplasty, n=69; stent implantation, n=45) treated with endovascular therapy. For de novo FP lesions, the 3-year primary patency rate was significantly better with stent implantation than with balloon angioplasty (61% vs. 69%, log-rank P=0.001), but it was similar for ISR FP lesions (40% vs. 43%, log-rank P=0.83). For de novo FP lesions, stent implantation was favorable in all subgroups except for female sex (hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% CI: 0.65-1.31, P=0.66), critical limb ischemia (CLI; HR, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.46-1.06, P=0.10), calcified lesion (HR, 0.81; 95% CI: 0.46-1.39, P=0.44), and poor tibial run-off (HR, 0.86; 95% CI: 0.59-1.25, P=0.42) subgroups.

Studies indicate that many individuals prefer working from home due to fear of contracting the virus at work. However, not all work can be performed from home. Moreover, jobs that are amenable to be performed from home generally pay more, while the ability to WFH will likely increase income inequality. Therefore, we ascertained socio-economic inequalities in ability to WFH among South African employees during the pandemic. We used data from the National Income Dynamics Study-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey, a nationally representative longitudinal survey of South Africans conducted during the pandemic. We found that the ability to WFH was pro-rich (i.e. concentrated on workers in higher socio-economic classes) in all study periods. The results were robust to the use of different ranking variables and varying the age cut-off. There was no gender difference in these inequalities. Casual employment, urban residence, being married/cohabiting, age and household size dampened the degree to which ability to WFH favoured those in higher socio-economic classes. Conversely, being non-African, living in a house/flat and having more education increased the pro-richness of the ability to WFH. This study highlights the significant inequalities associated with ability to WFH, a likely important positive determinant of welfare in the pandemic and post-pandemic periods. Interventions targeted at inequality-enhancing factors such as race, housing and education may be important in lowering these inequalities.JEL Codes: D63, J22","output":"Socio-economic inequalities in ability to work from home during the coronavirus pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: This study assessed the validity and reliability of the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale\\\\Japanese Version.

The cause of epididymal stones is unknown, but an infectious agent, the avian infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV), has been implicated. The goal of this study was to determine if administering the live attenuated AIBV vaccine to male chicks increases the incidence of stones in the epididymal region of the adult rooster. Specific pathogen free (SPF) Leghorn roosters were divided into two groups: a vaccine-free group (n = 7) and a group vaccinated with AIBV (n = 12). The vaccine was administered orally at 2, 4, 10, and 14 wk of age. Blood was drawn weekly to monitor antibodies to AIBV. At 26 wk of age, blood was obtained to determine testosterone concentrations, and reproductive tracts were removed to analyze daily sperm production and to detect epididymal stones. Nine of 12 vaccinated roosters developed stones, whereas those not given the vaccine did not develop stones. Serum testosterone concentrations were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in vaccinated roosters with epididymal stones (3.6 +/- 0.30 ng/ml) when compared with nonvaccinated roosters that did not have epididymal stones (7.0 +/- 1.63 ng/ml). Testis weight was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in vaccinated roosters with epididymal stones (12.1 +/- 0.76 g), as compared with nonvaccinated roosters without epididymal stones (15.2 +/- 0.81 g). Daily sperm production was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in vaccinated roosters with epididymal stones (5.03 +/- 0.31 x 10(8) sperm/testis/day) when compared with nonvaccinated roosters without epididymal stones (7.43 +/- 0.52 x 10(8) sperm/testis/day). Comparing daily sperm production on a per gram basis, vaccinated roosters with epididymal stones had 4.38 +/- 0.14 x 10(7) sperm/g of testis, which was significantly (P < 0.05) smaller than nonvaccinated roosters without epididymal stones, which had 5.17 +/- 0.17 x 10(7) sperm/g of testis.

This study aims to investigate the sleep status of Chinese residents during the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to evaluate its related risk factors. METHODS: This research carried out a cross-sectional survey in February 2020 (during the COVID-19 outbreak) to investigate the sleep status of residents nationwide in the form of an online questionnaire. Of the 8151 respondents, 6437 were eventually included in the analysis. Logistic regression is applied to analyze the associated factors affecting residents' sleep quality. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, the incidence of sleep disturbances in residents was 17.65%. Increased risk of sleep disturbances was found to be associated with older age, female gender, and poor self-reported health status. Moreover, the odds ratios (ORs) were 1.42 (95% CI: 1.1-2.64), 1.35 (95% CI: 1.16-1.59), 5.59 (95% CI: 4.32-7.23), respectively. Those residents who believed COVID-19 had caused a high number of deaths or who thought COVID-19 was not easy to cure were more likely to experience sleep disorders, and the ORs were 1.73 (95% CI: 1.43-2.09), 1.57 (95% CI: 1.29-1.91), respectively. Regular exercise was a protective factor for sleep disturbances, OR = 0.77 (95% CI: 0.63-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: During the outbreak of COVID-19, nearly one-fifth of participants had sleep disorders. It is necessary to pay more attention to people at high risk for sleep disturbances during the outbreak, adopt effective risk communication methods, enhance residents' rational understanding of COVID-19, and develop practical indoor exercise programs for general public to improve sleep quality.","output":"Sleep disturbances among Chinese residents during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak and associated factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ionizable cationic lipids play a critical role in developing new gene therapies for various biomedical applications, including COVID-19 vaccines. However, it remains unclear whether the formulation of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) using DLin-MC3-DMA, an optimized ionizable lipid clinically used for small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy, also facilitates high liver-selective transfection of other gene therapies such as plasmid DNA (pDNA). Here we report the first investigation into pDNA transfection efficiency in different mouse organs after intramuscular and intravenous administration of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) where DLin-MC3-DMA, DLin-KC2-DMA or DODAP are used as the ionizable cationic lipid component of the LNP. We discovered that these three benchmark lipids previously developed for siRNA delivery followed an unexpected characteristic rank order in gene expression efficiency when utilized for pDNA. In particular, DLin-KC2-DMA facilitated higher in vivo pDNA transfection than DLin-MC3-DMA and DODAP, possibly due to its head group pKa and lipid tail structure. Interestingly, LNPs formulated with either DLin-KC2-DMA or DLin-MC3-DMA exhibited significantly higher in vivo protein production in the spleen than in the liver. This work sheds light on the importance of the choice of ionizable cationic lipid and nucleic acid cargo for organ-selective gene expression. The study also provides a new design principle towards the formulation of more effective LNPs for biomedical applications of pDNA, such as gene editing, vaccines and immunotherapies.","output":"In vivo delivery of plasmid DNA by lipid nanoparticles: the influence of ionizable cationic lipids on organ-selective gene expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT As response rates to health surveys conducted by telephone continue to decline and costs continue to increase, practitioners are increasingly considering a transition to self-administered mail contact modes. OBJECTIVE To compare empirical differences observed across adjacent administrations of the Healthy Chicago Survey (HCS) conducted by telephone versus self-administered via mail contact. DESIGN Data from the 2016, 2018, and 2020 administrations of the HCS are contrasted, and demographic distributions are benchmarked against the American Community Survey to investigate differences that may be linked to the HCS' transition from a telephone to self-administered mail mode between 2018 and 2020. SETTING All survey data were collected from adult residents of Chicago, Illinois, between 2016 and 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Costs, response rates, key health statistics, demographic distributions, and measures of precision generated from the HCS. RESULTS The mail mode led to a response rate increase of 6.8% to 38.2% at half the cost per complete. Mail respondents are more likely to be nonminority, female, and hold a college degree. Key health statistic differences are mixed, but design effects are larger in the mail mode, which we attribute to more detailed geographic stratification and weighting employed in 2020. CONCLUSIONS The mail mode is a less costly data collection strategy for the HCS, but it comes with trade-offs.

DesignNationwide, population-based cohort study. Setting: Norway from 1 March 2020 to 31 April 2021. Participants: All Norwegian residents <18 years of age. Main outcome measuresPopulation-based health care and population registries were used to study risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including socioeconomic factors, country of origin, and pre-existing chronic comorbidities. All residents were followed until age 18, emigration, death, or end of follow-up. Hazard ratios (HR) estimated by Cox regression models were adjusted for testing frequency. Further, risk factors for admission to the hospital among the infected were investigated. ResultsOf 1 182 796 residents, 22608 (1.9%) tested positive by polymerase chain reaction or lateral flow tests, of whom 107 (0.5%) were admitted to a hospital. Low family income (aHR 1.40, 95% confidence interval 1.36 to 1.46), crowded housing (1.35, 1.30 to 1.39), household size, age, and area of living were independent risk factors for infection. A non-Nordic country of origin was the strongest risk factor (aHR 2.37, 95% CI 2.30 to 2.49), whereas chronic comorbidity was not associated with the risk of infection. Chronic comorbidity was associated with hospitalisation (aHR 4.15, 2.63 to 6.56), in addition to age, whereas socioeconomic status and country of origin did not predict hospitalisation among those infected. ConclusionsSocioeconomic factors, country of origin, and area of living were associated with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, these factors did not predict hospitalisation among those infected. Chronic comorbidity was associated with the risk of admission but not with the overall risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2.
