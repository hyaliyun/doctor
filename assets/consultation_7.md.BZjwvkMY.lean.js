Little is known about their knowledge and attitudes, which may influence these care practices. Objective: This study aims to re-validate the knowledge and attitude towards hospice and palliative care (KAHP) scale and assess the scale's latent constructs among emergency providers. Methods: The scale consists of ten items measured on a five-point Likert scale. Five of the ten items were reverse scored. Content validation was performed by ten experts in Hospice and Palliative Medicine and Emergency Medicine. Baseline surveys of emergency physicians, advance practice providers, and nurses conducted in the context of a pragmatic, randomized control trial were used for the item analysis and the exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Results: The KAHP scale is a ten-item scale scored from 10 to 50. Based on the synthesis of content validation results and the item analysis, all ten items were retained. The item and scale Content Validity Index were each .91. The reliability of the scale was .64 and the exploratory factor analysis identified three underlying constructs defined as self-rated knowledge, support for hospice and palliative care practice, and views on provider-patient communication. The presence of good model fit indices supported the structural integrity of the constructs.

OBJECTIVE: To provide the first snapshot of immediate impact of COVID-19 on Americans' stress, coping, and guideline adherence. DESIGN: Data were collected from an online workers' platform for survey research (Amazon's Mechanical Turk) from April 7 to 9, 2020. The current data represents the baseline of a longitudinal study. Best practices for ensuring high-quality data were employed. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals who are 18 years of age or older, living in the USA, and English-speaking were eligible for the study. Of 1086 unique responses, 1015 completed responses are included. SETTING: Population-based. MAIN OUTCOMES: Exposure to and stressfulness of COVID-19 stressors, coping strategies, and adherence to CDC guidelines. RESULTS: The sample was 53.9% women (n = 547), with an average age of 38.9 years (SD = 13.50, range = 18-88), most of whom were White (n = 836, 82.4%), non-Hispanic (n = 929, 91.5%), and straight/heterosexual (n = 895, 88.2%); 40% were currently married (n = 407), and 21.6% (n = 219) were caregivers. About half (50.5%) endorsed having at least \\"mostly\\" enough money to meet their needs. Respondents' locations across the USA ranged from 18.5% in the Northeast to 37.8% in the South. The most commonly experienced stressors were reading/hearing about the severity and contagiousness of COVID-19, uncertainty about length of quarantine and social distancing requirements, and changes to social and daily personal care routines. Financial concerns were rated most stressful. Younger age, female gender, and caregiver status increased risk for stressor exposure and greater degree of stressfulness. The most frequently reported strategies to manage stress were distraction, active coping, and seeking emotional social support. CDC guideline adherence was generally high, but several key social distancing and hygiene behaviors showed suboptimal adherence, particularly for men and younger adults. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Americans have high COVID-19 stress exposure and some demographic subgroups appear particularly vulnerable to stress effects. Subgroups less likely to adhere to CDC guidelines may benefit from targeted information campaigns. these findings may guide mental health interventions and inform policy-making regarding implications of specific public health measures.","output":"Americans' COVID-19 Stress, Coping, and Adherence to CDC Guidelines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic systems, in which dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin levels are depleted and lead to the development of motor and non-motor symptoms such as tremor, bradykinesia, weight changes, fatigue, depression, and visual hallucinations. Therapeutic strategies place much focus on dopamine replacement and the inhibition of dopamine metabolism. The present study was based on the known abilities of chalcones to act as molecular scaffolds that selectively inhibit MAO-B with the added advantage of binding reversibly. Recently, we synthesized a series of 26 chalcone compounds, amongst which (2E)-1-(2H-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)prop-2-en-1-one (O10) and (2E)-1-(2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-6-yl)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)prop-2-en-1-one (O23) most inhibited MAO-B. Hence, the present study was performed to explore the molecular mechanisms responsible for the neuroprotective effect of O10 and O23 at varying doses such as 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg each in a haloperidol-induced murine model of PD. Both compounds were effective (though O23 was the more effective) at ameliorating extrapyramidal and non-motor symptoms in the model and improved locomotory and exploratory behaviors, reduced oxidative stress markers, and enhanced antioxidant marker and neurotransmitter levels. Furthermore, histopathological studies showed O10 and O23 both reduced neurofibrillary tangles and plaques to almost normal control levels.","output":"Exploring the Therapeutic Potentials of Highly Selective Oxygenated Chalcone Based MAO-B Inhibitors in a Haloperidol-Induced Murine Model of Parkinson's Disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wound bed preparation (WBP) is a paradigm for holistic patient care that includes treatment of the cause along with patient-centered concerns before optimizing the components of local wound care (debridement, infection/inflammation, moisture balance, and, when required, the edge effect).

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of knife sharpness on blood biochemical parameters, plasma catecholamines, and electroencephalographic (EEG) responses. Twenty Brahman crossbred steers were either subjected to slaughter with a sharp knife (n = 10) or a commercial sharp knife (n = 10); knife sharpness was measured with the ANAGO? sharpness tester. There was significant increase in adrenaline (p < 0.0001), glucose (p = 0.0167), creatinine kinase (p = 0.0123) and lactate dehydrogenase (p = 0.0151) at post-slaughter compared to pre-slaughter in commercial sharp knife group than in thesharp knife group.

We conducted this study to estimate the sensitivity/specificity and speed of shock/no-shock decision-making by prehospital emergency physicians for shockable or non-shockable rhythm, and their preference for manual versus automated defibrillation. METHODS: We developed a web application that simulates a manual defibrillator (https://simul-shock.firebaseapp.com/). In 2019, all (262) emergency physicians of six French emergency medical services were invited to participate in a study in which 60 ECG rhythms from real OHCA recordings were successively presented to the physicians for determination of whether they would or would not administer a shock. Time to decision was recorded. Answers were compared with a gold standard (concordant answers of three experts). We report sensitivity for shockable rhythms (decision to shock) and specificity for non-shockable rhythms (decision not to shock). Physicians were also asked whether they preferred manual or automated defibrillation. RESULTS: Among 215 respondents, we were able to analyse results for 190 physicians. 57% of emergency physicians preferred manual defibrillation. Median (IQR) sensitivity for a shock delivery for shockable rhythm was 0.91 (0.81-1.00); median specificity for no-shock delivery for non-shockable rhythms was 0.91 (0.80-0.96). More precisely, sensitivities for shock delivery for ventricular tachycardia (VT) and coarse ventricular fibrillation (VF) were both 1.0 (1.0-1.0); sensitivity for fine VF was 0.6 (0.2-1). Specificity for not shocking a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) was 0.83 (0.72-0.86), and for asystole, specificity was 0.93 (0.86-1). Median speed of decision-making (in seconds) were: VT 2.0 (1.6-2.7), coarse VF 2.1 (1.7-2.9), asystole 2.4 (1.8-3.5), PEA 2.8 (2.0-4.2) and fine VF 2.8 (2.1-4.3). CONCLUSIONS: Global sensitivity and specificity were comparable with published automated external defibrillator studies.

After adjusting for confounding, the detected risk for in-hospital death was lower in the tocilizumab group versus nontocilizumab group (hazard ratio = 0.47; 95% confidence interval = 0.25-0.90; p = 0.023). Moreover, use of tocilizumab was associated with a lower risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (odds ratio = 0.23; 95% confidence interval = 0.11-0.45; p < 0.0001). Furthermore, patients had heightened inflammation and more dysregulated immune cells before treatment, which might aggravate disease progression. After tocilizumab administration, abnormally elevated IL-6, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and activated partial thromboplastin time decreased. Tocilizumab may be of value in prolonging survival in patients with severe COVID-19, which provided a novel strategy for COVID-19-induced cytokine release syndrome. Our findings could inform bedside decisions until data from randomized, controlled clinical trials become available.","output":"Repurposed Tocilizumab in Patients with Severe COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China in January 2020 prompted substantial control measures including social distancing measures, suspension of public transport and industry, and widespread cordon sanitaires ('lockdowns'), that have led to a decrease in industrial activity and air pollution emissions over a prolonged period. We use a 5 year dataset from China's air quality monitoring network to assess the impact of control measures on air pollution. Pollutant concentration time series are decomposed to account for the inter-annual trend, seasonal cycles and the effect of Lunar New Year, which coincided with the COVID-19 outbreak. Over 2015-2019, there were significant negative trends in particulate matter (PM2.5, -6% yr-1) and sulphur dioxide (SO2, -12% yr-1) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2, -2.2% yr-1) whereas there were positive trends in ozone (O3, + 2.8% yr-1). We quantify the change in air quality during the LNY holiday week, during which pollutant concentrations increase on LNY's day, followed by reduced concentrations in the rest of the week. After accounting for interannual trends and LNY we find NO2 and PM concentrations were significantly lower during the lockdown period than would be expected, but there were no significant impacts on O3. Largest reductions occurred in NO2, with concentrations 27.0% lower on average across China, during the lockdown. Average concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 across China were respectively 10.5% and 21.4% lower during the lockdown period. The largest reductions were in Hubei province, where NO2 concentrations were 50.5% lower than expected during the lockdown.

We aimed to predict the potential effects of such disruptions on HIV-related deaths and new infections in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: In this modelling study, we used five well described models of HIV epidemics (Goals, Optima HIV, HIV Synthesis, an Imperial College London model, and Epidemiological MODeling software [EMOD]) to estimate the effect of various potential disruptions to HIV prevention, testing, and treatment services on HIV-related deaths and new infections in sub-Saharan Africa lasting 6 months over 1 year from April 1, 2020. We considered scenarios in which disruptions affected 20%, 50%, and 100% of the population. FINDINGS: A 6-month interruption of supply of antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs across 50% of the population of people living with HIV who are on treatment would be expected to lead to a 163 times (median across models; range 139-187) increase in HIV-related deaths over a 1-year period compared with no disruption. In sub-Saharan Africa, this increase amounts to a median excess of HIV deaths, across all model estimates, of 296a??000 (range 229a??023-420a??000) if such a high level of disruption occurred. Interruption of ART would increase mother-to-child transmission of HIV by approximately 16 times. Although an interruption in the supply of ART drugs would have the largest impact of any potential disruptions, effects of poorer clinical care due to overstretched health facilities, interruptions of supply of other drugs such as co-trimoxazole, and suspension of HIV testing would all have a substantial effect on population-level mortality (up to a 106 times increase in HIV-related deaths over a 1-year period due to disruptions affecting 50% of the population compared with no disruption). Interruption to condom supplies and peer education would make populations more susceptible to increases in HIV incidence, although physical distancing measures could lead to reductions in risky sexual behaviour (up to 119 times increase in new HIV infections over a 1-year period if 50% of people are affected). INTERPRETATION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the primary priority for governments, donors, suppliers, and communities should focus on maintaining uninterrupted supply of ART drugs for people with HIV to avoid additional HIV-related deaths. The provision of other HIV prevention measures is also important to prevent any increase in HIV incidence.

OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to study the polysomnography findings in HD and to assess whether oculomotor abnormalities are associated with poor REM sleep. METHODS Twenty-nine genetically confirmed HD patients underwent clinical evaluation including extraocular movement and OKN examination. Twenty-six patients and 15 controls underwent overnight video polysomnography (VPSG). RESULTS VPSG of 23 HD patients and 13 controls were considered for analysis. Compared to controls, HD patients had higher median wake period and higher WASO percentage (p = 0.005). REM sleep percentage was reduced significantly in HD in comparison to controls (p < 0.001). Out of 23 patients, only two patients had REM sleep above 20% while 14 patients had REM sleep percentage less than 15%. Poor horizontal OKN (grades 2 and 3) was associated with the presence of low REM sleep percentage (REM sleep less than 15%) (p = 0.02). Low REM sleep was also associated with severe illness (UHDRS) (p = 0.038). CONCLUSION An association between decreased REM sleep and OKN abnormalities indicate that EOM abnormalities seen in HD could lead to errors in scoring REM sleep.

Following elongation, pig conceptuses secrete interferon gamma (IFNG) during attachment to the endometrial luminal epithelium. The objective here was to determine if conceptus production of IFNG is important for early development and establishment of pregnancy. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and somatic cell nuclear transfer technologies were used to create an IFNG loss-of-function study in pigs. Wild-type (IFNG+/+) and null (IFNG-/-) fibroblast cells were used to create embryos through somatic cell nuclear transfer. IFNG expression was not detected in IFNG-/- conceptuses on either day 15 or day 17 of pregnancy. Ablation of conceptus IFNG production resulted in the reduction of stromal CD3+ and mast cells which localized to the site of conceptus attachment on day 15. The uteri of recipients with IFNG-/- conceptuses were inflamed, hyperemic and there was an abundance of erythrocytes in the uterine lumen associated with the degenerating conceptuses. The endometrial stromal extracellular matrix was altered in the IFNG-/- embryo pregnancies and there was an increased endometrial mRNA levels for collagen XVII (COL17A1), matrilin 1 (MATN1), secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) and cysteine-rich secretory protein 3 (CRISP3), which are involved with repair and remodeling of the extracellular matrix.

One treatment strategy is combining surgery and medical therapy to reduce the recurrence of endometriosis. Though the combination of surgery and medical therapy appears to be beneficial, there is a lack of clarity about the appropriate timing of when medical therapy should be used in relation with surgery, that is, before, after, or both before and after surgery, to maximize treatment response. OBJECTIVES To determine the effectiveness of medical therapies for hormonal suppression before, after, or both before and after surgery for endometriosis for improving painful symptoms, reducing disease recurrence, and increasing pregnancy rates. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and two trials registers in November 2019 together with reference checking and contact with study authors and experts in the field to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which compared medical therapies for hormonal suppression before, after, or before and after, therapeutic surgery for endometriosis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Where possible, we combined data using risk ratio (RR), standardized mean difference or mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Primary outcomes were: painful symptoms of endometriosis as measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS) of pain, other validated scales or dichotomous outcomes; and recurrence of disease as evidenced by EEC (Endoscopic Endometriosis Classification), rAFS (revised American Fertility Society), or rASRM (revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine) scores at second-look laparoscopy. MAIN RESULTS We included 26 trials with 3457 women with endometriosis. We used the term \\"surgery alone\\" to refer to placebo or no medical therapy. Presurgical medical therapy compared with placebo or no medical therapy Compared to surgery alone, we are uncertain if presurgical medical hormonal suppression reduces pain recurrence at 12 months or less (dichotomous) (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.66; 1 RCT, n = 262; very low-quality evidence) or whether it reduces disease recurrence at 12 months - total (AFS score) (MD -9.6, 95% CI -11.42 to -7.78; 1 RCT, n = 80; very low-quality evidence). We are uncertain if presurgical medical hormonal suppression decreases disease recurrence at 12 months or less (EEC stage) compared to surgery alone (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00; 1 RCT, n = 262; very low-quality evidence). We are uncertain if presurgical medical hormonal suppression improves pregnancy rates compared to surgery alone (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.36; 1 RCT, n = 262; very low-quality evidence). No trials reported pelvic pain at 12 months or less (continuous) or disease recurrence at 12 months or less. Postsurgical medical therapy compared with placebo or no medical therapy We are uncertain about the improvement observed in pelvic pain at 12 months or less (continuous) between postsurgical medical hormonal suppression and surgery alone (MD -0.48, 95% CI -0.64 to -0.31; 4 RCTs, n = 419; I2 = 94%; very low-quality evidence). We are uncertain if there is a difference in pain recurrence at 12 months or less (dichotomous) between postsurgical medical hormonal suppression and surgery alone (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.12; 5 RCTs, n = 634; I2 = 20%; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain if postsurgical medical hormonal suppression improves disease recurrence at 12 months - total (AFS score) compared to surgery alone (MD -2.29, 95% CI -4.01 to -0.57; 1 RCT, n = 51; very low-quality evidence). Disease recurrence at 12 months or less may be reduced with postsurgical medical hormonal suppression compared to surgery alone (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.54; 4 RCTs, n = 433; I2 = 58%; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain about the reduction observed in disease recurrence at 12 months or less (EEC stage) between postsurgical medical hormonal suppression and surgery alone (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.91; 1 RCT, n = 285; very low-quality evidence). Pregnancy rate is probably increased with postsurgical medical hormonal suppression compared to surgery alone (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.39; 11 RCTs, n = 932; I2 = 24%; moderate-quality evidence). Pre- and postsurgical medical therapy compared with surgery alone or surgery and placebo There were no trials identified in the search for this comparison. Presurgical medical therapy compared with postsurgical medical therapy We are uncertain about the difference in pain recurrence at 12 months or less (dichotomous) between postsurgical and presurgical medical hormonal suppression therapy (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.07; 2 RCTs, n = 326; I2 = 2%; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain about the difference in disease recurrence at 12 months or less (EEC stage) between postsurgical and presurgical medical hormonal suppression therapy (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.28; 1 RCT, n = 273; very low-quality evidence). We are uncertain about the difference in pregnancy rate between postsurgical and presurgical medical hormonal suppression therapy (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.21; 1 RCT, n = 273; very low-quality evidence). No trials reported pelvic pain at 12 months or less (continuous), disease recurrence at 12 months - total (AFS score) or disease recurrence at 12 months or less (dichotomous). Postsurgical medical therapy compared with pre- and postsurgical medical therapy There were no trials identified in the search for this comparison. Serious adverse effects for medical therapies reviewed There was insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion regarding serious adverse effects, as no studies reported data suitable for analysis. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that the data about the efficacy of medical therapy for endometriosis are inconclusive, related to the timing of hormonal suppression therapy relative to surgery for endometriosis. In our various comparisons of the timing of hormonal suppression therapy, women who receive postsurgical medical therapy compared with no medical therapy or placebo may experience benefit in terms of disease recurrence and pregnancy. There is insufficient evidence regarding hormonal suppression therapy at other time points in relation to surgery for women with endometriosis.","output":"Pre- and postsurgical medical therapy for endometriosis surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Innovation in technology is redefining the world, including health care.

The development was completed in October 2019 and rolled out for use to occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and speech therapists. During the COVID-19 pandemic, rehabilitation services were severely interrupted. Tele-rehabilitation was used extensively to meet the demand for rehabilitation service delivery. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to (1) describe the design and development process of a tele-rehabilitation service, and (2) study how the tele-rehabilitation platform was used to overcome the disruption of rehabilitation service during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Tele-rehabilitation was developed utilizing 4 core determinants of Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology as guiding principles. A generic prescription platform, called the activity-based prescription system, and a mobile app, called the Rehabilitation App, were built. Five outcomes were used to examine the utilization of tele-rehabilitation both before and during the pandemic: throughput, patient demographic, patient conditions, workforce, and satisfaction from patients and staff. RESULTS: There was a tremendous increase in the use of tele-rehabilitation during pandemic. The total number of patients (up until July 2020) was 9101, and the main age range was between 51 to 70 years old. Tele-rehabilitation was used for a much wider scope of patient conditions than originally planned. More than 1112 therapists, which constituted 50.6% of the total workforce (1112/2196), prescribed tele-rehabilitation to their patients. Moreover, there was a high satisfaction rate from patients, with a mean rating of 4.2 out of 5, and a high adherence rate to prescribed rehabilitation activities (107840/131995, 81.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our study suggested that tele-rehabilitation in the form of a generic prescription platform and mobile app can be an effective means to provide rehabilitation to patient. During the COVID-19 pandemic, tele-rehabilitation has been used extensively and effectively to mitigate service disruption. Our findings also provide support that there is a high level of satisfaction with tele-rehabilitation; however, a longer duration study is required to demonstrate the sustained use of tele-rehabilitation, especially after the pandemic.","output":"Tele-Rehabilitation to Combat Rehabilitation Service Disruption During COVID-19 in Hong Kong: Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the global pandemic of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is classified as a biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) agent, impeding the basic research into its biology and the development of effective antivirals. Here, we developed a biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) cell culture system for production of transcription and replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus-like-particles (trVLP). This trVLP expresses a reporter gene (GFP) replacing viral nucleocapsid gene (N), which is required for viral genome packaging and virion assembly (SARS-CoV-2 GFP/N trVLP). The complete viral life cycle can be achieved and exclusively confined in the cells ectopically expressing SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, but not MERS-CoV N. Genetic recombination of N supplied in trans into viral genome was not detected, as evidenced by sequence analysis after one-month serial passages in the N-expressing cells. Moreover, intein-mediated protein trans-splicing approach was utilized to split the viral N gene into two independent vectors, and the ligated viral N protein could function in trans to recapitulate entire viral life cycle, further securing the biosafety of this cell culture model. Based on this BSL-2 SARS-CoV-2 cell culture model, we developed a 96-well format high throughput screening for antivirals discovery. We identified salinomycin, tubeimoside I, monensin sodium, lycorine chloride and nigericin sodium as potent antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

There were conflicting reports as well as unscientific opinion pieces in the scientific literature also. This study was planned to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of health-care professionals regarding HCQ. Methods: An online survey was created with 8 knowledge-based questions (n = 2 fact-based [each scoring 1], n = 6 guideline-based [each scoring 2]), and 6 attitude-based questions, and distribution among a target population of doctors was done using Google? forms. Results: Of 115 respondents, the majority considered HCQ a safe drug (86.1%) and were in favor of its usage in COVID-19 trials (81.7%) or health-care/contact prophylaxis (60.9%) but against its use as a mass prophylactic agent (80.9%). Contrary to the published guidelines/recommendations, 80% and 55.7% of respondents opined for routine cardiac and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase evaluations before prescribing HCQ. Those who were dealing with COVID-19 patients directly (n = 41) had significantly lower knowledge score compared to the others (6.37 vs. 7.72, P = 0.007). They had significantly lesser awareness for the baseline tests recommended (97.6% vs. 77.0%, P = 0.003). A significantly higher number of these physicians opposed the use of HCQ in clinical trials (26.82% vs. 8.1%, P = 0.027) and health-care/contact prophylaxis (41.5% vs. 16.2%, P = 0.008). Conclusion: Sparse and speedily gathered information on HCQ can influence the practicing doctors, especially those involved directly in COVID-19 patient care, but less familiar with the prescription of this time-tested drug.

This unprecedented situation has raised concerns about children's and adolescent's mental health. Children and adolescents diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may find this context of restrained activity particularly tricky. The objectives of our study are to gather information about the well-being and global life conditions of children and adolescents with ADHD during the COVID-19 outbreak in France. METHODS: We designed a survey including both open-ended questions and questionnaire items for parents of children and adolescents with ADHD. Parents responded to the following open-ended questions: 1) \\"How is your child doing since the lockdown?\\" 2) \\"How is life at home since the lockdown?\\" 3) \\"If you had a remote service provision with a mental health professional (e.g. by telephone or video technology), please share your thoughts and any suggestions with us\\" 4) \\"Please share any other items that you think are important about ADHD symptoms of your child and the lockdown situation\\". This survey was posted on social media on the 6th of April and disseminated by French ADHD-parent and patient organizations. The present article reports the descriptive, qualitative and textometrical analyses of the survey. RESULTS: Between day 20 and 30 of lockdown, 538 parents responded to the survey, and we included 533 responses in the final analysis. The vast majority of responders were women 95 % (95 % CI 93,50; 97,18) with children whose mean age was 10,5 (95 % CI 7.58; 13.44). Since the lockdown, 34.71 % (95 % CI 30.70; 38.94) of children experienced a worsening in well-being, 34.33 % (95 % CI 30.34; 38.56) showed no significant changes and 30.96 % (95 % CI 27.09; 35.10) were doing better according to their parents. The thematic analysis showed that an improvement of their children's anxiety was one of the main topics addressed by parents. This improvement related to less school-related strain and flexible schedules that respected their children's rhythm. Improved self-esteem was another topic that parents linked with a lesser exposure of their children to negative feed-back. Parents repeatedly reported both inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. However, optimal lockdown life conditions seemed to compensate for the impact of ADHD symptoms (e.g. sufficient space at home, presence of a garden). Some parents reported worsening of general well-being in their children, and this manifested as oppositional/defiant attitudes and emotional outbursts. Parents also cited sleep problems and anxiety in this context. As regards everyday life during lock-down, at-home schooling was another major topic-parents described that their children struggled to complete school-related tasks and that teachers seemed to have forgotten about academic accommodations. The lockdown situation seems to have raised parents' awareness of the role of inattention and ADHD symptoms in their children's learning difficulties. Due to potential selection biases, the results of our survey may not be generalizable to all children and adolescents with ADHD. The main strengths of this rapid survey-based study lies in the reactivity of the participants and the quality and diversity of their responses to the open-ended questions. CONCLUSIONS: According to their parents, most children and adolescents with ADHD experience stability or improvement of their well-being. An improvement in school-related anxiety and the flexible adjustment to the children's' rhythms as well as parents' increased awareness of the difficulties their children experience are among the key topics in parents' descriptions.","output":"[How do children and adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) experience lockdown during the COVID-19 outbreak?]/ Comment les enfants et adolescents avec le trouble dficit d'attention/hyperactivit (TDAH) vivent-ils le confinement durant la pandmie COVID-19 ?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the use of online distance learning for the education of our future healthcare professionals across the world.

However, patient choices can be the result of the complex interactivity of various factors. The aim of this study is to propose a deep neural network approach to model the complex decision of patient choice in travel distance to access care, which is an important indicator for policymaking in allocating resources. Method: We used the 4-year nationwide insurance data of Taiwan and accumulated the possible features discussed in earlier literature. This study proposes the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework to make predictions. The model performance was tested against other machine learning methods. The proposed framework was further interpreted using Integrated Gradients (IG) to analyze the feature weights. Results: We successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of using a CNN-based framework to predict the travel distance of patients, achieving an accuracy of 0.968, AUC of 0.969, sensitivity of 0.960, and specificity of 0.989. The CNN-based framework outperformed all other methods.

However, the association between frailty and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prognosis remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between frailty and mortality over 6 months in middle-aged and older patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and the association between acute morbidity severity and mortality across frailty strata. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Large academic medical center in Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1830 patients aged &#8805;50 years hospitalized with COVID-19 (March-July 2020). MEASUREMENTS: We screened baseline frailty using the CFS (1-9) and classified patients as fit to managing well (1-3), vulnerable (4), mildly (5), moderately (6), or severely frail to terminally ill (7-9). We also computed a frailty index (0-1; frail >0.25), a well-known frailty measure. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the association between frailty and time to death within 30 days and 6 months of admission. We also examined whether frailty identified different mortality risk levels within strata of similar age and acute morbidity as measured by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. RESULTS: Median age was 66 years, 58% were male, and 27% were frail to some degree. Compared with fit-to-managing-well patients, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval [CI]) for 30-day and 6-month mortality were, respectively, 1.4 (1.1-1.7) and 1.4 (1.1-1.7) for vulnerable patients; 1.5 (1.1-1.9) and 1.5 (1.1-1.8) for mild frailty; 1.8 (1.4-2.3) and 1.9 (1.5-2.4) for moderate frailty; and 2.1 (1.6-2.7) and 2.3 (1.8-2.9) for severe frailty to terminally ill. The CFS achieved outstanding accuracy to identify frailty compared with the Frailty Index (area under the curve = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.93-0.95) and predicted different mortality risks within age and acute morbidity groups.

It is well understood that modeling and digitalizing industrial-scale processes would help control production circuits better, improve efficiency, enhance personal training systems, and decrease plants' energy consumption. This tactical approach could be integrated using conscious lab (CL) as an innovative concept in the internet age. Surprisingly, no CL has been reported for the milling circuit of a cement plant. A robust CL interconnect datasets originated from monitoring operational variables in the plants and translating them to human basis information using explainable artificial intelligence (EAI) models.

The absence of any vaccine as well as any definitive drug to cure, has made the situation very grave. Therefore only few effective tools are available to contain the rapid pace of spread of this disease, named as COVID-19. On 24th March, 2020, the the Union Government of India made an announcement of unprecedented complete lockdown of the entire country effective from the next day. No exercise of similar scale and magnitude has been ever undertaken anywhere on the globe in the history of entire mankind. This study aims to scientifically analyze the implications of this decision using a kinetic model covering more than 96% of Indian territory. This model was further constrained by large sets of realistic parameters pertinent to India in order to capture the ground realities prevailing in India, such as: (i) true state wise population density distribution, (ii) accurate state wise infection distribution for the zeroth day of simulation (20th March, 2020), (iii) realistic movements of average clusters, (iv) rich diversity in movements patterns across different states, (v) migration patterns across different geographies, (vi) different migration patterns for pre- and post-COVID-19 outbreak, (vii) Indian demographic data based on the 2011 census, (viii) World Health Organization (WHO) report on demography wise infection rate and (ix) incubation period as per WHO report.

Emerging evidence shows that simvastatin (SIM) has promising anticancer activities. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Increasing reports imply statins can modulate ferroptosis through disrupting reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione peroxidase enzyme (GPX4) levels. However, whether ferroptosis contributes to SIM anticancer activity, especially regarding GPX4 is unclear. Moreover, poor aqueous SIM solubility hinders its delivery in adequate levels to tumor sites. Meanwhile, cubosomes are biocompatible nanocarriers that enhance lipophilic drug delivery. Therefore, in this study, we formulated a novel SIM-loaded cubosome (SIM-CB) and analyzed its cytotoxic activity on MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison with free SIM. METHODS: The present study tested the cytotoxic activity of SIM-CB on MCF-7 cells, in comparison with SIM using sulphorhodamine assay. We analyzed SIM-CB effect on apoptosis and cell cycle using flowcytometry, and investigated its effect on Bcl-2, caspase 3, ROS, reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxides and GPX4 enzyme. Finally, we tested the persistence of SIM-CB apoptosis and ferroptosis activities on MCF-7 cells in presence of vitamin E, a potent antioxidant and ferroptosis inhibitor. RESULTS: SIM-CB was successfully formulated at the nano size. SIM-CB significantly increased simvastatin therapeutic activity, with IC(50) of SIM-CB 52% lower than SIM. 95% CI [1.8, 2.7], SD = 0.34 for SIM-CB, and [4.1, 5.2], SD = 0.45 for SIM. Compared with free SIM, SIM-CB doubled total deaths and increased apoptosis (p < 0.05). Moreover, SIM-CB remarkably increased caspase-3, ROS, and lipid peroxide levels but decreased antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein, GSH, and GPX4 compared with free SIM. Notably, SIM-CB elicited a high distinguished resistance against the inhibitory effects of vitamin E.

These mAbs demonstrated a very high affinity with K(d) values in the range of 10(-9)-10(-14) M, and the highest affinity (K(d) value of 0.0214 pM) was 40-fold higher than the previously generated high-affinity mAb YP7 (K(d) value of 0.876 nM). Additionally, these mAbs exhibited excellent thermostability with T(m) values in the range of 45-82 C. As a proof-of-concept study for ADC, we made immunotoxins (scFv fused with PE24, the 24-kDa cytotoxic domain of Pseudomonas exotoxin A) based on these mAbs, and we found that immunotoxins targeting the N-lobe of GPC3 were overall much more potent than those targeting the C-lobe and other locations. One representative N-lobe-targeting immunotoxin J80A-PE24 demonstrated 3 to 13-fold more potency than the hitherto best immunotoxin HN3-PE24 that was previously developed.

The extent of acinar insult, intensity, and type of immune response determines the severity of the disease. Smoking, alcohol and autoimmune pancreatitis are some of the predominant risk factors that increase the risk of pancreatitis by differentially influencing the adaptive immune system. The overall decrease in peripheral lymphocyte (T-, B- and (natural killer T-) NKT-cell) count and increased infiltration into the damaged pancreatic tissue highlight the contribution of adaptive immunity in the disease pathology. Smoking and alcohol modulate the responsiveness and apoptosis of T- and B-cells during pancreatic insult. Acute pancreatitis worsens with smoking and alcohol, leading to the development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome, suggesting the critical role of adaptive immunity in fatal outcomes such as multiple organ dysfunction. The presence of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes and perforin-expressing cells in the fibrotic tissue in chronic pancreatitis modulate the severity of the disease. Due to their important role in altering the severity of the disease, attempts to target adaptive immune mediators will be critical for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.","output":"Alcohol and Smoking Mediated Modulations in Adaptive Immunity in Pancreatitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction La pandmie  COVID-19 est responsable de prs de 3 millions de dcs.

The experimental results highlighted that the storage condition has a significant (p < 0.05) effect on the oleuropein content. Regardless of the extraction condition, the frozen storage was responsible for a decrease in the oleuropein content, ranging from 5.38 to 70.09%.

METHODS: Three methods were used to assess changes in responses to COVID-19. First, website visits and call centre traffic were compared across two time periods: the comparison period (1 September 2020 to 28 September 2019), and during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic (19 March 2020 to 15 April 2020). Second, demographic and symptom data were compared across all patients who started an assessment during the comparison (n = 1650) and the COVID-19 period (n = 1668). Third, responses to questions about the impact of COVID-19 introduced to the assessment from 19 March 2020, and reports from treating therapists were examined. RESULTS: There was an 89% increase in website visits and a 90% increase in telephone calls to the clinic in the early COVID-19 period compared to the comparison period. There was a higher proportion of females in the COVID-19 sample (76.9% vs. 72.9), and a lower proportion reported being in employment (52.8% vs. 60.8%). There was a small but significant increase in the severity of anxiety symptoms, and an increase in the number of people reporting recent onset of anxiety and depression. However, there were no differences between groups in severity of symptoms of distress or depression. Most people (94%) reported concern about the impact of COVID-19, and 88% reported making changes in lifestyle. Older adults had higher levels of concern about COVID-19. Therapists reported that patients were concerned about how to access testing, manage quarantine, financial security and the effect of social isolation. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has resulted in a significant increase in contact with an established DMHS, but we have not yet detected increases in baseline symptom severity. With the prospect of prolonged restriction of movement, DMHS such as MindSpot could play an important role in both providing clinical services and monitoring the mental health of the population.","output":"Rapid report: Early demand, profiles and concerns of mental health users during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is changing the world in unprecedented and unpredictable ways Human mobility, being the greatest facilitator for the spread of the virus, is at the epicenter of this change In order to study mobility under COVID-19, to evaluate the efficiency of mobility restriction policies, and to facilitate a better response to future crisis, we need to understand all possible mobility data sources at our disposal Our work studies private mobility sources, gathered from mobile-phones and released by large technological companies These data are of special interest because, unlike most public sources, it is focused on individuals rather than on transportation means Furthermore, the sample of society they cover is large and representative On the other hand, these data are not directly accessible for anonymity reasons Thus, properly interpreting its patterns demands caution Aware of that, we explore the behavior and inter-relations of private sources of mobility data in the context of Spain This country represents a good experimental setting due to both its large and fast pandemic peak and its implementation of a sustained, generalized lockdown Our work illustrates how a direct and naive comparison between sources can be misleading, as certain days (e g , Sundays) exhibit a directly adverse behavior After understanding their particularities, we find them to be partially correlated and, what is more important, complementary under a proper interpretation Finally, we confirm that mobile-data can be used to evaluate the efficiency of implemented policies, detect changes in mobility trends, and provide insights into what new normality means in Spain","output":"Comparative Analysis of Geolocation Information through Mobile-Devices under Different COVID-19 Mobility Restriction Patterns in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Contactless shopping concepts meet the needs of those consumers who want to minimise social interactions, especially due to COVID-19;they also offer added value by combining the advantages of traditional shopping with digital features that stem from online shopping.

APTT may be influenced by coagulopathies, lupus anticoagulant and raised FVIII levels. Previous studies have shown sensitivity differences of APTT reagents to argatroban. Some recent publications have favoured the use of anti-IIa methods to determine the plasma drug concentration of argatroban. This study aims to compare the anti-IIa assays: Hemoclot thrombin inhibitor assay (HTI) and Ecarin chromogenic assay (ECA) alongside the APTT. METHODS: Residual plasma of 25 samples from 8 patients (3 with COVID-19 and HIT: n = 18, 5 with HIT: n = 7) was tested at two sites: site A: Sysmex CS5100 by HTI and APTT (Actin FS and SynthASil), and also on Stago STA Compact Max: ECA and APTT (CK Prest); and site B: Stago STA R Max 2 by ECA and APTT (Cephascreen). RESULTS: Mean APTT ratio was 1.96 (Actin FS), 1.84 (SynthASil), 1.59 (CK Prest) and 2.48 (Cephascreen). Mean argatroban concentration by HTI was 0.60 g/mL and by ECA was 0.65 g/mL (site A) and 0.70 g/mL (site B). There was a poor correlation to HTI in APTT ratios (range r2 = .0235-0.4181) with stronger correlations between ECA methods to HTI (r2 = .8998 site A, r2 = .8734 site B).

Different governments across the world have adopted NPIs (e.g., social distancing, quarantine, isolation, lockdowns, curfews, travel restrictions, closures of schools and colleges). Two fundamental strategies, namely a strict containment strategy-also called suppression strategy-and a mitigation strategy have been adopted in different countries, mainly to reduce the reproduction number (R0) to below one and hence to reduce case numbers to low levels or eliminate human-to-human transmission, as well as to use NPIs to interrupt transmission completely and to reduce the health impact of epidemics, respectively. However, the adoption of these NPI strategies is varied and the factors impacting NPI are inconsistent and unclear. This study, therefore, aimed to review the factors associated with the implementation of NPIs (social distancing, social isolation and quarantine) for reducing COVID-19. Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched for published and unpublished studies, undertaking a systematic search of: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine, COVID-19 Research, WHO database on COVID-19, and Google Scholar. Thirty-three studies were included in the study. Seven descriptive themes emerged on enablers and barriers to NPIs: the positive impact of NPIs, effective public health interventions, positive change in people's behaviour and concerns about COVID-19, the role of mass media, physical and psychological impacts, and ethnicity/age associated with COVID-19. This study has highlighted that the effectiveness of NPIs in isolation is likely to be limited, therefore, a combination of multiple measures e.g., SD, isolation and quarantine, and workplace distancing appeared more effective in reducing COVID-19. Studies suggest that targeted approaches alongside social distancing might be the way forward, and more acceptable. Further research to promote country- and context-specific adoption of NPIs to deliver public health measures is needed.

For this purpose, a telephone consultation was established for the discussion of medical findings and for the planning of procedures as part of the aftercare. The aim of this study is to measure the quality of care in telephonic patient care. Method Following a medical teleconsultation, patients were given a standardised questionnaire (EvaSys) and the quality of the interviews was queried according to defined criteria (general, technical implementation/organisation, content, summary). Results In terms of technical implementation, the majority considered the quality of the connection, timeframes and punctual contact to be good. Findings and further proceedings were largely well understood in terms of content, own concerns could be expressed, there was room for questions and despite tumor disease and possible anatomical limitations, communication was sufficiently possible. The lack of travel and the lower waiting time were perceived positively, but the majority of patients lacked physical examination and the inclusion of relatives. Conclusion The establishment of a telephone consultation is not considered a substitute for personal appointments, but seems to be feasible for selected contacts. It means conserving resources, increasing safety for patients and medical staff, and increasing time efficiency. Despite the mentioned advantages in time, travel, etc., the lack of involving relatives and the lack of physical examination lead to the overwhelming desire for a personal presentation.","output":"Survey-based analysis of the treatment quality of head-and-neck tumor-patients using telephone consultation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper focuses on the challenges, opportunities and future potentials with ammonia as a carbon-free fuel, and covers recent technological solutions to overcome the barriers with the production, storage and usage of green ammonia One way to decarbonize the energy industry is by converting electrical energy into chemical energy via water electrolysis to produce hydrogen Hydrogen can then be stored, used in a fuel cell to generate electricity, or burnt cleanly with air to generate heat, steam, producing only water as a by-product However, hydrogen has an extremely low density, even when compressed, which means that its energy density on a volumetric basis remains distinctly substandard to most liquid fuels, hydrogen also has a much wider range of concentrations over which it remains potentially explosive Ammonia alternatively is ~ 18% hydrogen by weight, which means that in terms of hydrogen density, it is ~ 50% higher than compressed or liquefied hydrogen One major advantage is that there is an existing infrastructure for the production, transport and distribution of ammonia worldwide Although ammonia in theory can be combusted to produce only nitrogen and water as emissions, in practice, several challenges arise, nitrous oxides (NOx) are often generated, especially if the combustion happens at higher temperatures and/or under pressure, in vehicle engines, gas turbines and as rocket fuel To overcome such challenges, further research into ammonia combustion phenomena is required This review sheds light on recent technological advancements with ammonia from the production point to the utilization end point Moreover, the study concludes with a techno-economic evaluation and global market trends of ammonia in the COVID-19 crises","output":"Progress in green ammonia production as potential carbon-free fuel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of June 16, 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in 2,104,346 cases and 116,140 deaths in the United States.* During pregnancy, women experience immunologic and physiologic changes that could increase their risk for more severe illness from respiratory infections (1,2). To date, data to assess the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 among pregnant U.S. women and determine whether signs and symptoms differ among pregnant and nonpregnant women are limited. During January 22-June 7, as part of COVID-19 surveillance, CDC received reports of 326,335 women of reproductive age (15-44 years) who had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Data on pregnancy status were available for 91,412 (28.0%) women with laboratory-confirmed infections; among these, 8,207 (9.0%) were pregnant. Symptomatic pregnant and nonpregnant women with COVID-19 reported similar frequencies of cough (>50%) and shortness of breath (30%), but pregnant women less frequently reported headache, muscle aches, fever, chills, and diarrhea. Chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease were more commonly reported among pregnant women than among nonpregnant women. Among women with COVID-19, approximately one third (31.5%) of pregnant women were reported to have been hospitalized compared with 5.8% of nonpregnant women. After adjusting for age, presence of underlying medical conditions, and race/ethnicity, pregnant women were significantly more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (aRR = 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-1.8) and receive mechanical ventilation (aRR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2-2.4).

These findings suggest that among women of reproductive age with COVID-19, pregnant women are more likely to be hospitalized and at increased risk for ICU admission and receipt of mechanical ventilation compared with nonpregnant women, but their risk for death is similar. To reduce occurrence of severe illness from COVID-19, pregnant women should be counseled about the potential risk for severe illness from COVID-19, and measures to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 should be emphasized for pregnant women and their families.","output":"Characteristics of Women of Reproductive Age with Laboratory-Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Infection by Pregnancy Status - United States, January 22-June 7, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The extent to which oncology social workers (OSWs) are available and adapting to disruptions in service delivery throughout the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown.Objectives: The purpose of this report is to outline the initial impact of COVID-19 on oncology social work practice during the first six months of the pandemic.Methods: As part of a nationwide investigation of workforce conditions for OSWs, three professional organizations surveyed their members to assess the effects of COVID-19 on changes to work hours, employment status, work setting, pay, and mode for patient contact (e.g., telephone or videoconference).Findings: Among 939 OSWs, 20% reported a reduction in work hours, and two-thirds indicated a temporary shift in work to home, with most patient contact occurring primarily via telephone or videoconference.Implications: Results speak to the essential nature of oncology social work and the need for evidence to inform OSW training and advocacy efforts for however long the pandemic continues.","output":"Six months in: COVID-19 and its impact on oncology social work practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to describe the successful emergency plan implemented by Padova University Hospital (AOUP) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Many factors hinder treatment attendance, and language discordance with the provider may present an additional obstacle to attending therapy. This study evaluates factors associated with voice therapy attendance at a language-diverse, safety-net hospital. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective chart review METHODS: Retrospective review of adult patients referred to speech language pathology for treatment of voice disorders from January, 2018 to April, 2019. Primary spoken language, interpreter collaboration, and patient demographics were obtained from medical records. Multivariate analysis compared patient factors with voice therapy attendance versus nonattendance. RESULTS Of 422 patients, 219 (52%) attended at least one therapy session, whereas 203 (48%) did not attend (n = 120) or schedule therapy (n = 83). In multivariate analysis, only the association between public insurance and nonattendance was statistically significant (P = .016). After adjusting for interpreter use and interval between referral and first appointment, patients with private health insurance were 2.35 times more likely to attend therapy compared to those with public insurance (95% confidence interval: 1.18-4.71). Non-English language; interpreter collaboration; distance from hospital; and patient demographics, including age, gender, ethnicity, and birthplace, did not significantly correlate with attendance. CONCLUSIONS In a culturally and language-diverse cohort of dysphonic patients, individuals with public health insurance were significantly less likely to attend voice therapy. Language-discordant therapy and interpreter collaboration was not a statistically significant barrier to therapy attendance.

METHODS: To extract the results, Derwent Innovation database is used by a combination of different key-strings. Approximately 3800 patents were obtained and further scrutinized and analyzed. The present write-up also discusses the recent progress of patent applications in a period of the year 2010 to 2020 (present) along with the recent developments in India for the treatment options for CoV and 2019-nCoV. RESULTS: Present analysis showed that key areas of the inventions have been focused on vaccines and diagnostic kits apart from the composition for treatment of CoV. We also observed that no specific vaccine treatments is available for treatment of 2019-nCov, however, developing novel chemical or biological drugs and kits for early diagnosis, prevention and disease management is the primarily governing topic among the patented inventions. The present study also indicates potential research opportunities for the future, particularly to combat 2019-nCoV. CONCLUSION: The present paper analyzes the existing patents in the field of Coronaviruses and 2019-nCoV and suggests a way forward for the effective contribution in this upcoming research area. From the trend analysis, it was observed an increase in filing of the overall trend of patent families for a period of 2010 to the current year. This multifaceted analysis of identified patent literature provides an understanding of the focuses on present ongoing research and grey area in terms of the trends of technological innovations in disease management in patients with CoV and 2019-nCoV. Further, the findings and outcome of the present study offer insights for the proposed research and innovation opportunities and provide actionable information in order to facilitate policymakers, academia, research driven institutes and also investors to make better decisions regarding programmed steps for research and development for the diagnosis, treatment and taking preventive measures for CoV and 2019-nCoV. The present article also emphasizes on the need for future development and the role of academia and collaboration with industry for speedy research with a rationale.","output":"A Case Study: Analysis of Patents of Coronaviruses and Covid-19 for Technology Assesment and Future Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2, became pandemic very quickly.

Varied environmental and physiological signals touch the antibiotic machinery that faced a serious decline in the last decades.

These gene clusters are linked with a great reservoir of yet unknown molecules, and arranging them is considered a major challenge for biotechnology approaches. In the present paper, we discuss the recent strategies that have been taken to augment the yield of secondary metabolites via awakening these cryptic genes in Actinomycetes with emphasis on chemical signaling molecules used to induce the antibiotics biosynthesis. The rationale, types, applications and mechanisms are discussed in detail, to reveal the productive path for the unearthing of new metabolites, covering the literature until the end of 2020.","output":"A Glossary for Chemical Approaches towards Unlocking the Trove of Metabolic Treasures in Actinomycetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gender-affirming care (GAC) is critical to the well-being of transgender and gender diverse youth and was limited by COVID-19 stay-at-home orders.

Since all methods currently used for the ships' compliance monitoring are costly and require proximity to the ship, the performance of a global and continuous monitoring of the emission standards' fulfillment has been impossible up to now. A promising approach is the use of remote sensing with the recently launched TROPOMI/S5P satellite. Due to its unprecedentedly high spatial resolution, it allows for the visual distinction of $\\\\text{NO}_\\\\text{2}$ plumes of individual ships. To successfully deploy a compliance monitoring system that is based on TROPOMI data, an automated procedure for the attribution of $\\\\text{NO}_\\\\text{2}$ to individual ships has to be developed. However, due to the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio, interference with the signal from other - often stronger - sources, and the absence of ground truth, the task is very challenging. In this study, we present an automated method for segmentation of plumes produced by individual ships using TROPOMI satellite data - a first step towards the automated procedure for global ship compliance monitoring. We develop a multivariate plume segmentation method based on various ships', wind's and spatial properties. For this, we propose to automatically define a region of interest - a ship sector that we normalize with respect to scale and orientation. We create a dataset, where each pixel has a label for belonging to the respective ship plume or not. We train five linear and nonlinear classifiers. The results show a significant improvement over the threshold-based baselines. Moreover, the aggregated $\\\\text{NO}_\\\\text{2}$ levels of the segmented plumes show high correlation with the theoretically derived measure of ship's emission potential.","output":"Supervised segmentation of NO2 plumes from individual ships using TROPOMI satellite data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The business model of monoline insurers is to guarantee payments of debt issues in case of defaults by the issuer. Although sparse attention is given to monolines in literature, they play an important role in enabling municipalities and firms in refinancing. This study aims to conduct a systematic review of 181 articles from 1990 to 2020 from 23,130 records and a case study on the key monoline insurers. Key failure, success factors and demand for future monoline insurance are identified. Finally, the study explores monolines potential during COVID-19 and develops a framework for monoline governance and regulation. Design/methodology/approach: The study follows Briner and Denyer and Moher et al. to implement the systematic review. The methodology involves ascertaining the motivation behind the review, and formulating research questions;aggregating relevant prior literature from scientific databases, conducting quality assessment and synthesising the data;and conducting extensive analysis for framework development. Case study methodology foundation phase focuses on understanding the research philosophy. The second phase involves documenting the procedures involved. The final phase involves collecting the relevant quantitative and qualitative material. In addition, collecting empirical data from numerous sources allows triangulation. Findings: The review results of 181 articles from 1990 to 2020 show that peak article counts occur in 2010 and 2013 (nine academic studies) and in 2008 and 2010 (six industry studies). Over- and under-explored domains happen to be bond pricing (86 academic studies) and bond markets (36 industry studies) and corporate bonds (19 academic studies), respectively. The study highlights failure factors such as adverse selection, premiums mispricings, inadequate capital and regulation, untimely downgrades and governance issues;and identifies success factors such as conservative underwriting, early financing, competitor business acquisitions and obtaining put-back claims. Potential during COVID-19 is discussed and a monoline governance framework is developed. Research limitations/implications: Search and selection criteria distortions may lead to sample selection bias in systematic reviews. Issue is addressed by using different permutations of the search key words to refine the search criteria. Reference list of collected final sample of articles are perused to identify additional articles. It is difficult to obtain verifiable empirical data on the bond/monoline insurers or their insured products, especially for the structured finance sector. Most of the information available on data stream and firms quarterly financial reports for publicly traded monoline/bond insurers and credit rating reports are included to overcome this issue. Practical implications: Demand for bond/monoline insurance still persists even in the USA. Although borrowing costs are low, obtaining bank loans would be challenging for municipalities and corporates with increased risks. Especially, given worldwide government stimulus on wages, most municipalities would possess reduced budgets for public finance. Monoline insurance can play a key role in financing such projects. Thus, it is important to understand their unique traditional and transformed business model and applicability during and post-COVID-19. Given the near extinction of bond/monoline insurers during the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC), an adequate framework for bond/monoline insurers as developed in this study is key for future business continuity. Social implications: There is significant interest, especially, from the industry on monolines as identified in our systematic review. Monoline insurance has major effects on taxpayers, government policies and bond investors. They aid in financing public finance projects that have significant societal impact. This study contributes by filling existing gaps in the literature, especially, from a behavioural, ethical and social perspective of the monolines, regulators, other stakeholders and new entran s to the industry during COVID-19. This study links prior finance theories to the impact of bond/monoline insurers during the 2008 GFC and their stakeholders involved that has societal implications. Originality/value: This study can be differentiated from prior research on monoline insurers as follows: The study identifies, gaps, similarities, trends between prior academic and industry literature and develop a bond/monoline governance framework;identifies key failure and success factors during the 2008 GFC crisis to develop the governance framework and identify monolines potential during COVID-19;as opposed to most prior literature that only focus on one (Drake and Neal, 2011 analyse MBIA) or two key bond/monoline insurers, this study focuses on five key bond/monoline insurers in detail and all other key insurers as well in the empirical analysis section. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Icarus of the 21st century: bond/monoline insurance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Earlier in 2016, the ACLU's executive director, Anthony Romero, had encouraged me to apply for the legal director job with visions of overseeing the ACLU's legal department, and especially its Supreme Court docket, under a liberal-majority Supreme Court Based on his campaign and his base of support, we could expect voter suppression, opposition to LGBT equality, and a Justice Department Civil Rights Division that would do little to enforce the civil rights that are its raison d'etre On my third day on the job, I testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on then-Senator Jeff Sessions's nomination to become Attorney General Without a vigorous opposition political party, critics in the academy, perspectives of religious faiths, and people speaking out individually and together for their beliefs, the First Amendment (and the rest of the Constitution) would only be so many words on a page [ ]while the First Amendment is essential to protect civil society, civil society is also essential to the realization of the First","output":"Defending Liberty in the Trump Era: Reflections from the Front"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Patterns of trauma during the covid-19 lockdown were reviewed.

Although these lockdowns are imposed to save public health by reducing the transmission of the virus, rather significant improvements of the air quality in this period have been reported in different areas, mainly as a result of the reduction in vehicular trips. In this research, the city of Turin in the northern part of Italy has been considered as the study area, because of its special meteorology and geographic location in one of the most polluted regions in Europe, and also its high density of vehicular emissions. A Lagrangian approach is applied to illustrate and analyze the effect of imposing full lockdown restrictions on the reduction of traffic-induced air pollution in the city.

Lung-protective ventilation (LPV) has been proven to improve perioperative oxygenation and lung compliance in some critical patients. This study aimed to investigate whether intraoperative LPV could improve respiratory function and prevent postoperative complications in emergency TBI patients. METHODS: Ninety TBI patients were randomly allocated to three groups (1:1:1): Group A, conventional mechanical ventilation [tidal volume (VT) 10 mL/kg only]; Group B, small VT (8 mL/kg) + positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (5 cmH(2)O); and Group C, small VT (8 mL/kg) + PEEP (5 cmH(2)O) + recruitment maneuvers (RMs). The primary outcome was the incidence of total postoperative pulmonary complications; Secondary outcomes were intraoperative respiratory mechanics parameters and serum levels of brain injury markers, and the incidence of each postoperative pulmonary and neurological complication. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients completed the final analysis. The intraoperative PaO(2) and dynamic pulmonary compliance of Groups B and C were higher than those of Group A (P = 0.028; P = 0.005), while their airway peak pressure and plateau pressure were lower than those of group A (P = 0.004; P = 0.005). Compared to Group A, Groups B and C had decreased 30-day postoperative incidences of total pulmonary complications, hypoxemia, pulmonary infection, and atelectasis (84.0 % vs. 57.1 % vs. 53.8 %, P = 0.047; 52.0 % vs. 14.3 % vs. 19.2 %, P = 0.005; 84.0 % vs. 50.0 % vs. 42.3 %, P = 0.006; 24.0 % vs. 3.6 % vs. 0.0 %, P = 0.004). Moreover, intraoperative hypotension was more frequent in Group C than in Groups A and B (P = 0.007). At the end of surgery, the serum levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 in Group B were lower than those in Groups A and C (P = 0.002; P < 0.001). The postoperative incidences of neurological complications among the three groups were comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous intraoperative administration of small VT + PEEP is beneficial to TBI patients.

Covid-19 has fundamentally challenged the global health care system in all aspects. However, there is a growing concern for the subsequent detrimental effects of continuing delays or adjustments on time-dependent treatments for Covid-19 negative patients. Patients arriving to the ED with STEMIs and acute CVA are currently presumed to have delays due to Covid-19 related concerns. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic on non-Covid19 patients in emergency care settings. We conducted a retrospective study from February 2020 to April 2020 and compared this to a parallel period in 2019 to assess the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on three distinct non-Covid-19 ED diagnosis that require immediate intervention. Our primary outcome measures were time to primary PCI in acute STEMI, time to fibrinolysis in acute CVA, and time to femoral hip fracture correction surgery. Our secondary outcome measure included a composite outcome of length of stay in hospital and mortality. From 1 February 2020 to 30 April 2020, the total referrals to ED diagnosed with STEMI, Hip fracture and CVA of which required intervention were 197 within Covid-19 group 2020 compared to 250 in the control group 2019. Mean duration to intervention (PCI, surgery and tPA, respectively) did not differ between COVID-19 group and 2019 group. Among femoral hip fracture patients', the referral numbers to ED were significantly lower in Covid-19 era (p = 0.040) and the hospitalization stay was significantly shorter (p = 0.003). Among CVA patients', we found statistical differences among the number of referrals and the patients' age. Coping with the Covid-19 pandemic presents a challenge for the general healthcare system. Our results suggest that with proper management, despite the obstacles of isolation policies and social distancing, any negative impact on the quality of health care for the non-Covid-19 patients can be minimized in the emergency department setting.","output":"The Pandemic's impacts on patients without Covid-19 on multidisciplinary aspects in emergency medicine care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hydrodynamic electrospray ionization jetting was applied for generating and characterizing calcium cross-linked alginate microparticles.

Initially activated as alarm raising systems, their function can be finally switched towards inflammation resolution, where they sustain immune maturation and orchestrate repair mechanisms, opening the way back to homeostasis. However, when getting out of control, these defense systems can become deleterious and trigger serious cellular and tissue damage. Therefore, they can be considered as double-edged swords.

A number of viruses have been newly discovered or emerged in the last decade, including human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, new human coronaviruses and rhinoviruses, human polyomaviruses, and a new 2009 pandemic strain of influenza A/H1N1. The potential for these viruses to cause lower respiratory tract infections after transplantation varies, and is greatest for human metapneumovirus and H1N1 influenza, but appears to be limited for the other new viruses. Acute and long-term complications in hematopoietic and solid organ transplant recipients are active areas of research.

Method: A 25-year-old male student was admitted to the emergency department with an acute bilateral visual loss and headaches, nausea, and cold sweats. A complete clinical and ophthalmologic examination was performed. Results: On ophthalmic examination, visual acuity (VA) was light perception in the right eye (RE) and no light perception in the left eye (LE). Pupillary examinations demonstrated dilated, non-reactive pupils. An arterial blood gas analysis showed systemic metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.23 and Gap anion elevated. Consequently, these results were enough to provide a substantial suspicion of methanol toxicity and start the treatment. 72 hours after, he confessed that he had been inhaling methanol-based solvent for eight years. Conclusions: Methanol-induced toxicity can cause a non-reversible toxic optic neuropathy. Blood acidemia with Gap anion elevated and a suspicious fundus ophthalmic examination allows a fast diagnosis. A quick treatment based on dialysis, intravenous ethanol, sodium bicarbonate, vitamin B12, and intravenous methylprednisolone slows the secondary intoxication damages.

It was subsequently called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in all employees of the Nouakchott National Hospital Center (CHN). The study was conducted during the week 20/05/2020 to 27/05/2020. It involved 853 employees of all ranks (doctors, pharmacists, nurses, secretaries, security personnel, administrators...) of whom 504 were male and 331 were female, with a sex ratio of 1,52 with an average age of 39 years, ranging from 20 to 60 years. The screening for IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was performed using Biotime (Xiamen Biotime Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) immunochromatographic technique. Out of 835 employees included in our study, 14 were positive (1.67%) of whom 12 had IgM and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and 2 had isolated IgM. Nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in these 14 patients and was positive in six. While PCR is the gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, in particular rapid tests (RDTs) are a diagnostic complement to COVID-19.

Its peculiar primary health care (PHC) system faces a burden due to the contagion occurring in the community environment. Then, the aim is to estimate the effect of the coverage of primary health care and social isolation on the evolution of confirmed cases and deaths by COVID-19, controlling sociodemographic, economic and health system aspects. METHODS: A time series design was designed with data on diagnosed cases of COVID-19 and their deaths as outcomes in the capital cities of the Northeast region of Brazil. Independent variables such as PHC coverage, hospital beds, social isolation, demographic density, Gini index and other indicators were analyzed. A Autoregressive Generalized Linear Model method was applied for model the relationship. RESULTS: We identified an exponential growth of cases (y = 0.0025(0.71x); p-value<0,001). However, there is a high variability in the occurrence of outcomes. PHC coverage75% (2 = 9.27; p-value = 0.01) and social isolation rate (2 = 365.99; p-value<0.001) proved to be mitigating factors for the spread of COVID-19 and its deaths.

We sought to identify risk factors for influenza-related hospitalization, specifically the role of immunization and oseltamivir prescriptions. METHODS: Patients with influenza diagnoses were identified from the MarketScan database (2014-2018). Primary risk factors of interest were an influenza vaccination within 6 months prior to infection and oseltamivir prescriptions (filled on the day diagnosis, the following day, or 2-5 days). A multivariable logistic regression model was run to identify risk factors for influenza-related hospitalizations within 30 days of diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 2 395 498 influenza infections, 0.27% were hospitalized. Of those prescribed oseltamivir the day of diagnosis, 0.13% were later hospitalized, compared to 0.67% among those who filled prescriptions the following day and 11.8% when filled within 2 to 5 days. Upon adjustment, oseltamivir prescriptions filled on the day of diagnosis were associated with significantly decreased odds of hospitalization (OR 0.51 CI 0.48-0.55). Prescriptions filled within 1 to 5 days of diagnosis were associated with significantly increased odds of hospitalization (1 day OR 2.01 CI 1.81-2.24; 2-5 days OR 34.1 CI 31.7-36.6). Flu vaccination was associated with a lower odds for hospitalization (OR 0.84 CI 0.74-0.95).

All women of childbearing age (13-49 years) from the open national COVID-19 database from the Ministry of Health of Mexico were considered for eligibility. SARS-COV-2 infection was confirmed or ruled out by RT-qPCR. We performed a bivariate and multivariable analysis to estimate mortality risk. Results: Ten (2.2%) pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 died. Positive pregnant patients did not have a higher risk of complications (admission to the ICU, pneumonia, or requirement for mechanical ventilation) or death than the controls. In the multivariate analysis, only history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease remained independently associated with death in the positive cohort. Seven (0.6%) pregnant women with a negative test died. In bivariate analysis, pregnant patients with a positive test had a higher risk of death than pregnant patients with a negative test (relative risk (RR) = 3.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.48-10.12), but no higher risk was found than in non-pregnant women with a positive test (RR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.44-1.53), and 60-day mortality did not significantly differ among pregnant patients with or without a positive test (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.12-1.30) or between COVID-19-positive patients who were pregnant or not pregnant (HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.35-1.56).

To verify this, we grafted Arabidopsis Col-0 (WT) scion onto rootstock originated from WT or a double-knockout mutant of CK receptors AHK2 and AHK3 (ahk2-5 ahk3-7; ahk23) because this mutant over accumulates CKs in the body probably due to feedback homeostasis regulation. The grafted plants (scion/rootstock: WT/WT and WT/ahk23) were grown in vermiculite pots or solid media for vegetative growth and biochemical analysis. The root-specific deficiency of AHK2 and AHK3 increased root concentrations of trans-zeatin (tZ)-type and N6-(2-isopentenyl) adenine (iP)-type CKs, induced CK biosynthesis genes, and repressed CK degradation genes in the root. The WT/ahk23 plants had significantly larger shoot weight, rosette diameter, and leaves area than did the WT/WT plants. Shoot concentrations of tZ-type CKs showed increasing trends in the WT/ahk23 plants. Moreover, the root-specific deficiency of AHK2 and AHK3 enhanced shoot growth in the WT scion more strongly than in the ahk23 scion, suggesting that shoot growth enhancement could occur through increased shoot perception of CKs. In the WT/ahk23 shoots compared with the WT/WT shoots, however, induction of most of CK-inducible response regulator genes was not statistically significant. Thus we suggest that the root-specific reduction of CK perception enhances shoot growth only partly by increasing the amount of root-derived tZ-type CKs and their perception by shoots.

Zimbabwe's initial Covid lockdown in March 2020 and associated movement restrictions interrupted clinical service provision for 6 weeks, particularly in mobile clinics, triggering the adaptation of services for the Covid\\\\19 context and a scale up of differentiated service delivery (DSD) models. PrEP service delivery decentralized with shifts from clinical settings towards community/home\\\\based, peer\\\\led PrEP services to expand and maintain access. We hypothesize that peer\\\\led community\\\\based provision of PrEP services influenced both demand and supply\\\\side determinants of PrEP uptake. We observed the effect of these adaptations on PrEP uptake among FSW accessing services in Sisters in 2020. METHODS: New FSW PrEP initiations throughout 2020 were tracked by analysing routine Sisters programme data and comparing it with national PrEP initiation data for 2020. We mapped PrEP uptake among all negative FSW attending services in Sisters alongside Covid\\\\19 adaptations and shifts in the operating environment throughout 2020: prior to lockdown (JanuaryCMarch 2020), during severe restrictions (AprilCJune 2020), subsequent easing (JulyCSeptember 2020) and during drug stockouts that followed (OctoberCDecember 2020). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: PrEP uptake in 2020 occurred at rates <25% (315 initiations or fewer) per month prior to the emergence of Covid\\\\19. In response to Covid\\\\19 restrictions, DSD models were scaled up in April 2020, including peer demand creation, community\\\\based delivery, multi\\\\month dispensing and the use of virtual platforms for appointment scheduling and post\\\\PrEP initiation support. Beginning May 2020, PrEP uptake increased monthly, peaking at an initiation rate of 51% (n = 1360) in September 2020. Unexpected rise in demand coincided with national commodity shortages between October and December 2020, resulting in restriction of new initiations with sites prioritizing refills. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the impact of Covid\\\\19 on the Sisters Programme and FSW mobility, DSD adaptations led to a large increase in PrEP initiations compared to pre\\\\Covid levels demonstrating that a peer\\\\led, community\\\\based PrEP service delivery model is effective and can be adopted for long\\\\term use.","output":"It went through the roof: an observation study exploring the rise in PrEP uptake among Zimbabwean female sex workers in response to adaptations during Covid\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Trusted Research environments (TRE)s are safe and secure environments in which researchers can access sensitive data.

However, the currently available R package cosinor could only analyze daily cross-sectional data and compare the parameters between groups with two levels. To evaluate longitudinal changes in the circadian patterns, we need to extend the model to a mixed-effect model framework, allowing for random effects and interaction between COSINOR parameters and time-varying covariates. RESULTS: We developed the cosinoRmixedeffects R package for modelling longitudinal periodic data using mixed-effects cosinor models. The model allows for covariates and interactions with the non-linear parameters MESOR, amplitude, and acrophase. To facilitate ease of use, the package utilizes the syntax and functions of the widely used emmeans package to obtain estimated marginal means and contrasts. Estimation and hypothesis testing involving the non-linear circadian parameters are carried out using bootstrapping. We illustrate the package functionality by modelling daily measurements of heart rate variability (HRV) collected among health care workers over several months. Differences in circadian patterns of HRV between genders, BMI, and during infection with SARS-CoV2 are evaluated to illustrate how to perform hypothesis testing. CONCLUSION: cosinoRmixedeffects package provides the model fitting, estimation and hypothesis testing for the mixed-effects COSINOR model, for the linear and non-linear circadian parameters MESOR, amplitude and acrophase.

(ii) To what extent do these rehabilitation recommendations differ? Methods: Retrospective analysis of currently used early rehabilitation protocols after ACLR in German-speaking countries (GER, AUT and SUI) was conducted. Rehabilitation criteria included weight bearing, range of motion (ROM), the utilization of braces, continuous passive/active motion therapy (CPM/CAM), rehabilitation training and sport-specific training. Tendon grafts were differentiated as hamstring (HAM) and bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts (BTB). Concomitant pathologies included meniscus injuries (+M) and unhappy triad injuries (+UTI). Results: Most of the surveyed protocols were differentiated according to the used tendon graft or additional therapy of concomitant injuries (ACLR-differentiated, n = 147 vs. ACLR without graft differentiation, n = 58). When comparing ACLR-HAM and ACLR-BTB, significant differences were found regarding weight bearing (p = 0.01), ROM (p = 0.05) and the utilization of braces (p = 0.03). Regarding ACLR+M, an overall significant decelerated rehabilitation could be detected. After ACLR+UTI-therapy, a significant delayed start to full weight bearing (p = 0.002) and ROM (p < 0.001) was found. Conclusions: Most orthopedic surgeons from German-speaking countries differentiate early rehabilitation after ACLR according to the tendon graft used and therapy of concomitant pathologies.

We describe data on SARS-CoV-2 testing among PEH in US clinic- and community-based settings from March through November 2020. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive analysis of data from HCH clinics and community testing events. We used a standardized survey to request data from HCH clinics. We developed and made publicly available an online data entry portal to collect data from community-based organizations that provided testing for PEH. We assessed positivity rates across clinics and community service sites serving PEH and used generalized linear mixed models to account for clustering. RESULTS: Thirty-seven HCH clinics reported providing 280 410 tests; 3.2% (n = 8880) had positive results (range, 1.6%-4.9%).

The World Health Organization has named this new virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 in November 2019 in Wuhan, China, physicians, researchers, and others have made it their top priority to find drugs and cures that can effectively treat patients and reduce mortality rates. The symptoms of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) include fever, dry cough, body aches, and anosmia. Various therapeutic compounds have been investigated and applied to mitigate the symptoms in COVID-19 patients and cure the disease. Degenerative virus analyses of the infection incidence and COVID-19 have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 penetrates the pulmonary alveoli's endothelial cells through Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the membrane, stimulates various signaling pathways and causes excessive secretion of cytokines. The continuous triggering of the innate and acquired immune system, as well as the overproduction of pro-inflammatory factors, cause a severe condition in the COVID-19 patients, which is called \\"cytokine storm\\". It can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in critical patients. Severe and critical COVID-19 cases demand oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilator support. Various drugs, including immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive agents (e.g., monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and interleukin antagonists) have been utilized in clinical trials. However, the studies and clinical trials have documented diverging findings, which seem to be due to the differences in these drugs' possible mechanisms of action.

COVID-19; however, it is estimated that few rapid-antigen test results are reported to local departments of health. ObjectiveTo characterize how often individuals in six communities throughout the United States used a digital assistant to log rapid-antigen test results and report them to their local Department of Health. DesignThis prospective cohort study is based on anonymously collected data from the beneficiaries of The Say Yes! Covid Test program, which distributed 3,000,000 rapid antigen tests at no cost to residents of six communities between April and October 2021. We provide a descriptive evaluation of beneficiaries use of digital assistant for logging and reporting their rapid antigen test results. Main Outcome and MeasuresNumber and proportion of tests logged and reported to the Department of Health through the digital assistant ResultsA total of 178,785 test kits were ordered by the digital assistant, and 14,398 households used the digital assistant to log 41,465 test results. Overall, a small proportion of beneficiaries used the digital assistant (8%), but over 75% of those who used it reported their rapid antigen test results to their state public health department. The reporting behavior varied between communities and was significantly different for communities that were incentivized for reporting test results (p < 0.001). In all communities, positive tests were less reported than negative tests (60.4% vs 75.5%; p<0.001). Conclusions and RelevanceThese results indicate that app-based reporting with incentives may be an effective way to increase reporting of rapid tests for COVID-19; however, increasing the adoption of the digital assistant is a critical first step.","output":"If you build it, will they use it?

Restricted human interaction with nature during this crisis time has appeared as a blessing for nature and environment. Reports from all over the world are indicating that after the outbreak of COVID-19, environmental conditions including air quality and water quality in rivers are improving and wildlife is blooming. India has always been a hub of pollution with huge population, heavy traffics and polluting industries leading to high air quality index (AQI) values in all major cities. But after declaration of lockdown due to COVID-19, quality of air has started to improve and all other environmental parameters such as water quality in rivers have started giving a positive sign towards restoring. This paper provides evidence-based insight into improvement of air quality and environment during pre and post lockdown of this pandemic situation. An attempt has been made to visualize the improvement in the air quality using tools like satellite images of Indian atmosphere, results of onsite real-time monitoring at specific locations (Ghaziabad-highest polluting city of India) and Air quality index (AQI) calculated by central pollution control board of India.","output":"Indirect impact of COVID-19 on environment: A brief study in Indian context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Observational data suggest that B-cell-depleting therapies are effective for antibody-mediated autoimmune encephalitis. However, randomized controlled trials are needed. Here, we report challenges encountered in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of ocrelizumab for autoimmune encephalitis that failed to meet recruitment goals. METHODS: This was a single-center, 12-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients with autoimmune encephalitis were randomized in 1:1 fashion to placebo or ocrelizumab infusion after receiving first-line immunotherapy. The primary endpoint of the study was clinical worsening, defined as a perceived decline by the patient or clinician or a decrease in the Lawton and Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADL), along with either worsening on the Texas Functional Living Scale (TFLS) or hospitalization for symptoms of encephalitis. RESULTS: Among 16 eligible patients, only three enrolled in the study, which closed due to poor recruitment. Two participants were randomized to the ocrelizumab arm and one to the placebo arm. The single patient in the placebo arm (NMDAR+) met the primary endpoint at 12 weeks and received open-label ocrelizumab with improvement. In the ocrelizumab arm, one participant (NMDAR+) demonstrated marked improvement, and the second (LGI1+) remained clinically stable. There were no serious adverse events associated with ocrelizumab. CONCLUSION: Clinical trial recruitment for autoimmune encephalitis is challenging, and our trial did not meet recruitment goals. Large, multicenter clinical trials are still needed, and careful attention must be given to study design, endpoints, and patient selection. Instrumented functional rating scales will be valuable outcome measures for future studies.

A previously proposed score for Stroke Prognostication Using Age and NIHSS Stroke Scale (SPAN) indicated that SPAN-100-positive patients (ie, age + NIHSS score = 100 or more) do not benefit from IV-tPA. If this finding holds true for endovascular therapy, this score can impact patient selection for such interventions. This study investigated whether a score combining age and NIHSS score can improve patients' selection for endovascular stroke therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The SPAN index was calculated for patients in the prospective Solitaire FR Thrombectomy for Acute Revascularization study: an international single-arm multicenter cohort for anterior circulation stroke treatment by using the Solitaire FR. The proportion with favorable outcome (90-day mRS score 2) was compared between SPAN-100-positive versus-negative patients. RESULTS Of the 202 patients enrolled, 196 had baseline NIHSS scores. Fifteen (7.7%) patients were SPAN-100-positive. There was no difference in the rate of successful reperfusion (Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction 2b or 3) between SPAN-100-positive versus -negative groups (93.3% versus 82.8%, respectively; P = .3). Stroke SPAN-100-positive patients had a significantly lower proportion of favorable clinical outcomes (26.7% versus 60.8% in SPAN-100-negative, P = .01). In a multivariable analysis, SPAN-100-positive status was associated with lower odds of favorable outcome (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9; P = .04). A higher baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score and a short onset to revascularization time also predicted favorable outcome in the multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS A significantly lower proportion of patients with a positive SPAN-100 achieved favorable outcome in this cohort. SPAN-100 was an independent predictor of favorable outcome after adjusting for time to treatment and the extent of preintervention tissue damage according to the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score.","output":"Impact of age and baseline NIHSS scores on clinical outcomes in the mechanical thrombectomy using solitaire FR in acute ischemic stroke study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Occupational disease and injuries are the 8th leading cause of death in the United States. Low-wage and minority workers are more likely to work in hazardous industries and are thus at greater risk. Within the small business sector, in particular, the health of low-wage and minority workers is threatened by a multitude of complex and interrelated factors that increase their risk for injuries, death, and even chronic disease. The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified these concerns, as many low-wage and minority workers are essential workers, and many small businesses are reopening with little to no guidance. The article describes work-related health risks and reviews current research on occupational and social ecological approaches to improving the health of minority and low-wage workers primarily employed by small businesses. We propose a conceptual framework that integrates the social ecological model with the hierarchy of controls to address work-related health among low-wage and minority workers specifically in the small business sector. Community-based strategies are recommended to engage small business owners and workers in efforts to address their immediate needs, while building towards sustainable policy change over time. These strategies are of particular importance as small businesses reopen in the ongoing pandemic.","output":"Proposing a social ecological approach to address disparities in occupational exposures and health for low-wage and minority workers employed in small businesses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nonpharmaceutical and pharmaceutical public health interventions are important to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. However, it is still unclear how the effectiveness of these interventions changes with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) novel variants. This simulation study utilized data from Japan and investigated how the characteristic properties of the Omicron variant, which emerged in late 2021, influence the effectiveness of public health interventions, including vaccination, the reduction of interpersonal contact, and the early isolation of infectious people. Although the short generation time of the Omicron variant increases the effectiveness of vaccination and the reduction of interpersonal contact, it decreases the effectiveness of early isolation. The latter feature may make the containment of case clusters difficult. The increase of infected children during the Omicron-dominant epidemic diminishes the effects of previously adult-targeted interventions. These findings underscore the importance of monitoring viral evolution and consequent changes in epidemiological characteristics. An assessment and adaptation of public health measures against COVID-19 are required as SARS-CoV-2 novel variants continue to emerge.","output":"Properties of the Omicron Variant of SARS-CoV-2 Affect Public Health Measure Effectiveness in the COVID-19 Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiogenic shock is defined as persistent hypotension, accompanied by evidence of end organ hypo-perfusion.

We aim to describe the symptoms and clinical course of COVID-19 among ambulatory patients seen at the Emory University multidisciplinary Acute Respiratory Clinic (ARC) developed to care for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. METHODS: PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases seen at ARC from 4/3C5/16/2020 were included in a retrospective chart review. Encounters were classified as acute, subacute, or convalescent depending on the duration since illness onset (< 1, 1C4, or >4 weeks, respectively). Demographic, clinical, physical exam, diagnostic test, and disposition data were abstracted and analyzed with standard descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Among 404 visits at ARC, 127 (31.4%) were for confirmed COVID-19 illness (107 unique patients with 1C4 visits). The majority (75.7%) of patients were female, and the median age was 55 years (range 24C89). Patients presented during acute, subacute, and convalescent phases of illness (15.7%, 58.3%, and 26.0%, respectively; Table). Prevalent co-morbidities included hypertension (39.3%), obesity (27.1%), diabetes (20.6%), and asthma (21.5%). While measured or subjective fever was reported in the majority of acute visits (60.0%), it was less common in subacute and convalescent encounters (27.0% and 30.3%). Cough was commonly reported in acute, subacute, and convalescent visits (70.0%, 79.7%, 66.7%), as were dyspnea on exertion (45.0%, 70.3%, 66.7%) and chest tightness (40.0%, 40.5%, 60.6%). Although smell or taste alteration was present in almost half of acute and subacute patients, it was only reported in a quarter of convalescent patients. Among the three stages of illness, transfers from ARC to the ED or direct hospitalizations occurred in 15.0%, 23.0%, and 12.1% of acute, subacute and convalescent visits, respectively.

METHODS: YouTube videos were evaluated independently by two nephrologists. The videos' quality was assessed with DISCERN scoring system, global quality score (GQS) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) scoring system. We determined the quartile (Q) of the videos as follows: most reliable top 25% videos Q1 and others Q2-4. RESULTS: A total of 295 videos were evaluated. University or society-sourced videos made up 15% (n = 43) of all videos, and healthcare providers were the primary target audience compared to patients (p < 0.001).

We present an improved method to estimate Rt and its application to routine surveillance data from Greece. Methods: Our method extends that of Cori et al (2013), adding Bayesian imputation of missing symptom onset dates, imputation of infection times using an external estimate of the incubation period, and an adjustment for reporting delay. To facilitate its use, we provide an R software package named \\"bayEStim\\". We applied the method to COVID-19 surveillance data from Greece, and examined the resulting Rt estimates in relation to control measures applied, in order to assess their effectiveness. We also associated Rt, as a measure of transmissibility, to population mobility as recorded in Google data and to ambient temperature. We used a serial interval between 4 and 7.5 days, and a median incubation period of 5.1 days. Results: In Greece Rt fell rapidly as the first control measures were introduced, dropping below 1 at least a week before a full lockdown came into effect. In mid-July Rt started increasing again, as increased mobility associated with tourism activity was observed. Each 10% of increase in relative mobility increased Rt by 8.1% (95% CrI 6.1-10.2%), whereas each unit celsius of temperature increase decreased Rt by 4.6% (95% CrI 5.4-13.7%). Conclusions: Mobility patterns significantly affect Rt. Most of the reduction in COVID-19 transmissibility in Greece occurred already before the lockdown, likely as a result of decreased population mobility. Lower viral transmissibility in summer does not appear sufficient to counterbalance the increased mobility due to tourism. Monitoring Rt is an essential component of COVID-19 surveillance, and it is crucial for correctly assessing the effect of control measures.","output":"An improved method to estimate the effective reproduction number of the COVID-19 pandemic: lessons from its application in Greece"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sigmoid sinus thrombophlebitis is a severe and potentially fatal intracranial complication of acute otitis media and middle ear cholesteatoma.

Core quality management methodologies are positioned on the framework illustrating their relative contribution to value, risk and cost management.FindingsThe QVRC framework is developed, and used as a basis for classifying models and methodologies associated with quality management. A set of propositions are developed, which, together with the framework, set an agenda for further research.Research limitations/implicationsNo literature review can capture the richness of discourses on terms as pervasive as value, risk and cost. This paper aims to present a systematic and reliable sampling of such literature.Practical implicationsThe resulting model can be applied to management tools, and to products and services.Originality/valueResearchers, particularly in marketing, have developed models of value, risk and cost in terms of products and services. However, delivering products that provide the appropriate value, risk and cost trade-off is an operations management problem. This is the first paper to combine value, risk and cost across the value stream showing how this interplay extends beyond product.","output":"Redefining quality in terms of value, risk and cost: a literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 19 March 2020, I last met with a group of women from a neighbourhood of Monterrey, Mexico where I have spent the past year conducting ethnographic research. They had scheduled a meeting to decide whether to continue our weekly talks on health-related topics. 'Is this coronavirus real?' was the question guiding the meeting. Women shared their thoughts on their feelings on the threat that predominates in biomedical discourse. An air of resignation pervaded their speech. Nearly all of them suffer from chronic diseases and they clearly perceive the risk of their own death. However, the material conditions of their lives limit the scope of their strategies to protect themselves. A dialogue emerged between the women's request for clarity regarding the pandemic and me, a researcher called on as a physician. This article seeks to reflect on the political and moral aspects of everyday life that configure risk perception in the context of the WHO-declared pandemic.

METHODS: Epidemiological and clinical characteristics from the 26 asymptomatic patients with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing were obtained. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (84.6%) correlated with clustering occurrence. The median period from contact to diagnosis and the last positive nucleic acid test was 19 (8C24 days) and 21.5 days (10C36 days), respectively. The median period from diagnosis to negative nucleic acid test was significantly different between patients with normal or atypical chest computed tomography (CT) findings (n=16, 61.5%; 7.5 days [2C20 days]) and patients with typical ground-glass or patchy opacities on CT(n=10, 38.5%; 12.5 days[8C22 days]; P<0.01). Seven patients (70.0%) with initial positive nucleic acid test results had a negative result simultaneously with improved CT findings. Obvious improvement in CT findings was observed in three patients (30.0%) despite positive nucleic acid test results. CONCLUSION: In asymptomatic patients, changes in biochemical and inflammatory variables are small and changes on chest CT can occur.

To achieve this goal, it is necessary to shift the economy toward the use of green and renewable energy. Critical raw materials (CRMs), Li, Co, REE, Te, Sc and others, are used in renewable energy sources (RES) production. The EU lacks its own CRM deposits, and additionally, the access to already identified deposits is limited, which is making the EU countries search for alternative CRM sources. One such source of CRMs may be mining waste generated on the Indonesian island of Bangka as a result of processing cassiterite-bearing sands. Studies of the mineral composition of the waste using the XRD method reveal rich contents of xenotime (0.79C17.55 wt%), monazite (1.55C21.23 wt%), zircon (1.87C64.35 wt%) and other minerals, carriers of valuable metals, such as Sn, Ti, Nb, Ta. The point mineral chemistry analyses were performed using EPMA. Xenotime is the main carrier of heavy rare earth elements (HREE), especially the most critical HREEs: Gd2O3 (1.42C7.16 wt%), Dy2O3 (2.28C11.21 wt%), Er2O3 (2.44C7.85 wt%), and Yb2O3 (1.71C7.10 wt%). Xenotime is characterized by a complex internal structure resulting from metasomatic processes occurring during their formation. In SEM-BSE imaging, they show zonation of internal structure, which is the effect of an HREE, Y, Si and U substitution in the crystal structure. On the other hand, thorite ThSiO4 and uranothorite (Th,U)SiO4 inclusions are present in xenotimes. The ICP-MS/ES studies of tailings reveal very high contents of HREE + Y (up to 7.58 wt%), U (up to 0.11), Th (up to 0.75 wt%) and Sc (132 ppm). A CRM source diversification is part of the strategy to ensure the security of raw materials for countries of the European Union and the green transformation of the continent. Bilateral EUCIndonesia cooperation in the geological exploration and development of primary and secondary sources may contribute to an increase in the supply of HREEs to the global market.","output":"Mining Waste as a Potential Additional Source of HREE and U for the European Green Deal: A Case Study of Bangka Island (Indonesia)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of the emergency provider lies at the forefront of recognition and treatment of novel and re-emerging infectious diseases in children.

METHODS: We undertook a cross-sectional, online self-reported survey implemented between March 31 and April 5 2020 of Italian physicians. RESULTS: Responses were received from 516 physicians, only 13% of which reported to have access to PPE every time they need them. Approximately half of the physicians reported that the information received about the use of PPE was either clear (47%) or complete (54%). Risk perception about contracting the infection was influenced by receiving adequate information on the use of PPE. Access to adequate information on the use of PPE was associated with better ability to perform donning and doffing procedures [OR = 2.2 95% C.I. 1.7-2.8] and reduced perception of risk [OR = 0.5, 95% C.I. 0.4-0.6].

There was nothing that prepared us for a statewide stay-at-home order nor the hospital lockdown that would come with the coronavirus pandemic. The hospital lockdowns resulted in disheartening loneliness that would prohibit the visitation of family to the ill or injured patients. The difficulty of locking down well parents proved challenging. Our new hospital policy restricted parent movements & their anxiety of exposure also heightened the desire to discharge. We questioned whether the peds patient was better suited in the hospital or at home. This shifted our usual practice. During March-May, our hospital restricted parent movements out of the patients room, no visitors, no swap outs during the day. This resulted in early debridements, often at the bedside, & application of the polylactic acid polymer substitute. This allowed for a discharge within 24 hrs & return to clinic in 48 hrs. METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 10 pediatric patients that normally would have remained hospitalized pre-COVID & these patients were admitted underwent debridement & early application of a polylactic acid polymer skin substitute. The charts were reviewed to determine if there were any readmissions, ER visits, delays in wound healing, delays in OR time, if needed, opposition from parents or nurses from about readiness for discharge. RESULTS: The charts indicated there was one return admission. The readmit was from a planned split thickness skin graft & the polylactic acid polymer was used to stage the deeper area while allowing the majority to heal. Charts demonstrated satisfaction of the parents that didnt want to be in the hospital during COVID. No nurses felt uncomfortable & all patients demonstrated stable vitals & good UOP at the time of discharge. This indicates several initial application on admission & was discharged within 24 hours.

This is partially driven by revolutionary advances in computational technology and the parallel dissipation of previous constraints to the collection/processing of large volumes of data. Meanwhile, the cost of bringing new drugs to market and to patients has become prohibitively expensive. Recognizing these headwinds, AI/ML techniques are appealing to the pharmaceutical industry due to their automated nature, predictive capabilities, and the consequent expected increase in efficiency. ML approaches have been used in drug discovery over the past 15C20 years with increasing sophistication. The most recent aspect of drug development where positive disruption from AI/ML is starting to occur, is in clinical trial design, conduct, and analysis. The COVID-19 pandemic may further accelerate utilization of AI/ML in clinical trials due to an increased reliance on digital technology in clinical trial conduct.

However, the processing time varies widely depending on the type of patients. Monitoring of the WT alone may not enable an effective evaluation of the lean performance of the medical staff for patients with different characteristics. The objective of this study was to use process cycle efficiency (PCE) to assess the performance of an intelligent tube preparation system (ITPS) which automatically labeled test tubes and conducted patient rerouting for phlebotomy services, and to interpret the WT during peak hours. Methods: Three time periods were used. The baseline period was from 1 July to 31 July 2014. Phase 1 was after the establishment of the ITPS, with patients 80 years old being rerouted. In phase 2, patients 78 years old were rerouted. Those data were recorded with a calling system and ITPS, respectively. Results: PCE was significantly improved from 12.9% at baseline to 51.1% (p < 0.001) in phase 1 and 53.0% (p < 0.001) in phase 2. The WT of 16.9 min at baseline was reduced to 3.8 min in phase 1 (p < 0.001), and 3.6 min in phase 2 (p < 0.001). Moreover, the results showed that a WT < 10 min was consistent with a PCE  25%.

However, COVID-19 is causing serious impacts on tax revenue and many countries are facing constraints to new investment in health. To advance UHC progress, countries can also focus on improving health system technical efficiency to maximize the service outputs given the current health financing levels. METHODS: This study assesses Cambodias public health services technical efficiency, unit costs, and utilization rates to quantify the extent to which current health financing can accommodate the expansion of social health protection coverage. This study employs Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), truncated regression, and pioneers the application of DEA Aumann-Shapley applied cost allocation to the health sector, enabling unit cost estimation for the major social health insurance payment categories. RESULTS: Overall, for the public health system to be fully efficient output would need to increase by 34 and 73% for hospitals and health centers, respectively. We find public sector service quality, private sector providers, and non-discretionary financing to be statistically significant factors affecting technical efficiency. We estimate there is potential supply-side service space to expand population coverage to an additional 4.69 million social health insurance beneficiaries with existing financing if the public health system were fully efficient. CONCLUSIONS: Public health service efficiency in Cambodia can be improved by increasing utilization of cost-effective services. This can be achieved by enrolling more beneficiaries into the social health insurance schemes with current supply-side financing levels. Other factors that can lead to increased efficiency are improving health service quality, regulating private sector providers, focusing on discretionary health financing, and incentivizing a referral system.","output":"Advancing universal health coverage in the COVID-19 era: an assessment of public health services technical efficiency and applied cost allocation in Cambodia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Moral judgment commonly depends on intuition. It is also true, though less widely agreed, that ethical theory depends on it. The nature and epistemic status of intuition have long been concerns of philosophy, and, with the increasing importance of ethical intuitionism as a major position in ethics, they are receiving much philosophical attention. There is growing agreement that intuition conceived as a kind of seeming is essential for both the justification of moral judgment and the confirmation of ethical theories. This paper describes several importantly different kinds of intuition, particularly the episodic kinds often called seemings. This is done partly by sketching numerous examples of intuition. Intuitive seemings and moral judgments based on them differ in content, basis, epistemic authority, and phenomenology. The paper explores these four dimensions of intuition and, in doing so, compares moral intuition with moral perception. The overall aim is to clarify moral phenomenology both descriptively and epistemologically and to support the view that intuitions are often discriminative responses to experience and have justificatory power analogous to the power of sense-perceptions.","output":"The Phenomenology of Moral Intuition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION In thermally injured patients, inhalation injury is often associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and is an independent predictor of increased morbidity and mortality.

We performed an early application of ECCO2R in mild-to-moderate ARDS in sheep ventilated in BiPAP mode. Our aim was to investigate its effect on severity of the lung injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS Non-pregnant farm-bred ewes (n = 15) were anesthetized and injured by a combination of wood-bark smoke inhalation and a 40% total body surface area full-thickness burn, and were observed for 72 h or death. The animals were randomized to a Hemolung group (n = 7) or a Control group (n = 8) at time of ARDS onset. ECCO2R was performed in the Hemolung group after onset of ARDS.Histopathology, CT scans, systemic and pulmonary variables, and CO2 removal were examined. RESULTS Early application of ECCO2R therapy with Hemolung in spontaneously breathing sheep decreased PaCO2 significantly, while the device removed about 70 mL of CO2 per minute. This did not result in lower minute ventilation in the Hemolung group. Lungpathology and CT scans did not show a difference between groups. CONCLUSION In an ovine model of ARDS due to smoke inhalation and burn injury, early institution of ECCO2R in spontaneously breathing animals was effective in removing CO2 and in reducing PaCO2.

Here, we validate a quantitative multiplex real-time PCR (qmPCR) assay with a panel consisting of 43 S. pneumoniae and 29 non-pneumococcal isolates, 20 culture positive, 26 culture negative and 30 spiked serum samples. A standard curve was obtained using S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 strain and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was used as an endogenous internal control. The experiment showed high sensitivity with lower limit of detection equivalent to 4 genome copies/l. The efficiency of the reaction was 100% for ply, lytA, Spn9802 and 97% for psaA. The test showed sensitivity and specificity of 100% with culture isolates and serum specimens. This study demonstrates that qmPCR analysis of sera using 4 oligonucleotide primers appears to be an appropriate method for the genotypic identification of S. pneumoniae infection.","output":"Standardisation and evaluation of a quantitative multiplex real-time PCR assay for the rapid identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Placental chorioangioma is the most common benign non-trophoblastic neoplasm of the placenta.

The cardiotocography performed during hospitalization showed an abnormal fetal pattern. A 2250 g newborn was delivered by cesarean section. No complications were observed during childbirth and postpartum was insignificant. On gross inspection a white fleshy intraparenchymal mass blooming on the maternal surface was noted; routinely stained sections revealed features consistent with chorioangioma with vascular channels lined by inconspicuous endothelial cells immunoreactive for CD31 and CD133. Focal expression of CD133 was also observed in placental villi.

Among them, the safe wearing of facemasks has played a vital role in reducing the likelihood and severity of infectious respiratory disease transmission. The reported research in facemasks has covered many of their material types, fabrication techniques, mechanism characterization, and application aspects. However, in more recent times, the focus has shifted towards the theoretical investigations of fluid flow mechanisms involved in the virus-laden particles prevention by facemasks. This exciting research domain aims to address the complex fluid transport that led to designing a facemask with a better performance. This review paper discusses the recent updates on fluid flow dynamics through the facemasks. Key design aspects such as thermal comfort and flow resistance are discussed. Furthermore, the recent progress in the investigations on the efficacy of facemasks for prevention of COVID 19 spread and the impact of wearing facemasks are presented.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-four patients (10 men, 14 women; mean age, 39 years; age range, 23-70 years) with confirmed SARS underwent follow-up thin-section CT of the thorax. The scans were obtained on average 36.5 days after hospital admission and were analyzed for parenchymal abnormality (ground-glass opacification, consolidation, or interstitial thickening) and evidence of fibrosis (parenchymal band, traction bronchiectasis, irregular interfaces). Patients were assigned to group 1 (with CT evidence of fibrosis) and group 2 (without CT evidence of fibrosis) for analysis. Patient demographics, length of hospital stay, rate of intensive care unit admission, peak lactate dehydrogenase level, pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone therapy, and peak opacification on chest radiographs were compared between the two groups. RESULTS Parenchymal abnormality was found in 96% (23 of 24) of patients and ranged from residual ground-glass opacification and interstitial thickening in group 2 (nine of 24, 38%) to fibrosis in group 1 (15 of 24, 62%). Patients in group 1 were older (mean age, 45 vs 30.3 years), had a higher rate of intensive care unit admission (27% [four of 15] vs 11% [one of nine]), more requirement for pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone (87%, [13 of 15] vs 67% [six of nine]), higher peak lactate dehydrogenase level (438.9 vs 355.6 U/L), and higher peak opacification on chest radiographs (estimated area, 14% vs 11%) than patients in group 2. CONCLUSION Pulmonary fibrosis may develop early in patients with SARS who have been discharged after treatment. Patients who are older and have more severe disease during treatment are more likely to develop thin-section CT findings of fibrosis.","output":"Thin-section CT in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome following hospital discharge: preliminary experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Academia is an arena where practitioners from industry are integrated to theoreticians.

However, the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding COVID-19 among pharmacists in Japan have not yet been elucidated. METHODS: We conducted a web-based questionnaire survey among 1,137 pharmacists working in health support pharmacies (HSPs) in Japan. These pharmacists are responsible for providing health consultations to community residents. We assessed COVID-19-related KAP among pharmacists and compared the results for two age groups: 49 years and 50 years. We used multiple regression analysis to examine which factors influence KAP scores regarding COVID-19. RESULTS: From among the 2,141 HSPs in Japan, a total of 1,137 pharmacists, each representing a different HSP, responded to the survey. The results indicated that since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, pharmacists have been providing consultations about COVID-19 to local residents, covering topics such as Effective infection prevention methods (60.6%) and What the COVID-19 pandemic would be (48.8%). Importantly, 73.5% of the pharmacists felt they did not have enough information about COVID-19. The main information resources about COVID-19 were Internet (91.2%) and television (78.9%). Across all respondents, the mean knowledge score (4.17/10) was lower than the mean scores for attitudes (7.26/10) and practices (5.79/10). Multiple regression analysis showed that having enough information about COVID-19 was a factor strongly associated with total KAP scores (p<0.001; 95% confidence interval, ?1.344 to ?0.540). CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists working in community pharmacies provide residents with information related to COVID-19. In this role as a health partner, these pharmacists need a way to strengthen and expand their knowledge, and moreover, their ability to support community residents.

PA Post-graduate education programs are voluntary and available to American licensed PAs. Therefore, an assessment of the characteristics of PA post-graduate fellowships and residencies programs was initiated. METHOD: A non-experimental, descriptive research study was designed to obtain information on the characteristics of PA postgraduate education programs in the US. The source of information was from surveyed members of the Association of Postgraduate Physician Assistant Programs (APPAP). Questions were drawn from consensus discussions. Directors of postgraduate programs that were operational in 2020 were eligible to participate. RESULTS: Seventy-two postgraduate program directors were invited to the survey and 34 program directors replied. These programs are geographically distributed across the US in 13 states. The respondents represent a wide range of medicine: surgery, emergency medicine, critical care, orthopaedics, hospitalist, psychiatry, oncology, primary care, pediatrics, and cardiology. Most programs are associated with an academic medical center and some institutions have more than one postgraduate specialty track. The curriculum includes bedside teaching, lectures, mentorship, assigned reading, procedures, simulation, and conferences. An average program length is 12 months and awards a certificate. Stipends for PA fellows are $50,000C80,000 (2020 dollars) and benefits include paid time off, health and liability insurance. About half of the programs bill for the services rendered by the PA. Over 90% of graduates are employed within 2 months of completing a PA postgraduate training program. CONCLUSION: A trend is underway in American medicine to include PAs in postgraduate education. PA postgraduate training occurs across a broad spectrum of medical and surgical areas, as well as diverse institutions and organizations overseeing these programs. Most PA postgraduate programs are in teaching hospitals where the PA resident or PA fellow also serves as a house officer alongside a categorical resident. This study sets the stage for more granular economic and social research on this growing phenomenon in American medicine.

Scholars predict that the pandemic will continue into the coming winter and will become a seasonal epidemic in the following year. Therefore, the identification of effective control measures becomes extremely important. Although many reports have been published since the COVID-19 outbreak, no studies have identified the relative effectiveness of a combination of control measures implemented in Wuhan and other areas in China. To this end, a retrospective analysis by the collection and modeling of an unprecedented number of epidemiology records in China of the early stage of the outbreaks can be valuable.In this study, we developed a new dynamic model to describe the spread of COVID-19 and to quantify the effectiveness of control measures. The transmission rate, daily close contacts, and the average time from onset to isolation were identified as crucial factors in viral spreading. Moreover, the capacity of a local health-care system is identified as a threshold to control an outbreak in its early stage. We took these factors as controlling parameters in our model. The parameters are estimated based on epidemiological reports from national and local Center for Disease Control (CDCs).A retrospective simulation showed the effectiveness of combinations of 4 major control measures implemented in Wuhan: hospital isolation, social distancing, self-protection by wearing masks, and extensive medical testing. Further analysis indicated critical intervention conditions and times required to control an outbreak in the early stage. Our simulations showed that South Korea has kept the spread of COVID-19 at a low level through extensive medical testing. Furthermore, a predictive simulation for Italy indicated that Italy would contain the outbreak in late May under strict social distancing.In our general analysis, no single measure could contain a COVID-19 outbreak once a health-care system is overloaded. Extensive medical testing could keep viral spreading at a low level. Wearing masks functions as favorably as social distancing but with much lower socioeconomic costs.","output":"A dynamic model of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak to analyze the effectiveness of control measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cash-based transactions have been losing in popularity due to the high cost associated to maintaining the cash system and due to its numerous risks Through the advent of the fourth industrial revolution, it was believed that a rapid transition to a more flexible, secure, and open cashless system would be accelerated However, numerous hurdles in regard to legislation, protocols, and resistance to change were noted, rendering a slow adoption rate However, the advent of COVID-19 pandemic and the noted potential contamination of bank notes and coinage revealed a steep support toward cashless payments and supported an immediate need to amend legislations and protocols to maintain the efficiency and stability of banking systems while catering for the shift in user demand This chapter surveys the shift created by the COVID-19 pandemic from cash-based to cashless systems in cities and unveils how payment giants and information and communication technology corporations have been active in providing the underlaying foundation that would be critical in supporting the transition","output":"Chapter 8 - The Forceful Reevaluation of Cash-Based Transactions by COVID-19 and Its Opportunities to Transition to Cashless Systems in Digital Urban Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Many internal medicine residents struggle to prepare for both the ITE and board test.

We assessed the impacts of remdesivir on hospital-bed resources and budgets affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. A stochastic agent-based model was combined with epidemiological data available on the COVID-19 outbreak in France and data from two randomized control trials. Strategies involving treating with remdesivir only patients with low-flow oxygen and patients with low-flow and high-flow oxygen were examined. Treating all eligible low-flow oxygen patients during the entirety of the second wave would have decreased hospital-bed occupancy in conventional wards by 4% [2%; 7%] and intensive care unit (ICU)-bed occupancy by 9% [6%; 13%]. Extending remdesivir use to high-flow-oxygen patients would have amplified reductions in ICU-bed occupancy by up to 14% [18%; 11%]. A minimum remdesivir uptake of 20% was required to observe decreases in bed occupancy. Dexamethasone had effects of similar amplitude. Depending on the treatment strategy, using remdesivir would, in most cases, generate savings (up to 722) or at least be cost neutral (an extra cost of 34). Treating eligible patients could significantly limit the saturation of hospital capacities, particularly in ICUs.

However, to date, the trend of hospitalizations in the oncology patient population has not been studied, and the frequency of nosocomial spread to patients with cancer is not well understood. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on inpatient oncology census and determine the nosocomial rate of COVID-19 in patients with cancer admitted at a large academic center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of patients with cancer diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted were reviewed to evaluate the temporal trends in inpatient oncology census during pre-COVID-19 (January 2019 to February 2020), COVID-19 (March to May 2020), and post-COVID-19 surge (June to August 2020) in the region. In addition, nosocomial infection rates of SARS-CoV-2 were reviewed. RESULTS: Overall, the daily inpatient census was steady in 2019 (median, 103; range, 92-118) and until February 2020 (median, 112; range, 102-114). However, there was a major decline from March to May 2020 (median, 68; range, 57-104), with 45.4% lower admissions during April 2020. As the COVID-19 surge eased, the daily inpatient census over time returned to the pre-COVID-19 baseline (median, 103; range, 99-111). One patient (1/231, 0.004%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 13 days after hospitalization, and it is unclear if it was nosocomial or community spread. CONCLUSION: In this study, inpatient oncology admissions decreased substantially during the COVID-19 surge but over time returned to the pre-COVID-19 baseline. With aggressive infection control measures, the rates of nosocomial transmission were exceedingly low and should provide reassurance to those seeking medical care, including inpatient admissions when medically necessary. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the health care system, and cancer patients are a vulnerable population. This study observes a significant decline in the daily inpatient oncology census from March to May 2020 compared with the same time frame in the previous year and examines the potential reasons for this decline. In addition, nosocomial rates of COVID-19 were investigated, and rates were found to be very low. These findings suggest that aggressive infection control measures can mitigate the nosocomial infection risk among cancer patients and the inpatient setting is a safe environment, providing reassurance.","output":"Temporal Trends in Inpatient Oncology Census Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Rates of Nosocomial COVID-19 Among Patients with Cancer at a Large Academic Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The incidence and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among HIV-positive persons receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) have not been characterized in large populations.

Available defluoridation techniques can be costly, present complicated technical aspects, and show limited effectiveness. Therefore, it is necessary to devise innovative, sustainable, and effective solutions. This study proposes an alternative method of intervention to the known techniques for removing fluoride from water, particularly suitable for smaller rural communities. In particular, in this work, the possibility to use electromagnetic fields as a physical method for removing the excess fluoride was investigated. The study was carried out by developing a multiphysics model used for studying and envisaging the design of a device. In this framework, the combination of this approach with the use of highly reactive smectite clay was numerically studied. The results obtained, although preliminary, indicate that the proposed system could significantly impoverish the waters of the Rift Valley from fluoride, with the consequence of obtaining a resource suitable for human consumption, in particular for rural communities. However, further theoretical investigations and experimental phases will be necessary to achieve the desired results.","output":"Evaluation of a Smectite Adsorption-Based Electrostatic System to Decontaminate F?

Those symptoms can be the first manifestation of COVID-19, but whether they reflect a better or worse prognosis, is controversial. The potential relation of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor in the digestive tract as an entry route for the virus is discussed. CONCLUSION: Gastrointestinal symptoms may be common in COVID-19, in some cases appearing as the first manifestation, even before fever and respiratory symptoms.

Molecular simulation is a powerful tool used extensively to study the self-assembly of ordered phases from disordered fluid phases of atoms, molecules, or nanoparticles. However, it is not yet possible to predict colloidal crystal structures a priori from particle shape as we can for atomic crystals from electronic valency. Here, we present such a first-principles theory. By calculating and minimizing excluded volume within the framework of statistical mechanics, we describe the directional entropic forces that collectively emerge between hard shapes, in familiar terms used to describe chemical bonds. We validate our theory by demonstrating that it predicts thermodynamically preferred structures for four families of hard polyhedra that match, in every instance, previous simulation results. The success of this first-principles approach to entropic colloidal crystal structure prediction furthers fundamental understanding of both entropically driven crystallization and conceptual pictures of bonding in matter.","output":"A theory of entropic bonding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Alongside the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with several secondary health effects. There is concern for increased substance use motivated by coping with stress, anxiety, depression, and boredom-all of which may be elevated during the pandemic. The current study examined intraindividual changes (from pre-COVID to during COVID) in young adults' alcohol and marijuana use, perceptions of peers' use (i.e., norms), and motives for use. METHODS: A community sample of young adults (N = 572; Mage= 25.14; 60.8% women) was recruited in Washington State. By using a repeated-measures design, data were collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (January 2020) and again during the initial acute phase of the pandemic (April/May of 2020). RESULTS: Young adults, on average, increased alcohol use frequency but decreased the amount consumed per drinking occasion. No changes in marijuana use were identified. Young adults (on average) perceived that peers had increased the frequency and total amount of alcohol use and perceived that peers were engaging in heavier marijuana use than prior to COVID-19. For alcohol use motives, there was a significant increase in depression coping motives and significant decreases in social, enhancement, and conformity motives. Boredom motives for marijuana use significantly increased, while celebration motives decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Using a prospective design with a sample initially recruited in Washington State, these data indicate that (a) young adults' patterns of alcohol use may have changed, (b) young adults tend to think that peers are engaging in heavier alcohol/marijuana use than before the pandemic, and (c) motives for using alcohol/marijuana may have changed during the pandemic.","output":"Changes in Young Adults' Alcohol and Marijuana Use, Norms, and Motives From Before to During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the world's largest public health concern in 2021.

For the derivatives of the screening test results, data from individuals with a contact history who underwent nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing between July 2020 and April 2021 (6,156 participants, including 550 test-positive patients) were used. The value of Nt correlated with the weekly RT-PCR test-positive rate after close contact, prevalence of cough symptoms in test-positive individuals or in test-negative individuals, lower air temperature, lower air humidity, and higher wind speed. The weekly test-positive rate correlated with lower air humidity and higher wind speed. In cross-correlation analyses, natural environmental factors correlated with the regional epidemic status on a scale of months, whereas the airway symptoms among non-COVID-19 population affected on a scale of weeks. When applying an autoregression model to the serial data of Nt, large-scale movements of people were suggested to be another factor to influence the local epidemics on a scale of days.

It is the largest of all twenty amino acids in the translational toolbox. Its side chain is indole, which is aromatic with a binuclear ring structure, whereas those of Phe, Tyr, and His are single-ring aromatics. In part due to these elaborate structural features, the biosynthetic pathway of Trp is the most complex and the most energy-consuming among all amino acids. Essential in the animal diet, Trp is also the least abundant amino acid in the cell, and one of the rarest in the proteome. In most eukaryotes, Trp is the only amino acid besides Met, which is coded for by a single codon, namely UGG. Due to the large and hydrophobic -electron surface area, its aromatic side chain interacts with multiple other side chains in the protein, befitting its strategic locations in the protein structure. Finally, several Trp derivatives, namely tryptophylquinone, oxitriptan, serotonin, melatonin, and tryptophol, have specialized functions. Overall, Trp is a scarce and precious amino acid in the cell, such that nature uses it parsimoniously, for multiple but selective functions.

The pooled analysis of the ultracongruent insert and the standard cruciate retaining insert was based on a cohort of 2860 and 7129 TKA, respectively. Knee pain was significantly better in patients that had standard inserts (p = 0.02; 95% CI - 1.06 to - 0.10), and the physical component of health-related quality of life was also significantly better in patients that had standard inserts (p = 0.02; 95% CI - 6.43 to - 0.64).

Following reports that mechanical ventilation contributes to pulmonary growth arrest and the development of chronic lung disease, there is a renewed interest in using CPAP as the prevailing method for supporting newborn infants. Animal and human research has shown that CPAP is less injurious to the lungs than is mechanical ventilation. The major concepts that embrace lung protection during CPAP are the application of spontaneous breathing at a constant distending pressure and avoidance of intubation and positive-pressure inflations. A major topic for current research focuses on whether premature infants should be supported initially with CPAP following delivery, or after the infant has been extubated following prophylactic surfactant administration. Clinical trials have shown that CPAP reduces the need for intubation/mechanical ventilation and surfactant administration, but it is still unclear whether CPAP reduces chronic lung disease and mortality, compared to modern lung-protective ventilation techniques. Despite the successes, little is known about how best to manage patients using CPAP. It is also unclear whether different strategies or devices used to maintain CPAP play a role in improving outcomes in infants. Nasal CPAP technology has evolved over the last 10 years, and bench and clinical research has evaluated differences in physiologic effects related to these new devices.

However, rare studies have examined the psychological distress and protective behaviors across different populations. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess psychological distress, protective behaviors, and potential predictors of psychological distress and protective behaviors across the Hong Kong general population, Taiwan healthcare workers, and Taiwan outpatients. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used to recruit participants from Hong Kong and Taiwan. Telephone interviews were carried out for Hong Kong participants (n = 1,067; 30.2% male participants); online surveys were used for Taiwan healthcare workers (n = 500; 8.0% male participants) and Taiwan outpatients (n = 192; 32.8% male participants). All the participants completed questions on psychological distress and protective behaviors. Multiple linear regressions and multivariable logistic regressions were employed to explore the potential predictors of psychological distress and protective behaviors, respectively. RESULTS: Hong Kong participants had significantly lower levels of psychological distress than Taiwan participants [mean (SD) = 0.16 (0.39) vs. 0.47 (0.59) in healthcare workers and 0.46 (0.65) in outpatients; p < 0.001]. Hong Kong participants (51.7%) and Taiwan outpatients had more people showing fear of COVID-19 (52.0%) than Taiwan healthcare providers (40.8%; p < 0.001). Moreover, Hong Kong participants engaged the most in protective behaviors, followed by Taiwan healthcare providers and Taiwan outpatients (p < 0.001). Moreover, being a female, fear of COVID-19 and worry about personal savings were associated with protective behaviors in general. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the greater COVID-19 severity and fear of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, the general population in Hong Kong experienced less psychosocial distress with higher compliance to protective behaviors than the other groups in Taiwan.","output":"Psychological Distress and Protective Behaviors During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Different Populations: Hong Kong General Population, Taiwan Healthcare Workers, and Taiwan Outpatients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 54-year-old man with a long history of severe haemophilia A treated prophylactically with efmoroctocog alpha (3,000 IU twice weekly) was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection.

We included individuals that were vaccinated recently (<3 months), distantly (6-12 months), or recently boosted, and accounted for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remarkably, neutralization of Omicron was undetectable in most vaccinated individuals. However, individuals boosted with mRNA vaccines exhibited potent neutralization of Omicron only 4-6-fold lower than wild type, suggesting that boosters enhance the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibody responses. In addition, we find Omicron pseudovirus is more infectious than any other variant tested.

The Clinical utilisation of respiratory elastance (CURE) trial is a two-arm, randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating the performance of PEEP selected at an objective, model-based minimal respiratory system elastance in patients with ARDS. METHODS AND DESIGN: The CURE RCT compares two groups of patients requiring invasive MV with a partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio  200; one criterion of the Berlin consensus definition of moderate ( 200) or severe ( 100) ARDS. All patients are ventilated using pressure controlled (bi-level) ventilation with tidal volume = 6C8 ml/kg. Patients randomised to the control group will have PEEP selected per standard practice (SPV). Patients randomised to the intervention will have PEEP selected based on a minimal elastance using a model-based computerised method. The CURE RCT is a single-centre trial in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Christchurch hospital, New Zealand, with a target sample size of 320 patients over a maximum of 3 years. The primary outcome is the area under the curve (AUC) ratio of arterial blood oxygenation to the fraction of inspired oxygen over time. Secondary outcomes include length of time of MV, ventilator-free days (VFD) up to 28 days, ICU and hospital length of stay, AUC of oxygen saturation (SpO(2))/FiO(2) during MV, number of desaturation events (SpO(2) < 88%), changes in respiratory mechanics and chest x-ray index scores, rescue therapies (prone positioning, nitric oxide use, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) and hospital and 90-day mortality. DISCUSSION: The CURE RCT is the first trial comparing significant clinical outcomes in patients with ARDS in whom PEEP is selected at minimum elastance using an objective model-based method able to quantify and consider both inter-patient and intra-patient variability. CURE aims to demonstrate the hypothesized benefit of patient-specific PEEP and attest to the significance of real-time monitoring and decision-support for MV in the critical care environment.

We searched three databases, PubMed, EMBASE and EMCARE to identify studies reporting symptoms of COVID-19. All articles published between December 2019 and May 2020 was included in this meta-analysis. A total of 56 studies consisted of 7310 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Mean age of patients varied from 22 to 69.8 years. The pooled proportion of male patients was 52%. Highest incidence of fever (76%) and cough (56%) was noted in Chinese population. Sore throat (29%) was most common in Asian population. Upper respiratory tract symptom like Rhinorrhoea, Anosmia and dysgeusia (32%, 47% and 39%) were well documented in European population as compared to the other continents.

Sub-10 nm particles are of additional interest due to their health effects and contribution to particle growth processes. Ambient measurements were carried out at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC between April to June 2019 and November 2019 to May 2020 to investigate the temporal variability of size distribution and number concentration of ultrafine particles. A mobile lab was deployed between March and May 2020 to characterize the spatial distribution of sub-10 nm particle number concentration. New particle formation and growth events were observed regularly. Also observed were direct emissions of sub-10 nm particles. Analysis against meteorological variables, gas-phase species, and particle concentrations show that the sub-10nm particles dominated number concentration during periods of low planetary boundary layer height, low solar radiation, and northeast winds. The spatial patterns observed during mobile deployments suggest that multiple temporally stable and spatially confined point sources of sub-10 nm particles are present within the city. These sources likely include the campus utility plants and the Raleigh-Durham International Airport.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: From the start of the first epidemic wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Bergamo, Italy, we have prospectively screened all consecutive outpatients who presented for treatment to the Oncology Division of the Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo for SARS-CoV-2 antigen expression. We identified patients treated with ICIs and compared these to patients with the same cancer subtypes treated with TTs or CT. RESULTS: Between March 5 and May 18, 293 consecutive patients (49% melanoma, 34% non-small cell lung cancer, 9% renal cell carcinoma, 8% other) were included in this study: 159 (54%), 50 (17%) and 84 (29%) received ICIs, CT or TTs, respectively. Overall 89 patients (30.0%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive. Mortality of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients was statistically significantly higher compared with SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (8/89 vs 3/204, respectively, Fisher's exact test p=0.004). All deaths were due to COVID-19. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were more frequent in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative cases (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test p=0.0008). The incidence of SAEs in SARS-CoV-2 positive compared with SARS-CoV-2 negative patients was similar in ICI and CT patients (17.3% and 3.7% for positive and negative patients in ICIs and 15.4% and 2.7% in CT, Breslow-Day test p=0.891). No COVID-19-related SAEs were observed in the TTs patients. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SAEs was higher for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients treated with ICIs and CT, mostly in advanced disease. No SAEs were observed in patients treated with TTs. SAEs were COVID-19 related rather than treatment related. Treatment with ICIs does not appear to significantly increase risk of SAEs compared with CT.

User experience partly overlaps with the acceptability field and may provide insight into factors affecting adherence and adoption of E-Health programs. This study aimed to explore early acceptability and user experience of a companion app prototype for adolescents with AN using user-centered design methods. METHODS: We developed a prototype containing self-help material and emotions and behaviors evaluation and management features. Then we conducted a mixed evaluation combining semi structured focus group interviews and questionnaires in a clinician group and an AN patient group. We analyzed data using thematic analysis and descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The apps overall appeal was adequate. The user experience questionnaire revealed the weakest dimensions, including novelty, dependability, and efficiency versus stimulation (i.e., ability to induce motivation to use the product) and perspicuity (i.e., easy to understand, to get familiar with). The qualitative data analysis revealed three central axes: acceptability, features, and use.

To account for the endogeneity of many of these variables, and the possibility of correlated latent (unobservable) country characteristics, I estimate a four structural model of the evolution of case growth rates, death growth rates, average changes in mobility and the determination of the severity of NPIs. There are strongly decreasing returns to the stringency of NPIs, especially for extreme lockdowns, as no significant improvement in the main outcome measures is found beyond NPIs corresponding to a Stringency Index range of 51-60 for cases and 41-50 for deaths. A non-restrictive policy of extensive and open testing has half of the impact on pandemic dynamics as the optimal NPIs, with none of the associated social and economic costs resulting from the latter. Decreases in mobility were found to increase, rather than decrease case growth rates, consistent with arguments that within-household transmission, resulting from spending more time at residences due to mobility restrictions, may outweigh the benefits of reduced community transmission. Vaccinations led to a fall in case and death growth rates, however the effect size must be re-evaluated when more data becomes available. Governments conditioned policy choice on recent pandemic dynamics, and were found to de-escalate the associated stringency of implemented NPIs more cautiously than in their escalation, i.e., policy mixes exhibited significant hysteresis. Finally, at least 90% of the maximum effectiveness of NPIs can be achieved by policies with an average Stringency index of 31-40, without restricting internal movement or imposing stay at home measures, and only recommending (not enforcing) closures on workplaces and schools, accompanied by public informational campaigns. Consequently, the positive effects on case and death growth rates of voluntary behavioral changes in response to beliefs about the severity of the pandemic, generally trumped those arising from mandatory behavioral restrictions. The exception being more stringent mandatory restrictions on gatherings and international movement, which were found to be effective.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all patients with middle cerebral artery bifurcation unruptured wide-necked aneurysms treated using an LVIS device at our institution between October 2014 and December 2018. Clinical presentation, aneurysmal characteristics, technical feasibility, perioperative complications, clinical outcome, and angiographic and clinical follow-up results were evaluated. RESULTS Fifty-seven patients with 57 wide-necked aneurysms arising from the middle cerebral artery bifurcation were identified. The technical success rate of stent deployment was 100%. Immediate postoperative angiograms showed Raymond 1 in 26 aneurysms (45.6%), Raymond 2 in 10 (17.6%), and Raymond 3 in 21 (36.8%). Perioperative complications developed in two patients (3.5%), including one procedure-related hemorrhagic event and one thromboembolic event. The follow-up angiogram was available for 47 aneurysms obtained at an average of 11.7 months (range, 5 to 49 months) after intervention; the latest follow-up angiograms revealed complete occlusion in 37 (78.7%) aneurysms, improvement in three (6.4%), stabilization in five (10.6%), and recanalization in two (4.3%). During the follow-up, one patient was found to have in-stent stenosis and two patients were found to have slow flow or occlusion of the jailed branch. All three of these patients were asymptomatic. No hemorrhagic or thromboembolic events occurred during clinical follow-up.

Most staff found the academic level of the learning material and quiz appropriate (85% and 93% of all staff members, respectively), as well as agreeing that the module was relevant to prepare them to use the NIRS device (90%). Thematic analysis revealed issues such as a discrepancy between learning material and quiz questions, lack of clarity, and technical issues. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence of the feasibility of developing a multilingual web-based training program for an international trial, despite challenges such as low budget, language barriers and possibly differences in the clinical training of staff. Exploring the integration of training and certification for international trials, the positive results of this study motivate further developments. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT03770741.

It is unclear how much of the ischaemic damage is mediated by direct or inflammatory effects of virus on the CNS vasculature and how much is secondary to extracranial cardiorespiratory disease. Limited data suggest that the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus may enter the CNS via the nasal mucosa and olfactory fibres, or by haematogenous spread, and is capable of infecting endothelial cells, pericytes and probably neurons. Extracranially, SARS-CoV-2 targets endothelial cells and pericytes, causing endothelial cell dysfunction, vascular leakage and immune activation, sometimes leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation. It remains to be confirmed whether endothelial cells and pericytes in the cerebral vasculature are similarly targeted. Several aspects of COVID-19 are likely to impact on cognition. Cerebral white matter is particularly vulnerable to ischaemic damage in COVID-19 and is also critically important for cognitive function. There is accumulating evidence that cerebral hypoperfusion accelerates amyloid-? (A?) accumulation and is linked to tau and TDP-43 pathology, and by inducing phosphorylation of &#945;-synuclein at serine-129, ischaemia may also increase the risk of development of Lewy body disease. Current therapies for COVID-19 are understandably focused on supporting respiratory function, preventing thrombosis and reducing immune activation. Since angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are predicted to increase ACE-2 expression, it was initially feared that their use might exacerbate COVID-19. Recent meta-analyses have instead suggested that these medications are protective. This is perhaps because SARS-CoV-2 entry may deplete ACE-2, tipping the balance towards angiotensin II-ACE-1-mediated classical RAS activation: exacerbating hypoperfusion and promoting inflammation. It may be relevant that APOE ?4 individuals, who seem to be at increased risk of COVID-19, also have lowest ACE-2 activity.

Conditions and structures of caring for people with dementia differ widely, depending on the country and the care context. Our study aimed to describe the experiences and opinions of nursing experts and managers with regard to facilitators and barriers to the implementation of nurse-led interventions in long-term dementia care. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using individual interviews based on qualitative vignettes as a useful stimulus to generate narrations allowing to study peoples perceptions and beliefs. The study took place in nursing homes in the German-speaking part of Switzerland and in the Principality of Liechtenstein using purposive sampling. We intended to conduct the interviews face-to-face in a quiet room according to the participants choice. However, due to the lockdown of nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020, we performed interviews face-to-face and by video. We analysed data thematically following Braun and Clarke to achieve a detailed, nuanced description. To verify our interpretation and to ensure congruence with participants perspectives, we conducted member checks. The Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) served to structure our manuscript. RESULTS: Six dyads of nursing home managers and nursing experts from six nursing homes took part in our study (n = 12). Our thematic analysis yielded seven themes reflecting facilitators and barriers to implementing nurse-led interventions in long-term dementia care: ?A common attitude and cohesion within the organization?, ?Commitment on several levels?, ?A needs-oriented implementation?, ?The effect and the public perception of the intervention?, ?A structured and guided implementation process?, ?Supporting knowledge and competencies?, as well as ?Resources for implementing the intervention?. CONCLUSIONS: To support the implementation of nurse-led interventions in long-term dementia care, active commitment-building seems essential. It is necessary that the value of the intervention is perceptible.Commitment-building is the precondition to reach the persons involved, such as nursing home managers, nursing staff, residents and relatives. Furthermore, nurses should precisely inform about the intervention. It is necessary that the value of the intervention is perceptible. In addition, nurses should adjust the interventions to the situational needs of people with dementia, thus. Therefore, it is important to support dementia-specific competencies in long-term care.

Consequently, visuality and social media platforms like Twitter have come to play a vital role in disseminating prevention messages widely. Yet to date, only little is known about what characterizes visual risk communication during the Covid-19 pandemic. To address this gap in the literature, this studys objective was to determine how visual risk communication was used on Twitter to promote the World Health Organisations (WHO) recommended preventative behaviours and how this communication changed over time. METHODS: We sourced Twitters 500 most retweeted Covid-19 messages for each month from JanuaryCOctober 2020 using Crowdbreaks. For inclusion, tweets had to have visuals, be in English, come from verified accounts, and contain one of the keywords covid19, coronavirus, corona, or covid. Following a retrospective approach, we then performed a qualitative content analysis of the 616 tweets meeting inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Our results show communication dynamics changed over the course of the pandemic. At the start, most retweeted preventative messages came from the media and health and government institutions, but overall, personal accounts with many followers (51.3%) predominated, and their tweets had the highest spread (10.0%, i.e., retweet count divided by followers). Messages used mostly photographs and images were found to be rich with information. 78.1% of Tweets contained 1C2 preventative messages, whereby stay home and wear a mask frequented most. Although more tweets used health loss framing, health gain messages spread more. CONCLUSION: Our findings can inform the didactics of future crisis communication. The results underscore the value of engaging individuals, particularly influencers, as advocates to spread health risk messages and promote solidarity. Further, our findings on the visual characteristic of the most retweeted tweets highlight factors that health and government organisations should consider when creating visual health messages for Twitter. However, that more tweets used the emotive medium of photographs often combined with health loss framing raises concerns about persuasive tactics.

Studies included were English-language, peer-reviewed, observational studies of adults hospitalised for COVID-19 with reported clinical course and living with or without diabetes. The severity of clinical course was assessed using a composite outcome (mortality, admittance to ICU, requirement for IMV, clinically defined severe or critical disease). Data and adjusted measures of association were extracted from published reports, and meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model. Registered with OSF (https://osf.io/agsyb/).Findings: A literature search yielded 431 articles, of which 45 studies (22,091 patients) met the inclusion criteria and 14 studies (12,383 patients) reported an adjusted measure of association for diabetes with the composite outcome with pooled hazard ratio 159 (95% confidence interval 1.3C1.93;I 2 =0%, p=0820) and pooled odds ratio of 215 (95% confidence interval 163C283;I 2 =0%, p=0892);evidence by GRADE was moderate.Interpretation: People living with diabetes are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 clinical course if hospitalised for COVID-19 than people not living with diabetes. To inform clinical decision-making during the pandemic, our findings support that people living with diabetes who are hospitalised for COVID-19 should be prioritised when triaged as at increased risk for the development of severe clinical course.

In non-COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome, RV dysfunction develops due to pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction, inflammation, and alveolar overdistension or atelectasis. Although similar pathogenic mechanisms may induce RV dysfunction in COVID-19, other COVID-19-specific pathology, such as pulmonary endothelialitis, thrombosis, or myocarditis, may also affect RV function. We quantified RV dysfunction by echocardiographic strain analysis and investigated its correlation with disease severity, ventilatory parameters, biomarkers, and imaging findings in critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We determined RV free wall longitudinal strain (FWLS) in 32 patients receiving mechanical ventilation for COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. Demographics, comorbid conditions, ventilatory parameters, medications, and laboratory findings were extracted from the medical record. Chest imaging was assessed to determine the severity of lung disease and the presence of pulmonary embolism. RESULTS: Abnormal FWLS was present in 66% of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients and was associated with higher lung compliance (39.6 vs 29.4 mL/cmH2O, P = 0.016), lower airway plateau pressures (21 vs 24 cmH2O, P = 0.043), lower tidal volume ventilation (5.74 vs 6.17 cc/kg, P = 0.031), and reduced left ventricular function. FWLS correlated negatively with age (r = -0.414, P = 0.018) and with serum troponin (r = 0.402, P = 0.034). Patients with abnormal RV strain did not exhibit decreased oxygenation or increased disease severity based on inflammatory markers, vasopressor requirements, or chest imaging findings. CONCLUSIONS: RV dysfunction is common among critically ill COVID-19 patients and is not related to abnormal lung mechanics or ventilatory pressures. Instead, patients with abnormal FWLS had more favorable lung compliance. RV dysfunction may be secondary to diffuse intravascular micro- and macro-thrombosis or direct myocardial damage.

In this review, we evaluated the clinical and laboratory features associated with BNT162b2 messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccine, Ad26.COV2.S and ChAdOx1 adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccines, to determine their immunogenicity. Demographic distribution of pathogenic autoimmune response and time interval between vaccination and onset of symptoms were also assessed. This was to identify; persons at risk of developing auto-immune reactions and markers to enhanced occurrence of this event. MAIN BODY: Using relevant keywords, search was conducted in the databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google scholar from November 2020 to May 31, 2021. Additional article was also identified through hand-searching of reference lists, and the review was conducted in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines 2009. Study outcome measures were presence of antibodies after vaccination and evidence of autoimmune reactions, therefore studies relating these measures were considered eligible for this review. Studies showed stimulation of immune response with administration of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2-S adenovirus vector-based vaccines. Aside SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies, elevated D-dimers, presence of PF4 and low fibrinogen were most commonly seen laboratory features in persons with autoimmune reactions following vaccination. In addition, thrombotic thrombocytopenia was the commonest clinical features observed with ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2-S adenovirus vector-based vaccines. Findings from this study also suggest higher susceptibility of women of 22C60 years to the pathogenic immunogenicity that may particular result from exposure to ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2-S adenovirus vector-based vaccines. Time interval of 4C37 days was mostly observed between vaccination and occurrence of a symptom. CONCLUSION: Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia and other PF4 dependent syndrome are likely associated with ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S adenovirus vector vaccines, mostly occurring in women usually within 4C37 days of first dose of vaccine. Enhanced knowledge about vaccine adverse effects and its distribution is crucial for effective vaccination strategies.","output":"Immunogenicity and clinical features relating to BNT162b2 messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccine, Ad26.COV2.S and ChAdOx1 adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccines: a systematic review of non-interventional studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of HSV genome transport during the initiation of infection using viruses containing bioorthogonal traceable precursors incorporated into their genomes (HSV(EdC)). In vitro assays revealed a structural alteration in the capsid induced upon HSV(EdC) binding to solid supports that allowed coupling to external capture agents and demonstrated that the vast majority of individual virions contained bioorthogonally-tagged genomes. Using HSV(EdC) in vivo we reveal novel aspects of the kinetics, localisation, mechanistic entry requirements and morphological transitions of infecting genomes. Uncoating and nuclear import was observed within 30 min, with genomes in a defined compaction state (ca. 3-fold volume increase from capsids). Free cytosolic uncoated genomes were infrequent (7C10% of the total uncoated genomes), likely a consequence of subpopulations of cells receiving high particle numbers. Uncoated nuclear genomes underwent temporal transitions in condensation state and while ICP4 efficiently associated with condensed foci of initial infecting genomes, this relationship switched away from residual longer lived condensed foci to increasingly decondensed genomes as infection progressed. Inhibition of transcription had no effect on nuclear entry but in the absence of transcription, genomes persisted as tightly condensed foci. Ongoing transcription, in the absence of protein synthesis, revealed a distinct spatial clustering of genomes, which we have termed genome congregation, not seen with non-transcribing genomes. Genomes expanded to more decondensed forms in the absence of DNA replication indicating additional transitional steps. During full progression of infection, genomes decondensed further, with a diffuse low intensity signal dissipated within replication compartments, but frequently with tight foci remaining peripherally, representing unreplicated genomes or condensed parental strands of replicated DNA. Uncoating and nuclear entry was independent of proteasome function and resistant to inhibitors of nuclear export.

The lack of internal electric fields across the non-polar structures results in an improved electron and hole wavefunction overlap with respect to the polar structures. Therefore, the radiative recombination presents shorter decay times, independent of the well width. On the contrary, the presence of electric fields in the polar structures reduces the emission energy and the wavefunction overlap, which leads to a strong decrease in the recombination rate when increasing the well width. Taking into account the different energy dependences of radiative recombination in non-polar and polar structures of the same geometry, and assuming that non-radiative processes are energy independent, we attempted to explain the 'S-shape' behavior of the PL energy observed in polar GaN/AlGaN QWs, and its absence in non-polar structures. This approach has been applied previously to InGaN/GaN structures, showing that the interplay of radiative and non-radiative recombination processes can justify the 'S-shape' in polar InGaN/GaN MQWs. Our results show that the differences in the energy dependences of radiative and non-radiative recombination processes cannot explain the 'S-shape' behavior by itself, and localization effects due to the QW width fluctuation are also important. Additionally, the influence of the electric field on the pressure behavior of the investigated structures was studied, revealing different pressure dependences of the PL energy in non-polar and polar MQWs. Non-polar MQWs generally follow the pressure dependence of the GaN bandgap. In contrast, the pressure coefficients of the PL energy in polar QWs are highly reduced with respect to those of the bulk GaN, which is due to the hydrostatic-pressure-induced increase in the piezoelectric field in quantum structures and the nonlinear behavior of the piezoelectric constant.","output":"The Role of the Built-In Electric Field in Recombination Processes of GaN/AlGaN Quantum Wells: Temperature- and Pressure-Dependent Study of Polar and Non-Polar Structures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To evaluate the possible association between Covid-19 infection and subacute thyroiditis.

In the last years, several authors have proposed sophisticated statistical approaches to forecast the ambulance dispatches, typically modelling the data as a point pattern occurring on a planar region. Nevertheless, ambulance interventions can be more appropriately modelled as a realisation of a point process occurring on a road network. The constrained spatial domain raises specific challenges and unique methodological problems that cannot be ignored when developing a proper statistical approach. Hence, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal model to analyse ambulance dispatches focusing on the interventions that occurred in the road network of Milan (Italy) from 2015 to 2017. We adopt a non-separable first-order intensity function with spatial and temporal terms. The temporal dimension is estimated semi-parametrically using a Poisson regression model, while the spatial dimension is estimated non-parametrically using a network kernel function. A set of weights is included in the spatial term to capture space-time interactions, inducing non-separability in the intensity function. A series of tests show that our approach successfully models the ambulance interventions and captures the space-time patterns more accurately than planar or separable point process models.","output":"A non-separable first-order spatio-temporal intensity for events on linear networks: an application to ambulance interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is widely used in the emergency department (ED). Not all practicing emergency physicians received POCUS training during residency, leaving a training gap that is reflected in POCUS privileging. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the success of meeting privileging criteria as well as associated factors, following implementation of a basic POCUS training and privileging program within a large emergency medicine department. Methods We implemented a POCUS training and privileging program, based on national guidelines, for faculty physicians who worked at one of the following EDs staffed by the same emergency medicine department: a pediatric tertiary site, two tertiary academic sites, and seven community sites. POCUS examinations included aorta, cardiac, first-trimester obstetrics (OB), and extended focused assessment with sonography in trauma. Pediatric emergency medicine faculty were taught soft tissue and thoracic US instead of aorta and OB. Completion of the program required 16 h of didactics, 25 quality-assured US examinations by examination type, and passing a series of knowledge-based examinations. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Associations between physician characteristics and successfully becoming privileged in POCUS were modeled using Firth's logistic regression. Results A total of 176 faculty physicians were eligible. A total of 145 (82.4%) achieved basic POCUS privileging during the study period. Different pathways were used including 86 (48.9%) practice-based, nine (5.1%) fellowship-based, and 82 (46.9%) residency-based. POCUS privileging was lower for those working in a community versus academic setting (odds ratio 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.1-0.9). A greater number of scans completed prior to the privileging program was associated with greater success. Conclusions Implementation of a POCUS training and privileging program can be successful in a large emergency medicine department that staffs hospitals in a large-scale health care system composed of both academic and community sites.

In addition, tracheal compression by thyroid nodules can aggravate hypoxia in critically ill patients. No studies have investigated the effect of thyroid nodules on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. In this study, we investigated the effect of thyroid hormonal disorders and thyroid nodules on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at the Sirnak State Hospital (Pandemic hospital in Turkey) between 15 March and 15 August 2020. We evaluated thyroid hormonal disorder and thyroid nodules in 125 patients who were admitted to the non-intensive care unit (non-ICU) due to mild COVID-19 pneumonia (group 1) and 125 critically ill patients who were admitted to the ICU (group 2). RESULTS: Thyroid-stimulating hormone levels (TSH) were not significantly different between groups 1 and 2; however, group 2 patients had significantly lower levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) as compared to group 1 (P = .005, P < .0001, respectively). FT3 level showed a negative correlation with length of hospital stay and C-reactive protein level (rho: -0.216, p: 0.001; rho: -0.383, P < .0001). Overt thyroid disorder was observed in 13 patients [2 patients in group 1 (both with overt thyrotoxicosis) and 11 patients in group 2 (3 overt hypothyroidism, 8 overt thyrotoxicosis) (P = .01)].

METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) who were hospitalized in Hainan Provincial People's Hospital from January 15, 2020 to February 18, 2020. Compare the clinical characteristics of elderly with Young and Middle-aged patients. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were enrolled 18 elderly patients (32.14%), and 38 young and middle-aged patients (67.86%). The most common symptoms in both groups were fever, followed by cough and sputum. Four patients in the elderly group received negative pressure ICU for mechanical ventilation, and five patients in the young and middle-aged group. One patient died in the elderly group (5.56%), and two patients died in the young and middle-aged group (5.26%). The PSI score of the elderly group was higher than that of the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001). The proportion of patients with PSI grades IV and V was significantly higher in the elderly group than in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.05). The proportion of multiple lobe involvement in the elderly group was higher than that in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001), and there was no difference in single lobe lesions between the two groups. The proportion of lymphocytes in the elderly group was significantly lower than that in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001), and the C-reactive protein was significantly higher in the young group (P < 0.001).

Examine virtual palliative care utilization patterns in the inpatient and outpatient setting as well as the adoption of telephonic or video-based platforms 3. Recognize palliative care clinician perspectives and willingness to adopt virtual visits across the care continuum Background The number of Americans who are living with serious illness without adequate access to palliative care services is growing. Virtual palliative care offers an inclusive solution that enhances the patients quality of life and addresses complex patient centric needs. Aim Statement This project was developed during the COVID-19 pandemic to investigate telehealth utilization and engagement as well as clinician perceptions and experiences using the virtual platform. Methods We evaluated the use of telephone and video visits in 7 states from May 2020 to April 2021. Of the 84 palliative care clinicians (physicians and APPs) practicing in those states, 35 clinicians (42%) conducted virtual visits. A total of 1,816 virtual visits were completed based on claims analysis. We conducted a clinician experience survey that was completed via Google forms by 15 physicians (44% response rate), which provided qualitative feedback. Results Of the 1,816 visits completed, 332 were telephonic and 1,484 video. 30% of the visits were from the inpatient setting, 19% nursing facility, and 51% outpatient. Top diagnoses were respiratory failure, neuro/Parkinson's, dementia, CHF, and cancer. 37% of the patients lived in disadvantaged zip codes. 93% of the clinicians who responded to the survey were open to having a video visit with their patients with reported benefits such as improved access to care, more efficient use of time, and enhanced clinician-patient relationship. The barriers reported by clinicians included patients having limited availability to a device with a camera and inadequate internet bandwidth. Conclusions and Implications Clinicians find virtual palliative care to be beneficial to patients for goals-of-care conversations, frequent symptom assessment, and engaging multiple family members. Despite a perception that video visits have low adoption in older populations, more than 68% of the virtual visits were with patients 65 years+.

However, how GEF-H1 activates Rho upon microtubule disassembly remains elusive. Here, we found that BNIP-2, a BCH domain-containing protein that binds both RhoA and GEF-H1 and traffics with kinesin-1 on microtubules, is important for GEF-H1-driven RhoA activation upon microtubule disassembly. Depletion of BNIP-2 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells decreases RhoA activity and promotes cell migration. Upon nocodazole-induced microtubule disassembly, the interaction between BNIP-2 and GEF-H1 increases, while knockdown of BNIP-2 reduces RhoA activation and cell rounding via uncoupling RhoA-GEF-H1 interaction. Together, these findings revealed that BNIP-2 couples microtubules and focal adhesions via scaffolding GEF-H1 and RhoA, fine-tuning RhoA activity and cell migration.","output":"BNIP-2 retards breast cancer cell migration by coupling microtubule-mediated GEF-H1 and RhoA activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the lives of people globally and is expected to have profound effects on mental health.

This recently identified virus is highly contagious. Controlling the rapid spread of this infection requires early detection of infected people through comprehensive screening. For COVID-19 viral diagnosis and follow-up, chest radiography imaging is an excellent tool. Deep learning (DL) has been used for a variety of healthcare purposes, including diabetic retinopathy detection, image classification, and thyroid diagnosis. DL is a useful strategy for combating the COVID-19 outbreak because there are so many streams of medical images (e.g., X-rays, CT, and MRI). In this study, we used the benchmark chest X-ray scan (CXRS) dataset for both COVID-19-infected and noninfected patients. We evaluate the results of DL-based convolutional neural network (CNN) models after preprocessing the scans and using data augmentation. Transfer learning (TL) is used to improve the algorithm's classification performance for chest radiography imaging. Finally, features of the attention and feature interweave modules are combined to create a more accurate feature map. The architecture is trained for COVID-19 CXRS using CNN, and the newly generated feature layer is applied to TL architecture.

Lung segmentation from chest X-ray (CXR) is a promising method for early diagnoses of pulmonary diseases. Recently, deep learning has achieved great success in supervised lung segmentation. However, how to effectively utilize the lung region in screening COVID-19 still remains a challenge due to domain shift and lack of manual pixel-level annotations. We hereby propose a multi-appearance COVID-19 screening framework by using lung region priors derived from CXR images. Firstly, we propose a multi-scale adversarial domain adaptation network (MS-AdaNet) to boost the cross-domain lung segmentation task as the prior knowledge to the classification network. Then, we construct a multi-appearance network (MA-Net), which is composed of three sub-networks to realize multi-appearance feature extraction and fusion using lung region priors. At last, we can obtain prediction results from normal, viral pneumonia, and COVID-19 using the proposed MA-Net. We extend the proposed MS-AdaNet for lung segmentation task on three different public CXR datasets. The results suggest that the MS-AdaNet outperforms contrastive methods in cross-domain lung segmentation. Moreover, experiments reveal that the proposed MA-Net achieves accuracy of 98.83 [Formula: see text] and F1-score of 98.71 [Formula: see text] on COVID-19 screening. The results indicate that the proposed MA-Net can obtain significant performance on COVID-19 screening.","output":"COVID-19 Screening in Chest X-Ray Images Using Lung Region Priors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To reveal the impact of campus epidemic prevention and control policy on undergraduate students' well-being, time use survey of D University before and during COVID-19 were investigated.

METHODS In this study, 104 patients with gastrointestinal system and/or fever complaints who had traveled abroad during the pandemic period and returned to Turkey were included. Parasitic agents were investigated by taking blood and stool samples from the patients. Additionally, urine samples were obtained from patients with hematuria or dysuria with the suspicion of schistosomiasis. A direct microscopic examination, the Crypto-Giardia immunochromatographic test, and ELISA methods were used in the examination of the stool samples. In order to detect Plasmodium species, blood samples were examined by preparing both the rapid diagnostic test and thick drop and thin smear preparations. RESULTS One or more parasite species were detected in 38 (38.5%) of 104 patients included in the study. While intestinal parasites were detected in 16 (32%) of 50 patients who traveled to Iran and 16 (33.3%) of 48 patients who traveled to Northern Iraq, blood parasites were not found. Schistosoma mansoni was detected in all 5 of the patients with a history of traveling to Sudan. Plasmodium falciparum was detected in 1 patient who traveled to the African continent. CONCLUSION It is vital to take precautions to prevent parasitic diseases, such as malaria and schistosomiasis, during travels to African countries. During travels to neighboring countries of Turkey, such as Northern Iraq and Iran, hygiene should be paid attention to, so as to prevent contracting intestinal parasitic diseases. In addition, it was concluded that people who plan to travel abroad should have information about the endemic parasitic diseases of the country that they are going to.","output":"Investigation of Intestinal and Blood Parasites in People Returning to Turkey with a History of Traveling Abroad During the Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic challenges safe and equitable voting in the United States' 2020 elections, and in response, several states including Rhode Island (RI) have made significant changes to election policy In addition to increasing accessibility of mail-in voting by mailing applications to all registered voters, RI has suspended their notary/witness requirement for both the primary and general election However, RI's \\"emergency\\" voting process still plays a crucial role in allowing voters who missed the mail-in ballot application deadline, such as those unexpectedly hospitalized in the days leading up to the election, to still cast their ballot COVID-19 has also forced RI to modify its emergency voting procedures, most notably allowing healthcare workers to serve on bipartisan ballot delivery teams This commentary highlights these salient updates to voting procedures and serves as a primer as to how interested health care workers may navigate this process alongside patients and lead in the arena of patient voting rights","output":"Emergency Mail-in Voting in Rhode Island: Protecting Civic Participation During COVID-19 and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Little is known regarding why a subset of COVID-19 patients exhibited prolonged positivity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Our findings indicate that among the self-employed, who generally face a higher likelihood of income losses due to COVID-19 than employees, women are about one-third more likely to experience income losses than their male counterparts. We do not find a comparable gender gap among employees. Our results further suggest that the gender gap among the self-employed is largely explained by the fact that women disproportionately work in industries that are more severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis of potential mechanisms reveals that women are significantly more likely to be impacted by government-imposed restrictions, e.g., the regulation of opening hours.

Based on comprehensive vaccination data from the German federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate for calendar week 1C20 in the year 2021, we calculated sex- and age-specific vaccination coverage. Furthermore, we calculated the proportion of weekly COVID-19 fatalities and reported SARS-CoV-2 infections formed by each age group. Vaccination coverage in the age group 80 + years increased to a level of 80% (men) and 75% (women). Increasing vaccination coverage coincided with a reduction in the age groups proportion of COVID-19 fatalities. In multivariable logistic regression, vaccination coverage was associated both with a reduction in an age-groups proportion of COVID-19 fatalities [odds ratio (OR) per 5 percentage points = 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.82C0.96, p = 0.0013] and of reported SARS-CoV-2 infections (OR per 5 percentage points = 0.82, 95% CI 0.76C0.88, p < 0.0001).

The costs and benefits of such movements depend, in part, on the dispersing individuals phenotypes, including their sex and age. Here we investigated dispersal and road-related mortality in larvae of a bioluminescent beetle, the European common glow-worm, Lampyris noctiluca, in relation to habitat, sex and proximity of pupation. We expected these variables to be relevant to larval dispersal because adult females are wingless, whereas adult males fly when searching for glowing females. We found that dispersing glow-worm larvae were almost exclusively females and close to pupation. The larvae were often found on a road, where they were able to move at relatively high speeds, with a tendency to uphill orientation. However, each passing vehicle caused a high mortality risk, and we found large numbers of larvae run over by cars, especially close to covered, forest-like habitat patches. In contrast, adult females in the same area were most often found glowing in more open rocky and grassy habitats. These findings demonstrate an underappreciated ecological strategy, sex-biased dispersal at larval phase, motivated by different habitat needs of larvae and wingless adult females. The results are also consistent with roads being an ecological trap, facilitating dispersal and presumably females signal visibility but causing severe larval mortality just before the reproductive stage. Hence, in addition to the previously recognised threats of urbanisation, even low traffic volumes have a high potential to negatively affect especially females of this iconic beetle. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Animals sometimes need to move from one habitat to another to find mating partners or breeding sites. We found this need to result in strongly female-biased larval dispersal in the European common glow-worm, a beetle known for the glow of wingless females that attract flying males to mate. Female larvae moving between habitats often used a road or trail but perished in high numbers when run over by cars. Hence, roads are likely to be ecological traps for the female glow-worm larvae, attracting them during dispersal, but causing grave mortality. The sex-biased larval dispersal, demonstrated in this study, is a poorly known ecological strategy that was found to be very risky in a human-modified landscape.

METHODS Thirty persons with incomplete SCI, all community walkers (25 males and 5 females, 18-69 years old) were recruited to a clinical trial of a 12 weeks home-based aerobic exercise program of either high or moderate intensity. During the last week of inpatient rehabilitation (baseline), participants performed a maximal exercise test on a treadmill (peak oxygen uptake; peak VO2) and a 6-min walking test (6MWT). Also, total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) and daily amount of steps were measured continuously during 7 days in the participants' homes. All tests were repeated after 3 and 12 months (post tests). RESULTS Twenty of the 30 clinical trial participants performed baseline and both posttests and are included in this secondary analysis. We found no statistically significant between-group differences in the time course over the first year of either peak VO2, 6MWT, or physical activity outcomes. Therefore, data from both exercise groups and the control group were merged for secondary analyses, revealing statistically significant increase over time in peak VO2, 6MWT, and TDEE. The increase over time in the average daily steps did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS Ambulatory persons with SCI were able to increase their CRF levels over the first year after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation, despite a minimal increase in activity levels.","output":"Changes in cardiorespiratory fitness and activity levels over the first year after discharge in ambulatory persons with recent incomplete spinal cord injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Radiology departments have been directly involved from the beginning of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emergency to provide imaging lung assessment of suspected and positive patients while ensuring the execution of other routine and emergency examinations for non-COVID-19 patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We introduce a novel risk-stratified SIR-HCD model that introduces new variables to model the dynamics of low-contact (e.g., work from home) and high-contact (e.g., work on-site) subpopulations while sharing parameters to control their respective R0(t) over time. We test our model on data of daily reported hospitalizations and cumulative mortality of COVID-19 in Harris County, Texas, from May 1, 2020, until October 4, 2020, collected from multiple sources (USA FACTS, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Southeast Texas Regional Advisory Council COVID-19 report, TMC daily news, and Johns Hopkins University county-level mortality reporting). RESULTS: We evaluated our model's forecasting accuracy in Harris County, TX (the most populated county in the Greater Houston area) during Phase-I and Phase-II reopening. Not only does our model outperform other competing models, but it also supports counterfactual analysis to simulate the impact of future policies in a local setting, which is unique among existing approaches. DISCUSSION: Mortality and hospitalization rates are significantly impacted by local quarantine and reopening policies. Existing models do not directly account for the effect of these policies on infection, hospitalization, and death rates in an explicit and explainable manner. Our work is an attempt to improve prediction of these trends by incorporating this information into the model, thus supporting decision-making. CONCLUSION: Our work is a timely effort to attempt to model the dynamics of pandemics under the influence of local policies.","output":"Population stratification enables modeling effects of reopening policies on mortality and hospitalization rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the relations between underlying dimensions of burnout (i.e. exhaustion, mental distance, cognitive impairment and emotional impairment) and sleep reactivity in occupations that have critical tasks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sleep reactivity refers to the vulnerability of experiencing sleep disturbances during challenging conditions, and manifests as difficulties with falling and staying asleep. Previous research has highlighted the importance investigating psychological factors that may influence or trigger vulnerability to stress induced sleep problems, including factors at work. METHODS: Longitudinal self-report data was collected using an online survey administered to Norwegian workers employed in health care, education, social services, emergency services and other sectors with critical tasks during the COVID-19 pandemic at two different time points three months apart. The sample in the present study (N = 1331) consisted of 76% females and 24% males with a mean age of 44 years. RESULTS: The results showed that work-related exhaustion measured at baseline was the strongest symptom of burnout associated with higher sleep reactivity three months later, followed by emotional impairment. Mental distance and cognitive impairment at work was not associated with sleep reactivity, indicating that these burnout dimensions have less of an impact on sleep than exhaustion and emotional impairment. CONCLUSION: Work-related exhaustion and emotional impairment can lower the individuals tolerance to perceiving events as stressful as well as reinforce the stress response, and contribute to difficulties with initiating and/or maintaining sleep. Workers employed in occupations with critical tasks during the pandemic may be more susceptible to exhaustion, emotional strain and poorer sleep due to increased and prolonged work pressure during the pandemic. Organizational and individual measures that can decrease stress and increase coping should be offered to employees working in high-stress conditions.","output":"Associations between burnout symptoms and sleep among workers during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although Chinas modern education for public health was developing over the past 60 years, there is a lack of authoritative statistics and analyses on the nations development of education for public health at higher education institutions (HEIs). Few quantitative studies on this topic have been published in domestic and international peer-reviewed journals. To address this knowledge gap, we aimed to use national data to quantitatively analyse the scale, structure, and changes of public health education in Chinas HEIs, and to compare the changes of public health education with those of other health science disciplines. METHODS: This study uses previously unreleased national data provided by the Ministry of Education of China that includes the number of health professional students by school and major. The data, which spans from 1998 to 2012, are descriptively analyzed. RESULTS: The number of HEIs for public health education per 100 million population increased from 7.2 in 1998 to 11.3 in 2012. The total enrolment, number of students, and number of graduates increased at rates of 7.3, 7.4, and 5.8% per year, respectively. The percentage of junior college students dropped drastically from 24.0 to 8.4% from 1998 to 2012. During that same period, the number of undergraduates, master and doctorate students increased. Undergraduates accounted for the majority of public health graduates (63.1%) in 2012, and master and doctorate students increased by 10.0 and 5.1 times, respectively, from 1998 to 2012. The relative percentage of public health enrollment, students, and graduates to all health education disciplines dropped from about 6.0% percent in 1998 to around 2% in 2012. CONCLUSIONS: The overall scale of public health education has clearly expanded, though at a slower pace than many other health science disciplines in China. The increase of public health graduates helped to address the previous shortage of public health professionals. Gradually adopting a modern model of education, public health education in China has undergone notable changes that may be informative to other developing countries though it still faces a complex situation in terms of graduates adherence to public health, student recruitment, teaching and training, program planning and reform.","output":"Public health education at Chinas higher education institutions: a time-series analysis from 1998 to 2012"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menemukan bukti empiris adanya pengaruh current ratio, perputaran aktiva tetap, debt to equity ratio, dan return on assets terhadap harga saham.

Using a unique dataset from five poverty\\\\stricken counties, we found that the pandemic has had large negative effects on wage income for migrant workers and workers in manufacturing, the private sector, and small enterprises. Compared with households relying on wage income, households relying on small businesses have suffered much more from the pandemic, whereas households depending on farming or transfer payments have been less affected. Although poor and ethnic minority households lost significant amounts of wage income due to the pandemic, they did not lose more household income than nonpoor and nonminority households. We conclude that support from the government has kept vulnerable households from suffering more than other households from the effects of COVID\\\\19.

Exposure of different sizes of four CNM at dosage levels between 3 and 300 g/mL decreased cell viability in a concentration- and size-dependent manner. Exposure of CNM (10-100 g/mL) to HEK cells resulted in size-, surface area- and concentration-dependent cell membrane damage, increased production of IL-8, increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and decreased intracellular glutathione levels.

This bacterium is present in many soil and aquatic environments and is a major causative agent of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in medical staff. Clinically, it has been reported to contribute to nosocomial infections in patients that include but are not limited to gastrointestinal, skin, and genitourinary tract infections. These complications are most common in hospitalized patients with underlying immunodeficiency, multiple comorbidities, or those receiving invasive surgery. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 25-year-old patient with a R. ornithinolytica infection. The patient had no history of any disease. Her main complaints were high fever, a scattered maculopapular rash, and superficial lymph node enlargement (SLNE). Peripheral blood samples were collected for high-throughput sequencing analysis to identify pathogenic microorganisms. The results confirmed a R. ornithinolytica infection, which was treated successfully using meropenem. Loratadine was also administered to treat the patients compromised skin condition caused by an allergic reaction. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case of a systemic maculopapular rash and superficial lymphadenopathy caused by a R. ornithinolytica infection acquired at the community level. Based on this case, we recommend a combination of antibiotic and antiallergic drugs to treat a R. ornithinolytica infection and associated allergic reaction to the bacteria.","output":"A case report of community-acquired Raoultella ornithinolytica infection in a healthy, young individual"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Lifestyle and work habits have been drastically altered by restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether the associated changes in sleep timing modulate the risk of suffering from symptoms of insomnia, the most prevalent sleep disorder, is however incompletely understood. Here, we evaluate the association between the early pandemic-associated change in 1) the magnitude of social jetlag (SJL) C ie, the difference between sleep timing on working vs free days C and 2) symptoms of insomnia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 14,968 anonymous participants (mean age: 40 years; 64% females) responded to a standardized internet-based survey distributed across 14 countries. Using logistic multivariate regression, we examined the association between the degree of social jetlag and symptoms of insomnia, controlling for important confounders like social restriction extension, country specific COVID-19 severity and psychological distress, for example. RESULTS: In response to the pandemic, participants reported later sleep timing, especially during workdays. Most participants (46%) exhibited a reduction in their SJL, whereas 20% increased it; and 34% reported no change in SJL. Notably, we found that both increased and decreased SJL, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, were associated with later sleep midpoint (indicating a later chronotype) as well as more recurrent and moderate-to-severe symptoms of insomnia (about 23C54% higher odds ratio than subjects with unchanged SJL). Primarily those with reduced SJL shifted their bedtimes to a later timepoint, compared with those without changes in SJL. CONCLUSION: Our findings offer important insights into how self-reported changes to the stability of sleep/wake timing, as reflected by changes in SJL, can be a critical marker of the risk of experiencing insomnia-related symptoms C even when individuals manage to reduce their social jetlag. These findings emphasize the clinical importance of analyzing sleep-wake regularity.","output":"Social Jetlag Changes During the COVID-19 Pandemic as a Predictor of Insomnia C A Multi-National Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Racial equality requires coalitions and solidarity across racial groups, but there continues to be racially colorblind and anti-Black attitudes within the Asian American community, a diverse community consisting of individuals with ancestral origins in East, Southeast, and South Asia.

CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia is a serious complication of vaccination that is not feasible to anticipate or prevent. When the patient presents with sustained headache, neurologic symptoms/signs, abdominal pain, dyspnea, or limb pain/swelling beginning 5C30 days post vaccination, platelet count and d-dimer must be measured, and imaging for thrombosis performed. Confirmation of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia diagnosis should be ordered (platelet factor 4/polyanion enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; platelet factor 4Cenhanced platelet activation testing) as treatment is initiated (nonheparin anticoagulation, IV immunoglobulin).","output":"Recognizing Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Caregiver burden associated with dementia-related agitation is one of the most common reasons for a community-dwelling person living with dementia to transition to a care facility. The Behavioral and Environmental Sensing and Intervention (BESI) for the Dementia Caregiver Empowerment system uses sensing technology, smartwatches, tablets, and data analytics to detect and predict agitation in persons living with dementia and to provide just-in-time notifications and dyad-specific intervention recommendations to caregivers. The BESI system has shown that there is a valid relationship between dementia-related agitation and environmental factors and that caregivers prefer a home-based monitoring system. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to obtain input from caregivers of persons living with dementia on the value, usability, and acceptability of the BESI system in the home setting and obtain their insights and recommendations for the next stage of system development. METHODS: A descriptive qualitative design with thematic analysis was used to analyze 10 semistructured interviews with caregivers. The interviews comprised 16 questions, with an 80% (128/160) response rate. RESULTS: Postdeployment caregiver feedback about the BESI system and the overall experience were generally positive. Caregivers acknowledged the acceptability of the system by noting the ease of use and saw the system as a fit for them. Functionality issues such as timeliness in agitation notification and simplicity in the selection of agitation descriptors on the tablet interface were identified, and caregivers indicated a desire for more word options to describe agitation behaviors. Agitation intervention suggestions were well received by the caregivers, and the resulting decrease in the number and severity of agitation events helped confirm that the BESI system has good value and acceptability. Thematic analysis suggested several subjective experiences and yielded the themes of usefulness and helpfulness. CONCLUSIONS: This study determined preferences for assessing caregiver strain and burden, explored caregiver acceptance of the technology system (in-home sensors, actigraph or smart watch technology, and tablet devices), discerned caregiver insights on the burden and stress of caring for persons living with dementia experiencing agitation in dementia, and solicited caregiver input and recommendations for system changes. The themes of usefulness and helpfulness support the use of caregiver knowledge and experience to inform further development of the technology.","output":"Dementia Caregiver Experiences and Recommendations for Using the Behavioral and Environmental Sensing and Intervention System at Home: Usability and Acceptability Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Oral fluid sampling and testing offers a convenient, unobtrusive mechanism for evaluating the health status of swine, especially grower and finisher swine. This assessment evaluates the potential testing of oral fluid samples with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to detect African swine fever, classical swine fever, or foot-and-mouth disease for surveillance during a disease outbreak and early detection in a disease-free setting. METHODS: We used a series of logical arguments, informed assumptions, and a range of parameter values from literature and industry practices to examine the cost and value of information provided by oral fluid sampling and rRT-PCR testing for the swine foreign animal disease surveillance objectives outlined above. RESULTS: Based on the evaluation, oral fluid testing demonstrated value for both settings evaluated. The greatest value was in an outbreak scenario, where using oral fluids would minimize disruption of animal and farm activities, reduce sample sizes by 23%-40%, and decrease resource requirements relative to current individual animal sampling plans. For an early detection system, sampling every 3 days met the designed prevalence detection threshold with 0.95 probability, but was quite costly. LIMITATIONS: Implementation of oral fluid testing for African swine fever, classical swine fever, or foot-and-mouth disease surveillance is not yet possible due to several limitations and information gaps. The gaps include validation of PCR diagnostic protocols and kits for African swine fever, classical swine fever, or foot-and-mouth disease on swine oral fluid samples; minimal information on test performance in a field setting; detection windows with low virulence strains of some foreign animal disease viruses; and the need for confirmatory testing protocol development.","output":"Assessing the value of PCR assays in oral fluid samples for detecting African swine fever, classical swine fever, and foot-and-mouth disease in U.S. swine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Poverty and mental health Extreme poverty, measured as earning less than USD 1 90 a day by the World Bank, is accompanied by hunger, overcrowded living conditions, low accessibility and affordability of health services, limited educational and livelihood opportunities, and adverse life events associated with socioeconomic vulnerabilities Over time an awareness in the field of mental health recognizes that this vicious cycle of poverty and mental ill health needs to be viewed from human rights perspective Rise in mental health needs during COVID-19 pandemic COVID-19 is merely one symptom of the dysfunctional relationship between humans and nature, which is manifested through climate change, loss of biodiversity, habitat fragmentation, and domestication of wild animals (UNEP, 2020) The results of a Chinese study reviewing the effect of COVID-19 mitigation plans on mental health led Wuhan's Government officials to develop a multi-layered response that involved forming psychological intervention teams for key populations that are likely to be impacted by exposure to COVID-19 and its adverse risk factors (Kang et al , 2020)","output":"Impact of pandemic on mental health in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Persons with communicable diseases who travel on commercial aircraft can pose a risk for infection to the traveling public.

In addition, weak interactions among crowds, transient interactions within social gatherings, and dense human contact between foreign workers in dormitories are also taken into consideration. Such a categorization in terms of a multiplex of social network connections together with the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) epidemic model have enabled a more precise study of the feasibility and efficacy of control measures such as social distancing, work from home, and lockdown, at different moments and stages of the pandemics. Using this model, we study an epidemic outbreak that occurs within densely populated residential areas in Singapore. Our simulations show that residents in densely populated areas could be infected easily, even though they constitute a very small fraction of the whole population.

There are few studies that relate the attendance of children at the PC to the pandemic of COVID-19. The aim of our study is to describe the impact of the two Spanish states of alarm on the care of children at de PC level. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study. The PC visits corresponding to pediatric patients (<14 years) from a health area in northern Spain during the first and second states of alarm were analyzed, and compared with their equivalent periods in 2019. RESULTS: During the first state of alarm, home lockdown and school closure were established, and a large decrease in pediatric visits to the health centres was observed (758 vs. 1381 in 2019) at the expense of health check-ups and infectious diseases. This decrease was not observed in the second state of alarm (1375 vs. 1233 in 2019). In both states of alarm, the percentage of telephone assistance increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of alarm states has meant a decrease on the demand of medical care, especially during the first state of alarm, may be owing to the fear of the families of going to the health center and the decrease in the transmissibility of viruses due to home lockdown. The increase of the telematic assistance has been on account of the need of reorganization of health care, wich has proven to be effective.","output":"[Impact of COVID-19s alarm states in the care of pediatric patients in Primary Care in a health area in northern Spain]./ Impacto de los estados de alarma por COVID-19 en la atencin a pacientes peditricos en Atencin Primaria de un rea sanitaria del norte de Espa?a"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created uncertainties about different aspects of the lives of people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) We intend to understand the impact of the virus and the risks of the infection in PwMS Methods: The study was launched on 17 March 2020 as part of the United Kingdom (UK) MS Register (UKMSR), a research project with 13,916 PwMS registered as of 22 April 2020 which holds longitudinal data about patients' demographics, MS related and other medical information, and patient-reported outcome measures since 2011 All patients on the UKMSR were asked to participate in the study by completing COVID-19 related questionnaires fortnightly Telephone interviews by a neurologist confirmed the suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 based on symptoms We also asked healthcare professionals to provide anonymised data on MS patients with COVID-19 using a separate questionnaire Results: As of 22 April 2020, 3,702 PwMS participated in the study and recruitment is on-going A total of 196 (5 29%) participants reported that they had suspected COVID-19 out of which 41 (20 92%) reported having been diagnosed by a healthcare professional Only three (1 53%) of the patients with suspected COVID-19 required hospitalisation On the contrary, out of the 26 suspected COVID-19 cases reported by clinicians, 21 have positive polymerase chain reaction tests and 3 have died Conclusion: These contrasting results emphasise the need to supplement clinician-reported outcomes with community- based studies to understand the true impact of COVID-19 in PwMS","output":"Complementary reporting by patients and clinicians offers a more thorough picture of the impact of COVID-19 on people with multiple sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory viruses evolve to maintain infectivity levels that permit spread yet prevent host and virus extinction, resulting in surprisingly low infection rates.

One such device, the virtual reality (VR) headset, has recently been shown to improve analgesia in a small sample of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of VR in patients undergoing atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation under conscious sedation. METHODS: All patients who underwent an AF ablation with VR from March to May 2020 were included. Patients were compared to a consecutive cohort of patients who underwent AF ablation in the 3 months prior to the study. Primary efficacy was assessed by using a visual analog scale, summarizing the overall pain experienced during the ablation. RESULTS: The AF cryoablation procedure with VR was performed for 48 patients (mean age 63.0, SD 10.9 years; n=16, 33.3% females). No patient refused to use the device, although 14.6% (n=7) terminated the VR session prematurely. Preparation of the VR headset took on average 78 (SD 13) seconds. Compared to the control group, the mean perceived pain, assessed with the visual analog scale, was lower in the VR group (3.5 [SD 1.5] vs 4.3 [SD 1.6]; P=.004), and comfort was higher in the VR group (7.5 [SD 1.6] vs 6.8 [SD 1.7]; P=.03).

Eight rat liver samples were collected 24 h post-betamethasone-treatment from experimental and control animals and were analysed by 1H-MRS using a 7-Tesla MRI scanner. 1H-MR reference spectra both of the Bentelan formulation used for treatment, and of three solutions of betamethasone in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) at 5, 10 and 100 mM, respectively, were acquired to fit analyte-peaks in the liver samples spectra. Betamethasone-peaks were found only in the 100 mM betamethasone in DMSO solution spectrum. Betamethasone residues were not detected in any of the tissue samples analysed, probably related to the low concentration of injected drug. These findings allow us to establish, for the first time in the literature, the detection limit (in the range 10-100 mM) of betamethasone for the 7-Tesla MRI scanner used here. Given this very-low sensitivity, we conclude that the evaluated 1H-MR spectroscopy approach is not suitable for the detection of betamethasone residues in edible tissues, since the maximum residue limit imposed by Commission Regulation (EC) 37/2010 for betamethasone in the liver, and metabolic concentrations required to be detected in animal samples from livestock, are far below the detection limit we found.","output":"Residue analysis of a synthetic glucocorticoid in liver samples by a 1HMR spectroscopy approach: An exploratory study on animal model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite advances in critical care facilities and ventilation therapies acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with high mortality rates.

Strikingly, this evolutionary analysis revealed that the bat PyVs were paraphyletic, suggestive of multiple species jumps between bats and other mammalian species, such that the theory of virus-host co-divergence for mammalian PyVs as a whole could be rejected. In addition, evidence was found for strong heterogeneity in evolutionary rate and potential recombination in a number of PyV complete genomes, which complicates both phylogenetic analysis and virus classification.

Disease-specific and nonspecific cutaneous manifestations have been increasingly reported in the spectrum of COVID-19 but the influence of the infection on pre-existing dermatologic diseases has not been clearly defined. There has been a debate in the literature as to whether patients suffering from autoimmune dermatoses, including cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as if they experience worsening of their lupus erythematosus (LE)-related clinical symptoms. This article reports on a case of Rowell syndrome occurring after COVID-19 in a 67-year old woman with pre-existing chronic CLE manifesting with few discoid lesions on the face, scalp, and upper chest, successfully controlled with topical corticosteroids and photoprotection. Erythema multiforme (EM)-like eruption developed approximately two weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 infection, the latter being confirmed by positive nasopharyngeal swab and successfully treated with systemic antibiotics and antiaggregants. Diffuse hair loss and patches of cicatricial alopecia were also present upon scalp examination. Laboratory workup, including routine tests, histologic, immunofluorescent, and serologic investigations, was supportive to the diagnosis. Administration of topical and systemic corticosteroids along with peroral hydroxychloroquine resulted in the progressive improvement of the cutaneous lesions. Rowell syndrome is a rare entity in the spectrum of LE, characterized by EM-like lesions, photosensitivity, and positive antinuclear and anti-Ro antibodies, that is currently considered to be a variant of subacute CLE (SCLE). Several cases of SCLE have been described in association with medications, including anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines but only a few reports incriminate the infection itself as a potential exacerbating factor. Based on the clinical course of the disease, we suggest that the observed Rowell syndrome-like flare of CLE was related to the COVID-19 infection in this patient.","output":"Case Report: Rowell SyndromeCLike Flare of Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Following COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diagnosis and understanding of disease progression require an interpretation of medical images, would take a lot of time in manual interpretation of the large amount of medical images accumulated.

Differences in these characteristics between countries and between pandemic and prepandemic care are described.ResultsCare for patients with RTIs rapidly switched to telephone/video consultations (10% in Armenia, 91% in Denmark), and when consultations were face-to-face, GPs used PPE during 97% (95% CI 96% to 98%) of contacts. Laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 in primary care patients with RTIs was rapidly implemented in Denmark (59%) and Germany (31%), while overall testing for C reactive protein decreased. The proportion of patients prescribed antibiotics varied considerably between countries (3% in Belgium, 48% in UK) and was lower during the pandemic compared with the months before, except for Greece, Poland and UK. GPs provided frequent and varied COVID-related advice and more frequently scheduled a follow-up contact (50%, 95% CI 48% to 52%). GPs reported a slightly higher degree of confidence in the likely effectiveness of their management in face-to-face (73% (very) confident, 95% CI 71% to 76%) than in virtual consultations (69%, 95% CI 67% to 71%).ConclusionsDespite between-country variation in consultation characteristics, access to SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing and medication prescribing, GPs reported a high degree of confidence in managing their patients with RTIs in the emerging pandemic. Insight in the highly variable pandemic responses, as measured in this multicountry audit, can aid in fine-tuning national action and in coordinating a pan-European response during future pandemic threats.","output":"Primary care for patients with respiratory tract infection before and early on in the COVID-19 pandemic: an observational study in 16 European countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Over a year since the first reported case, COVID-19 burden in Ethiopia remains unknown due to limited surveillance.

Clinical experience of prophylactic treatment of respiratory tract infections with the marketed CHMP containing horseradish root (Armoraciae rusticanae radix) and nasturtium (Tropaeoli majoris herba) has existed for decades. METHODS The study was performed as a phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. All groups received two film coated tablets three times a day. Group 1 received the CHMP tablets 3  2 per day, group 2 the CHMP tablets 2  2 and placebo tablets 2  1 per day and group 3 received placebo tablets 3  2 per day. Maximum duration of treatment was 84 days. The primary efficacy criterion was the comparison of the incidences of new occurring RTIs between the treatment groups during the prophylactic treatment. In addition the character of occurring infections, number of sick days and severity of infections were compared. Further criteria were subjects' well being, the satisfaction of subjects with the respective treatments and severity and incidence of the observed adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) during the study period. TRIAL REGISTRATION EudraCT No. 2010-023227-26. RESULTS From 371 subjects screened, a total of 351 subjects of both sexes from 18 to 75 years were randomly allocated to one of the three groups. In order to achieve scientifically and medically impeccable results it was necessary to address acute infections of the respiratory tract occurring during the normal incubation period. Early infections (day 7) were excluded from the data set in a sensitivity analysis. In the intention to treat (ITT) population excluding early infections day 7 (n = 344) the infection rates were 13.3% for CHMP 3  2 (n = 113), 18.4% for CHMP 2  2 (n = 114) and 25.6% for placebo (n = 117). The statistical trend test showed significant results (p = 0.0171). For the per protocol (PP) population - also excluding infections day 7 (n = 334) - infection rates were: CHMP 3  2 (n = 110) 12.7%, CHMP 2  2 (n = 113) 18.6% and placebo (n = 111) 24.3% (p = 0.0266). Secondary parameters of infections (infection diagnosis, intensity, duration) showed no relevant differences between the treatment groups. The study medication was well tolerated. LIMITATIONS This was the first clinical ICH-GCP study with the CHMP conducted in this indication and with a sufficient number of subjects. The study population comprised subjects from 18 to 75 years and covered different diagnoses of RTIs. The results show a benefit when using 3  2 film tablets of CHMP for prophylaxis of RTIs. However, no data are available on use of the CHMP in this indication in children, adolescents and the elderly (over 75 years).

Group 1 (controls): healthy calves (n = 9). Group 2: calves affected with diarrhea at Day 9 (n = 7). Group 3: calves with diarrhea at Days 3 and 9 (n = 4). Infections occurred spontaneously and were mainly due to E. coli infections. All affected calves had recovered at Day 21. Mean GH concentrations in the calves in Groups 2 and 3 compared to control calves had increased by Day 3 (P < 0.01; P < 0.001). Cortisol levels of calves in all groups were highest at Day 3 and decreased thereafter (P < 0.001). Cortisol concentrations were lower at Day 3 in animals in Groups 2 (P < 0.001) and 3 (P < 0.05) than in controls. Pulsatile LH release was detectable at Days 9 and 21 only in healthy calves. Insulin increased at Day 9 during diarrhea. The results indicate that cortisol concentrations decreased whereas GH concentrations were increased before diarrhea was observed. The onset of pulsatile LH release was delayed in diarrheic calves.

Nearly 10 million deaths were reported in 2020 due to cancer alone. Several factors are involved in cancer progressions, such as lifestyle and genetic characteristics. According to a recent report, extracellular vesicles (EVs) are involved in cancer initiation, progression, and therapy failure. EVs can play a major role in intracellular communication, the maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and pathogenesis in several types of diseases. In a healthy person, EVs carry different cargoes, such as miRNA, lncRNA etc., to help other body functions. On the other hand, the same EV in a tumor microenvironment carries cargoes such as miRNA, lncRNA, etc., to initiate or help cancer progression at various stages. These stages may include the proliferation of cells and escape from apoptosis, angiogenesis, cell invasion, and metastasis, reprogramming energy metabolism, evasion of the immune response, and transfer of mutations. Tumor-derived EVs manipulate by altering normal functions of the body and affect the epigenetics of normal cells by limiting the genetic makeup through transferring mutations, histone modifications, etc. Tumor-derived EVs also pose therapy resistance through transferring drug efflux pumps and posing multiple drug resistances. Such EVs can also help as biomarkers for different cancer types and stages, which ultimately help with cancer diagnosis at early stages.

Globally, no therapy such as vaccines and specific therapeutic agents is available so far despite some protease inhibitors and antiviral agents. Introduction: Due to no therapeutic drug or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 so far, phytomedicine may be developed as therapeutic agents in the prevention and treatment of current COVID-19 disease. Thus, the aim of this study was to find out a suitable therapeutic agent from selected 17 dietary molecules, which could target SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins. Materials and Methods: In this study, 3D structures of selected dietary molecules were obtained from the PubChem database, which have previously been reported for their antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. Then, molecular docking analysis by using AutoDoc4 and AutoDockVina software was conducted to evaluate their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Lipinski's rule of five and drug-likeness properties were also discussed with the help of Molinspiration and the OSIRIS property explorer methods. Results: Our results revealed that, among all, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (7) is a lead compound that could fit well into the binding sites of docked proteins of SARS-CoV-2. EGCG showed very strong molecular interactions with the free enzyme of main protease (6y2e), chimeric receptorbinding domain complexed with human ACE2 (6vw1), and NSP15 endoribonuclease (6vww) encoded proteins of SARS-CoV-2, by showing binding energies -9.30, -8.66, and -8.38, kcal/mole, respectively. Conclusion: In the present study, EGCG (7) is more active than two standard drugs that are currently being used in COVID 19, namely remdesivir and nafamostat.

In the 2019-2020 academic year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we designed an innovative and novel online robotics competition format using Zoom Webinar tools rather than cancelling the world championship competition. The purpose of this paper is to show how we designed, implemented synchronized online robotics competitions, and to analyze the results and efficacy of the Robofest Online World championships (ROWC). One hundred and fifty-three teams comprising of 360 students competed in three age divisions and six categories held weekends from Aug. 28 through Oct. 10, 2020. Most teams set up playing fields at home and we trained judges online prior to the competitions. We sent the description of an unknown game ending task and unknown playing field factors to local volunteer judges at the same time just before the 30-minute work time on the competition day. After checking to make sure that all the teams were ready to play, we sent the game start signal to all the teams at the same time through Zoom. The local judges scored the runs and submitted videos to the Robofest office for score verification. Robofest office staff also proctored the competitions through Zoom screens for fair competition results and maximum learning opportunities. It was an innovative practice of using online conference tools to organize the world's first unique 'synchronized' online autonomous robotics competitions for engineering and computing education.

Six hundred thirty-eight teacher candidates participated in the study. The research data were collected through an 11-item questionnaire, and the data were analyzed using descriptive and cross-tabulation analyzes. Research findings mainly showed that vaccine acceptance was low, and most of the participants thought the virus is artificial. Another finding of the research revealed that most of the participants who complied with all the rules regarding COVID-19 did not get the virus;however, it was seen that nearly all of the participants who caught COVID-19 had an infected individual in their family.

Several issues concerning the origin, time of introduction to humans, evolutionary patterns, and underlying force driving the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak remain unclear. METHOD: Genetic variation in 137 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and related coronaviruses as of 2/23/2020 was analyzed. RESULT: After correcting for mutational bias, the excess of low frequency mutations on both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites was revealed which is consistent with the recent outbreak of the virus. In contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for SARS-CoV during its brief epidemic in 2003, our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes shows signs of relaxation. The sequence similarity in the spike receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and a sequence from pangolin is probably due to an ancient intergenomic introgression that occurred approximately 40 years ago. The current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to have originated on 12/11/2019 (95% HPD 11/13/2019-12/23/2019). The effective population size of the virus showed an approximately 20-fold increase from the onset of the outbreak to the lockdown of Wuhan (1/23/2020) and ceased to increase afterwards, demonstrating the effectiveness of social distancing in preventing its spread. Two mutations, 84S in orf8 protein and 251 V in orf3 protein, occurred coincidentally with human intervention. The former first appeared on 1/5/2020 and plateaued around 1/23/2020. The latter rapidly increased in frequency after 1/23/2020. Thus, the roles of these mutations on infectivity need to be elucidated. Genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 collected from China is two times higher than those derived from the rest of the world. A network analysis found that haplotypes collected from Wuhan were interior and had more mutational connections, both of which are consistent with the observation that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak originated in China. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 might have cryptically circulated within humans for years before being discovered. Data from the early outbreak and hospital archives are needed to trace its evolutionary path and determine the critical steps required for effective spreading.","output":"The origin and underlying driving forces of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The literature reports increased suicide rates among general population in the weeks following the celebrity suicide, known as the Werther effect.

The relative effectiveness of specific NPIs remains uncertain. METHODS: We used state-level Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case and mortality data between January 19, 2020 and March 7, 2021 to model NPI policy effectiveness. Empirically derived breakpoints in case and mortality velocities were used to identify periods of stable, decreasing, or increasing COVID-19 burden. The associations between NPI adoption and subsequent decreases in case or death velocities were estimated using generalized linear models accounting for weekly variability shared across states. State-level NPI policies included: stay at home order, indoor public gathering ban (mild >10 or severe 10), indoor restaurant dining ban, and public mask mandate. RESULTS: 28,602,830 cases and 511,899 deaths were recorded. The odds of a decrease in COVID-19 case velocity were significantly elevated for stay at home (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.63C2.52), indoor dining ban (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.25C2.10), public mask mandate (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.47C3.23), and severe gathering ban (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.31C2.16). In mutually adjusted models, odds remained elevated for stay at home (AOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.04C2.07) and public mask mandate (AOR = 2.27, 95% CI 1.51C3.41). Stay at home (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.53C2.62; AOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.25C2.87) was also associated with greater likelihood of decrease in death velocity in unadjusted and adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: NPIs employed in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic, most significantly stay at home orders, were associated with decreased COVID-19 burden.","output":"Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions and COVID-19 Burden in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current pandemic, finding an effective drug to prevent or treat the infection is the highest priority.

Spreads rapidly among humans of both sexes of all ages, in large masses in the cyclical manner(seasonally) causing disease in susceptible human Hosts affecting most of the organs in humans mainly lungs resulting in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome resulting in mass acute deaths. Acute deaths are more common with Comorbidities like Diabetes mellitus, Ischaemic heart disease, Liver disease, Kidney disease, Gut, etc. Now it is the major emergency international pandemic public health medical disease. On the face of the earth, there are large masses of infection and mass acute deaths due to COVID-19 virus infection and so the life of every individual is uncertain at any time. Because of the mass acute deaths from the COVID-19 virus infection, everyone in the world is scared. From now on, it is the responsibility of the researchers of all nations to bring hope to people. In this article, by predicting the lifetime of disease-causing virus, hope to the people is given, to better protect all people and speed up the immediate general pandemic preparedness within the lifespan of the virus. To accelerate actions to save people's lives, mathematical models will help make public health decisions and reduce mortality using the resources available during this time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, to better protect people from disease preparedness for the virus and a general pandemic by predicting the lifetime of the disease-causing coronavirus, three new mathematical models which are dependent on parameters are proposed. The parameters in the model function model uncertainty of death due to the present international real-life problem caused by different strains of the COVID-19 virus. The first model is a model with six parameters and the second and third models are models with seven parameters respectively. These three models are the generalization of the three models of Phem . The errors due to the models of this article are minimized from the errors due to the models of Phem. These three models can predict the acute death count outside the data period and can predict the lifetime. To illustrate the applicability of the models a big data set of size 54 days starting from February 29, 2020, to April 22, 2020, of acute death counts of USA( United States of America) is considered. The main focus is on the USA due to the significant large mass of infection and large mass of acute death from the COVID-19 virus. As a result, everyone's life is uncertain about death at any time. Since it is a major international public health-related medical problem in humans, with an accuracy of 95% of confidence the results using three models are erected. The large mass of acute deaths due to the number of COVID-19 virus infections in the USA are fitted by the model functions of three mathematical models and a solution is found to an international problem. Based on the acute death rate, the lifetime of the COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 1484.76198616309920 days from the first day of acute death, February 29, 2020. In other words, there will be no mass acute deaths from the COVID-19 virus in the USA after April 2024 if the nation follows the guidelines of the WHO(World Health Organization) and the recommendations of the pathogen. And when the people and the government are very well prepared for this crisis then the spread of infection can be prevented, the people and government can be saved from the economic crisis, and many lives can be saved from mass acute deaths. A comparative study of all models is presented for different measures of errors. The acute death count of the USA outside the date of the data set of 54 days is predicted using three models. The data set misses some counts during the collection of data and it is identified. From the ratio of standard deviation and average acu e deaths, it is predicted that the total acute death counts during 54 days will be 62,969. Using the standard deviation around the line of regression it is shown that in the data set a large count is missing during the collection of data of USA. Using the coefficient of determination it is predicted that the Model-C, provides 100% of fitness with the given data set and only 0.0% variation. All three models are suitable to fit the data set of acute death counts of the USA, but Model-C is the best and optimal among the three models. Tt is predicted from Model-A, Model-B, and Model-C the total acute death counts during 54 days will be 66537, 67085, and 68523 respectively. Since Model-C is the best and optimal model, the predicted total acute death counts during 54 days will be 68523. Finally, this article suggests various steps to help control the spread and severity of the new disease. The prediction of the lifetime and data count missing in the data set presented in this research article is entirely new and differs totally from all other articles in the literature. To accelerate actions to save people's lives, mathematical models will help make public health decisions and reduce mortality using the resources available during this time of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The Prediction of the Lifetime of the COVID-19 Virus using Parameter-dependent New Mathematical Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The advertising of e-cigarettes in the UK is regulated through the revised EU Tobacco Products Directive and the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations, with further rules set out in the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) Committees of Advertising (CAP) Code. Focusing on the ASA CAP Code Rules, we examined e-cigarette advertising regulation compliance in traditional advertising channels and on social media. METHODS: We conducted a content analysis of UK e-cigarette and related product advertising using a randomly selected sample (n = 130) of advertising in traditional channels and on Instagram which appeared between January and December 2019. All ads were independently double-coded to assess compliance with each CAP Code Rule. RESULTS: In traditional channels, our sample of advertising had largely good compliance. Only very small numbers of these ads appeared to be clearly in breach of any of the ASA rules (5% were in breach of Rule 22.7; 2% of Rule 22.9; and 1% of Rule 22.10). In contrast, we judged that all of the Instagram sample (n = 30) was in breach of Rule 22.12. For some rules, it was not possible to make definitive judgments about compliance, given uncertainty regarding how a rule should be interpreted and applied. CONCLUSIONS: We found overall good compliance for advertising in traditional channels, but assessed all of our social media advertising samples was in breach of regulations. Current guidance on e-cigarette advertising could be improved to facilitate e-cigarette advertising assessment and regulation. It would be beneficial to bring consumer perspectives into the assessment of regulation compliance. IMPLICATIONS: The regulation of e-cigarette advertising is a global concern. The UK Government has a statutory obligation to review the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations by May 2021. This study assessed compliance with current UK e-cigarette advertising regulations on placement and content.

We apply the method to assess excess mortality from March to June 2020 in Denmark and Sweden as a result of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic; associated policy interventions; and behavioral, healthcare, social, and economic changes. We chose to compare Denmark and Sweden because reliable data were available and because the two countries are similar but chose different responses to COVID-19: Denmark imposed a rather severe lockdown; Sweden did not. We make forecasts by age and sex to predict expected deaths if COVID-19 had not struck. Subtracting these forecasts from observed deaths gives the excess death count. Excess deaths were lower in Denmark than Sweden during the first wave of the pandemic. The later/earlier ratio we propose for shortcasting is easy to understand, requires less data than more elaborate approaches, and may be useful in many countries in making both predictions about the future and the past to study the impact on mortality of coronavirus and other epidemics. In the application to Denmark and Sweden, prediction intervals are narrower and bias is less than when forecasts are based on averages of the last 5 y, as is often done. More generally, later/earlier ratios may prove useful in short-term forecasting of illnesses and births as well as economic and other activity that varies seasonally or periodically.","output":"Short-term forecasts of expected deaths"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diagnostic testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is primarily conducted from an upper respiratory specimen, like nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) or oropharyngeal swab (OPS) obtained by the health-care personnel.

METHODS: This nationwide retrospective cohort study describes patients with prior lung disease hospitalised for COVID-19 (March-April 2020) or influenza (2018C2019 influenza outbreak). We compare the resulting pulmonary complications, need for intensive care and in-hospital mortality depending on respiratory history and virus. RESULTS: In the 89 530 COVID-19 cases, 16.03% had at least one CRD, which was significantly less frequently than in the 45 819 seasonal influenza patients. Patients suffering from chronic respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cystic fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension were underrepresented, contrary to those with lung cancer, sleep apnea, emphysema, and interstitial pulmonary diseases (ILD). COVID-19 patients with CRD developed significantly more ventilator-associated pneumonia and pulmonary embolism than influenza patients. They needed intensive care significantly more often and had a higher mortality rate (except for asthma) when compared to patients with COVID-19 but without CRD, or patients with influenza. CONCLUSION: Patients with prior respiratory diseases were globally less likely to be hospitalised for COVID-19 than for influenza but were at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 and had a higher mortality rate compared to influenza patients and patients without a history of respiratory illness.

Although a large amount of data on SARS-CoV-2 is available, the investigation of how viral functions change in response to mutations is hampered by a lack of effective structural analysis. Here, we exploit the advances of protein structure fingerprint technology to study the folding conformational changes induced by mutations. With integration of both protein sequences and folding conformations, the structures are aligned for SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2, including Alpha variant (lineage B.1.1.7) and Delta variant (lineage B.1.617.2). The results showed that the virus evolution with change in mutational positions and physicochemical properties increased the affinity between spike protein and ACE2, which plays a critical role in coronavirus entry into human cells. Additionally, these structural variations impact vaccine effectiveness and drug function over the course of SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has become a pandemic with tens of thousands of infected patients. Based on clinical features, pathology, the pathogenesis of acute respiratory disorder induced by either highly homogenous coronaviruses or other pathogens, the evidence suggests that excessive inflammation, oxidation, and an exaggerated immune response very likely contribute to COVID-19 pathology. This leads to a cytokine storm and subsequent progression to acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and often death. Melatonin, a well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative molecule, is protective against ALI/ARDS caused by viral and other pathogens. Melatonin is effective in critical care patients by reducing vessel permeability, anxiety, sedation use, and improving sleeping quality, which might also be beneficial for better clinical outcomes for COVID-19 patients. Notably, melatonin has a high safety profile. There is significant data showing that melatonin limits virus-related diseases and would also likely be beneficial in COVID-19 patients.

The clinical form included questions on any symptom consistent with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the IBD adherence treatment. Furthermore, we have reviewed all IBD medical records including new IBD diagnoses and flares in known IBD patients after the lockdown. Results: Questionnaires of 290 IBD children were returned during lockdown. Out of them, 24 children (8%) complained of mild symptoms suspicious of SARS-CoV-2 infection without needing hospitalization or changing IBD treatment.

There has been little scrutiny of alcohol use behaviors resulting in hospital visits, which is essential to guide pandemic public policy. We aimed to determine whether COVID-19 peak restrictions were associated with increased hospital visits for alcohol use or withdrawal. Secondary objectives were to describe differences based on age, sex, and race, and to examine alcohol-related complication incidence. DESIGN: Multi-center, retrospective, pre-post study. SETTING: New York City health system with five participating hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Adult Emergency Department encounters for alcohol use, alcoholic gastritis or pancreatitis or hepatitis, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, withdrawal seizure, or delirium tremens. MEASUREMENTS: Age, sex, race, site, encounter diagnosis. Encounters were compared between 2019 and 2020, for March 1 through May 31. FINDINGS: There were 2,790 alcohol-related visits during the 2019 study period and 1,793 in 2020, with a decrease in total hospital visits. Of 4,583 alcohol-related visits, median age was 47 years, with 22.1% females. In 2020, there was an increase in percentage of visits for alcohol withdrawal (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.07-1.67) and withdrawal with complications (AOR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.14-1.72), and a decline in percentage of hospital visits for alcohol use (AOR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.59-0.85) and use with complications (AOR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.58-0.88). It is unknown whether use visit changes mirror declines in other chief complaints. The age groups 18-29 and 60-69 years were associated with increased visits for use and decreased visits for withdrawal, as were non-white race groups. Sex was not associated with alcohol-related visit changes despite male predominance.

The aim of this work was to evaluate compounds of natural origin, mainly from medicinal plants, as potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors through docking studies. The viral spike (S) glycoprotein and the main protease Mpro, involved in the recognition of virus by host cells and in viral replication, respectively, were the main molecular targets in this study. Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock, which allowed us to select the plant actives with the highest affinity towards the viral targets and to identify the interaction molecular sites with the SARS-CoV2 proteins. The best energy binding values for S protein were, in kcal/mol: ?19.22 for glycyrrhizin, ?17.84 for gitoxin, ?12.05 for dicumarol, ?10.75 for diosgenin, and ? 8.12 for delphinidin. For Mpro were, in kcal/mol: ?9.36 for spirostan, ?8.75 for N-(3-acetylglycyrrhetinoyl)-2-amino-propanol, ?8.41 for -amyrin, ?8.35 for oleanane, ?8.11 for taraxasterol, and ? 8.03 for glycyrrhetinic acid. In addition, the synthetic drugs umifenovir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine were used as controls for S protein, while atazanavir and nelfinavir were used for Mpro. Key hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between natural compounds and the respective viral proteins were identified, allowing us to explain the great affinity obtained in those compounds with the lowest binding energies.

One of the most important pieces of this host-pathogen interaction is the spike protein, which binds to the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) cell receptor, mediates the membrane fusion and is the major target of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The multiple amino acid substitutions observed in this region, specially in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), mainly after almost one year of its emergence (late 2020), have enhanced the hACE2 binding affinity and led to several modifications in the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, improving the viral fitness and/or promoting immune evasion, with potential impact in the vaccine development. In this way, the present work aimed to evaluate the effect of positively selected mutations fixed in the Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 lineages and to check for mutational evidence of coevolution. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of selected mutations identified in some of the VOC and VOI lineages (C.37, B.1.1.7, P.1, and P.2) of Brazilian samples on the structural stability of the spike protein, as well as their possible association with more aggressive infection profiles by estimating the binding affinity in the RBD-hACE2 complex. We identified 48 sites under selective pressure in Brazilian spike sequences, 17 of them with the strongest evidence by the HyPhy tests, including VOC related mutation sites 138, 142, 222, 262, 484, 681, and 845, among others. The coevolutionary analysis identified a number of 28 coevolving sites that were found not to be conditionally independent, such as the couple E484K - N501Y from P.1 and B.1.351 lineages. Finally, the molecular dynamics and free energy estimates showed the structural stabilizing effect and the higher impact of E484K for the improvement of the binding affinity between the spike RBD and the hACE2 in P.1 and P.2 lineages, as well as the stabilizing and destabilizing effects for the positively selected sites.","output":"Molecular evolution and structural analyses of the spike glycoprotein from Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 genomes: the impact of the fixation of selected mutations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this research, the effect of Dexamethasone drug (DM) on mild steel corrosion in 2 M HCl was analyzed using weight loss, potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and MD-simulation. In addition, Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were employed to inspect the mild steel surface in the blank and inhibited medium. For the optimization tool, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model was developed to predict the inhibition efficiency. The experimental data was categorized into two different sections for training and testing the ANFIS model. The developed model aimed to evaluate the fitness between the experimental and predicted values. From the results generated, optimum value (IE%) of DM was recorded as 80%, 81% and 83% at concentration of 0.4 g/L for weight loss, EIS and PDP respectively. Potentiodynamic polarization results reveal that Dexamethasone functions as a mixed-type inhibitor, whereas studies of EIS show that the inhibition mechanism is by the transfer of charges. Mild steel surface examination confirmed the presence of a protective adsorbed film on the mild steel surface. Thermodynamic parameters obtained imply that Dexamethasone is adsorbed on the steel surface by a physiochemical process and obeys Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Also the MD-simulation results evidenced that DM forms a metallic surface adsorbed film on the steel surface. From the ANFIS model, the sensitivity analysis shows that time and inhibitor concentration were the most important input variable while other input variables could not be neglected. ANFIS model coefficient of determination (R(2) 0.993) was found between the observed and predicted values. ANFIS model gave optimum prediction (80%) with high degree accuracy and robustness.

Few adult cancer patients participate in trials. Although patient decision-making about trial participation has been frequently examined, the participation rate for patients actually offered a trial is unknown. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis using 3 major search engines was undertaken. We identified studies from January 1, 2000, to January 1, 2020, that examined clinical trial participation in the United States. Studies must have specified the numbers of patients offered a trial and the number enrolled. A random effects model of proportions was used. All statistical tests were 2-sided. RESULTS: We identified 35 studies (30 about treatment trials and 5 about cancer control trials) among which 9759 patients were offered trial participation. Overall, 55.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 49.4% to 60.5%) of patients agreed to enroll. Participation rates did not differ between treatment (55.0%, 95% CI = 48.9% to 60.9%) and cancer control trials (55.3%, 95% CI = 38.9% to 71.1%; P = .98).

The main reasons for nonparticipation were treatment choice or lack of interest. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of all cancer patients offered a clinical trial do participate. These findings upend several conventional beliefs about cancer clinical trial participation, including that Black patients are less likely to agree to participate and that patient decision-making is the primary barrier to participation.

We employed a multilevel meta-analytic approach (Viechtbauer, 2010) to accommodate the interdependent nature of the EBL model and interdependency of effect sizes (305 effect sizes from 144 studies, including 4,424 OCD patients). Results revealed that the EBL model predicted memory performance; that is, as EBL demand increases, those with OCD performed progressively worse on memory tasks. Executive function was the driving mechanism behind the EBL's impact on OCD memory performance, as it negated binding complexity, memory load, and visual or verbal task differences. Comparisons of subtask effect sizes were also generally in accord with the cognitive parameters of the EBL taxonomy.

All virus strains produced a cytopathic effect (CPE) with cell-to-cell fusion in B16, DBT, IC-21 and J774A.1 cells. The CPE was induced most rapidly in IC-21 cells and was visible microscopically in all cell lines tested. In contrast, the coronaviruses produced little CPE in A3-1M and CMT-93 cells. Although most virus-infected cells, except KQ3E-infected A3-1M, CMT-93 and J774A.1 cells, produced progeny viruses in the supernatants when assayed by plaque formation on DBT cells, the kinetics of viral replication were dependent on both the cell line and virus strain; replication of prototype strains was higher than that of new isolates.

DESIGN A secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial in 229 adults 65 yrs or older admitted to two skilled nursing facilities undergoing rehabilitation services was conducted. Patients were randomized to receive physical and occupational therapy by therapists trained in systematic approaches to engage patients, called Enhanced Medical Rehabilitation, or standard of care. The outcome of interest was functional improvement, defined as Barthel Index at discharge (controlling for Barthel Index upon admission). This study analyzed the relationship of measures of cognition, depression, and medical comorbidities as predictors of functional outcome and as moderators interacting with treatment group. RESULTS Clock drawing score moderated treatment effect size; the functional improvement of Enhanced Medical Rehabilitation over standard of care therapy reduced with increasing executive impairment. In contrast, general cognitive abilities, depression, medical comorbidities, and readiness for rehabilitation were neither predictors nor moderators of functional improvement. CONCLUSIONS For older adults undergoing rehabilitation, greater functional improvement with the motivational techniques of Enhanced Medical Rehabilitation was contingent on patients having intact executive function. Given that executive function impairments are common in rehabilitation populations, new strategies are needed to improve treatment outcomes in physical/occupational therapy.

However, little is known about these on patients at the intensive care unit. Although these symptoms may be common in this scenario, few studies have documented their onset, triggers and other factors associated to their presentation. The evaluation of these symptoms is a challenge for intensive care unit physicians, neurologists and otolaryngologists due to several factors as consciousness, systemic comorbidities, prolonged immobility and antibiotic therapy. The frequency of audiovestibular symptoms at the intensive care unit and the related events and factors associated to their presentation will be explored in this review.","output":"Audiovestibular Symptoms at the Intensive Care Unit: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interest in incorporating art into radiology has been growing in recent years.

HIV infection can modify the host epigenome and as such can impact disease progression, as well as the molecular processes driving non-AIDS comorbidities in PWH. Epigenetic epidemiologic studies including epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) offer a unique set of tools to expand our understanding of HIV disease and to identify novel strategies applicable to treatment and diagnosis in this patient population. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge from epigenetic epidemiologic studies of PWH, identify the main challenges of this approach, and highlight future directions for the field. Emerging epigenetic epidemiologic studies of PWH can expand our understanding of HIV infection and health outcomes, improve scientific validity through collaboration and replication, and increase the coverage of diverse populations affected by the global HIV pandemic. Through this review, we hope to highlight the potential of EWAS as a tool for HIV research and to engage more investigators to explore its application to important research questions.","output":"Epigenome-wide epidemiologic studies of human immunodeficiency virus infection, treatment, and disease progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper provides a synopsis of discussions related to the Learning Environments track of the Fourth BME Education Summit held at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio in May 2019.

In contrast to cytokine blockers, therapeutic blockade of TREM\\\\1 can blunt excessive inflammation while preserving the capacity for microbial control. However, the nature of the TREM\\\\1 ligand(s) and mechanisms of TREM\\\\1 signalling are still not yet well understood, impeding the development of clinically relevant inhibitors of TREM\\\\1. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti\\\\arthritic activity of a novel, ligand\\\\independent TREM\\\\1 inhibitory nonapeptide GF9 that was rationally designed using the signalling chain homo oligomerization (SCHOOL) model of cell signalling. Free GF9 and GF9 bound to macrophage\\\\targeted nanoparticles that mimic human high\\\\density lipoproteins (GF9\\\\HDL) were used to treat collagen\\\\induced arthritis (CIA).

In this study, the aim was to investigate the underlying competing endogenous RNA network mechanism of asthma, especially T2 asthma, as well as to find more diagnostic biomarkers and effective therapeutic targets. Methods: Multiple sets of T2 asthma airway biopsy transcription profiles were collected, which involved long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), mRNA, and microRNA (miRNA). DIANA-LncBase, targetscan, mirwalk, and miRDB databases were employed to predict interactions between lncRNAs, miRNAs and target mRNAs. To identify mRNAs correlated with T2 asthma, differential expression and network analyses were conducted through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Subsequently, the expressions of potential biomarkers were examined through qRT-PCR analysis in the T2 asthma coreinteracting cellular factor (IL-13/IL-33) induced experimental model. Lastly, the ceRNA network was confirmed by plasmid transfection and RNAi experiments in a 16HBE cell line. Results: 30 lncRNAs, 22 miRNAs and 202 mRNAs were differentially expressed in airway biopsies from T2 asthma patients. As indicated by the ROC analysis, the lncRNA, PCAT19, had high diagnostic accuracy (AUC >0.9) in distinguishing T2 asthma patients from non-T2 asthma patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, a competing ceRNA network was established, consisting of 13 lncRNAs, 12 miRNAs, as well as eight mRNAs. The reliability of this network was verified by testing several representative interactions in the network. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this study has been the first to establish an lncRNA-mediated ceRNA regulatory network for studying T2 asthma. The findings of this study may elucidate the pathogenesis and help find potential therapeutic targets for T2 asthma. In T2 asthma, PCAT19-dominated ceRNA regulation networks may play a critical role, and PCAT19 may serve as a potential immune-related biomarker for asthma and other respiratory diseases correlated with eosinophilic inflammation.","output":"Construction of lncRNA-Mediated Competing Endogenous RNA Networks Correlated With T2 Asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since COVID-19 outbreak, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) studies as surveillance system is becoming an emerging interest due to its functional advantage as a tool for early warning signal and to catalyze effective disease management strategies based on the community diagnosis. An attempt was made in this study to define and establish a methodological approach for conducting WBE studies in the framework of identifying/selection of surveillance sites, standardizing sampling policy, designing sampling protocols to improve sensitivity, adopting safety protocol, and interpreting the data. Data from hourly sampling indicated a peak in the viral RNA during the morning hours (6C9 am) when the all the domestic activities are maximum. The daily sampling and processing revealed the dynamic nature of infection spread among the population. The two sampling methods viz. grab, and composite showed a good correlation. Overall, this study establishes a structured protocol for performing WBE studies that could provide useful insights on the spread of the pandemic at a given point of time. Moreover, this framework could be extrapolated to monitor several other clinically relevant diseases.

The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue and lower respiratory tract infection signs. Almost all populations are susceptible to the virus, and the basic reproduction number (R(0)) is 2.8C3.9. The fight against COVID-19 should have two aspects: one is the treatment of infected patients, and the other is the mobilization of the society to avoid the spread of the virus. The treatment of patients includes supportive treatment, antiviral treatment, and oxygen therapy. For patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and circulatory support are recommended. Plasma therapy and traditional Chinese medicine have also achieved good outcomes. This review is intended to summarize the research on this new coronavirus, to analyze the similarities and differences between COVID-19 and previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and to provide guidance regarding new methods of prevention, diagnosis and clinical treatment based on autodock simulations. METHODS: This review compares the multifaceted characteristics of the three coronaviruses including COVID-19, SARS and MERS. Our researchers take the COVID-19, SARS, and MERS as key words and search literatures in the Pubmed database. We compare them horizontally and vertically which respectively means concluding the individual characteristics of each coronavirus and comparing the similarities and differences between the three coronaviruses. RESULTS: We searched for studies on each outbreak and their solutions and found that the main biological differences among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are in ORF1a and the sequence of gene spike coding protein-S. We also found that the types and severity of clinical symptoms vary, which means that the diagnosis and nursing measures also require differentiation. In addition to the common route of transmission including airborne transmission, these three viruses have their own unique routes of transmission such as fecal-oral route of transmission COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In evolutionary history, these three coronaviruses have some similar biological features as well as some different mutational characteristics. Their receptors and routes of transmission are not all the same, which makes them different in clinical features and treatments. We discovered through the autodock simulations that Met124 plays a key role in the efficiency of drugs targeting ACE2, such as remdesivir, chloroquine, ciclesonide and niclosamide, and may be a potential target in COVID-19.","output":"Biological, clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19, SARS and MERS and AutoDock simulation of ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, the established paradigm of the three Rs of animal research-refinement, replacement, and reduction-has come under scrutiny.

Although HCoV is highly prevalent in the world, studies of the genomic and antigenic details of circulating HCoV strains have been limited. In this study, we compared four Japanese isolates with the standard HCoV-229E strain obtained from ATCC (ATCC-VR740) by focusing on the spike (S) protein, a major determinant of neutralizing antigen and pathogenicity. The isolates were found to have nucleotide deletions and a number of sequence differences in the S1 region of the S protein. We compared two of the Japanese isolates with the ATCC-VR740 strain by using virus-neutralizing assays consisting of infectious HCoV-229E particles and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-pseudotyped virus carrying the HCoV-229E S protein. The two clinical isolates (Sendai-H/1121/04 and Niigata/01/08) did not react with antiserum to the ATCC-VR740 strain via the neutralizing test. We then constructed a pseudotype VSV-harboured chimeric S protein with the ATCC S1 and Sendai S2 regions or that with Sendai S1 and ATCC S2 regions and compared them by a neutralization test. The results revealed that the difference in the neutralizing antigenicity depends on the S1 region. This different antigenic phenotype was also confirmed by a neutralizing test with clinically isolated human sera. These results suggest that the HCoV-229E viruses prevalent in Japan are quite different from the laboratory strain ATCC-VR740 in terms of the S sequence and neutralization antigenicity, which is attributed to the difference in the S1 region.","output":"Differences in neutralizing antigenicity between laboratory and clinical isolates of HCoV-229E isolated in Japan in 2004-2008 depend on the S1 region sequence of the spike protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have received ever-increasing attention and in-depth exploration in multifarious fields on account of their superior mass transfer ability and abundant catalytic-active sites.

The effect of the SARS-CoV-2 mutation, on the other hand, has been characterized by worrying variations that modify viral characteristics in response to the changing resistance profile of the human population. The repeated transmission of virus mutation indicates that epidemics are likely to occur. Therefore, an early identification system of ongoing mutations of SARS-CoV-2 will provide essential insights for planning and avoiding future outbreaks.

Thus, we aim to study the prevalence of food insecurity among older Indian adults and the association of food insecurity as a modifiable risk factor with late-life cognitive impairment. Method: Data for this study was utilized from the recent release of Longitudinal Ageing Study in India which was conducted 2017-18. The total sample size for the present study is 31,464 older adults aged 60 years and above. Descriptive statistics along with cross-tabulation were presented in the present study. Additionally, binary logistic regression analysis was used to fulfil the objective of the present study. Results: It was found that 7.7% of older adults in rural areas reduced their size of meals due to unavailability (urban, 3.2%), 41.2% of them did not eat enough food of their choice (urban, 38.3%), 6.9% were hungry but did not eat food (urban, 2.6%), 5.0% did not eat for whole day (urban, 2.2%), and 6.9% lost weight due to lack of food in their household (urban, 2.9%). It was found that older adults who did not have enough food of their choice had significantly higher odds of suffering from cognitive impairment in reference to their counterparts. Similarly, the older adults who were hungry but did not eat were 33% more likely to suffer from cognitive impairment in reference to their counterparts. Interaction model revealed that older adults who had food insecurity in rural areas had higher odds of cognitive impairment than older adults who had food insecurity in urban areas.

The physician can then do an online consultation and renew prescriptions on the basis of real-time data from his or her patients. We aimed to establish the feasibility and effects of SSDM in maintaining effective interactions between patients and physicians in Hubei province during the COVID-19 epidemic period. Methods Based on the SSDM database, we did a multicentre retrospective cohort study of patients with rheumatic disease in Hubei province in China. SSDM had been widely used across China since 2015. To study the influence of interruption of routine care by the COVID-19 epidemic for patients with rheumatic disease, we included patients registered with SSDM from Hubei Province. Data on patient disease activities, online consultations, and prescription refilling, as well as surveys on satisfaction about the online service were extracted from Jan 23, 2020 to Feb 27, 2020, acting as the study group, and data from the same period during 2018 and 2019 were also extracted as a control. Inclusion criteria included a confirmed diagnosis of rheumatic disease and disease duration of at least 3 months. Patients were excluded from the study if they declined participation or discontinued before completion of the survey. For patients with rheumatoid arthritis, achieving a disease activity score with 28 joints (DAS28) of less than 32 was considered to be a treat-to-target (T2T) status. For patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, a disease activity index-2000 (SLESAI-2K) score of less than 4 was the main target of the lupus low disease-activity state (LLDAS). We compared the T2T and LLDAS prevalence during the epidemic period of 2020 with that of 2018 and 2019. All statistical analyses were done with Python version 3.7.4. We used descriptive and frequency statistics (percentage) to describe baseline demographic information and clinical information. Comparison of ratio variables between two groups was done with a 2 test. Findings By Feb 27, 2020, a total of 173 560 adult patients (46 861 [27%] men and 126 699 [73%] women) with rheumatic disease from 860 hospitals across China registered and routinely used SSDM since 2015. Patients were encouraged to upload their data and do a disease activity self-assessment every 1C3 months. 10 441 (6%) of 173 560 patients (3237 [31%] with rheumatoid arthritis and 1566 [15%] with systemic lupus erythematosus) were managed by 176 rheumatologists from 42 hospitals in Hubei province. From Jan 23, 2020 to Feb 27, 2020, 69 rheumatologists from 28 hospitals provided 1451 patients with 1692 consultations and supplied 566 (39%) of them with continued medication, which included 55 commonly used therapeutic drugs for rheumatic diseases. 247 (8%) of 3237 patients with rheumatoid arthritis during the 2020 epidemic and 350 (9%) in same period during 2018 and 2019 did the DAS28 self-assessments, and T2T was 47% in 2020 compared with 50% in 2018 and 2019, (p=053). 293 (19%) of 1566 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus in 2020 and 210 (16%) in 2018 and 2019 did the SLESAI-2K self-assessments, and LLDAS was 60% in 2020 compared with 47% in 2018 and 2019 (p=003). Surveys showed that 100% of patients were satisfied with the interactions, which prevented the risk of cross-infection and discontinuation of medication. Interpretation Patients with rheumatism can maintain accessibility to good care in the era of the COVID-19 epidemic by using SSDM for consultations and medication refills. The clinical outcomes, at least for both rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, are not compromised.

However, few studies have explored the factors related to the UOA and how to predict UOA after AKAS. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a standardized peri-operative protocol for the AKAS and identify whether a correlation exists between the peri-operative surgical factors and UOA in the patients undergoing AKAS. We hypothesized that more surgical invasiveness and prolong tourniquet time increase the risk of UOA after AKAS. METHOD: A prospective cohort study was conducted between October 2017 and March 2021. All 184 patients operated on standard AKAS protocol. The UOA is defined as overnight hospitalization of a patient undergoing AKAS. Demographic and peri-operative data were recorded, and the procedure was categorized based on the surgical invasiveness based on less invasive (intra-articular soft tissue surgery) (n = 65) and more complex surgery (involving extra-articular soft tissue surgery or ligamentous reconstruction) (n = 119). The clinical risk factors for UOA were identified and analyzed with multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The incidence of UOA in the more complex group (n = 7, 14.3%) was significantly higher than in the less invasive group (n = 3, 4.6%) (p = 0.049). The peri-operative factors significantly associated with UOA were age, more complex surgery, and longer tourniquet time (p < 0.10 all). However, the multivariate analysis revealed that longer tourniquet time was the only significant predictor for UOA (OR = 1.045, 95% CI = 1.022C1.067, p = 0.0001). The optimal cut-off points of tourniquet time for predicting UOA with the highest Youden index in the less invasive and more complex groups were 56 minutes and 107 minutes, respectively. CONCLUSION: The UOA after AKAS is more common in more complex surgery compared to less invasive surgery. This study showed that unplanned admission significantly associated with many factorsas patient factors, surgical invasiveness, and tourniquet time. However, tourniquet time is the only independent predictor for UOA. Therefore, strict perioperative management protocol must be applied in AKAS, and all patients having these risk factors should be prepared for UOA.","output":"Predicting surgical factors for unplanned overnight admission in ambulatory arthroscopic surgery of the knee: a prospective cohort in one hundred and eighty four patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"About a decade ago, Dian Baker, a professor at Sacramento State School of Nursing, responded to a directive from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) asking health care practitioners to do something about the thorny and serious problem of ventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia, which afflicts thousands of people each year.

Many studies have indicated a close relationship between ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The structural basis of receptor recognition by SARS-CoV-2 has been analyzed in detail. The diversification of the ACE2 sequence due to ACE2 polymorphisms and alternative splicing has to a large extent affected the susceptibility of different species. Differential ACE2 expression makes specific populations more prone to be infected, and ACE2 also plays a role in the broad tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in human organs and tissues.

Tourism is often associated with beauty and pleasure. But behind that tourism is an economic activity that is very vulnerable to natural disasters, including volcanic eruptions. Management of tourism mapping in the Semeru Volcano disaster-prone area (Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park Tourism Strategic Area) can be used as a reference in development guidelines, disaster mitigation, and recovery in tourist areas. Thus, the purpose of this study is to produce a mapping of disaster-prone areas and the distribution of tourist attractions around Semeru Volcano. The research method used is the use of ArcGIS and Microsoft Excel applications. The data used is from the Population, Tourism, and Disaster Data of Semeru Volcano. The analysis technique uses map buffering and overlaying. Based on the results of the mapping, 57 villages are predicted to be affected and experience heavy losses. The number of villages is divided into 17 villages in Malang Regency and 40 villages in Lumajang Regency. These villages belong to several sub-districts, namely Ampelgading, Poncokusumo, Tirto Yudo, Wajak, Pasrujambe, Candipuro, Pronojiwo, Pasirian, Candipuro, Tempursari, Tempeh, Sumbersuko, and Tempursari. In addition, these disaster-prone areas are areas that have a lot of tourism potential. Most of the tourist attractions are affected by the eruption zone and affected by the lava flow. The tourism objects studied in this study amounted to 23. While the tourist objects that are classified as safe amounted to 11 objects.

Clarifying the mechanisms underlying such a \\"post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome\\" is essential for the development of preventive and early treatment methods for this syndrome. In the present paper, by integrating insights pertaining to the glymphatic system and the nasal cerebrospinal fluid outflow pathway with findings in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and COVID-19, I provide a coherent conceptual framework for understanding the pathophysiology of post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome. According to this hypothesis, this syndrome may result from damage to olfactory sensory neurons, causing reduced outflow of cerebrospinal fluid through the cribriform plate, and further leading to congestion of the glymphatic system with subsequent toxic build-up within the central nervous system. I further postulate that patients with post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome may benefit from cerebrospinal fluid drainage by restoring glymphatic transport and waste removal from the brain. Obviously, further research is required to provide further evidence for the presence of this post-viral syndrome, and to provide additional insight regarding the relative contribution of the glymphatic-lymphatic system to it. Other mechanisms may also be involved. If confirmed, the glymphatic-lymphatic system could represent a target in combating post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome.

Five group-1 HA SS probes, representing five subtypes, were chosen for this analyses. Eighty-four percent of samples analyzed had specific reactivity to at least one probe, with approximately 60% of the samples reactive to H1 probes, and up to 45% reactive to each of the non-circulating subtypes. Thirty percent of analyzed sera had cross-reactivity to at least four of five probes and this reactivity could be blocked by competing with F10 bNAb. Binding cross-reactivity in sera samples significantly correlated with frequency of H1(+)H5(+) cross-reactive B cells. Interestingly, only 33% of the cross-reactive sera neutralized both H1N1 and H5N1 pseudoviruses. Cross-reactive and neutralizing antibodies were more prevalent in individuals >50 years of age.

Classified here into 9 main families, most of the 20 approved cytokine preparations (18 different cytokines; 3 pegylated), all in recombinant human (rh) form, are grouped in the hematopoietic growth factor, interferon, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor  (TGF) families. In the hematopoietin family, approved cytokines are aldesleukin (rhIL-2), oprelvekin (rhIL-11), filgrastim and tbo-filgrastim (rhG-CSF), sargramostim (rhGM-CSF), metreleptin (rh-leptin) and the rh-erythropoietins, epoetin and darbepoietin alfa.

RESULTS 103 selected articles with complete data in 502 cases in whom 413 (82.3%) had mutations in KCNJ11 (#64) and 89 in ABCC8 (# 56). Successful transfer from insulin to SU was achieved in 91% and 86.5% patients, respectively at a mean age of 36.5 months (0-63 years). Among patients with KCNJ11 and ABCC8 mutations 64 & 46 were associated with constant success,5 & 5 to constant failure, and 10 and 4 to variable degrees of reported success rate, respectively. The glibenclamide dosage required for each genotype ranged from 0.017 to 2.8 mg / kg / day.

Daratumumab (DARA) is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD38 and is approved as monotherapy or in combination with standard of care regimens for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Administration of DARA intravenous (IV) takes approximately 7 hours for the first infusion and 3-4 hours for subsequent infusions. To reduce this burden, DARA subcutaneous (SC;DARA 1800 mg coformulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 [rHuPH20;2000 U/ml;ENHANZE? drug delivery technology, Halozyme, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA]) was developed. In the phase 3 COLUMBA trial (NCT03277105), at a median follow-up of 7.5 months, overall response and maximum trough concentration with DARA SC were noninferior to DARA IV in patients with relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM). Based on these results, DARA SC was approved by the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency. Based on an SC injection duration of 5 minutes, administration of DARA SC injections is estimated to take <2 hours (115 minutes) of HCP time during the first year of treatment. A time and motion survey was undertaken to elicit HCPs understanding of workflow and time estimates for administration of DARA IV and SC (beyond injection time alone) in patients with RRMM. Data collection was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we report the interim survey results. Methods: A web-based, prospective survey was designed to collect primary data from HCPs at sites that actively enrolled patients in the COLUMBA trial. Data were collected for DARA IV and SC regarding time spent on prespecified drug preparation and drug administration/patient care activities;for each task, the respondent's perception of average time and HCP who performs the task were captured. Patient data, including efficacy and safety information, were not collected. The primary endpoints are mean and median active HCP time for each prespecified activity. Time for each activity was adjusted by its probability of occurring (eg, management of infusion-related reactions). Median results are reported here, as these are considered a better measure of central tendency than the mean. Total median active HCP time was calculated by summing median time for all prespecified activities (drug preparation activities vs activities in the patient care area/infusion suite). A post-hoc analysis estimated patient chair time based on HCP inputs for pre-treatment activities, infusion/injection duration, and post-treatment activities. A sensitivity analysis was conducted comparing a subgroup of respondents with fully validated data with the overall study population. Results: A total of 26 respondents from 8 countries (Brazil, Israel, Japan, Greece, Poland, Sweden, Taiwan, and Ukraine) completed the survey. For DARA IV, the median total active HCP time was 294.2 minutes for the first infusion and 194.9 minutes for subsequent infusions (Figure 1). For DARA SC, the median total active HCP time was 98.7 minutes for the first injection (66.5% reduction in time vs DARA IV) and 82.2 minutes for subsequent injections (57.8% reduction in time vs DARA IV) (Figure 1). For both treatments, the proportions of time spent on drug preparation vs drug administration/patient care were roughly similar for first and subsequent administrations (Table). When extrapolated for year 1 and year 2 (23 administrations in year 1 and 13 in year 2, as per label), estimated active HCP time per patient was 76.4 and 42.2 hours, respectively, for DARA IV and 31.8 and 17.8 hours, respectively, for DARA SC. Estimated chair time for DARA IV was 445.6 minutes for the first infusion and 243.1 minutes for subsequent infusions;for DARA SC, estimated chair time for first and subsequent injections was 8.6 and 6.9 minutes, respectively (Figure 2). Results were confirmed by a sensitivity analysis using fully validated data for 13 of the 26 respondents. Conclusions: Results of this time and motion survey indica e that DARA SC is associated with less active HCP time spent on drug preparation and drug administration/patient care compared with DARA IV. This reduced treatment burden may translate into advantages for patients (less time away from home, family, and/or work) and efficiencies for HCPs and healthcare facilities (ability to treat a greater number of patients).

Using quantum dots (QDs) in the absorber region of the SESAMs instead of quantum wells, enables additional degrees of freedom in the design, the control of saturation parameters and the recovery dynamics. However, if one wants to integrate such a SESAM element into semiconductor surface emitting lasers such as a mode-locked integrated external-cavity surface-emitting laser (MIXSEL), the saturable absorber layers have to withstand a longer high-temperature growth procedure for the epitaxial formation of distributed Bragg reflectors (DBR). Typically defect related SESAMs will be annealed at those growth temperatures and lose their high-speed performance. Here we present a systematic study on the growth parameters and post-growth annealing of SESAMs based on high-quality InxGa1-xAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) grown by MBE at growth temperatures of 450 C or higher. The good quality enables the QDs to survive the long DBR overgrowth at 600 C with only minimal shifts in the designed operation wavelength of 1030 nm required for growth of MIXSEL devices. The introduction of recombination centers with p-type modulation doping and additional post-growth annealing improves the absorption of the high-quality QDs. Hence, low saturation fluences < 10 J/cm2 and a reduction of the &#964;1/e recovery time to values < 2 ps can be achieved.","output":"Temperature resistant fast InxGa1-xAs / GaAs quantum dot saturable absorber for the epitaxial integration into semiconductor surface emitting lasers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM Endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography (ERCP) is a technique in which endoscope and radiological imaging are used in combination in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases related to the pancreaticobiliary system. Our aim in this study is to discuss all aspects of approach strategies to ERCP patients whose operation is mandatory during the pandemic period, to draw the future perspective and to summarize the measures that the surgical team should take in terms of their own health and public health. MATERIALS AND METHODS During the pandemic period between 14 March and 31 December 2020, we accepted 270 patients to our ERCP unit. We made our analysis regarding the management of these cases under COVID-19 pandemic conditions. We presented our patients' form of application, application complaints, COVID- 19 contact stories, pre-procedure preparations, and our prevention methods to prevent COVID-19 transmission of the patient and healthcare team during the procedure, and post-procedure patient follow-up methods, and the management of our COVID-19 positive patients before the procedure. RESULTS ERCP was applied to 270 patients. The COVID-19 test of 13 patients was positive before the procedure and they were taken to our COVID-19 isolated service. There was no problem in the anesthesia of patients who had positive COVID-19 PCR test and subsequently underwent ERCP. There was no difference in the discharge time after the ERCP procedure. CONCLUSION COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the management and safety of ERCP units. ERCP procedures should be performed by determining the urgency of patients so that their treatment needs are not delayed. Postponing cases without planning can develop an increased workload in centers offering ERCP and this situation can lead to further delays or negative consequences.","output":"Management of Our Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio Pancreatography Cases During the Pandemic Process."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that has affected >188 countries, involved >24 million people, and caused >840,000 deaths.

The increasing consumption of these materials has raised a new alert about marine plastic pollution: if, on the one hand, the use of masks and gloves is essential to prevent contamination by the new coronavirus, on the other, it has a direct impact on human health, since that plastic waste, when it reaches the oceans, becomes part of the food chain, and releases its toxins into living organisms, including humans. The damage resulting from these residues inserted in the environment can also be reflected in the world economy as it affects all ecosystem services to some extent, with a reduction in its provision.

Methods Study design was to international requirements including European Pharmacopoeia, Ph. Eur., v9.0 04/2013:0450, 2013. I-2 Working Seed (WS) was compared with five-times-passaged I-2 WS (5XP WS) in intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI), F o cleavage site sequencing and Safety tests. Results The first passage series used a 50% brain: 50% tracheal tissue challenge homogenate and was unsuccessful as I-2 was not detected after the fourth passage. A second passage series used 10% brain: 90% tracheal tissue homogenates. I-2 was isolated from tracheal tissue in each passage. However harvested titres were below the minimum challenge level (10 7 EID 50) specified for the ICPI and Safety tests, possibly reflecting I-2's inherently low pathogenicity (interestingly caecal tonsils yielded significant titres). Given this the WS and 5XP WS comparisons proceeded. ICPI values were 0.104 and 0.073 for the WS group and the 5XP WS group respectively confirming that I-2, whether passaged or not, expressed low pathogenicity. F 0 amino-acid sequences for both WS and 5XP WS were identified as 112R-K-Q-G-R--L-I-G 119 and so compatible with those of avirulent ND viruses. In safety, no abnormal clinical signs were observed in both groups except for two chicks in the 5XP WS group, where one bird was withdrawn due to a vent prolapse, and another bird died with inconclusive necropsy results. Conclusions: These data, the issue of low passage titres with little or no virus isolation from brain tissues and the genomic copy approach suggest a need to amend Ph.

It is an incredibly useful approach, but like all data-driven approaches, it raises privacy-related serious ethical and legal concerns when data is about peoples' information. Is it possible to accurately analyze data for outliers while protecting the privacy of people whose data we analyze? In this dissertation, we explicate methods to answer this question for the most practically relevant case, where outliers are defined in a data-dependent way and current privacy methods such as differential privacy fail to achieve practically meaningful utility.To define what it means to protect privacy in outlier analysis, we conceptualize sensitive privacy - it not only admits efficient algorithmic constructions but is also amenable to analysis. We introduce novel constructions to develop sensitively private mechanisms to accurately identify outliers, and to compile low-accuracy differentially private mechanisms into high-accuracy sensitively private mechanisms. Furthermore, to address the lack of a principled approach to private outlier analysis, we provide a framework to help a data analyst identify the right problem-specification and a practical solution for her application.Finally, we develop mechanisms - which guarantee privacy and practically meaningful utility - to identify (beta,r)-anomalies as well as covid-19 hotspots (an outlying event). An extensive empirical evaluation of these private mechanisms over a range of real-world datasets and use cases overwhelmingly supports the effectiveness of our approach.

Such enrichment designs typically consist of two or three stages, where the first stage serves as a screening process for selecting a specific subpopulation. METHODS: We propose a Bayesian design for randomized clinical trials with a binary outcome that focuses on restricting the inclusion to a subset of patients who are likely to benefit the most from the treatment during trial accrual. Several Bayesian measures of efficacy and treatment-by-subset interactions were used to dictate the enrichment, either based on Gail and Simons or Millens criteria. A simulation study was used to assess the performance of our design. The method is exemplified in a real randomized clinical trial conducted in patients with respiratory failure that failed to show any benefit of high flow oxygen supply compared with standard oxygen. RESULTS: The use of the enrichment rules allowed the detection of the existence of a treatment-by-subset interaction more rapidly compared with Gail and Simons criteria, with decreasing proportions of enrollment in the whole sample, and the proportions of enrichment lower, in the presence of interaction based on Millens criteria. In the real dataset, this may have allowed the detection of the potential interest of high flow oxygen in patients with a SOFA neurological score  1. CONCLUSION: Enrichment designs that handle the uncertainty in treatment efficacy by focusing on the target population offer a promising balance for trial efficiency and ease of interpretation.

Summary Dispensation is intended for patients who are unable to move, mainly because of their health condition, age or special geographical location. Unlike a simple home delivery service, dispensation at home involves direct contact between the pharmacy team and the patient, allowing both the collection of information and advice (counselling) for the proper use of the health products. Community pharmacists have responded to the need for continuity of care during the periods of containment by providing home delivery services. The objective of this survey is to describe these home delivery practices C simple delivery and dispensation at home C provided during the period of the first containment of Covid-19. The survey was conducted between May 20th and June 15th, 2020 among French community pharmacists, owners or employees, by convenience and reasoned sampling. A total of 803 respondents participated in the survey, 90.0% being owners. A total of 74.1% of these participants (n=595) declared having offered a home delivery service during the period of the first containment. This service was initiated during the pandemic period for 50.6% of them and mainly involved the pharmacy team itself: only 2.3% of the respondents said they relied exclusively on a service provider. Among these participants, 48.9% declared having encountered difficulties in collecting patient information, delivering and providing the information and advice for the proper use of health products. The practices of home delivery carried out by the respondents is more similar to the principle of dispensation at home than to a simple home delivery. Accessing the patient's home enriches the pharmaceutical analysis and offers an opportunity for new pharmacy services. This is why, in order to respond to the difficulties encountered and support the development of this activity, the SFPC Special Interest Group for Community Pharmacy analysed the process of dispensation at home and published guidelines.","output":"Le portage  domicile : de la livraison  la dispensation  domicile C Recommandations de bonnes pratiques et perspectives pour le pharmacien dofficine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: A rapidly evolving evidence suggests that smell dysfunction is a common symptom in COVID-19 infection with paucity of data on its duration and recovery rate. OBJECTIVES: Delineate the different patterns of olfactory disorders recovery in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This cross-sectional cohort study included 96 patients with olfactory complaint confirmed to be COVID-19 positive with recent onset of anosmia. All patients were inquired for smell recovery patterns using self-assessment questionnaires. RESULTS: Ninety six patients completed the study with mean age 34.26  11.91 years. Most patients had sudden anosmia 83%. Loss of smell was accompanied by nonspecific inflammatory symptoms as low-grade fever (17%) and generalized body ache (25%). Nasal symptoms were reported by 33% of patients. Some patients reported comorbidities as D.M (16%), hypertension (8%) or associated allergic rhinitis (25%), different patterns of olfactory recovery showed 32 patients experiencing full recovery (33.3%) while, 40 patients showed partial recovery (41.7%) after a mean of 11 days while 24 patients (25%) showed no recovery within one month from onset of anosmia. CONCLUSION: The sudden olfactory dysfunction is a common symptom in patients with COVID-19. Hyposmia patients recover more rapidly than anosmic ones while the middle age group carried the best prognosis in olfactory recovery.

Using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), children and parents were separately questioned about QOL of patients. RESULTS The mean patients' age was 8.6  3.2 years (SD), with range of 5-16 years. The children responded that all PedsQL scores were significantly improved by surgery, and the highest improvement was observed in the school subscale score. When the parents rated the children's QOL, significant improvements were limited to 3 out of 7 subscales, including the emotional, psychosocial health summary, and total scores. The improvements in the PedsQL score were not correlated with age, size of deviation changes following surgery, nor the improvement in binocular vision. CONCLUSIONS The general health-related QOL significantly improved by surgery in pediatric patients with IXT, while the improvement was considerably underestimated by the parents.

The mental health consequences of a pandemic may be related to the sequelae of the disease itself or to the preventive measures aimed at containing the spread of infections.

RESULTS: Up to June 30th 2020, 15,111 patients from 150 hospitals were included. Their median age was 69.4 years (range: 18-102 years) and 57.2% were male. Prevalences of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus were 50.9%, 39.7%, and 19.4%, respectively. The most frequent symptoms were fever (84.2%) and cough (73.5%). High values of ferritin (73.5%), lactate dehydrogenase (73.9%), and D-dimer (63.8%), as well as lymphopenia (52.8%), were frequent. The most used antiviral drugs were hydroxychloroquine (85.6%) and lopinavir/ritonavir (61.4%); 33.1% developed respiratory distress. Overall mortality rate was 21.0%, with a marked increase with age (50-59 years: 4.7%, 60-69 years: 10.5%, 70-79 years: 26.9%, &#8805;80 years: 46.0%). CONCLUSIONS: The SEMI-COVID-19 Network provides data on the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Spain. Patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Spain are mostly severe cases, as one in three patients developed respiratory distress and one in five patients died. These findings confirm a close relationship between advanced age and mortality.","output":"Caractersticas clnicas de los pacientes hospitalizados con COVID-19 en Espa?a: resultados del Registro SEMI-COVID-19./ Caractersticas clnicas de los pacientes hospitalizados con COVID-19 en Espa?a: resultados del Registro SEMI-COVID-19./ Clinical characteristics of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Spain: Results from the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine diarrhea disease in newborn and suckling piglets due to infection with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a leading cause of economic loss in the pig industry globally. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the host innate immune response to PEDV infection. The expression dynamics of antiviral genes (e.g., RIG-1, PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-, IFN-, TNF-, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12) in porcine small intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells were analyzed following PEDV stimulation. The results showed that the expression of antiviral genes (e.g., PKR, OAS1, and Mx2) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN- and TNF-) were significantly reduced within 0C4 h post-infection (P < 0.05). However, all antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines were up-regulated from 12 to 24 h (P < 0.05), and cytopathic changes were observed during this time. The expression of RIG-1, PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2 were significantly and positively correlated to each other during the entire infection (P < 0.01). The results suggested that the RIG-1, PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2 genes may play an important role in PEDV infection in piglets. Initially, PEDV displayed cellular invasion by inhibiting IFN- transcription and interfering with the antiviral function of PKR, OAS1, and Mx2, ultimately induced an intense inflammatory response. The relationship between antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines with PEDV infection at the cellular level provides a reference for studying the mechanism of resistance to PEDV infection in piglets.","output":"Expression Pattern Analysis of Antiviral Genes and Inflammatory Cytokines in PEDV-Infected Porcine Intestinal Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The antiviral properties of zeolite (sodium aluminosilicate) powders amended with metal ions were assessed using human coronavirus 229E, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and feline calicivirus F-9.

In addition, overburdening of health system led to an increase in mortality due to the scarcity of adequate medical care, at the same time confinement measures could have contributed to the decrease in mortality from certain causes. Our aim is to compare the number of deaths observed in 2020 with the projection for the same period obtained from a sequence of previous years. Thus, this computed mortality excess could be considered as the real impact of the COVID-19 on the mortality rates. METHODS: The population was split into four age groups, namely: (< 50; 50C64; 65C74; 75 and over). For each one, a projection of the death numbers for the year 2020, based on the interval 2008C2020, was estimated using a Bayesian spatio-temporal model. In each one, spatial, sex, and year effects were included. In addition, a specific effect of the year 2020 was added (\\"outbreak\\"). Finally, the excess deaths in year 2020 were estimated as the count of observed deaths minus those projected. RESULTS: The projected death number for 2020 was 426,970 people, the actual count being 499,104; thus, the total excess of deaths was 72,134. However, this increase was very unequally distributed over the Spanish regions. CONCLUSION: Bayesian spatio-temporal models have proved to be a useful tool for estimating the impact of COVID-19 on mortality in Spain in 2020, making it possible to assess how the disease has affected different age groups accounting for effects of sex, spatial variation between regions and time trend over the last few years.","output":"A Bayesian spatio-temporal analysis of mortality rates in Spain: application to the COVID-19 2020 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The pressures on clinical time is a well-recognised obstacle to medical teaching in a busy department.1 The current novel Corona virus (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged this even further by placing unprecedented demands on our time and ability to deliver face to face teaching.2 There is evidence demonstrating that teaching delivered in short units is well received by learners.3 4 Objectives To develop a new, quality-assured framework of teaching consisting of 15-minute virtual teaching sessions (Bitesize). They would be suitable for and accessible to all staff in a busy tertiary neonatal unit. Methods In the first phase, teaching sessions were delivered twice weekly with a focus on establishing routine and demonstrating how to deliver the teaching. After a period of 4 weeks, a survey was sent to participants. The sessions were then continued over a 6-month period with modifications incorporating feedback from the first survey. At the end of the 6-month period, another survey was sent to the participants for their feedback on Bitesize teaching. The sessions were open to all staff and was accessible on a virtual platform. Once completed, recorded sessions were uploaded to an online education platform. Results The initial survey was sent to 30 participants and 10 responded (33%). As illustrated in table 1 below, there was a strong positive response to the sessions. In order to promote inclusivity and make the sessions relevant to everyone, the sessions were delivered by various members of the team in the NICU including the c-onsultants, trainees and the extended multidisciplinary team as demonstrated in table 2 below. The response was positive even after 6 months. When asked what they liked about Bitesize, 78% (n=11) highlighted the brevity of the sessions. Participants were asked if they would like Bitesize to continue (if staying in the NICU) or to be initiated in their new department (if rotating) and 100% (n=14) said that they would. Conclusions Bitesize teaching is a valuable technique for delivering concise and relevant teaching in a busy department. The brevity promotes inclusivity of different team members and encourages the virtual participation fostered in the current pandemic climate.","output":"Bitesize teaching: Learning-but make it snappy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This document is intended to provide guiding principles for healthcare and non-healthcare administrators of correctional and detention facilities (including but not limited to federal and state prisons, local jails, and detention centers), law enforcement agencies that have custodial authority for detained populations (i e , U S Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U S Marshals Service), and their respective health departments, to assist in preparing for potential introduction, spread, and mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019, or COVID-19) in their facilities In general, the document uses terminology referring to correctional environments but can also be applied to civil and pre-trial detention settings This guidance will not necessarily address every possible custodial setting and may not use legal terminology specific to individual agencies authorities or processes The guidance may need to be adapted based on individual facilities physical space, staffing, population, operations, and other resources and conditions Facilities should contact CDC or their state, local, territorial, and/or tribal public health department if they need assistance in applying these principles or addressing topics that are not specifically covered in this guidance This guidance will not necessarily address every possible custodial setting and may not use legal terminology specific to individual agencies authorities or processes The guidance may need to be adapted based on individual facilities physical space, staffing, population, operations, and other resources and conditions Facilities should contact CDC or their state, local, territorial, and/or tribal public health department if they need assistance in applying these principles or addressing topics that are not specifically covered in this guidance Guidance Overview The guidance below includes detailed recommendations on the following topics related to COVID-19 in correctional and detention settings: check light icon Operational and communications preparations for COVID-19 check light icon Enhanced cleaning/disinfecting and hygiene practices check light icon Social distancing strategies to increase space between individuals in the facility check light icon Strategies to limit transmission from visitors check light icon Infection control, including recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) and potential alternatives during PPE shortages check light icon Verbal screening and temperature check protocols for incoming incarcerated/detained individuals, staff, and visitors check light icon Testing considerations for SARS-CoV-2 check light icon Medical isolation of individuals with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 and quarantine of close contacts, including considerations for cohorting when individual spaces are limited check light icon Healthcare evaluation for individuals with suspected COVID-19 check light icon Clinical care for individuals with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 check light icon Considerations for people who are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19","output":"Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in December 2019 in China and the epidemic is still going on at present Since children are the susceptible population, the number of cases is gradually increasing In addition to the typical respiratory symptoms, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection also has the clinical symptoms of cardiovascular system damage Based on a literature review, this article discusses the possible cardiovascular system damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 in children and related mechanisms, in order to provide help for the timely treatment and prevention of cardiovascular system damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 in children","output":"[Research advances in cardiovascular system damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 in children]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Current guidelines recommend video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for recurrent primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) and for cases with persistent air leak after chest tube treatment.

Forty-eight patients underwent primary VATS, while the second group received chest tube (CT) treatment only. Length of hospital stay (LOS), duration of chest tube, prolonged air leak, postoperative complications, recurrences and treatment costs were analyzed. RESULTS Prolonged air leaks were evident in 12.5% and 22.9% patients of the VATS and CT group, respectively. Ten (20.8%) patients in the CT group underwent VATS for persistent air leakage. During follow-up, the VATS group recurred at 8.3% compared to 52.1% in the CT group. The total cost of treatment per patient, including treatment cost due to recurrence, was EUR 1.501 in the VATS group and EUR 2.233 in the CT group.

However, detailed reports on immunizations and preventive antimalarial prophylactic treatments delivered and how the trends changed in referral centers in low-income countries are still missing. Methods We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study. Data for vaccinations administered to children <5 years of age, according to the local vaccination schedule, were extracted from the official records of the Kent Community Health Post, Sierra Leone, in the period between April 2019 and March 2021. We compared the vaccinations performed in the first year, considered as a pre-Covid period, with the second year, post-Covid period. Both the period was then divided in four trimester each and the same analysis was operated for each trimester. A Chi-square goodness of fit test was performed to compare the number of vaccinations performed both in the 2 years and in the 8 trimesters. Findings Seven thousand two hundred and eighty-three vaccinations were administered: 4,641 in the period between April 2019 and March 2020 and 2,642 between April 2020 and March 2021. The drop in immunizations performed began as soon as the first cases were described in China. The drops were statistically significant when the first three trimesters of the two study periods were compared, while no statistically significant differences were observed for all the vaccines performed in the 4th trimesters. Vaccines administered at birth (BCG) were less affected compared to booster vaccinations. Conclusions Immunizations administered in a referral health center in Sierra Leone significantly declined during the pandemic. Although the decline was less pronounced in the last months of the pandemic, we don't think that the small increase would indicate the recovery of previously missed vaccinations. These findings open new public health challenges for the coming years.","output":"Changes in Childhood Immunizations and Intermittent Preventive Malaria Treatment in a Peripheral, Referral Immunization Center During the First 12 Months of COVID-19 Pandemic in Sierra Leone, Western Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the turbulent and stressful work environment of prehospital emergencies, the conflict among emergency medical technicians (EMT) and other health-care providers is inevitable.

Our results indicated that post-vaccine myocarditis and pericarditis were associated most frequently with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines followed by live or live-attenuated non-COVID-19 vaccines such as smallpox and anthrax vaccines. The frequencies of cardiac adverse events were affected by vaccine, vaccine type, vaccine dose, sex, and age of the vaccinated individuals. Systems biology results suggested a central role of interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) in the biological processes leading to cardiac adverse events, by impacting MAPK and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. We suggest that increasing the time interval between vaccine doses minimizes the risks of developing inflammatory adverse reactions.

Particulate matter changes were smaller due to the existence of other natural sources. During the lockdown the ozone patterns were different for each studied location, depending on the VOCs-NOx ratios, with concentration changes close to those expected from the historical series in each site and not statistically attributable to the health crisis effects.

Policy measures on mobility included international and local travel restrictions, closure of schools and workplaces, work from home, cancellation or restriction of public gatherings, close of public transport, and stay at home orders. Sri Lanka too has embraced several policy measures restricting community mobility to curtail the outbreak. This paper analyzes the trend of stringency of Covid-19 mobility restriction policy response by the Government of Sri Lanka concerning its epidemiological trend, and with the same patterns observed in selected countries of the world. The Government Response Stringency Index (GRSI), a composite indicator developed by the Oxford Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) group consisting of nine indicators based on publicly available data was used to track the stringency of policy measures related to mobility restrictions in Sri Lanka and the selected other countries. Besides, the daily number of Covid-19 cases in the same countries was analyzed. The results show that Sri Lanka was able to achieve 100% in the GRSI at the early stages of the outbreak, and most clusters it faced were curtailed under considerable high GRSI levels. GRSI values dropped to 26.85% just before the onset of the largest ever Minuwangoda Cluster, after which it was raised to 50%. Comparing GRSI values and epidemiological pattern of Sri Lanka with three purposefully selected blocks of countries showed that its stringency to be comparatively lower than most of the countries studied, as per the end of the study period. It could be seen that the current GRSI values about the policy measures adopted by the government of Sri Lanka are suboptimal, compared to the level of risk based on the case trend that the country is exposed to, as of 30 th November 2020. These findings provide evidence towards the implementation of more stringent mobility control measures on an urgent basis, at least until the case number starts to fall.","output":"Too Tight or Too Loose?

Descriptive analysis and binary logistic regression were conducted to identify the status of the medical staffs attitude to the reform and the influencing factors. RESULTS: A total of 61.4% of medical staff satisfied with the reform and the main reason was the promotion of their practice environment and social status brought by the reform. The logistic regression model indicated that the attitude to the reform of medical staff was positively associated with 9C11 hours of daily working time (OR = 2.373, as compared with less than 8 hours), higher income (OR = 1.966), the occupation of the nurse and medical technician (OR = 2.196C1.464 as compared with the doctor) as well as negative attitude towards the effectiveness of reform (OR = 3.676).

Androgen deprivation therapy, a clinical endocrine therapy, has resulted in increases in the occurrence of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC); however, the mechanisms of CRPC have not yet fully been determined. We previously showed that spindle pole body component 25 (SPC25), a component of the NDC80 complex that is critical in kinetochore formation and chromosome segregation during the cell cycle, plays a critical role in PCa tumorigenesis and cancer stemness. However, it is not yet known whether SPC25 plays a role in CRPC; thus, we sought to address this question in the current study. Methods: SPC25 levels were detected in androgen-insensitive PCa cells using the public database and bioinformatics tools. In vitro, SPC25 levels were determined in androgen-sensitive and androgen-insensitive PCa cells treated with or without DHT. The growth of the PCa cells was assessed by the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. The invasiveness and migratory potential of the PCa cells were assessed by the transwell cell invasive assay and migratory assay, respectively. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments examined the transfection of androgen-sensitive and androgen-insensitive PCa cells by plasmids carrying small-interfering ribonucleic acids for SPC25 or SPC25, respectively. Results: SPC25 levels were significantly reduced in the androgen-insensitive PCa cells treated with DHT in the Public database. In vitro, PCa cell growth, invasion, and metastasis was reduced in androgen-insensitive PCa cells but increased in androgen-sensitive PCa cells treated with DHT, partially through DHT-regulated expression of SPC25 at transcriptional but not at translational levels. Conclusions: Androgen treatment reduces CRPC growth, invasion, and metastasis partially through its regulation of SPC25.

STUDY DESIGN: We analyse all public hospital emergency inpatient discharges in Ireland from 2010 to 2015 using the administrative Hospital In-Patient Enquiry dataset. We use changes to inpatient bed supply across hospitals over time to examine the impact of bed supply on length of stay. Linear, negative binomial, and hospitalCmonth-level fixed effects models are estimated. RESULTS: U-shaped trends are observed for both average length of stay and inpatient bed supply between 2010 and 2015. A consistently large positive relationship is found between bed supply and length of stay across all regression analyses. Between 2010 and 2012 while length of stay fell by 6.4%, our analyses estimate that approximately 42% (2.7% points) of this reduction was associated with declines in bed supply. CONCLUSION: Changes in emergency inpatient length of stay in Ireland between 2010 and 2015 were closely related to changes in bed supply during those years. The use of length of stay as an efficiency measure should be understood in the contextual basis of other health system changes. Lower length of stay may be indicative of the lack of resources or available bed supply as opposed to reduced demand for care or the shifting of care to other settings.

PATIENTS AND METHODS RASP was performed on patients with a prostate volume of >80 cm(3) with an indication for open enucleation of the prostate. Preoperatively, all patients were evaluated by uroflowmetry, prostate-specific antigen level, and postvoid residual measurement, as well as by the International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaire. All perioperative data were recorded in a prospective database. Follow-up appointments included the aforementioned measurements and were scheduled at 1 and 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS Ten RASP procedures were successfully performed by the extraperitoneal approach. Mean patient age and prostate volume were 63.1 years (range, 55-74 years) and 129.4 cm(3) (range, 90-170 cm(3)), respectively. Mean operative time was 122.5 minutes (range, 85-140 minutes) and represented the time from the first incision to the closure of the all incisions. The estimated blood loss was minimal (mean value, 230 mL). Transfusions were not necessary. Mean catheterization period was 7.4 days (range, 6-8 days). The symptomatology, as reported by the International Prostate Symptom Score, was improved at the follow-up appointments in comparison with the baseline values. One case of prolonged fever was noted postoperatively and managed by antibiotics. CONCLUSION The extraperitoneal approach for RASP proved to be efficient in the management of large prostates. The results are directly comparable with the current available experience with transperitoneal RASP. The extraperitoneal RASP seems to favorably compare with the open simple prostatectomy, while the results are at least comparable with those of conventional laparoscopic approach.","output":"Extraperitoneal approach for robotic-assisted simple prostatectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Impairment of Kv1.3 expression at the cell membrane in leukocytes and sensory neuron contributes to the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases and sensory syndromes. Molecular mechanisms underlying Kv1.3 channel trafficking to the plasma membrane remain elusive.

Notably, homologous motifs are conserved in neuronal Kv1 and Shaker channels. Biochemical analysis revealed interactions with the Sec24 subunit of the coat protein complex II. Disruption of this complex retains the channel at the endoplasmic reticulum. A molecular model of the Kv1.3-Sec24a complex suggests salt-bridges between the di-acidic E483/484 motif in Kv1.3 and the di-basic R750/752 sequence in Sec24.

Klerman published an essay in which he named the then-nascent \\"neo-Kraepelinian\\" movement and formulated a \\"credo\\" of nine propositions expressing the movement's essential claims and aspirations. Klerman's essay appeared on the eve of the triumph of neo-Kraepelinian ideas in the DSM-III. However, this diagnostic system has subsequently come under attack, opening the way for competing proposals for the future of psychiatric nosology. To better understand what is at stake, in this paper I provide a close reading and consideration of Klerman's credo in light of the past forty years of research and reflection. The credo is placed in the context of two equally seminal publications in the same year, one by S. Guze, the leading neo-Kraepelinian theorist, and the other by R. Spitzer and J. Endicott, defining mental disorder. The divergences between Spitzer and standard neo-Kraepelinianism are highlighted and argued to be much more important than is generally realized. The analysis of Klerman's credo is also argued to have implications for how to satisfactorily resolve the current nosological ferment in psychiatry. In addition to issues such as creating descriptive syndromal diagnostic criteria, overthrowing psychoanalytic dominance of psychiatry, and making psychiatry more scientific, neo-Kraepelinians were deeply concerned with the conceptual issue of the nature of mental disorder and the defense of psychiatry's medical legitimacy in response to antipsychiatric criticisms. These issues cannot be ignored, and I argue that proposals currently on offer to replace the neo-Kraepelinian system, especially popular proposals to replace it with dimensional measures, fail to adequately address them.","output":"Klerman's \\"credo\\" reconsidered: neo-Kraepelinianism, Spitzer's views, and what we can learn from the past."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The gendered implications of COVID-19, in particular in terms of gender-based violence and the gendered division of care work, have secured some prominence, and ignited discussion about prospects for a feminist recovery.

However, telephone consultations differ from face-to-face interactions: clinical examination is nearly impossible and visual signals cannot be observed. Thus, telephone consultations require specific skills training. This article describes the development, implementation and evaluation of a course, Telephone Consultation for Medical Emergencies, for 5(th) year medical students at the University of Bern, Switzerland. Methods: Following the evidence in the literature for telephone consultations, we developed guidelines for effective communication via telephone. After self-study of preparatory material, learners engaged in telephone consultations with simulated patients (SP) at the simulation center. They received multi-dimensional feedback regarding the encounter. Results: The course was successfully implemented in 2012. Evaluations showed the course to be well-received by students. In a survey, students agreed that they had learned many new skills and that they considered this learning as being important in their future employment. They felt that the SP feedback was helpful and that being observed by peer-students during the encounter or filling in a checklist while observing peer-students in other encounters added to their learning. During the debriefing of the simulation with a clinical expert, students judged the scenarios as realistic and relevant, praised the SP performances and identified that the most instructive aspect of the training was the opportunity to practice and to get feedback. Conclusion: Telephone consultations require specific skills that should be trained. The current Covid-19 pandemic and the recommendations of government institutions for patients to contact healthcare professionals primarily via telephone stress the importance of adequately training these skills. In this publication we describe a feasible and viable format for implementing this process.","output":"Telephone consultation for medical emergencies C development, implementation and evaluation of a course in identifying and handling medical emergencies via telephone for 5(th) year medical students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has been named as the cause of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) The Government of Jakarta reported 47 796 cases, 35 431 of those who got infected already recovered while 1 318 died The Jakarta government has provided a particular website as a media for delivering Covid-19 information in a fast and updated dynamically The government provides various information with features that make it easier for the public to read and understand the extent to which the Covids-19 pandemic This study adopted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) approach to qualitative research Data was analyzed by classifying topics that are relevant to the information layout Data reduction is defined as the collection process, focusing on what is appropriate to the research objectives The finding was analyzed Covid-19 pandemic in Jakarta has infected 43,709 people and killed 1,219 in Jakarta Data on patients who were cured and those who were infected are displayed on the Jakarta governments website The cure rate for Jakartas patients and national mortality data continues to increase Jakarta has contributed 34% of the cure for national data Optimization seeks to promote public access to the Jakarta Government Data displayed can detect the number of positive active patient cases","output":"Bringing Artificial Intelligent to Jakarta Monitoring Covid-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated the concentrations of air pollutants (NO, NO 2 , NO x , SO 2 , CO, O 3 , PM 10 , and PM 2.5 ) at three sites with different traffic loads (work, residential, and traffic sites) before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effects and associated potential pollution control implications of the lockdown on the quality of ambient air at three selected sites in the urban area of Riyadh City. The average concentrations of NO, NO 2 , NO x , and CO decreased during the lockdown period by 73%, 44%, 53%, and 32% at the work site, 222%, 85%, 100%, and 60% at the residential site, and 133%, 60%, 101%, and 103% at the traffic site relative to the pre-lockdown period, respectively. The average concentration of O 3 increased by 6% at the work site, whereas the concentration of SO 2 increased by 27% at the residential site and decreased by 6.5% at the work site. The changes in PM 10 and PM 2.5 varied and did not exhibit a clear pattern. The air quality index (AQI) results indicated that the contribution to undesired air quality by O 3 was 35.29% of the lockdown period at the work site while contributions to undesired air quality by PM 10 and PM 2.5 were 75.6% and 100% at the work site, 94.5% and 100% at the residential site, and 96.7% and 100% at the traffic site, respectively. The findings of this study are useful for devising effective urban pollution abatement policies. Applying control measures comparable to the lockdown measures over one week will result in a decrease of approximately 19% and 15% in CO mean concentration and 25% and 18% in NO 2 mean concentration at residential and traffic sites, respectively.

Coagulation and inflammatory parameters were compared between patients with and without coagulation-associated complications. Multivariable logistic models examined the utility of these markers in predicting coagulation-associated complications, critical illness, and death. The radiographically confirmed VTE rate was 4.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9-7.3), and the overall thrombotic complication rate was 9.5% (95% CI, 6.8-12.8).

However, the response of different regions has varied, revealing multiple deficits in the structures of regional governance. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is a region affected by chronic ongoing conflicts and serious inequalities in health and welfare provision, reflected in the absence of concerted responses to the pandemic. Its young population has meant lower comparative mortality rates, but the socio-economic spill-over effects are grave in terms of interrupted education, high unemployment, particularly in respect to vulnerable communities like refugees and migrant workers. With the current situation remaining critical, this paper reviews the impact of COVID-19 on MENA and considers the variable performance of states and institutions to the pandemic, highlighting the shortfalls, but also opportunities for collective action.

Among these patients, 67 satisfied the criteria for resection according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer. Complete ablation was obtained in 222 patients (94%). Overall, 337 RFA sessions were performed including iterative RFA for recurrence. Major complications occurred in three patients (0.9%), including one treatment-related death. After 27 +/- 20 months of mean follow-up, local or distant, or both, tumor recurrence occurred in 16, 88, and 11 patients, respectively. Twenty-nine patients underwent transplantation and were removed from the study at this point. Overall 5-year, recurrence-free, and tumor-free (including results of iterative RFA) survival rates were, respectively, 40%, 17%, and 32%. The overall 5-year survival rate was 76% for operable patients. Factors associated with overall survival were prothrombin activity (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.97, 0.96-0.98; P < 0.0001) and serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (HR = 1.02, 1.02-1.02; P < 0.0001), and factors associated with tumor recurrence were multinodular forms (HR = 2.34; 1.52-3.6; P = 0.0001) and serum AFP levels (HR = 1.015, 1.014-1.016; P = 0.015). Tumor size was associated with local recurrence but not with overall and tumor-free survival. CONCLUSION RFA is a safe and effective first-line treatment of HCC up to 5 cm in diameter, especially for patients with a single tumor, a low serum AFP level, and well-preserved liver function.","output":"Radiofrequency ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma: long-term results and prognostic factors in 235 Western patients with cirrhosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Automatic lesion segmentation on thoracic CT enables rapid quantitative analysis of lung involvement in COVID-19 infections.

Our results show that the literatures spatial scope is strongly represented by the global south as research was conducted mainly in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, places with greater incidence of vector-borne disease and with health systems, which incorporate community healthcare workers. However, there are significant spatial heterogeneities in where and how research is conducted. The topic analysis reveals that the literature predominantly considers issues of sex (e.g., pregnancy) and gender as it relates motherhood. Gendered considerations occur upon implementation of vector control policies, rather than being mainstreamed into their development and delivery. There is a need to deepen the analysis to allow for gendered aspects to be understood beyond binary sex differences and/or reproductive health.","output":"Examining the Intersection between Gender, Community Health Workers, and Vector Control Policies: A Text Mining Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper used 1526 works from the literature on disaster risk perception from 2000 to 2020 in the Web of Science core collection database as the research subject.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Tracheostomy has an essential role in managing COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure who require prolonged mechanical ventilation. However, limited data are available on how tracheostomy affects COVID-19 outcomes, and uncertainty surrounding risk of infectious transmission has led to divergent recommendations and practices. METHODS: It is a multicenter, retrospective study; data were collected on all tracheostomies performed in COVID-19 patients at 7 hospitals in 5 tertiary academic medical systems from February 1, 2020 to September 4, 2020. RESULT: Tracheotomy was performed in 118 patients with median time from intubation to tracheostomy of 22a??days (Q1-Q3: 18-25). All tracheostomies were performed employing measures to minimize aerosol generation, 78.0% by percutaneous technique, and 95.8% at bedside in negative pressure rooms. Seventy-eight (66.1%) patients were weaned from the ventilator and 18 (15.3%) patients died from causes unrelated to tracheostomy. No major procedural complications occurred. Early tracheostomy (&#8804;14a??days) was associated with decreased ventilator days; median ventilator days (Q1-Q3) among patients weaned from the ventilator in the early, middle and late groups were 21 (21-31), 34 (26.5-42), and 37 (32-41) days, respectively with P = 0.030. Compared to surgical tracheostomy, percutaneous technique was associated with faster weaning for patients weaned off the ventilator [median (Q1-Q3): 34 (29-39) vs 39 (34-51) days, P = 0.038]; decreased ventilator-associated pneumonia (58.7% vs 80.8%, P = 0.039); and among patients who were discharged, shorter intensive care unit duration [median (Q1-Q3): 33 (27-42) vs 47 (33-64) days, P = 0.009]; and shorter hospital length of stay [median (Q1-Q3): 46 (33-59) vs 59.5 (48-80) days, P = 0.001].

ARDS outcome depends on the lung injury severity within the first 24 hours of ARDS onset. We investigated whether two widely accepted cutoff values of PaO2/FIO2 and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) would identify subsets of patients with ARDS for predicting outcome and guiding therapy. DESIGN A 16-month (September 2008 to January 2010) prospective, multicenter, observational study. SETTING Seventeen multidisciplinary ICUs in Spain. PATIENTS We studied 300 consecutive, mechanically ventilated patients meeting American-European Consensus Conference criteria for ARDS (PaO2/FIO2  200 mm Hg) on PEEP greater than or equal to 5 cm H2O, and followed up until hospital discharge. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Based on threshold values for PaO2/FIO2 (150 mm Hg) and PEEP (10 cm H2O) at ARDS onset and at 24 hours, we assigned patients to four categories: group I (PaO2/FIO2  150 on PEEP < 10), group II (PaO2/FIO2  150 on PEEP  10), group III (PaO2/FIO2 < 150 on PEEP < 10), and group IV (PaO2/FIO2 < 150 on PEEP  10). The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Overall hospital mortality was 46.3%. Although at study entry, patients with PaO2/FIO2 less than 150 had a higher mortality than patients with a PaO2/FIO2 greater than or equal to 150 (p = 0.044), there was minimal variability in mortality among the four groups (p = 0.186). However, classification of patients in each group changed markedly after 24 hours of usual care. Group categorization at 24 hours provided a strong association with in-hospital mortality (p < 0.00001): group I had the lowest mortality (23.1%), whereas group IV had the highest mortality (60.3%). CONCLUSIONS The degree of lung dysfunction established by a PaO2/FIO2 of 150 mm Hg and a PEEP of 10 cm H2O demonstrated that ARDS is not a homogeneous disorder. Rather, it is a series of four subsets that should be considered for enrollment in clinical trials and for guiding therapy. A major contribution of our study is the distinction between survival after 24 hours of care versus survival at the time of ARDS onset.","output":"A clinical classification of the acute respiratory distress syndrome for predicting outcome and guiding medical therapy*."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Metric-based surgical training can be used to quantify the level and progression of neurosurgical performance to optimize and monitor training progress. Here we applied innovative metrics to a physical neurosurgery trainer to explore whether these metrics differentiate between different levels of experience across different tasks. METHODS Twenty-four participants (9 experts, 15 novices) performed four tasks (dissection, spatial adaptation, depth adaptation, and the A-B-A task) using the PsT1 training system. Four performance metrics (collision, precision, dissected area, and time) and six kinematic metrics (dispersion, path length, depth perception, velocity, acceleration, and motion smoothness) were collected. RESULTS For all tasks, the execution time (t) of the experts was significantly lower than that of novices (p<0.05). The experts performed significantly better in all but two of the other metrics, dispersion and sectional area, corresponding to the A-B-A task and dissection task, respectively, for which they showed a non-significant trend towards better performance (p = 0.052 and p = 0.076, respectively).

We sought to estimate carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions associated with travel for general surgery residency interviews in Canada, and the potential avoided emissions if interviews were restructured. METHODS: An eight-item survey was constructed to collect data on cities visited, travel modalities, and costs incurred. Applicants to the University of Ottawa General Surgery Program during the 2019/20 Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS) cycle were invited to complete the survey. Potential reductions in CO(2) emissions were modeled using a regionalized interview process with either one or two cities. RESULTS: Of a total of 56 applicants, 39 (70%) completed the survey. Applicants on average visited 10 cities with a mean total cost of $4,866 (95% CI=3,995-5,737) per applicant. Mean CO(2) emissions were 1.82 (95% CI=1.50-2.14) tonnes per applicant, and the total CO(2) emissions by applicants was estimated to be 101.9 (95% CI=84.0 C 119.8) tonnes. In models wherein interviews are regionalized to one or two cities, emissions would be 57.9 tonnes (43.2% reduction) and 84.2 tonnes (17.4% reduction), respectively. Overall, 74.4% of respondents were concerned about the environmental impact of travel and 46% would prefer to interview by videoconference. CONCLUSION: Travel for general surgery residency interviews in Canada is associated with a considerable environmental impact. These findings are likely generalizable to other residency programs.

In general, conserved quantities allow to reduce the formulation of a mechanical problem to fewer degrees of freedom, a process known as dynamical reduction. However, extant reductions are either non-general, or hide the problem's symmetry or include unexplained definitions. This paper presents a dynamical reduction that avoids these issues, and hence is general and natural. Any three-body configuration defines a triangle, and its orientation in space. Accordingly, we decompose the dynamical variables into the geometry (shape + size) and orientation of the triangle. The geometry variables are shown to describe the motion of an abstract point in a curved 3d space, subject to a potential-derived force and a magnetic-like force with a monopole charge. The orientation variables are shown to obey a dynamics analogous to the Euler equations for a rotating rigid body, only here the moments of inertia depend on the geometry variables, rather than being constant. The reduction rests on a novel symmetric solution to the center of mass constraint inspired by Lagrange's solution to the cubic. The formulation of the orientation variables is novel and rests on a little known generalization of the Euler-Lagrange equations to non-coordinate velocities. Applications to special exact solutions and to the statistical solution are described or discussed. Moreover, a generalization to the four-body problem is presented.","output":"Natural dynamical reduction of the three-body problem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by a new strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains the current global health challenge. In this paper, an epidemic model based on system of ordinary differential equations is formulated by taking into account the transmission routes from symptomatic, asymptomatic and hospitalized individuals. The model is fitted to the corresponding cumulative number of hospitalized individuals (active cases) reported by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), and parameterized using the least squares method. The basic reproduction number which measures the potential spread of COVID-19 in the population is computed using the next generation operator method. Further, Lyapunov function is constructed to investigate the stability of the model around a disease-free equilibrium point. It is shown that the model has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium if the basic reproduction number of the novel coronavirus transmission is less than one. Sensitivities of the model to changes in parameters are explored, and safe regions at certain threshold values of the parameters are derived. It is revealed further that the basic reproduction number can be brought to a value less than one in Nigeria, if the current effective transmission rate of the disease can be reduced by 50%. Otherwise, the number of active cases may get up to 2.5% of the total estimated population. In addition, two time-dependent control variables, namely preventive and management measures, are considered to mitigate the damaging effects of the disease using Pontryagin's maximum principle. The most cost-effective control measure is determined through cost-effectiveness analysis.

Methods After passing the first fit test, we prospectively enrolled healthcare workers who used N95 respirators for two hours per shift (duckbill-shaped HPR-R/HPR-S, dome-shaped Hi-Luck 350, and three-panel flat-fold respirators 9211) in settings such as bronchoscopy or respiratory specimen sampling. These procedures were repeated for up to three weeks, with the fit test performed every week. At each timing of the fit test, we used a fit-testing system for quantitatively evaluating particle leakage. Results A total of 41 participants were enrolled, including 24 doctors and 17 nurses, of whom 25 were women. The pass rate of successful reuse over three observational weeks using four fit tests was 85.4%, which was comparable among the three types of N95 respirators. Six (14.6%) participants failed the fit test, while no participants dropped out of protocol due to either N95 respirator damage or contamination.

Recent studies show that a shortening of the abstinence period could be beneficial mostly in oligoasthenoteratozoospermic (OAT) patients. OBJECTIVE retrospective study to verify the efficacy of a second semen sample after a short abstinence to treat severe OAT infertile patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS 127 couples treated between May 2014 and May 2018 were divided into two groups. Study Group 1 (75 cycles): severe OAT characteristics: count < 0.2x106 /ml no progressive motility; count  0.2x106 /ml and no total or progressive motility; 0% normal morphology; a second semen sample was requested after abstinence of two hours. Control Group 0 (52 cycles): normozoospermic or mild OAT; only one sample was requested. Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection was utilized in all cases. RESULTS all semen parameters were significantly different between Group 0 vs both samples of Group 1 (P<.001), excluding volume between Group 0 and 1st sample of Group 1 (P=.682). The comparison between 1st and 2nd samples from Group 1 showed significant differences in volume, total and progressive motility and morphology (P<.001, P<.001, P<.020) but not in total sperm count (P= .970).

METHODS A retrospective review of all patients who underwent lower eyelid retraction repair with porcine dermal matrix implantation between June 2007 and July 2013 at a tertiary care center was conducted. Patient demographics, procedure(s) performed, preoperative and postoperative marginal reflex distance, inferior scleral show, and complications were reviewed. Patients with a prior history of lower eyelid surgery were excluded. The study is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant, institutional review board approved, and adherent to the Declaration of Helsinki. RESULTS One hundred patients (160 eyelids) received porcine dermal collagen implants. Fifty-six patients had thyroid eye disease, 23 had midface descent, 10 had seventh nerve palsies, and 11 had other etiologies of retraction. The average preoperative marginal reflex distance was 7.64 mm in the OD and 7.17 mm in the OS, compared with 6.40 mm in the OD and 6.22 mm in the OS postoperatively. The average preoperative inferior scleral show was 2.04 in the OD and 1.70 in the OS compared with 0.81 mm in the OD and 0.65 mm in the OS postoperatively.

This paper describes our work designing and demonstrating infection microenvironment-activated core-shell Gd-doped Bi2S3@Cu(II) boron imidazolate framework (Bi2S3:Gd@Cu-BIF) nanoassemblies. Upon exposure to a single beam of 808-nm laser, Bi2S3:Gd@Cu-BIF nanoassemblies showed exceptional photothermal conversion (?=52.6%) and produced several cytotoxic reactive oxygen species, such as singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals, by depleting the intracellular glutathione and in-situ catalyzing the decomposition of endogenous hydrogen peroxide in the inflammatory microenvironment. The broad-spectrum antibacterial properties of nanoassemblies were confirmed to be effective against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with an inhibition rate of 99.99% in vitro. Additionally, in vivo wound-healing studies revealed that Bi2S3:Gd@Cu-BIF nanoassemblies could serve as an effective wound spray to accelerate healing following MRSA infections via photothermal/chemodynamic (PTT/CDT) synergistic therapy. The effective wound healing rate in the synergistic treatment group was 99.8%, which is higher than the 69.5% wound healing rate in the control group. Furthermore, magnetic resonance and computed tomography dual-modal imaging mediated by Bi2S3:Gd@Cu-BIF nanoassemblies also exhibits promising potential as an integrated diagnostic nanoplatform.

Notably, there is limited data regarding the influence of social determinants of health, like perceived discrimination and economic stress, which may exacerbate COVID-19 health risks. The primary goals of this study are to test the bearing of subjective experiences of discrimination, financial security, and quality of care on illness severity and lasting symptom complaints. METHODS: 1,584 recovered COVID-19 patients that experienced mild to severe forms of the disease provided information about their illness, medical history, lasting symptoms, and psychosocial information. Prevalence data isolated differences in patients infected early versus late in the pandemic. Path analyses examined hypothesized associations between discrimination, illness severity, and lasting symptoms. Post hoc logistic regressions tested social determinants hypothesized to predict neurological, cognitive, or mood symptoms. RESULTS: 70.6% of patients reported presence of one or more lasting symptoms after recovery. Neural systems were especially impacted, and 19.4% and 25.1% of patients reported mood or cognitive/memory complaints, respectively. Path models demonstrated that frequency and stress about experiences of discrimination predicted increased illness severity and increased lasting symptom count, even when adjusting for sociodemographic factors and mental/physical health comorbidities. Notably, this effect was specific to stress related to discrimination, and did not extend to general stress levels. Further, perceived but not objective socioeconomic status (SES) was associated with increased lasting symptom complaints after recovery. Finally, associations between discrimination and illness differed with individual perceptions about quality of medical care. CONCLUSIONS: Lasting symptoms after recovery from COVID-19 are highly prevalent and neural systems are significantly impacted. Importantly, psychosocial factors (perceived discrimination and perceived SES) can exacerbate individual health risk. This study provides actionable directions for improved health outcomes by establishing that sociodemographic risk and medical care influence near and long-ranging health outcomes.","output":"Social determinants of health exacerbate disparities in COVID-19 illness severity and lasting symptom complaints"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To evaluate the relationship between the waiting time for surgery, and cholesteatoma recidivism rates and major complications. The secondary aims were to identify any other prognostic factors for cholesteatoma recidivism. METHODS: A retrospective single-centre study of 312 patients who underwent cholesteatoma surgery under the care of a single-surgeon, between 2004 and 2018, was performed. Waiting times for surgery were categorised into  90 days, 91C180 days, 181C270 days and > 271 days. The outcome measures were cholesteatoma recidivism and major complications (facial nerve palsy or intracranial complications). RESULTS: The mean age was 36.1 years  21.5 with 242 adults (77.6%) and 70 children (22.4%). The mean waiting time for surgery was 126.2 days (4.1 months)  96.0 days and the overall rate of recidivism was 11.2% (35/312 patients). No instances of facial nerve palsy or intracranial complications were identified. Rates of recidivism by waiting time for surgery were: 15.3% for 118 patients who waited  90 days, 9.7% for 134 patients who waited 91C180 days, 6.7% for 30 patients who waited 181C270 days and 4.3% for 23 patients who waited > 271 days. There was no significant difference amongst the different waiting time groups for rates of recidivism (p = 0.266). CONCLUSION: Increased waiting times for cholesteatoma surgery do not appear to be associated with increased rates of recidivism or major complications. Clinical judgement will always be required for complicated disease or patients with additional risk factors. The other prognostic factors for recidivism identified in this study were age (< 15 years) and congenital cholesteatoma.

AIMS: We aimed to perform a meta\\\\analysis of randomized trials investigating the effect of colchicine in patients with COVID\\\\19. MATERIALS & METHODS: We systematically searched electronic databases and clinical trial registries (up to October 17, 2021) for eligible studies. The outcomes of interest were all\\\\cause mortality and duration of hospital stay. Meta\\\\analysis with the random\\\\effects model was used to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) of mortality and 95% confidence interval (CI). The pooled standardized mean difference of duration of hospital stay with 95% CI between colchicine users and non\\\\colchicine users was estimated using Cohen's d index. RESULTS: The meta\\\\analyses revealed no significant difference in the odds of mortality (pooled OR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.53C1.07), but a significant reduction in the duration of hospital stay with the use of colchicine (pooled standardized mean difference = ?0.59; 95% CI: ?1.06 to ?0.13). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The ability of colchicine to reduce the length of stay in hospitalized patients with COVID\\\\19 is consistent with its potential to prevent clinical deterioration via inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome.

Objective: To gain insight into the clinical profile of subjects with mild-to-moderate and severe PA, and investigate individual and collective predictive accuracy of clinical background and IgE to peanut extract and components for PA severity. Methods: Data on demographics, patient history and sensitization at extract and component level of 393 patients with probable PA (symptoms  2 h + IgE sensitization) from 12 EuroPrevall centers were analyzed. Univariable and penalized multivariable regression analyses were used to evaluate risk factors and biomarkers for severity. Results: Female sex, age at onset of PA, symptoms elicited by skin contact with peanut, family atopy, atopic dermatitis, house dust mite and latex allergy were independently associated with severe PA; birch pollen allergy with mild-to-moderate PA. The cross-validated AUC of all clinical background determinants combined (0.74) was significantly larger than the AUC of tests for sensitization to extract (0.63) or peanut components (0.54-0.64). Although larger skin prick test wheal size, and higher IgE to peanut extract, Ara h 1 and Ara h 2/6, were associated with severe PA, and higher IgE to Ara h 8 with mild-to-moderate PA, addition of these measurements of sensitization to the clinical background model did not significantly improve the AUC.

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, large numbers of patients have remained mechanically ventilated for extended periods of time. These patients are prone to acquire bacterial pathogens that persist for many weeks and have the opportunity to evolve within the pulmonary environment. However, little is known about what types of adaptations occur in these bacteria and whether these adaptations mimic those described in chronic infections. We describe a COVID-19 patient with a secondary Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection in which the causative bacterium persisted for >90 days. During the course of this infection, a hypermutator lineage of P. aeruginosa emerged and co-existed with a non-hypermutator lineage. Compared to the parental lineage, the hypermutator lineage evolved to be more extensively resistant to antibiotics, to change its type III secretion profile, and to grow more slowly. Genomic analyses of the hypermutator lineage identified numerous mutations, including in the mismatch repair gene mutL and other genes frequently mutated in individuals with cystic fibrosis. Together, these findings demonstrate that hypermutator phenotypes can emerge when clearance of P. aeruginosa fails to occur in typically acute infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and suggest that hypermutator lineages can affect patient treatments and outcomes.","output":"Emergence of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa Hypermutator Strain During the Course of Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Null.","output":"In-hospital Mortality after Liver Transplantation due to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundAs of 15 February 2021, over 20 million people in England have received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.

Therefore, this study aimed to elicit from those either undecided or more resistant to having a COVID-19 vaccine, what would make them more likely to have a vaccine when made available to them.MethodsIn October/November 2020 we delivered an online population-wide survey of COVID-19 vaccine intention in England. Sampling was stratified by gender, geographical region, and deprivation, with additional purposive sampling of those from an ethnic minority background. An open question What might make it more likely that you, your family, or friends would have a coronavirus vaccine when one is ready? was included.

The most common concerns expressed was the safety and efficacy of a vaccine, particularly potential side-effects. Participants wanted to see the evidence that supported vaccine approval as many were worried about how quickly vaccines had been developed. Distrust in the Government, specific ministers, and the pharmaceutical companies was a consideration. Some stipulated that it would take mandating for them to have a vaccine. Others wanted it to be free and easy to access. The broader implications of an immunisation programme were of interest, participants wanted to know if the vulnerable would be prioritised and protected and that restrictive conditions would be removed enabling them to engage in a greater range of social activities.ConclusionPromotional campaigns that focus on COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness, should be prioritised.

METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective analysis that included 147 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a community hospital. Demographics, medical history, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, complications during the hospital course, and treatments were collected and analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to describe the probability of intubation in patients with T2D as compared with patients without T2D. The hazard ratio for intubation in the survival analysis was estimated using a bivariable Cox proportional-hazards model. RESULTS: Of 147 patients, 73 (49.7%) had a history of T2D. Patients with T2D had higher requirement of ICU admission (31.5% vs 12.2%; p=.004), higher incidence of ARDS (35.6% vs 16.2%, p=.007), higher rates of intubation (32.9% vs 12.2%, p=0.003), and higher use neuromuscular blocking agents (23.3% vs 9.5%, p=.02).

A review of lessons learned can help determine best practices for the future. The purpose of the study was to analyze the virtual interview experience and assess opportunities to improve the post-pandemic fellowship recruitment process. STUDY DESIGN: Using a 28-question survey of Program Directors (PDs) of PS fellowships as well as a 44-question survey of applicants to PS fellowships in the US and Canada, we gathered information on the recruitment process during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020). Dichotomous, multiple choice and open-ended questions about the changes in process, platforms used, format, comparison to on-site interviews and overall satisfaction were used for objective and subjective feedback. RESULTS: A 95% participation rate was recorded for the PD survey. 24 out of 55 programs (44%) changed their on-site interviews to virtual format due to the pandemic. Most PDs described their overall impression of virtual interviews as satisfactory (66%, 16/24) and did not have an impact on the applicant's success in the match (35/54; 65%). About 50% of PDs preferred to have on-site interviews with virtual screening in the future. While the participation rate from applicants was much less (26 of 70), responses confirmed our survey results. Majority preferred on-site interviews (17/26), 6 of which preferred virtual screening followed by on-site interviews.

The second wave spreading worldwide has devastating consequences in every sector of life. Several measures to contain and curb its infection have forged significant challenges for the education community. With an estimated 1.6 billion learners, the closure of schools and other educational institutions has impacted more than 90% of students worldwide from the elementary to tertiary level. Methods: In a view to studying impacts on students fraternity, this article aims at addressing alternative ways of educatingmore specifically, online educationthrough the analysis of Google trends for the past year. The study analyzed the platforms of online teaching and learning systems that have been enabling remote learning, thereby limiting the impact on the education system. Thorough text analysis is performed on an existing dataset from Kaggle to retrieve insight on the clustering of words that are more often looked at during this pandemic to find the general patterns of their occurrence. Findings: The results show that the coronavirus patients are the most trending patterns in word search clustering, with the education system being at the control and preventive measures to bring equilibrium in the system of education. There has been significant growth in online platforms in the last year. Existing assets of educational establishments have effectively converted conventional education into new-age online education with the help of virtual classes and other key online tools in this continually fluctuating scholastic setting. The effective usage of teaching tools such as Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Google Meet, and WebEx are the most used online platforms for the conduction of classes, and whiteboard software tools and learning apps such as Vedantu, Udemy, Byjus, and Whitehat Junior have been big market players in the education system over the pandemic year, especially in India. Conclusions: The article helps to draw a holistic approach of ongoing online teaching-learning methods during the lockdown and also highlights changes that took place in the conventional education system amid the COVID pandemic to overcome the persisting disruption in academic activities and to ensure correct perception towards the online procedure as a normal course of action in the new educational system.

A novel disease of relatively unknown origin, COVID-19 does not seem to be amenable to the currently available medicines since there is no specific cure for the disease. In the absence of any vaccine or effective antiviral medication, we have no tools at our disposal, but the method of quarantine, be it domestic or institutional, to hinder any further progression of this outbreak. However, there is a record of physicians in the past who practiced convalescent blood transfusion. To their awe, the method seemed to be useful. It is anticipated that these contemporary methods will outdo any other vaccination process in the time being, as blood transfusion is instead a cost-effective and time-friendly technique. Following a successful trial, this new approach of contemporary nature to a viral disease may serve as an emergency intervention to intercept infectious outbreaks and prevent an impending epidemic/pandemic.

Families (N = 1206) that included fathers, mothers, and adolescents (48.9% females, Mage = 13.86  2.48) participated in the study. Adolescents provided a rating of PIU, and fathers and mothers reported their own parenting stress, parental expectations, and parental involvement. The results showed that paternal parenting stress and then expectations mediated the association between PIU and paternal involvement, and maternal parenting stress and then expectations mediated the association between PIU and maternal involvement, indicating a spillover effect. By contrast, the crossover effect was established only in that maternal parenting stress was negatively related to paternal expectations in middle adolescents. Moreover, maternal expectations showed the strongest association with maternal involvement in middle adolescents, whereas paternal expectations were most associated with paternal involvement in late adolescents. These findings underline the necessity of understanding parenting by assessing adolescent developmental stages and paternal and maternal parenting separately. Furthermore, the mediators of parenting stress and parental expectations can be the focus on facilitating parental involvement; the effect of maternal parenting stress on paternal expectations may suggest that intervention programs for fathers should consider more contextual factors.","output":"Adolescent problematic Internet use and parental involvement: The chain mediating effects of parenting stress and parental expectations across early, middle, and late adolescence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) effectively detects the SARS-COV-2 virus.

SARS-CoV-2 Firstly, the sensitivity and specificity as well as the predictive values of an expanded triage method were calculated. In addition, the Kappa coefficient was also determined to assess the concordance between laboratory test results and the expanded triage. RESULTS: Of a total of 733 sputum samples; 229 were RT-qPCR-positive (31.2%) and mortality rate reached 1.2%. Overall sensitivity and specificity were 86.0% (95% confidence interval: 81.0C90.0%) and 37.0% (95% confidence interval: 32.0C41.0%) respectively, with a diagnostic accuracy of 52.0% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.73.

In that regard, we analyzed 20,000 individual donation transactions made for COVID-19 campaigns on two popular fundraising platforms: GoFundMe in the United States and Kitabisa in Indonesia. We found that GoFundMe donors tended to self-identify (33.18% opted for anonymity) while Kitabisa donors tended to conceal their identities (73.89% opted for anonymity). Adjusting the donations to the fractions of GDPs, we further found that anonymous donors on Kitabisa donated significantly less amounts of money (M =.11, SD =.54) in contrast to their self-identified counterparts (M =.26, SD = 3.63), who donated even higher amounts of money than anonymous donors on GoFundMe (M =.16, SD =.66).

We show here that NF-B RelA/p65 is required for the tumour growth of human NSCLC cells grown in vivo as xenografts in immune-compromised mice. RNA-seq transcriptome profile analysis identified the metastasis suppressor CD82/KAI1/TSPAN27 as a canonical NF-B target. Loss of CD82 correlated with malignancy. RelA/p65 stimulates cell migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal cell transition (EMT), mediated, in part, by CD82/KAI1, through integrin-mediated signalling, thus, identifying a mechanism mediating NF-B RelA/p65 lung tumour promoting function. ABSTRACT: Background: The development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) involves the progressive accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes. These include somatic oncogenic KRAS and EGFR mutations and inactivating TP53 tumour suppressor mutations, leading to activation of canonical NF-B. However, the mechanism(s) by which canonical NF-B contributes to NSCLC is still under investigation. Methods: Human NSCLC cells were used to knock-down RelA/p65 (RelA/p65(KD)) and investigate its impact on cell growth, and its mechanism of action by employing RNA-seq analysis, qPCR, immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and functional assays. Results: RelA/p65(KD) reduced the proliferation and tumour growth of human NSCLC cells grown in vivo as xenografts in immune-compromised mice. RNA-seq analysis identified canonical NF-B targets mediating its tumour promoting function. RelA/p65(KD) resulted in the upregulation of the metastasis suppressor CD82/KAI1/TSPAN27 and downregulation of the proto-oncogene ROS1, and LGR6 involved in Wnt/-catenin signalling. Immunohistochemical and bioinformatics analysis of human NSCLC samples showed that CD82 loss correlated with malignancy. RelA/p65(KD) suppressed cell migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal cell transition (EMT), mediated, in part, by CD82/KAI1, through integrin-mediated signalling involving the mitogenic ERK, Akt1 and Rac1 proteins. Conclusions: Canonical NF-B signalling promotes NSCLC, in part, by downregulating the metastasis suppressor CD82/KAI1 which inhibits cell migration, EMT and tumour growth.","output":"Canonical NF-B Promotes Lung Epithelial Cell Tumour Growth by Downregulating the Metastasis Suppressor CD82 and Enhancing Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Cell Transition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The threat of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still looming large on humankind.

Methods: This study assesses the viability of pooled-testing with viral transport media (VTM) for COVID-19 diagnosis. For this, we designed high-dilution pools using samples with wide-ranging viral loads. The testing employs common TaqMan-based RT-PCR assay considering biological as well as technical replicates.

The results from biological and technical replicates were found to be satisfactory and reproducible for the objective. We have also discussed multiple variables that can influence the final outcome of pooled testing strategy. Conclusions: We show that pooling approach can be efficiently applied for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. We report improved pooling success compared to published studies, even with very low input volume of media, in very high pool-sizes using low-viral load samples.

A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding benefits and risks of these interventions is required. OBJECTIVES: Using a living systematic review approach, to assess whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19; and to maintain the currency of the evidence. SEARCH METHODS: To identify completed and ongoing studies, we searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, the Epistemonikos COVID-19 L*OVE Platform, and trial registries. Searches were done on 17 March 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. For safety assessments, we also included non-controlled non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) if 500 or more participants were included. We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)), as well as studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of Bias 2' tool for RCTs, and for NRSIs, the assessment criteria for observational studies, provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer. We rated the certainty of evidence, using the GRADE approach, for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, improvement and worsening of clinical status (for individuals with moderate to severe disease), development of severe clinical COVID-19 symptoms (for individuals with asymptomatic or mild disease), quality of life (including fatigue and functional independence), grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 studies (12 RCTs, 1 NRSI) with 48,509 participants, of whom 41,880 received convalescent plasma. We did not identify any completed studies evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. We identified a further 100 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin, and 33 studies reporting as being completed or terminated. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease Eleven RCTs and one NRSI investigated the use of convalescent plasma for 48,349 participants with moderate to severe disease. Nine RCTs compared convalescent plasma to placebo treatment or standard care alone, and two compared convalescent plasma to standard plasma (results not included in abstract). Effectiveness of convalescent plasma We included data on nine RCTs (12,875 participants) to assess the effectiveness of convalescent plasma compared to placebo or standard care alone. Convalescent plasma does not reduce all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.05; 7 RCTs, 12,646 participants; high-certainty evidence). It has little to no impact on clinical improvement for all participants when assessed by liberation from respiratory support (RR not estimable; 8 RCTs, 12,682 participants; high-certainty evidence). It has little to no impact on the chance of being weaned or liberated from invasive mechanical ventilation for the subgroup of participants requiring invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.93; 2 RCTs, 630 participants; low-certainty evidence). It does not reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.08; 4 RCTs, 11,765 participants; high-certainty evidence). We did not identify any subgroup differences. We did not identify any studies reporting quality of life, and therefore, do not know whether convalescent plasma has any impact on quality of life. One RCT assessed resolution of fatigue on day 7, but we are very uncertain about the effect (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.42; 309 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Safety of convalescent plasma We included results from eight RCTs, and one NRSI, to assess the safety of convalescent plasma. Some of the RCTs reported on safety data only for the convalescent plasma group. We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma increases or reduces the risk of grade 3 and 4 adverse events (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.41; 4 RCTs, 905 participants; low-certainty evidence), and serious adverse events (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.90; 2 RCTs, 414 participants; low-certainty evidence). A summary of reported events of the NRSI (reporting safety data for 20,000 of 35,322 transfused participants), and four RCTs reporting safety data only for transfused participants (6125 participants) are included in the full text. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and asymptomatic or mild disease We identified one RCT reporting on 160 participants, comparing convalescent plasma to placebo treatment (saline). Effectiveness of convalescent plasma We are very uncertain about the effect of convalescent plasma on all-cause mortality (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.65; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of convalescent plasma on developing severe clinical COVID-19 symptoms (RR not estimable; low-certainty evidence). We identified no study reporting quality of life. Safety of convalescent plasma We do not know whether convalescent plasma is associated with a higher risk of grade 3 or 4 adverse events (very low-certainty evidence), or serious adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). This is a living systematic review. We search weekly for new evidence and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We have high certainty in the evidence that convalescent plasma for the treatment of individuals with moderate to severe disease does not reduce mortality and has little to no impact on measures of clinical improvement. We are uncertain about the adverse effects of convalescent plasma. While major efforts to conduct research on COVID-19 are being made, heterogeneous reporting of outcomes is still problematic.

Patients with hip fractures, due to their age and comorbidity, were high-risk patients in this pandemic. The purpose of this study was to observe how the pandemic affected the management of hip fractures in elderly patients. METHODS: This is a descriptive, retrospective study of all patients over the age of 65 diagnosed with a hip fracture that came to the emergency room of Vall d'Hebron University Hospital in the COVID-19 pandemic period, from the 11th of March to the 24th of April 2020. They were followed up during their hospital stay and 30 days after the fracture. RESULTS: A total of 63 patients were included, 18 (28.6%) of whom had a positive RT-qPCR for COVID-19. Four could not be operated on due to the severity of the disease they presented with upon admission, dying a few days afterwards. Three of these patients had COVID-19. The 83.3% of the patients with positive RT-qPCR presented respiratory symptoms during their hospitalization. The length of hospital stays of patients with a positive RT-qPCR (18.258.99 days) was longer than that of patients that were RT-qPCR negative (10.94.52 days) (P=.01). In-hospital mortality in operated patients was 20% in patients with a positive RT-qPCR, compared with 2.3% in the group of patients who tested negative (P=.018). Mortality at 30 days was 40% in the group with positive RT-qPCR vs 6.8% in patients not infected by SARS-CoV-2 (P=.002).

Our aims were to use epidemiological data from the UK together with estimates of vaccine efficacy to predict the possible long-term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 under the planned vaccine rollout. METHODS: In this study, we used a mathematical model structured by age and UK region, fitted to a range of epidemiological data in the UK, which incorporated the planned rollout of a two-dose vaccination programme (doses 12 weeks apart, protection onset 14 days after vaccination). We assumed default vaccine uptake of 95% in those aged 80 years and older, 85% in those aged 50C79 years, and 75% in those aged 18C49 years, and then varied uptake optimistically and pessimistically. Vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease was assumed to be 88% on the basis of Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines being administered in the UK, and protection against infection was varied from 0% to 85%. We considered the combined interaction of the UK vaccination programme with multiple potential future relaxations (or removals) of NPIs, to predict the reproduction number (R) and pattern of daily deaths and hospital admissions due to COVID-19 from January, 2021, to January, 2024. FINDINGS: We estimate that vaccination alone is insufficient to contain the outbreak. In the absence of NPIs, even with our most optimistic assumption that the vaccine will prevent 85% of infections, we estimate R to be 158 (95% credible intervals [CI] 136C184) once all eligible adults have been offered both doses of the vaccine. Under the default uptake scenario, removal of all NPIs once the vaccination programme is complete is predicted to lead to 21 400 deaths (95% CI 1400C55 100) due to COVID-19 for a vaccine that prevents 85% of infections, although this number increases to 96 700 deaths (51 800C173 200) if the vaccine only prevents 60% of infections. Although vaccination substantially reduces total deaths, it only provides partial protection for the individual; we estimate that, for the default uptake scenario and 60% protection against infection, 483% (95% CI 481C485) and 160% (157C163) of deaths will be in individuals who have received one or two doses of the vaccine, respectively. INTERPRETATION: For all vaccination scenarios we investigated, our predictions highlight the risks associated with early or rapid relaxation of NPIs. Although novel vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 offer a potential exit strategy for the pandemic, success is highly contingent on the precise vaccine properties and population uptake, both of which need to be carefully monitored.

The first emergency phases involved a wide closure of such areas to support \\"social distancing\\" measures (i.e. travels limitation;lockdown of (over)crowd-prone activities). In the second phase, individual's risk-mitigation strategies (facial masks) could be properly linked to \\"social distancing\\" to ensure re-opening touristic cities to visitors. Simulation tools could support the effectiveness evaluation of risk-mitigation measures to look for an economic and social optimum for activities restarting. This work modifies an existing Agent-Based Model to estimate the virus spreading in touristic areas, including tourists and residents' behaviours, movement and virus effects on them according to a probabilistic approach. Consolidated proximity-based and exposure-time-based contagion spreading rules are included according to international health organizations and previous calibration through experimental data. Effects of tourists' capacity (as \\"social distancing\\"-based measure) and other strategies (i.e. facial mask implementation) are evaluated depending on virus-related conditions (i.e. initial infector percentages). An idealized scenario representing a significant case study has been analysed to demonstrate the tool capabilities and compare the effectiveness of those solutions. Results show that \\"social distancing\\" seems to be more effective at the highest infectors' rates, although represents an extreme measure with important economic effects. This measure loses its full effectiveness (on the community) as the infectors' rate decreases and individuals' protection measures become predominant (facial masks).

However, according to estimates in different countries, agriculture has suffered less than other sectors such as construction, industry and tourism, so agricultural development can be a good option to compensate for the economic damage caused to other sectors. The quality of available water and soil resources for agricultural development is not only limited, but is also decreasing incrementally, so the use of saline and unconventional soil and water resources is inevitable. Biosaline agriculture or haloculture is a system in which highly saline water and soil resources are used sustainably for the economic production of agricultural crops. It seems that in the current situation of the world (with COVID-19's impact on agriculture on the one hand and the quantitative and qualitative decline of freshwater and soil on the other), haloculture with a re-reading of territorial capabilities has good potential to provide a part of human food supply. In this review article, the potential of haloculture to offset the adverse impacts of the pandemic is analyzed from five perspectives: increasing the area under cultivation, using unconventional water, stabilizing dust centers, increasing the body's immune resistance, and reducing losses in agribusiness due to the coronavirus.

We hypothesized that aptitude may directly affect one's ability to successfully complete the learning curve for minimally invasive procedures. The aim was to assess whether aptitude has an impact on ability to achieve proficiency in completing a simulated minimally invasive surgical procedure. The index procedure chosen was a laparoscopic appendectomy. STUDY DESIGN Two groups of medical students with disparate aptitude were selected. Aptitude (visual-spatial, depth perception, and psychomotor ability) was measured by previously validated tests. Indicators of technical proficiency for laparoscopic appendectomy were established by trained surgeons with an individual case volume of more than 150. All subjects were tested consecutively on the ProMIS III (Haptica) until they reached predefined proficiency in this procedure. Simulator metrics, critical error scores, and Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) scores were recorded. RESULTS The mean numbers of attempts to achieve proficiency in performing a laparoscopic appendectomy for group A (high aptitude) and B (low aptitude) were 6 (range 4 to 7) and 14 (range 10 to 18), respectively (p < 0.0001). Significant differences were found between the 2 groups for path length (p = 0.014), error score (p = 0.021), and OSATS score (p < 0.0001) at the initial attempt.

OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) of residents in Western Jamaica regarding control of mosquito vectors and protection from mosquito bites. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between May and August 2010 among patients or family members of patients waiting to be seen at hospitals in Western Jamaica. Participants completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire on sociodemographic factors and KAPs regarding vector-borne diseases. KAP scores were calculated and categorized as high or low based on number of correct/positive responses. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of KAP and linear regression analysis conducted to determine if knowledge and attitude scores predicted practice scores. RESULTS: Three-hundred and sixty-one people (85 males and 276 females) participated in the study. Most participants (87%) scored low on knowledge and practice items (78%). Conversely, 78% scored high on attitudes items. By multivariate logistic regression, housewives were 82% less likely to have high attitude scores than laborers, and homeowners were 65% less likely to have high attitude scores than renters.

After the exponential phase, dynamic complexities like societal responses muddy the practical interpretation of many estimated parameters. The computer program ARRP, already available from sequence alignment applications, automatically estimated the end of the exponential phase in COVID-19 and extracted the exponential growth rate r for 160 countries. By positing a gamma-distributed generation time, the exponential growth method then yielded R(0) estimates for COVID-19 in 160 countries. The use of ARRP ensured that the R(0) estimates were largely freed from any dependency outside the exponential phase. The Prem matrices quantify rates of effective contact for infectious disease. Without using any age-stratified COVID-19 data, but under strong assumptions about the homogeneity of susceptibility, infectiousness, etc., across different age-groups, the Prem contact matrices also yielded theoretical R(0) estimates for COVID-19 in 152 countries, generally in quantitative conflict with the R(0) estimates derived from the exponential growth method. An exploratory analysis manipulating only the Prem contact matrices reduced the conflict, suggesting that age-groups under 20 years did not promote the initial exponential growth of COVID-19 as much as other age-groups. The analysis therefore supports tentatively and tardily, but independently of age-stratified COVID-19 data, the low priority given to vaccinating younger age groups. It also supports the judicious reopening of schools. The exploratory analysis also supports the possibility of suspecting differences in epidemic spread among different age-groups, even before substantial amounts of age-stratified data become available.","output":"A comprehensive estimation of country-level basic reproduction numbers R(0) for COVID-19: Regime regression can automatically estimate the end of the exponential phase in epidemic data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Total Worker Health(?)

In addition, epidemic information can help to suppress the epidemic diffusion only when individuals abilities of transforming awareness into actual protective behaviors attain a threshold. In communities dominated by highly literate individuals, a larger information literacy gap can improve awareness acquisition and thus help to suppress the epidemic among the whole group. By contrast, in communities dominated by low information-literate individuals, a smaller information literacy gap can better prevent the epidemic diffusion.

Although MICS should be routinely evaluated to reduce the hospitalization and mortality rate of ESRD patients, the inconvenience of the MIS might limit its use. Cerebral complications in ESRD, possibly induced by MICS, were previously assessed by using spectral electroencephalography (EEG) via the delta/theta ratio and microstate analysis. Correspondingly, EEG could be used to directly assess MICS in ESRD patients, but the relationships among MICS and these EEG features remain inconclusive. Thus, we aimed to investigate the delta/theta ratio and microstates in ESRD patients with high and low risks of MICS. We also attempted to identify the correlation among the MIS, delta/theta ratio, and microstate parameters, which might clarify their relationships. To achieve these objectives, a total of forty-six ESRD subjects were willingly recruited. We collected their blood samples, MIS, and EEGs after receiving written informed consent. Sixteen women and seven men were allocated to low risk group (MIS  5, age 57.57  14.88 years). Additionally, high risk group contains 15 women and 8 men (MIS > 5, age 59.13  11.77 years). Here, we discovered that delta/theta ratio (p < 0.041) and most microstate parameters (p < 0.001) were significantly different between subject groups. We also found that the delta/theta ratio was not correlated with MIS but was strongly with the average microstate duration ( = 0.708, p < 0.001); hence, we suggested that the average microstate duration might serve as an alternative encephalopathy biomarker. Coincidentally, we noticed positive correlations for most parameters of microstates A and B (0.54    0.68, p < 0.001) and stronger negative correlations for all microstate C parameters (?0.75    ?0.61, p < 0.001).

This study aims at investigating whether the COVID-19 lockdown had different consequences on the adherence to an exercise program specifically designed for women with postmenopausal osteoporosis when administered as individual home training (IHT) or gym group training (GGT). At the start of the lockdown, which imposed the temporary closure of any gym activities, GGT participants were invited to continue to exercise at home. IHT participants continued to exercise at home as usual. Adherence was recorded via logs and measured as the percentage of exercise sessions actually performed out of the total number of scheduled sessions in three 1-month periods: one before (PRE) and two after (M1 and M2) the beginning of lockdown. Before lockdown, IHT (66.8%  26.6) and GGT (76.3%  26.6) adherence were similar. During lockdown, IHT participation increased (M1: 81.5%  31.0; M2: 88.0%  28.3), while that of GGT showed no statistical differences (M1: 79.4%  34.2; M2: 80.6%  36.4).

Lung ultrasound was performed in ten zones of the patients' chest walls. The features of the ultrasound images were observed, and a lung ultrasound score (LUS) was recorded. The ultrasound features and scores were compared between the refractory group (PaO2/FiO2 &#8804; 100 mm Hg or on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) and the non-refractory group. The prediction value of the LUS was studied by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. In total, 7 patients were enrolled in the refractory group and 28 in the non-refractory group. B-line patterns and shred signs were the most common signs in all patients. Patients in the refractory group had significantly more ground-glass signs (median 6 [interquartile range {IQR}, 2.5-6.5] vs. median 0 [IQR, 0-3]), consolidation signs (median 1 [IQR, 1-1.5] vs. median 0 [IQR, 0-3]) and pleural effusions (median 5 [IQR, 1.5-6] vs. median 0 [IQR, 0-0.25]). The LUS was significantly higher in the refractory group (33.00 [IQR 27.50-34.00] vs. 25.50 [IQR 22.75-30.00]). The ROC of the LUS showed a cutoff score of 32 with a specificity of 0.893 and a sensitivity of 0.571 in diagnosing refractory respiratory failure among patients.

Methods: An unblinded cluster-randomized clinical trial was conducted at the Dongxihu FangCang hospital. Two cabins were randomly allocated to a CM or control group, with 204 mild COVID-19 participants in each cabin. All participants received conventional treatment over a 7 day period, while the ones in CM group were additionally given Huashibaidu granule 10 g twice daily. Participants were followed up to their clinical endpoint. The primary outcome was worsening symptoms before the clinical endpoint. The secondary outcomes were cure and discharge before the clinical endpoint and alleviation of composite symptoms after the 7 days of treatment. Results: All 408 participants were followed up to their clinical endpoint and included in statistical analysis. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups (P > 0.05). The number of worsening patients in the CM group was 5 (2.5%), and that in the control group was 16 (7.8%) with a significant difference between groups (P = 0.014).

Sub-Saharan Africa regions are the most affected regions and accounted for 67% of HIV infections worldwide, and 72% of the worlds AIDS-related deaths. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of HIV and identify factors associated with it among women of reproductive age in Ethiopia. METHODS: This study was conducted based on the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Surveys data. The data were weighted using sampling weight for probability sampling and non-response to restore the representativeness of the data and get valid statistical estimates. Then, a total of 14,161 weighted sample women were used to investigate the study. Finally, a multilevel analysis was done based on the Bayesian approach to identify factors associated with HIV among women of reproductive age in Ethiopia. RESULTS: This study showed the prevalence of HIV among reproductive age group women was 0.85%. Being rural resident (adjusted odds ratio = 0.20; 95% CrI = 0.1C0.4), secondary education level (adjusted odds ratio = 0.20; 95% CrI = 0.1C0.4), rich wealth status (adjusted odds ratio = 4; 95% CrI = 3C6), married women but living separately (adjusted odds ratio = 2.3; 95% CrI = 1.2C4.5), long distance from the health facility (adjusted odds ratio = 0.4; 95% CrI = 0.3C0.5), and exposure to media (adjusted odds ratio = 2.9; 95% CrI = 1.8C4.7) were significantly associated with HIV. CONCLUSION: Being rural residents, women whose marital status is separated, wealthy, travel a long distance to get health facility, and are exposed to media are risky to be infected by HIV.

Currently, scientific evidence regarding the attitudes of the Romanian public towards ticks is scanty. This study aimed to identify how the lockdown enforced by the COVID-19 pandemic in Romania impacted the recreational behaviour, risk perceptions, and protective practices of the Romanian population regarding ticks. METHODS: A cross-sectional, nationwide web-based questionnaire was designed and distributed via social media to evaluate if, and how, the COVID-19 lockdown impacted the behaviour of the Romanian public concerning ticks. The survey was available online from 6 May until 15 May 2020, which marked the last day of the travel ban in Romania. The collected data were processed by applying both uni- and multivariate methods. RESULTS: Respondents reported a higher frequency of finding ticks on themselves and their dogs during the lockdown. Bathing/showering and checking the body for ticks were the two most used protective behaviours both before and during the lockdown. Nevertheless, an overall lower usage rate of protective measures was registered during the lockdown. Almost all dog owners used a form of ectoparasite control for their dogs, and only three stopped due to lockdown-associated reasons. Respondent characteristics that were found to be positively associated with risk perceptions were being female and living in peri-urban/suburban/rural environments. CONCLUSIONS: Despite spending less time outdoors during the lockdown, more respondents reported finding ticks on themselves or their dogs. Changes in the preferences for recreational locations, rates of protective practices usage, amount of time spent in specific areas, or tick seasonal activity might have contributed to this outcome. Concerning risk groups, men of all ages, senior citizens, and rural inhabitants should be targeted by the relevant Romanian authorities when promoting local or nationwide tick awareness campaigns.

This ORF consists of sequences derived from ORF1a, ORF1b, and the nucleocapsid gene.

To determine whether translation of the ORF per se is required or whether the encoded polypeptide or a specific sequence is involved, we analyzed sets of related DI RNAs containing different ORFs. After partial deletion of ORF1b and nucleocapsid gene sequences, disruption of the remaining ORF is still lethal; translation of the entire ORF is not essential, however. When a large fragment of the MHV-A59 spike gene, which is not present in any of the MHV-A59 DI RNAs identified so far, was inserted in-frame into a MIDI derivative, translation across this sequence was vital to DI RNA survival. Thus, the translated sequence is irrelevant, indicating that translation per se plays a crucial role in DI virus propagation. Next, it was examined during which step of the viral life cycle translation plays its role. Since the requirement for translation also exists in DI RNA-transfected and MHV-infected cells, it follows that either the synthesis or degradation of DI RNAs is affected by translation.","output":"Translation but not the encoded sequence is essential for the efficient propagation of the defective interfering RNAs of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Lung Pathology TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia is a multisystem disease which results in AV Malformations and telangiectasia. It has autosomal dominant inheritance and prevalence of 1 in 5000 to 1 in 10,000. 1 Patients with Pulmonary AVMs can present with hypoxia, more post exercise and in sedentary position with improvement on standing. Patients presenting with hypoxia with history of HHT should undergo thorough evaluation including radiological imaging and echocardiography to rule out recurrence of AVMs and sequelae such as pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary arterial hypertension, respectively. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of 66 y/o male with Past medical history of HHT with AVM s/p repair presented with complaints of dyspnea with cough and sputum production. In ER patient was hypoxic with SPO2 88% on room air. Patient had coarse rhonchi, scattered wheeze and telangiectasia on the nose and hands. Routine labs were normal. Legionella antigen, SARS antigen, COVID PCR were negative. Chest x-ray revealed peri hilar and basilar reticular opacities. CT of chest with contrast revealed prior right lower lobe AVM repair with almost complete resolution and signs of severe COPD with emphysema. Transthoracic echocardiogram ruled out pulmonary artery hypertension. Patient was treated for COPD exacerbation with albuterol/ ipratropium nebulization, steroids, oxygen support and azithromycin. DISCUSSION: HHT is a familial genetic disease with autosomal dominant mutations of endoglin gene on chromosome 9q33-q34 or ALK-1 gene on chromosome 12q13.2 50% of all HHT patients develop pulmonary AV malformations. Clinical finding includes hypoxic respiratory failure. Pulmonary AVMs lead to right to left shunt formation impairing effective gas exchange leading to hypoxia, interestingly these patients can participate in high intensity physical activity despite of being severely hypoxic, this has been attributed to hemodynamic compensatory responses. 3 This shunt can lead to paradoxical emboli causing strokes and brain abscess. Management of Pulmonary AVMs includes trans catheter coil vaso-occlusion of the artery. Recanalization of treated pulmonary AVMs and development or growth of untreated pulmonary AVMs has been known, warranting long term follow up. Pulmonary AVMs itself is a life threating condition, its course can be further complicated by chronic lung disease like COPD. These patients can present with dyspnea not explained by right to left shunting, it is attributed more to underlying lung conditions, in our patient's case, COPD. CONCLUSIONS: While HHT is not known to cause COPD, it can lead to worsening of COPD by causing Pulmonary hypertension due to high output cardiac failure or pulmonary artery hypertension. Therefore, in patients with history of HHT presenting with hypoxia, it is crucial to have detailed evaluation for recurrence of AV malformations or new onset pulmonary hypertension.

KD patients were compared to those diagnosed before the epidemic. RESULTS: KD: 8 patients (6/8 boys, all negative for SARS-CoV-2); complete presentation in 5/8; 7/8 IVIG-responders; 3/8 showed transient coronary lesions (CALs).

The Spetzler-Martin grade was I in 3 AVMs (14.3%), II in four (19.0%), III in eleven (52.4%), and IV in three (14.3%). The complete AVM occlusion rate was calculated from 6-month follow-up DSA images. Occurrence of hemorrhage and infarction after embolization was evaluated using CT and MR imaging within 1 month after the operation. The mRS was used to assess the functional outcomes. RESULTS Complete AVM nidus obliteration was shown in 16 (84%) of 19 patients with technically feasible AVMs immediately after embolization. One (5%) patient with a small residual nidus after treatment showed complete obliteration at 13-month follow-up. There were 5 hemorrhages and 1 infarction; 4 patients' symptoms improved gradually. The percentage of cases with mRS  2 rose from 57.1% (12/21) before embolization to 66.7% (14/21) at 1-month follow-up. Both the morbidity and mortality rates were 4.8% (1/21). CONCLUSIONS Transvenous embolization can be performed only in highly selected hemorrhagic brain AVMs with high complete obliteration rates, improved functional outcomes, and acceptable morbidity and mortality rates, but it should not be considered as a first-line treatment.","output":"Safety and Efficacy of Transvenous Embolization of Ruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations as a Last Resort: A Prospective Single-Arm Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The classical interferon (IFN)-dependent antiviral response to viral infection involves the regulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), one being the gene encoding cellular endoribonuclease RNase L, which arrests protein synthesis and induces apoptosis by nonspecifically cleaving rRNA.

A possible link between all type of vaccination and immunological diseases is perhaps one of the hottest topics in literature; correspondingly, there is growing concern over the small but growing number of case reports linking COVID-19 vaccines with the development of glomerular disease. Our group conducted a systematic review of such cases. Results showed that IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and Minimal Change Disease (MCD) are the most frequently associated glomerulopathies. Interestingly, IgAN cases are mostly flares occurring few hours after the second dose of RNA vaccines and have a good clinical outcome, while both de novo and recurring MCD can occur up to 28 days after the first or second dose of vaccines. RNA vaccines are the most common vaccine type to be associated with glomerulopathy. Of course, this may simply reflect the more widespread use of these vaccines. However, compared to traditional vaccines, they do seem produce a higher antibody response and a stronger CD8+ T- and CD4+ T-cell response, including higher production of chemokines and cytokines.","output":"[A possible relationship between anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and glomerular diseases: food for thought for the nephrologist]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has reinforced the importance of facial protection against droplet transmission of diseases. Healthcare workers wear personal protection equipment (PPE), including face shields and masks. Plastic face shields may have advantages over regular medical masks. Although many designs of face shields exist, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the efficacy of shield designs against droplet transmissions. There is even less published evidence comparing various face shields. Due to the urgency of the pandemic and the health and safety of healthcare workers, we aimed to study the efficacy of various face shields against droplet transmission. METHODS: We simulated droplet transmission via coughing using a heavy-duty chemical spray bottle filled with fluorescein. A standard-adult sized mannequin head was used. The mannequin head wore various face shields and was positioned to face the spray bottle at either a 0, 45, or 90 angle. The spray bottle was positioned at and sprayed from 30 centimeters (cm), 60 cm, or 90 cm away from the head. These steps were repeated for all face shields used. Control was a mannequin that wore no PPE. A basic mask was also tested. We collected data for particle count, total area of particle distribution, average particle size, and percentage area covered by particles. We analyzed percent covered by particles using a repeated measures mixed-model regression with Tukey-Kramer pairwise comparison. RESULTS: We used least square means to estimate the percentage area covered by particles. Wearing PPE regardless of the design reduced particle transmission to the mannequin compared to the control. The LCG mask had the lowest square means of 0.06 of all face-shield designs analyzed. Tukey-Kramer pairwise comparison showed that all PPEs had a decrease in particle contamination compared to the control. LCG shield was found to have the least contamination compared to all other masks (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Results suggest the importance of wearing a protective covering against droplet transmission. The LCG shield was found to decrease facial contamination by droplets the most of any tested protective equipment.","output":"Efficacy of Various Facial Protective Equipment for Infection Control in a Healthcare Setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several diagnostic tools have been developed for clinical and epidemiological assays. RT-PCR and antigen detection tests are more useful for diagnosis of acute disease, while antibody tests allow the estimation of exposure in the population. Currently, there is an urgent need for the development of diagnostic tests for COVID-19 that can be used for large-scale epidemiological sampling. Through a comprehensive strategy, potential 16 mer antigenic peptides suited for antibody-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis were identified. A systematic scan of the three structural proteins (S,N and M) and the non-structural proteins (ORFs) present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus was conducted through the combination of immunoinformatic methods, peptide SPOT synthesis and an immunoassay with cellulose-bound peptides (Pepscan). The Pepscan filter paper sheets with synthetic peptides were tested against pools of sera of COVID-19 patients. Antibody recognition showed a strong signal for peptides corresponding to the S, N and M proteins of SARS-CoV-2 virus, but not for the ORFs proteins. The peptides exhibiting higher signal intensity were found in the C-terminal region of the N protein. Several peptides of this region showed strong recognition with all three immunoglobulins in the pools of sera. The differential reactivity observed between the different immunoglobulin isotypes (IgA, IgM and IgG) within different regions of the S and N proteins, can be advantageous for ensuring accurate diagnosis of all infected patients, with different times of exposure to infection.

Genetic modification and post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins offer alternative strategies for designing and creating multimeric and polymeric proteins. Multimeric proteins are commonly prepared by genetic modification, whereas polymeric proteins are usually created through PTMs. There are two methods that can be applied to create polymeric proteins: self-assembly and crosslinking. Self-assembly offers a spontaneous reaction without a catalyst, while the crosslinking reaction offers some catalyst options, such as chemicals and enzymes. In addition, enzymes are excellent catalysts because they provide site-specificity, rapid reaction, mild reaction conditions, and activity and functionality maintenance of protein polymers. However, only a few enzymes are applicable for the preparation of protein polymers. Most of the other enzymes are effective only for protein conjugation or labeling. Here, we review novel and applicable strategies for the preparation of multimeric proteins through genetic modification and self-assembly. We then describe the formation of protein polymers through site-selective crosslinking reactions catalyzed by enzymes, crosslinking reactions of non-natural amino acids, and protein-peptide (SpyCatcher/SpyTag) interactions.

Knowledge and practice of ethnobotany help to investigate the pharmacological basis of culturally important species of medical value. Traditional knowledge (TK) exists in local indigenous communities and has been passed down over generations as part of community identity. This research attempts to study the plant diversity of medical importance and traditional knowledge interpretation in the Himalayas. This work discloses rich ethnomedicinal knowledge linked with the people residing in the remote location of Northwestern Himalaya. The study justifies the medicinal plants prospective and the inherent knowledge of the local communities. It contains the raw interpretation of 107 high-altitude plants used for disease remedies by taking advantage of the knowledge of the young and old people of the targeted area. The obtained results provide substantial guidance in designating and obtaining the plant material for potential therapeutic interest, as well as sustaining and maintaining the natural ecosystem of the area. It also shows an impetus in discovering the baseline primary data for molecules which would contribute to future drug discovery and disease management, apart from conserving the gene pool of Himalaya and elsewhere in the world. ABSTRACT: The present study was carried out to enlist the medicinal plants used by the local inhabitants of developing countries such as India, and the district of Kupwara of the Kashmir Himalaya has been targeted. Our research is one of the first study focusing on the statistical evaluation of the cross-cultural analysis between three different communities i.e., Dard, Kashmiri and Gujjar, of the study area. Sampling was carried out in eight villages in 2017 to 2020, and data were collected from 102 informants based on walking transects, to collect plant specimens, and semi-structured interviews. The medical usages of all collected taxa were grouped into 15 disease categories and 81 biomedical ailments. In this study, we documented around 107 plant taxa belonging to 52 families from the local inhabitants of the Kashmir Himalaya, which regulate the livelihood of the people and support cultural ecosystem services. Asteraceae, Rosaceae, Lamiaceae, Malvaceae, Ranunculaceae, Poaceae, Solanaceae, Polygonaceae, Plantaginaceae and Brassicaceae are the top most dominant families. Herbaceous groups of plants were more common than trees and shrubs, and 71.96% of herb taxa were employed as medicine. Liliaceae, Caprifoliaceae and Portulacaceae (FUV = 0.24 each) have the highest family use value (FUV). The most prominent family was Asteraceae (seven genera, nine taxa), followed by Rosaceae and Lamiaceae (six genera, six taxa each). Persicaria Mill., Rheum L., Aconitum L. and Artemisia L. were prominent genera. Valeriana jatamansi Jones ex Roxb. (47UR), Fritillaria cirrhosa D. Don (45UR), Arisaema jacquemontii Blume (37UR), Asparagus racemosus Willd. (36UR) and Rumex acetosa L. (35UR) were the most important plant taxa with reference to use-reports. The ethnomedicinal applications of Aesculus indica Wall. ex Cambess., Solanum pseudocapsicum L., Ranunculus hirtellus Royle and Cormus domestica (L.) Spach plant taxa are reported here for the first time from the Himalayan Kashmiri people. We recommend further research on ethnopharmacological application of these newly recorded ethnobotanical plants. The medical usage of the plant was limited to different parts of the plant. In terms of the usage percentage, whole plant (26.17%), leaves (24.30%) and roots (19.63%) were found to have the highest utilization. The powder form (40.19%) was the most frequently employed method of drug/medicine preparation, followed by the utilization of extracted juice and/or other extracts (22.43%). The ICF values range from 0.85 to 1.00. Their use to remedy parasitic problems (PAR) and insect bites (IB) (ICF = 1.0 each) had the maximum consensus mentioned by the informants, although the number of taxa employed under this category was very limited. The different plant taxa used for the treatment of the gastrointestinal problems (GAS) was the most prominent disease category (262 URs, 16.19%, 25 taxa, ICF = 0.90). About 65% of the plant taxa studied is indigenous to the Asia or Himalayan regions, and around 35% is found to be exotic in nature. A strong positive correlation was found between age, gender, educational qualification and medicinal plant knowledge. No significant association was between people of different communities interviewed in terms of medical knowledge of the plants, p = 0.347 (>0.05) and (2) = 2.120. No significant difference was found between the number of species documented concerning gender as p = 0.347 (>0.05) and (2) =0.885. This study provides the comprehensive status of ethnomedicinal knowledge among three different communities of the study area. This study provided an impetus in discovering the baseline primary data for molecules which would help in drug discovery and management of various diseases, apart from conserving the genepool of plants in the investigated area.","output":"Ethnobotany of the Himalayas: Safeguarding Medical Practices and Traditional Uses of Kashmir Regions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unlike the lockdown measures taken in some countries or cities, the Japanese government declared a\\"State of Emergency\\"(SOE) under which people were only requested to reduce their contact with other people by at least 70 %, while some local governments also implemented their own mobility-reduction measures that had no legal basis. The effects of these measures are still unclear. Thus, in this study, we investigate changes in travel patterns in response to the COVID-19 outbreak and related policy measures in Japan using longitudinal aggregated mobile phone data. Specifically, we consider daily travel patterns as networks and analyze their structural changes by applying a framework for analyzing temporal networks used in network science. The cluster analysis with the network similarity measures across different dates showed that there are six main types of mobility patterns in the three major metropolitan areas of Japan: (I) weekends and holidays prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, (II) weekdays prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, (III) weekends and holidays before and after the SOE, (IV) weekdays before and after the SOE, (V) weekends and holidays during the SOE, and (VI) weekdays during the SOE. It was also found that travel patterns might have started to change from March 2020, when most schools were closed, and that the mobility patterns after the SOE returned to those prior to the SOE. Interestingly, we found that after the lifting of the SOE, travel patterns remained similar to those during the SOE for a few days, suggesting the possibility that self-restraint continued after the lifting of the SOE. Moreover, in the case of the Nagoya metropolitan area, we found that people voluntarily changed their travel patterns when the number of cases increased.","output":"Understanding Changes in Travel Patterns during the COVID-19 Outbreak in the Three Major Metropolitan Areas of Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The continuously growing number of COVID-19 cases pressures healthcare services worldwide.

We introduce a new modelling framework to describe the pandemics course with great accuracy and provide short-term daily forecasts for every country in the world. We show that our model generates highly accurate forecasts up to seven days ahead and use estimated model components to cluster countries based on recent events. We introduce statistical novelty in terms of modelling the autoregressive parameter as a function of time, increasing predictive power and flexibility to adapt to each country.

Disease severity and outcomes are different for these two infections: the human mortality rate for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is over 30% and less than 10%, respectively. Here, using microarray assay, we analyzed the global alterations in gene expression induced by MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infections in primary human pulmonary epithelial cells. Overall, the number of differentially expressed genes was higher in human lung cells infected with MERS-CoV than in cells with SARS-CoV-2. Out of 44,556 genes analyzed, 127 and 50 were differentially expressed in cells infected with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively (> 2-fold increase, compared to uninfected cells). Of these, only eight genes, including the one coding for CXCL8, were similarly modulated (upregulated or downregulated) by the two coronaviruses. Importantly, these results were virus-specific and not conditioned by differences in viral load, and viral growth curves were similar in human lung cells infected with both viruses. Our results suggest that these distinct gene expression profiles, detected early after infection by these two coronaviruses, may help us understand the differences in clinical outcomes of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections.","output":"Gene expression pattern differences in primary human pulmonary epithelial cells infected with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The nucleotide sequence of the peplomer (P) protein gene of Berne virus (BEV), the torovirus prototype, was determined. The gene encodes an apoprotein of 1581 amino acids with an Mr of about 178K. The open reading frame was cloned behind the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and its translation product was identified as the BEV P protein precursor by in vivo expression and immunoprecipitation. The deduced amino acid sequence contains a number of domains which are typical for type I membrane glycoproteins: an N-terminal signal sequence, a putative C-terminal transmembrane anchor, and a cytoplasmic tail. Eighteen potential N-glycosylation sites, two heptad repeat domains, and a possible trypsin-like cleavage site were identified. The mature P protein consists of two subunits and their electrophoretic mobility upon endoglycosidase F treatment strongly suggests that the predicted cleavage site is functional in vivo. The heptad repeat domains are probably involved in the generation of an intra-chain coiled-coil secondary structure; similar inter-chain interactions can play a role in P protein oligomerization. Using a sucrose gradient assay the P protein was indeed shown to form dimers. The intra- and inter-chain coiled-coil interactions may stabilize the elongated BEV peplomers.","output":"Primary structure and post-translational processing of the berne virus peplomer protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Cervical spine manipulations (CSM) have been performed for centuries and are a widely practiced intervention to manage cervical spine musculoskeletal disorders.

Methods The clinical data of 22 patients with severe COVID-19 were collected. The heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and oxygenation index (PO 2 /FiO 2 ) at 0, 6, 24 and 72 hours after treatment were compared between the HFNC oxygen therapy group and the conventional oxygen therapy (COT) group. In addition, the white blood cell (WBC) count, lymphocyte (L) count, C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were compared before and at 72 hours after oxygen therapy treatment. Results Of the included patients, 12 were assigned to the HFNC oxygen therapy group and 10 were assigned to the COT group. The differences in HR, RR, PaO 2 /FiO 2 , WBC, L, CRP and PCT at 0 hours between the two groups were not statistically significant. At 6 hours after treatment with the two oxygen therapies, HR, RR and PaO 2 /FiO 2 were better in the HFNC oxygen therapy group than in the COT group (p < 0.05), while at 24 and 72 hours after treatment with the two oxygen therapies, PaO 2 /FiO 2 was better in the HFNC oxygen therapy group than in the COT group (p < 0.05), but the differences in HR and RR were not statistically significant.

Fundamental reform is urgently needed to bring affordable health care that is accessible to all Americans. Over the last 40-plus years, our supposed system has been taken over by corporate stakeholders with the presumption that a competitive unfettered marketplace will achieve the needed goal of affordable, accessible care.

It is only the third option that can make affordable, comprehensive health care accessible for our entire population. As the debate goes forward over these alternatives during this election season, the likelihood of major change through a new system of national health insurance is becoming increasingly realistic.

Although a method foreseeing microvascular dysfunction has not been defined yet, studies conducted in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 have demonstrated the presence of endotheliitis. With this study, we aimed to investigate the microvascular circulation in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) by nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC). METHODS: Thirty-one patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 25 of whom were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 6 with MIS-C and 58 healthy peers were included in the study. NVC was performed in eight fingers with 2 images per finger and 16 images were examined for the morphology of capillaries, presence of pericapillary edema, microhemorrhage, avascular area, and neoangiogenesis. Capillary length, capillary width, apical loop, arterial and venous width, and intercapillary distance were measured from three consecutive capillaries from the ring finger of the non-dominant hand. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients showed significantly more capillary ramification (p < 0.001), capillary meandering (p = 0.04), microhemorrhage (p < 0.001), neoangiogenesis (p < 0.001), capillary tortuosity (p = 0.003). Capillary density (p = 0.002) and capillary length (p = 0.002) were significantly lower in the patient group while intercapillary distance (p = 0.01) was significantly longer compared with healthy volunteers. Morphologically, patients with MIS-C had a higher frequency of capillary ramification and neoangiogenesis compared with COVID-19 patients (p = 0.04).

Health care professionals have shown poor adherence to HH best practices, and little is known about athletic trainer (AT) HH. ATs typically work in dynamic, unpredictable environments, creating barriers to HH compliance. The purpose of this study was to understand the self reported behaviors and challenges with adherence to HH of secondary school ATs, particularly related to mitigating infection transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In this qualitative study, we conducted 11 semi-structured interviews with secondary school ATs actively engaged in direct patient care (age=31 +/- 9 years;experience=9 +/- 8 years). A 2-person data analysis team used a multi-phase inductive coding process to identify emerging domains and themes to create a codebook. Trustworthiness and credibility were established with member checking, multi-researcher analysis, and internal auditing. Results: We identified four themes: 1) best practices awareness, 2) impact of COVID-19, 3) resources, and 4) community-based prevention. Participants indicated HH training was included during on-boarding, but lacked contextual knowledge for HH in clinical practice, despite identifying ATs as health care providers. Participants expressed increased HH frequency due to the COVID-19 pandemic and concern for transmission. Participants noted an overall positive perception of access to physical resources, like hand sanitizer, sinks, and soap, as well as financial support to provide those resources. Participants noted decreased perceived risk and lack of formal policy or enforcement of HH expectations for facility users. Conclusion: ATs have general knowledge and resources but lack contextual knowledge and behaviors to employ HH best practices. The COVID-19 pandemic increased awareness, but HH by athletic training facility users remains poor.

A 29-item survey using SmartSurvey software was designed with multiple choice and Likert response scale questions. RESULTS: COVID-19 prevalence in GPs in Leicestershire was 8.1%; 70.3% of GPs were of Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) origin; 91.9% of GPs had undergone risk stratification; and 79.3% of GPs felt supported by their practice, but only 59.5% felt supported with mental health. GPs described feeling more stressed during the COVID-19 pandemic than they had been previously. CONCLUSION: This is the first study evaluating COVID-19 prevalence among GPs in Leicestershire. Despite government interventions, GPs felt less supported with their mental health compared with pre-COVID-19 times. Thus, the NHS in England should focus on GP stress and wellbeing as they work towards the restoration and recovery of primary care while battling the second wave.","output":"Recovery, restoration, and risk: a cross-sectional survey of the impact of COVID-19 on GPs in the first UK city to lock down"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most paramyxoviruses enter the cell by direct fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane. Our previous studies have shown the colocalization of Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) with the early endosome marker EEA1 and the inhibition of NDV fusion by the caveolin-phosphorylating drug phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) prompted us to propose that NDV enters the cells via endocytosis. Here we show that the virus-cell fusion and cell-cell fusion promoted by NDV-F are increased by about 30% after brief exposure to low pH in HeLa and ELL-0 cells but not in NDV receptor- deficient cell lines such as GM95 or Lec1. After a brief low-pH exposure, the percentage of NDV fusion at 29 C was similar to that at 37 C without acid-pH stimulation, meaning that acid pH would decrease the energetic barrier to enhance fusion. Furthermore, preincubation of cells with the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide led to the inhibition of about 30% of NDV infectivity, suggesting that a population of virus enters cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, the involvement of the GTPase dynamin in NDV entry is shown as its specific inhibitor, dynasore, also impaired NDV fusion and infectivity. Optimal infection of the host cells was significantly affected by drugs that inhibit endosomal acidification such as concanamycin A, monensin and chloroquine. These results support our hypothesis that entry of NDV into ELL-0 and HeLa cells occurs through the plasma membrane as well as by dynamin- low pH- and receptor- dependent endocytosis.","output":"Entry of Newcastle Disease Virus into the host cell: Role of acidic pH and endocytosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate the impact of 2020 COVID-19 rental eviction moratoria on household well-being.

Here, we show that N protein, when combined with viral RNA fragments in vitro, forms cylindrical 15-nm particles similar to the vRNP structures observed within coronavirus virions. These vRNPs form in the presence of stem-loop-containing RNA and depend on regions of N protein that promote protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions. Phosphorylation of N protein in its disordered serine/arginine (SR) region weakens these interactions and disrupts vRNP assembly. We propose that unmodified N binds stem-loop-rich regions in genomic RNA to form compact vRNP complexes within the nucleocapsid, while phosphorylated N maintains uncompacted viral RNA to promote the proteins transcriptional function.","output":"Reconstitution of the SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleosome provides insights into genomic RNA packaging and regulation by phosphorylation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rhythm abnormalities are rare during COVID-19-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).

Viruses that can be inhibited by arbidol include enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, RNA and DNA viruses, as well as pH-independent and pH-dependent ones. These differences in viral types highlight the broad spectrum of Arb antiviral activity and, therefore, it must affect a common viral critical step. Arbidol incorporates rapidly into biological membranes, and some of its antiviral effects might be related to its capacity to interact with and locate into the membrane. However, no information is available of the molecular basis of its antiviral mechanism/s. We have aimed to locate the protonated (Arp) and unprotonated (Arb) forms of arbidol in a model membrane system. Both Arb and Arp locate in between the hydrocarbon acyl chains of the phospholipids but its specific location and molecular interactions differ from each other. Whereas both Arb and Arp average location in the membrane palisade is a similar one, Arb tends to be perpendicular to the membrane surface, whereas Arp tends to be parallel to it. Furthermore, Arp, in contrast to Arb, seems to interact stronger with POPG than with POPC, implying the existence of a specific interaction between Arp, the protonated from, with negatively charged phospholipids. This data would suggest that the active molecule of arbidol in the membrane is the protonated one, i.e., the positively charged molecule. The broad antiviral activity of arbidol would be defined by the perturbation it exerts on membrane structure and therefore membrane functioning.

This systematic review investigated the pivot to online learning for nonclinical undergraduate medical education (UGME) activities and explored descriptions of educational offerings deployed, their impact, and lessons learned. METHODS The authors systematically searched four online databases and conducted a manual electronic search of MedEdPublish up to December 21, 2020. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts, performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias. A third author resolved discrepancies. Findings were reported in accordance with the STORIES (STructured apprOach to the Reporting in healthcare education of Evidence Synthesis) statement and BEME guidance. RESULTS Fifty-six articles were included. The majority (n = 41) described the rapid transition of existing offerings to online formats, whereas fewer (n = 15) described novel activities. The majority (n = 27) included a combination of synchronous and asynchronous components. Didactics (n = 40) and small groups (n = 26) were the most common instructional methods. Teachers largely integrated technology to replace and amplify rather than transform learning, though learner engagement was often interactive. Thematic analysis revealed unique challenges of online learning, as well as exemplary practices. The quality of study designs and reporting was modest, with underpinning theory at highest risk of bias. Virtually all studies (n = 54) assessed reaction/satisfaction, fewer than half (n = 23) assessed changes in attitudes, knowledge or skills, and none assessed behavioral, organizational or patient outcomes. CONCLUSIONS UGME educators successfully transitioned face-to-face instructional methods online and implemented novel solutions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although technology's potential to transform teaching is not yet fully realized, the use of synchronous and asynchronous formats encouraged virtual engagement, while offering flexible, self-directed learning. As we transition from emergency remote learning to a post-pandemic world, educators must underpin new developments with theory, report additional outcomes and provide details that support replication.","output":"Online learning developments in undergraduate medical education in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: A BEME systematic review: BEME Guide No. 69."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pernicious anemia (PA) is a chronic condition that is usually treated using B(12) injections.

The main protease, or Mpro, plays a key role in the expression and replication of viral genes and is therefore an extremely attractive target for the design of antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Numerous herbal components have been studied for their natural ability to be effective antiviral agents. Scopoletin (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) is a coumarin compound with antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor and hepatoprotective properties that has been isolated from several plant species (Scopolia japonica Maxim. - Japanese belladonna, Artemisia scoparia Waldst. & Kit. - wormwood and Viburnum prunifolium L. - black haw). The objectives of this study were to examine the interaction of scopoletin with the main protease Mpro SARS-CoV-2 and to determine its potential antiviral activity. The research covers the virtual interaction of scopoletin and main proteases Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 virus using AutoDock Vina version 1.1.2. The three-dimensional structure of the main protease Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6Y84), taken from Protein Data Bank, and the scopoletin structure taken from the PubChem chemical database, which was used in SDF form and converted using the online software Online SMILES Translator and Structure File Generator in PDB 3D form, were used for analysis. The final result of the analysis was visualized using Pymol 2.4. As positive control of binding affinity and proven therapeutic effect, we used hydroxychloroquine. Our results point out that scopoletin has a potential to bind to and inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 3Clpro main protease similarly to hydroxychloroquine that have been proven as antiviral in previous preclinical and clinical studies. After successful docking analysis it was shown that scopoletin has a binding affinity for the main protease SARS-CoV-2 at ?6.9 kcal/mol. This result indicates that scopoletin, as well as other coumarin derivatives, can potentially be used in the fight against COVID-19, but further in vitro and in vivo studies are certainly necessary. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"In Silico Analysis of Scopoletin Interaction with Potential SARS-CoV-2 Target"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic poses a huge threat internationally; however, the role of the host immune system in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is not well understood.

Results IP-10, MCP-1, MIG, IL-6, and IL-10 levels were significantly higher in acute severe/critically ill patients with COVID-19, whereas were normal in patients who had reached convalescence. CD8+ T cells in severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients expressed high levels of cytotoxic granules (granzyme B and perforin)and was hyperactivated as evidenced by the high proportions of CD38. Furthermore, the cytotoxic potential of natural killer (NK) cells, and the frequencies of myeloid dendritic cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells was reduced in patients with severe and critical COVID-19; however, these dysregulations were found to be restored in convalescent phases.

Two DI-specific RNA species, DIssA of genomic size and DIssE of subgenomic size, were detected in DI-infected cells. Purified DI particles, however, were found to contain predominantly DIssA and only a trace amount of DIssE RNA. Despite its negligible amount, the DIssE RNA in virions appears to serve as the template for the synthesis of DIssE RNA in infected cells. This conclusion was supported by two studies. First, the uv target size for DIssE RNA synthesis is significantly smaller than that for DIssA. Second, when purified DIssE RNA was transfected into cells which had been infected with a helper virus, DIssE RNA could replicate itself and became a predominant RNA species in the infected cells. Thus, DIssE RNA was not synthesized from the genomic RNA of DI particles. By studying the relationship between virus dilution and the amount of intracellular viral RNA synthesis, we have further shown that DIssE RNA synthesis requires a helper function, but it does not utilize the leader sequence of the helper virus. In contrast, DIssA synthesis appears to be helper-independent and can replicate itself.

For gregarious strepsirhines like the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta), with large vocal repertoires and several distinct affiliative vocalizations including the chirp and wail, it is important to understand behavioural usage of these vocalizations to gain insight into their social interactions. To determine whether chirp and wail vocalizations facilitate group cohesion, regulate interactions to achieve socially positive outcomes, and are correlated with differences in individual characteristics such as dominance rank and age, I collected 565 h of focal data on 31 males aged 1 year at Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, Madagascar, from March to July 2010. I found that chirp and wail vocalizations occurred at the highest rates during group-wide travel compared to other behaviours. Although nearest neighbour distance did not influence calling rate, focal animals maintained the same distance or were located closer to nearest neighbours after calling. Both chirp and wail calls were heard in behavioural contexts without agonism rather than agonistic contexts. No relationship was found between male calling rate and dominance rank or age, although the chirp showed a non-significant tendency to be produced at higher rates by younger males. Overall, my results indicated that ring-tailed lemur males of all ages and dominance ranks used both chirp and wail vocalizations as contact calls during group-wide travel events, helping individuals maintain proximity to other group members during movement. Chirp and wail vocalizations may additionally help regulate the caller's social interactions and promote increased tolerance from conspecifics. These findings add to our understanding of the breadth of communication behaviour in wild lemurs, thus furthering our knowledge of the social lives and cognitive abilities of strepsirhines.

Low functional status did not independently predict length of stay but was associated with delayed discharge (odds ratio [OR], 5.0; 95% CI, 1.2-21.3; P = .030) and complex discharge planning (OR, 5.7; 95% CI, 1.34-24.2; P = .018). CONCLUSION The VESPA can identify major head and neck surgical patients with low preoperative functional status who may be at risk for delayed or complex discharge planning. These patients may benefit from enhanced preoperative counseling and more comprehensive discharge preparation.","output":"Assessment of Preoperative Functional Status Prior to Major Head and Neck Surgery: A Pilot Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: We describe the spectrum of acute neurological disorders among hospitalized patients who recently had COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. METHOD: We performed a prospective study at 7 acute hospitals in Singapore. Hospitalized patients who were referred for neurological complaints and had COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, in the last 6 weeks were classified into central nervous system (CNS) syndromes, cerebrovascular disorders, peripheral nervous system (PNS) disorders, autonomic nervous system (ANS) disorders and immunization stress-related responses (ISRR). RESULTS: From 30 December 2020 to 20 April 2021, 1,398,074 persons (median age 59 years, 54.5% males) received COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (86.7% BNT162b2, 13.3% mRNA-1273); 915,344(65.5%) completed 2 doses. Four hundred and fifty-seven(0.03%) patients were referred for neurological complaints [median age 67(20C97) years, 281(61.5%) males; 95.8% received BNT162b2 and 4.2% mRNA-1273], classified into 73(16.0%) CNS syndromes, 286(62.6%) cerebrovascular disorders, 59(12.9%) PNS disorders, 0 ANS disorders and 39(8.5%) ISRRs. Eleven of 27 patients with cranial mononeuropathy had Bell's palsy. Of 33 patients with seizures, only 4 were unprovoked and occurred within 2 weeks of vaccination. All strokes occurred among individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors. We recorded 2 cases of cerebral venous thrombosis; none were vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia. Five had mild flares of immune-mediated diseases. CONCLUSION: Our observational study does not establish causality of the described disorders to vaccines. Though limited by the lack of baseline incidence data of several conditions, we observed no obvious signal of serious neurological morbidity associated with mRNA vaccination.

The present study analyzed the epidemic and evolutionary characteristics of haplotype subtypes or regions based on 1.8 million high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomic data. The estimated ratio of the rates of non-synonymous to synonymous changes (Ka/Ks) in North America and the United States were always more than 1.0, while the Ka/Ks in other continents and countries showed a sharp decline, then a slow increase to 1.0, and a dramatic increase over time. H1 (B.1) with the highest substitution rate has become the most dominant haplotype subtype since March 2020 and has evolved into multiple haplotype subtypes with smaller substitution rates. Many evolutionary characteristics of early SARS-CoV-2, such as H3 being the only early haplotype subtype that existed for the shortest time, the global prevalence of H1 and H1-5 (B.1.1) within a month after being detected, and many high divergent genome sequences early in February 2020, indicate the missing of early SARS-CoV-2 genomic data. SARS-CoV-2 experienced dynamic selection from December 2019 to August 2021 and has been under strong positive selection since May 2021.

We focused on methotrexate, a broadly used drug unrelated to COVID\\\\19, and (hydroxy)chloroquine, another broadly used drug implicated in COVID\\\\19 treatment. Using descriptive statistics, we compared reporting characteristics before and after the COVID\\\\19 outbreak. RESULTS: During the study period, 366 998 cases (60% female, median age: 59 years) were submitted to FAERS. The daily median number of reports (1796 in the pre\\\\pandemic, 1810 in the second pandemic time interval) and other characteristics remained stable. The daily median number of reports for methotrexate decreased from 28 in the pre\\\\pandemic to 15 in the second pandemic time interval, with no considerable differences in other characteristics.

In this report, two key performance parameters, analytical sensitivity (limit of detection) and reproducibility, of three approved rapid nucleic acid assays were assessed using heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 culture supernatants quantified by digital PCR. METHODS: The LOD (limit of detection) and reproducibility of three approved rapid nucleic acid assays using their own instruments were assessed, while the LOD and reproducibility of two assays on a 7500 Real-Time instrument were assessed at the same time. RESULTS: Using their own instruments, 100% of samples with 1150 copies/mL viral RNA could be detected by the Da An and Coyote assays, while 90% of samples could be detected by the Ustar assay; yet, for 525 copies/mL and 287.5 copies/mL viral RNA, the detection rate of the Ustar assay was higher than that of either the Da An or Coyote assays. However, the three assays did not produce statistically significant results with the three different concentrations of viral RNA (P=0.46, 0.46 and 0.46). Using a 7500 Real-Time instrument, Da An and Coyote assays did not produce statistically significant results with the 1150, 525 and 287.5 copies/mL viral RNA (P>0.99, >0.99 and >0.99).

However, this largely depends on the quality of supervision provided. There has been limited research describing what encompasses quality within GP clinical supervision, making it difficult to promote best practice. This study aimed to explore the attributes of high-quality clinical supervision for GP registrars. METHODS: In 2019C20, 22 semi-structured interviews were conducted with GP supervisors who were peer-nominated as best practice supervisors, by Regional GP Training Organisations and GP Colleges in Australia. Purposeful sampling sought respondents with diverse characteristics including gender and career stage, practice size, state/territory and rurality. Interviews were conducted by video-consultation and recorded. De-identified transcripts were independently coded using iterative, inductive thematic analyses to derive themes that reflected quality in GP supervision. RESULTS: Seven themes emerged. Participants understood the meaning of quality supervision based on their experience of being supervised when they were a registrar, and from reflecting and learning from other supervisors and their own supervision experiences. Quality was reflected by actively structuring GP placements to optimise all possible learning opportunities, building a secure and caring relationship with registrars as the basis for handling challenging situations such as registrar mistakes. Quality also encompassed sustaining and enhancing registrar learning by drawing on the input of the whole practice team who had different skills and supervision approaches. Strong learner-centred approaches were used, where supervisors adjusted support and intervention in real-time, as registrar competence emerged in different areas. Quality also involved building the registrars professional identity and capabilities for safe and independent decision-making and encouraging registrars to reflect on situations before giving quality feedback, to drive learning. CONCLUSIONS: This study, although exploratory, provides a foundation for understanding the quality of clinical supervision in general practice, from the perspective of peer-recognised GP supervisors. Understanding and adopting quality within GP supervision may be improved by GPs sharing exemplars of best practice and having opportunities for professional reflection. The findings could be used as a point of reference for devising GP supervisor curriculum, resources and professional development activities.","output":"Exploring attributes of high-quality clinical supervision in general practice through interviews with peer-recognised GP supervisors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Childhood maltreatment (CM)has been associated with adverse psychosocial outcomes during the pandemic, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear.

Most deaths are due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as a result of an excessive immune response and a cytokine storm elicited by severe SARS-CoV-2 lung infection, rather than by a direct cytopathic effect of the virus. In the most severe forms of the disease therapies should aim primarily at dampening the uncontrolled inflammatory/immune response responsible for most fatalities. Pharmacological agents - antiviral and anti-inflammatory molecules - have not been able so far to achieve compelling results for the control of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Cells derived from the placenta and/or fetal membranes, in particular amniotic epithelial cells (AEC) and decidual stromal cells (DSC), have established, well-characterized, potent anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory properties that make them attractive candidates for a cell-based therapy of COVID19 pneumonia. Placenta-derived cells are easy to procure from a perennial source and pose minimal ethical issues for their utilization. In view of the existing clinical evidence for the innocuousness and efficiency of systemic administration of DSCs or AECs in similar conditions, we advocate for the initiation of clinical trials using this strategy in the treatment of severe COVID-19 disease.","output":"Treatment of COVID-19 Pneumonia: the Case for Placenta-derived Cell Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An immunofluorescence test on smears of nasal epithelial cells was used to detect coronavirus infection in the respiratory tract of calves.

There is a perceived notion that regular ultrasonography is required to detect recurrence. The skills required to perform ocular ultrasound are not widely available, which can prevent patients being seen close to home. We aimed to determine whether local treatment failure can reliably be detected with colour fundus photography alone. We found that in 74 out of 75 patients (98.7%), with a clear view of their fundus, recurrence could be detected using colour photography alone. One patient with a clear fundal view developed extraocular extension which was detected on ultrasound without visible change in the intraocular part of the tumour. We conclude that most treated choroidal melanomas can be monitored without ultrasonography if they can be adequately imaged with colour photography. ABSTRACT: Prompt detection and treatment of local treatment failure after radiotherapy for choroidal melanoma optimises any opportunities for conserving vision and the eye, possibly reducing an increased risk of metastatic disease. Long-term surveillance is therefore required but is hampered by the perceived need to perform ultrasonography, which may not be available at a patients local hospital. The aim of this study was to determine whether local treatment failure can reliably be detected with colour fundus photography alone, and, if so, in which patients. Patients were included in the study if diagnosed with local treatment failure between April 2016 and February 2021 after eye-conserving therapy for choroidal melanoma. Wide-field colour and fundal autofluorescence (FAF) images, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and ultrasonography (US) were analysed by two of the authors (GN and UH). The cohort included 87 patients with local treatment failure. In 75 patients with clear media, tumour progression was detected by colour photography alone in 74 (98.7%) patients. Sensitivity was not increased by the addition of either OCT or AF. One patient with clear media developed extraocular extension detected with US without visible change in the intraocular part of the tumour. In the other 12 patients, US was required because of opaque media and a consequently poor fundal view. Local treatment failure after radiotherapy for choroidal melanoma is detected in 98.7% of cases with colour photography when the media are clear. Ultrasonography is useful when photography is prevented by opaque media or tumours having locations in the far periphery.","output":"Detecting Progression of Treated Choroidal Melanomas: Is Ultrasonography Necessary?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This cohort study examines the implementation of a microbiologic screening pilot program in Al Zahra Hospital in the United Arab Emirates for identifying presymptomatic COVID-19 in patients with cancer.","output":"Serial Screening for COVID-19 in Asymptomatic Patients Receiving Anticancer Therapy in the United Arab Emirates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to classify and delineate types of user-generated content about the disposable e-cigarette Puff Bar shared on the popular video-based social media platform TikTok.

As loneliness is recognised as a major public health concern, it is therefore vital that research considers the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic on loneliness to provide necessary support. But it remains unclear, who is lonely in lockdown? METHODS: This study compared sociodemographic predictors of loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using cross-cohort analyses of data from UK adults captured before the pandemic (UK Household Longitudinal Study, n = 31,064) and during the pandemic (UCL (University College London) COVID-19 Social Study, n = 60,341). RESULTS: Risk factors for loneliness were near identical before and during the pandemic. Young adults, women, people with lower education or income, the economically inactive, people living alone and urban residents had a higher risk of being lonely. Some people who were already at risk of being lonely (e.g. young adults aged 18C30 years, people with low household income and adults living alone) experienced a heightened risk during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with people living before COVID-19 emerged. Furthermore, being a student emerged as a higher risk factor during lockdown than usual. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that interventions to reduce or prevent loneliness during COVID-19 should be targeted at those sociodemographic groups already identified as high risk in previous research. These groups are likely not just to experience loneliness during the pandemic but potentially to have an even higher risk than normal of experiencing loneliness relative to low-risk groups.","output":"Who is lonely in lockdown?

Knowledge about current cause of respiratory infections is lacking, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The aim of this study was to identity the various respiratory pathogens causing acute respiratory tract infections in children below 5 years of age visiting a sub-urban primary care clinic in Senegal. METHODS: A case-control study was performed in September and October 2018. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from cases; infants with fever and respiratory symptoms, and controls; children involved in the vaccination programme. Viral identification was conducted by polymerase chain reaction for 21 different viruses; bacteria were identified by culture studies. Associations between microorganisms, acute respiratory infection and severity of disease were calculated by multivariate regression adjusting for confounders such as age, sex, and living area. RESULTS: Overall, 102 cases and 96 controls were included. Microorganisms were detected in 90.1% of cases and 53.7% of controls (P < .001). Influenza virus A (including H1N1), influenza virus B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and Streptococcus pneumoniae were independently associated with acute respiratory tract infections. Co-detection of two or more pathogens was present in 49.5% of cases; 31.7% of cases had a pneumonia and 90.2% was treated with antibiotics.

Methods: Retrospective analysis of all computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) studies undertaken at our hospital during the peak of the pandemic between 29/2-3/5/2020. We included all inpatients with positive CV19 swab or classical or probable features of CV19 on CTPA. All CTPAs were reviewed by certified radiologists. The patient's electronic health records were reviewed for clinical data. Results: Total 132 (45.9%) of CTPAs met inclusion criteria. Presence of PE was 31 (23.5%), with 13 (41.9%) being central, and 18 (58.1%) peripheral. Men (70.4%, P0.04) and white ethnicity (58.1%, P0.03) were significantly associated with PE. No association was seen between CTPA radiographic severity of CV19 and presence of PE. Thromboprophylaxis was administered to 73.2% of the cohort prior to CTPA, no association (P0.29) between administration and diagnosed PE. No difference in vital observations in the 24hrs prior to CTPA as detected. Median Ddimer and Troponin T were significantly elevated (P&lt;0.01) in those with PE. Median Ddimer was 1050ng/mL (585-2047) in PE compared to 403ng/mL (242-664) in those without. Troponin T level was 3 times higher (25ng/L (11-51) vs 8ng/L (6-18)) in those with PE. No association was detected for other laboratory tests including: white blood cells and differential, ferritin, c-reactive protein, and brain naturetic peptide. Critical illness (composite in-hospital mortality, ITU or respiratory HDU admission, transfer to tertiary centre) occurred in 50.8% of the cohort, there was no difference (P0.9) between groups. No significant difference between in hospital mortality (PE 16.7% vs no PE 13%), ITU admission (PE 38.7% vs no PE 33.7%). Conclusion: Presence of PE is high in those infected with CV19 with males and white ethnicity at risk. Ddimer and Troponin T are useful indicators of PE in those with CV19 and significant elevations in deteriorating patients should prompt evaluation for PE.

An inverted J-shaped relationship was found that the risk of a high U5MR was 3.74 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.55C5.48], 3.07 (95% CI 2.11C4.47), and 2.25 times (95% CI 1.52C3.31) higher in counties with < 50, 50C149, and 150C499 pediatricians per 10,000 km(2), respectively, than in counties with  500 physicians per 10,000 km(2). The joint association analyses show a stronger association with the risk of a high U5MR in geographical pediatrician density than PPTC. CONCLUSION: Both population and geographical pediatrician density should be considered when planning child health care services, even in areas with high numbers of PPTC.

Laboratory tests with ideal precision, sensitivity, and specificity should be used in public health and clinical settings to gauge the extent of virus exposure. Toward this end, we evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and the Roche Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays. METHODS: Quality control, pooled COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 patient specimens were used for the imprecision study. 246 specimens from 70 patients with COVID-19 diagnosis were tested to study the sensitivity. 73 non-COVID-19 control specimens were measured to study the specificity. All specimens were analyzed by both assays. RESULTS: Total analytic variability (CV) of the negative and positive controls were 5.5% and 3.6% for the Abbott assay and 4.5% and 1.9% for the Roche assay. Both assays demonstrated 100% qualitative reproducibility of negative and positive controls. The clinical specificities of the Abbott and the Roche assays were 100% (95% CI: 94% - 100%) and 97% (95% CI: 90% - 100%), respectively. The clinical sensitivities of the Abbott assay were 49% (95% CI: 41% - 56%), 86% (95% CI: 74% - 93%) and 100% (95% CI: 76% - 100%) for samples collected at 0-6 days, 7-13 days and &#8805;14 days after the first RT-PCR, while the sensitivities of the Roche assay were 55% (95% CI: 47% - 62%), 86% (95% CI: 74% - 93%) and 100% (95% CI: 76% - 100%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates similar analytical and clinical performance of the Abbott and the Roche SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays, but the Roche assay may be slightly more sensitive for patients tested within 0-6 days after first positive RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Analytical and Clinical Analysis of Two Automated Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoassays in Pre-pandemic and Pandemic Patient Populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and purpose: In the last months of 2019, the new coronavirus infection (COVID19) spread worldwide This study investigated the need for mechanical ventilation in children who were admitted for COVID-19 Materials and methods: This article provides a systematic review of studies about children with COVID-19 requiring invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation Electronic databases including SID, Iran Medex, Magiran, PubMed, and Google Scholar were searched using related keywords in Persian and English until July 20, 2020 Also, references in the selected articles were screened Results: Twenty studies were selected in which 1709 hospitalized children were included Mechanical ventilation methods were used in 15% of the patients, while in 260 non-invasive ventilation (n=130, 7 6%) and invasive ventilation (n=130, 7 6%) were used In critically ill children or those who needed intensive care (n=302), non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation were performed in 72 (23 8%) and 71 (23 5%), respectively Mortality occurred in 1 3% of all admitted patients and 4% of critically ill children Conclusion: According to this review, 15% of hospitalized children with COVID-19 needed a form of mechanical ventilation [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences (JMUMS) is the property of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"?? ?  ?  ??  ?? ?? ?? 19?  ??

We implemented a survey-based data collection platform to characterize how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the socio-economic, physical and mental health conditions of individuals. We focused on three broad areas, namely, changes in social interaction during home confinement, economic impact and their health status. We identified a substantial increase in virtual interaction among individuals, which might be a way to alleviate the sudden unprecedented mental health burden, exacerbated by general awareness about viral infections or other manifestations associated with them. The majority of participants (85%) lived with one or more companions and unemployment issues did not affect 91% of the total survey takers, which was one of the crucial consequences of the pandemic. Nevertheless, measures such as an increased frequency of technology-aided distant social interaction, focus on physical fitness and leisure activities were adopted as coping mechanisms during this period of home isolation. Collectively, these metrics provide a succinct and informative summary of the socio-economic and health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the individuals. Findings from our study reflect that continuous surveillance of the psychological consequences for outbreaks should become routine as part of preparedness efforts worldwide.

One hundred and sixty-one children (87 boys, 74 girls) from 3.0 to 6.0 years of age (34 only children, 125 siblings) and with no known motor or cognitive disability were assessed using the Motor Competence Assessment (MCA). Their standardized results on the three MCA subscales (stability, locomotor, and manipulative) and total MCA were used to group them into high, average, and low motor competence groups. Motor competence percentile distribution of the sibling and only child group condition was compared using chi-square tests. Results showed a significative and positive association between the sibling condition and the distribution between the three MC groups (chi-square = 6.29; p = 0.043), showing that children in a household with siblings, independent of their age and sex, show a clear tendency for developing better motor competence.","output":"Siblings Influence on the Motor Competence of Preschoolers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypertension has been identified as a risk factor for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated adverse outcomes. This study examined the association between preinfection blood pressure (BP) control and COVID-19 outcomes using data from 460 general practices in England. Eligible patients were adults with hypertension who were tested or diagnosed with COVID-19. BP control was defined by the most recent BP reading within 24 months of the index date (January 1, 2020). BP was defined as controlled (<130/80 mm Hg), raised (130/80C139/89 mm Hg), stage 1 uncontrolled (140/90C159/99 mm Hg), or stage 2 uncontrolled (160/100 mm Hg). The primary outcome was death within 28 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. Secondary outcomes were COVID-19 diagnosis and COVID-19Crelated hospital admission. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between BP control and outcomes. Of the 45 418 patients (mean age, 67 years; 44.7% male) included, 11 950 (26.3%) had controlled BP. These patients were older, had more comorbidities, and had been diagnosed with hypertension for longer. A total of 4277 patients (9.4%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 877 died within 28 days. Individuals with stage 1 uncontrolled BP had lower odds of COVID-19 death (odds ratio, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.62C0.92]) compared with patients with well-controlled BP. There was no association between BP control and COVID-19 diagnosis or hospitalization. These findings suggest BP control may be associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes, possibly due to these patients having more advanced atherosclerosis and target organ damage. Such patients may need to consider adhering to stricter social distancing, to limit the impact of COVID-19 as future waves of the pandemic occur.","output":"Association Between Blood Pressure Control and Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outcomes in 45 418 Symptomatic Patients With Hypertension: An Observational Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Probiotic supplements contain different strains of living microorganisms that promote the health of the host.

Methods: A systematic review of the last five years was carried out in PubMed, Scopus, Web of science, Sportdiscus and Embase databases. Results: Nine articles met the quality criteria. Of these, three reported direct benefits on sports performance. The remaining six articles found improvements in the reduction of oxidative stress, increased immune response and decreased incidence of URTIs. There is little scientific evidence on the direct relationship between the administration of probiotics in endurance athletes and sports performance. Conclusions: Benefits were found that probiotics could indirectly influence sports performance by improving other parameters such as the immune system, response to URTIs and decreased oxidative stress, as well as the monitoring of scheduled workouts.","output":"Impact of Probiotics on the Performance of Endurance Athletes: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Evidence suggests that physicians experience high levels of burnout and stress and that trainee physicians are a particularly high-risk group. Multiple workplace- and non-workplace-related factors have been identified in trainee physicians, but it is unclear which factors are most important in association with burnout and stress. Better understanding of the most critical factors could help inform the development of targeted interventions to reduce burnout and stress. Objective: To estimate the association between different stressors and burnout/stress among physicians engaged in standard postgraduate training (ie, trainee physicians). Data Sources: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews from inception until April 30, 2019. Search terms included trainee, foundation year, registrar, resident, and intern. Study Selection: Studies that reported associations between stressors and burnout/stress in trainee physicians. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the quality of the evidence. The main meta-analysis was followed by sensitivity analyses. All analyses were performed using random-effects models, and heterogeneity was quantified using the I2 statistic. Main Outcome and Measures: The main outcome was the association between burnout/stress and workplace- or non-workplace-related factors reported as odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs. Results: Forty-eight studies were included in the meta-analysis (n = 36 266, median age, 29 years [range, 24.6-35.7 years]). One study did not specify participants' sex; of the total population, 18a?781 participants (52%) were men. In particular, work demands of a trainee physician were associated with a nearly 3-fold increased odds for burnout/stress (OR, 2.84; 95% CI, 2.26-3.59), followed by concerns about patient care (OR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.58-3.50), poor work environment (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.57-2.70), and poor work-life balance (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.53-2.44). Perceived/reported poor mental or physical health (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.76-3.31), female sex (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.20-1.50), financial worries (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.07-1.72), and low self-efficacy (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.31-3.46) were associated with increased odds for burnout/stress, whereas younger age and a more junior grade were not significantly associated. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that the odds ratios for burnout and stress in trainee physicians are higher than those for work-related factors compared with nonmodifiable and non-work-related factors, such as age and grade. These findings support the need for organizational interventions to mitigate burnout in trainee physicians.","output":"Factors Associated With Burnout and Stress in Trainee Physicians: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The overload of the healthcare system and the organisational changes made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may be having an impact on acute stroke care in the Region of Madrid. METHODS: We conducted a survey with sections addressing hospital characteristics, changes in infrastructure and resources, code stroke clinical pathways, diagnostic testing, rehabilitation, and outpatient care. We performed a descriptive analysis of results according to the level of complexity of stroke care (availability of stroke units and mechanical thrombectomy). RESULTS: The survey was completed by 22 of the 26 hospitals in the Madrid Regional Health System that attend adult emergencies, between 16 and 27 April 2020. Ninety-five percent of hospitals had reallocated neurologists to care for patients with COVID-19. The numbers of neurology ward beds were reduced in 89.4% of hospitals; emergency department stroke care pathways were modified in 81%, with specific pathways for suspected SARS-CoV2 infection established in 50% of hospitals; and SARS-CoV2-positive patients with acute stroke were not admitted to neurology wards in 42%. Twenty-four hour on-site availability of mechanical thrombectomy was improved in 10 hospitals, which resulted in a reduction in the number of secondary hospital transfers. The admission of patients with transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke was avoided in 45% of hospitals, and follow-up through telephone consultations was implemented in 100%.

As healthcare systems evolve in the face of COVID-19, the use of telehealth platforms has expanded. We present the results of a large survey of patient perspectives on the role of telehealth in the care of spine clinic patients. METHODS: All patients at the spine clinic of a large, tertiary, academic medical center were surveyed at their clinic visit from 5/30/20-6/30/20. All responses were anonymous and results were analyzed with standard statistical techniques. RESULTS: 176 surveys were returned and 164 were entirely completed. 56.8% of patients were new while 24.4% were post-operative follow-up visits. 54.9% had lumbar symptoms. 85% had pain while more than half also reported weakness. 58% traveled greater than twenty-five miles for their appointment. 96% had transportation readily available. Of all respondents, only 15.3% preferred the appointment via video telehealth while 4% had no preference between in-person appointment or virtual visit. Preference for telehealth appointment was not associated with factors such as new or established in the practice, spinal region of symptoms, pain, weakness, comfort with technology, age or duration of symptoms. There was a significant difference between how far the patient traveled for the clinic appointment and their preference for a telehealth appointment, with patients traveling further distances favoring telehealth (p=0.04). This effect remained significant when stratifying based on 25 miles (p=0.03) or 50 miles (p=0.03) but not when stratifying based on 100 miles (p=0.32). However, the sample size of patients traveling >100 miles was small, limiting any inference regarding that subgroup. Access to transportation was associated with preference for telehealth (88.89% vs. 97.18%, p=0.08) but did not reach statistical significance.

These preferences should be considered when arranging patient encounters.","output":"Telemedicine in a spine clinic setting: a large survey of patient preferences and experiences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The critical step in the emergence of a new epidemic or pandemic viral pathogen occurs after it infects the initial spillover host and then is successfully transmitted onwards, causing an outbreak chain of transmission within that new host population. Crossing these choke points sets a pathogen on the pathway to epidemic emergence. While many viruses spill over to infect new or alternative hosts, only a few accomplish this transitionand the reasons for the success of those pathogens are still unclear. Here, we consider this issue related to the emergence of animal viruses, where factors involved likely include the ability to efficiently infect the new animal host, the demographic features of the initial population that favour onward transmission, the level of shedding and degree of susceptibility of individuals of that population, along with pathogen evolution favouring increased replication and more efficient transmission among the new host individuals. A related form of emergence involves mutations that increased spread or virulence of an already-known virus within its usual host. In all of these cases, emergence may be due to altered viral properties, changes in the size or structure of the host populations, ease of transport, climate change or, in the case of arboviruses, to the expansion of the arthropod vectors. Here, we focus on three examples of viruses that have gained efficient onward transmission after spillover: influenza A viruses that are respiratory transmitted, HIV, a retrovirus, that is mostly blood or mucosal transmitted, and canine parvovirus that is faecal:oral transmitted. We describe our current understanding of the changes in the viruses that allowed them to overcome the barriers that prevented efficient replication and spread in their new hosts. We also briefly outline how we could gain a better understanding of the mechanisms and variability in order to better anticipate these events in the future.

Larger immediate declines in notifications were seen among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive compared with HIV-negative individuals (?36%;95% CI: ?38 to ?35;versus ?12%;95% CI: ?17 to ?6). Following roll-out of tuberculosis response measures in July 2020, notifications immediately increased by 45% (95% CI: 38 to 51) nationally and across all subgroups and provinces. The trend in notifications remained stable through September 2021, with similar numbers to the predicted number had the pandemic not occurred. Conclusion Implementation of a coordinated public health response including active tuberculosis case-finding was associated with reversal of the adverse impact of the pandemic and mitigation measures. The gains were sustained throughout subsequent waves of the pandemic.","output":"Interrupted time-series analysis of active case-finding for tuberculosis during the COVID-19 pandemic, Zambia Analyse d'une srie chronologique interrompue de dpistage actif des cas de tuberculose durant la pandmie de COVID-19 en Zambie Anlisis de series temporales interrumpidas sobre la bsqueda activa de casos de tuberculosis durante la pandemia de la COVID-19 en Zambia .?? ? ? ? ? ?  ? ? ?? ?? ?? 19?  ޱ͹״ڼ˲ֵжʱз ߧѧݧڧ ֧ӧѧߧߧ ӧ֧ާ֧ߧߧ է էݧ ѧܧڧӧߧԧ ӧӧݧ֧ߧڧ ݧѧ֧ ٧ѧҧݧ֧ӧѧߧڧ ҧ֧ܧݧ֧٧ ӧ ӧ֧ާ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ COVID-19, ѧާҧڧ"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is by far the major cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs) worldwide in infants and children younger than 2 years. The overwhelming number of hospitalizations due to hRSV-induced ALRTI each year is due, at least in part, to the lack of licensed vaccines against this virus. Thus, hRSV infection is considered a major public health problem and economic burden in most countries. The lung pathology developed in hRSV-infected individuals is characterized by an exacerbated proinflammatory and unbalanced Th2-type immune response. In addition to the adverse effects in airway tissues, hRSV infection can also cause neurologic manifestations in the host, such as seizures and encephalopathy. Although the origins of these extrapulmonary symptoms remain unclear, studies with patients suffering from neurological alterations suggest an involvement of the inflammatory response against hRSV. Furthermore, hRSV has evolved numerous mechanisms to modulate and evade the immune response in the host. Several studies have focused on elucidating the interactions between hRSV virulence factors and the host immune system, to rationally design new vaccines and therapies against this virus. Here, we discuss about the infection, pathology, and immune response triggered by hRSV in the host.","output":"Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus: Infection and Pathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the distribution of equity returns in the G20 equity markets to test for contagion following the first official report of a COVID-19 case in China in December 2019 and the subsequent announcement of a global pandemic in March 2020.

Except for hypogammaglobulinemia, the remaining features resemble autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS). Here, we report the case of a 14-year-old boy with the ALPS phenotype, eventually diagnosed with LRBA deficiency.

Vital organs of the human body may get affected after replication of SARS-CoV-2, including the lungs, heart, kidneys, liver and brain. It triggers severe inflammation and impairs the function of two or more organ systems. IschaemiaCreperfusion (IR) injury is a phenomenon that can have disastrous effects on the human body. METHODS: In this study, we analysed the laboratory data of 7052 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). A total of 66.4% patients were men and 33.6% were women, which indicated gender difference as a prominent factor to be considered. RESULTS: Our data showed high levels of inflammation and elevated markers of tissue injury from multiple organs C reactive protein, white blood cell count, alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase and LDH. The number of red blood cells, haemoglobin concentration and haematocrit were lower than normal which indicated a reduction in oxygen supply and anaemia. CONCLUSION: On the basis of these results, we proposed a model linking IR injury to multiple organ damage by SARS-CoV-2.

The actions by governments triggered a debate on whether the costs of a lockdown, economically and in well-being, surpass the benefits perceived from a lower infection rate. Aim: To use the Gross National Happiness index (GNH), derived from Big Data, to investigate the determinants of happiness before and during the first few months of a lockdown in a country as an extreme case, South Africa (a country with low levels of well-being and stringent lockdown regulations). Next, to estimate (1) the probability of being happy during a pandemic year, before and after the implemented lockdown, relative to the mean happiness levels of the previous year, and (2) to utilise simulations to estimate the probability of being happy if there were no lockdown. Setting: This study considers the effect of government-mandated lockdown on happiness in South Africa. Methods: We use Big Data in the forms of Twitter and Google Trends to derive variables and ordinary least squares and ordered probit estimation methods. Results: What contributes to happiness under lockdown, except for COVID-19 cases, are the factors linked to the implemented regulations themselves. If we compare scenarios pre- and post-lockdown, we report a happiness cost of 9%. The simulations indicate that assuming there were no lockdown in 2020, the relative well-being gain is 3%. Conclusion: If policymakers want to increase happiness levels and the probability of achieving the same happiness levels as in 2019, they should consider factors related to the regulations that can increase happiness levels.","output":"Happiness lost: Was the decision to implement lockdown the correct one?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundOn 20 February 2020, a locally acquired coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case was detected in Lombardy, Italy.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the association between telemedicine visits and the failure to meet the Controlling High Blood Pressure (BP) quality measure from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 32,727 adult patients with hypertension who were seen in primary care and cardiology clinics at an urban, academic medical center from February to December 2020. The primary outcome was a failure to meet the Controlling High Blood Pressure quality measure, which was defined as having no BP recorded or having a last recorded BP of 140/90 mm Hg (ie, poor BP control). Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between telemedicine visit use during the study period (none, 1 telemedicine visit, or 2 telemedicine visits) and poor BP control; we adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: During the study period, no BP was recorded for 2.3% (486/20,745) of patients with in-person visits only, 27.1% (1863/6878) of patients with 1 telemedicine visit, and 25% (1277/5104) of patients with 2 telemedicine visits. After adjustment, telemedicine use was associated with poor BP control (1 telemedicine visit: odds ratio [OR] 2.06, 95% CI 1.94-2.18; P<.001; 2 telemedicine visits: OR 2.49, 95% CI 2.31-2.68; P<.001; reference: in-person visits only).

Among these proteins, 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro), also named main protease, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), have been identified as fundamental targets due to its importance in the viral replication stages. OBJECTIVES To investigate, in silico, two of the most abundant flavonoid glycosides from Dysphania ambrosioides; a medicinal plant found in many regions of the world, along with some of the putative derivatives of these flavonoid glycosides in the human organism as potential inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and RdRp. METHODS Using a molecular docking approach, the interactions and the binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and RdRp were predicted for quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (rutin), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (nicotiflorin) and some of their glucuronide and sulfate derivatives. FINDINGS Docking analysis, based on the crystal structure of 3CLpro and RdRp, indicated rutin, nicotiflorin, and their glucuronide and sulfate derivatives as potential inhibitors for both proteins. Also, the importance of the hydrogen bond and &#960;-based interactions was evidenced for the presumed active sites. MAIN CONCLUSIONS Overall, these results suggest that both flavonoid glycosides and their putative human metabolites can play a key role as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and RdRp.

First, policy measures aimed at reducing contagion are very useful when contagion is at its peak to reduce the reproduction rate. Second, the contagion curve should be accurately monitored over time to apply policy measures that are cost\\\\effective.","output":"Monitoring COVID\\\\19 contagion growth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Parent scientists lead a journey to bring surveillance severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing to public schools across the state of Massachusetts and beyond.","output":"The power of parent scientists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads across the world, the ongoing clinical trials are leading to a big race worldwide to develop a treatment that will help control the pandemic.

In this pandemic, there is not a lot of time to develop a new specific agent because of the rapid spread of the disease. The process of developing a vaccine is long and requires hard work. Although the pathophysiology of the disease is not fully understood, some of the proposed treatment alternatives are based on old evidence and some have been used with the idea that they might work owing to their mechanism of action. The efficacy, reliability, and safety of the currently available treatment alternatives are therefore a matter of debate. Currently, the main therapies used in the treatment of COVID-19 are antiviral drugs and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine.

Exogenous estrogen induces immature oviduct development to improve egg production after molting. In this process, regressed female reproductive tract is regenerated in response to the secretion of estrogen. However, there is limited knowledge on the physiological mechanisms underlying the regulation of the avian female reproductive system. In our previous study, results from microarray analysis revealed that the expression of genes encoding egg white proteins is affected during molting. Herein, we artificially induced the molting period in chickens through a zinc-containing diet. Subsequently, changes in the expression of genes encoding egg white proteins were confirmed in the oviduct tissue. The levels of MUC5B, ORM1, RTBDN, and TENP mRNA were significantly high in the oviduct, and the genes were repressed in the regression phase, whereas these were expressed in the recrudescence phase, particularly in the luminal epithelium and glandular epithelium of the oviduct, during molting. Moreover, we observed that gene expression was induced in the magnum, the site for the secretion of egg white components. Next, differences in expression levels of the four genes in normal and cancerous ovaries were compared. Collectively, results suggest that the four selected genes are expressed in the female chicken reproductive tract in response to hormonal regulation, and egg white protein-encoding genes may serve as modulators of the reproductive system in hens.","output":"Alterations in egg white-related genes expression in response to hormonal stimulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID\\\\19 has become a global pandemic, and close contacts and asymptomatic patients are worthy of attention.

Real\\\\time fluorescence was used to detect SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal swabs of all close contacts, and the colloidal gold method was used to detect serum\\\\specific antibodies. Levels of IgM\\\\ and IgG\\\\specific antibodies were detected quantitatively through chemiluminescence from the first nucleic acid turned negative date (0 week) and on weekly intervals of 1 week, 1C2 weeks, 2C3 weeks, 3C4 weeks, 4C5 weeks, 5C6 weeks, and 6C7 weeks. RESULTS: The total positive rate of the colloidal gold method (88.5%, 23/26) was significantly higher ((2) = 59.182, p < 0.001) than that of the healthy control group (2.0%, 1/50). There was significant difference in IgG concentration at different time points (0C7 weeks) after negative nucleic acid conversion ((2) = 14.034, p = 0.029). Serum IgG levels were significantly higher at weekly time points of 4C5 weeks (Z = ?2.399, p = 0.016), 5C6 weeks (Z = ?2.049, p = 0.040), and 6C7 weeks (Z = ?2.197, p = 0.028) compared with 1C2 weeks after negative nucleic acid conversion.

However, significant events, incidents, and demands, from democratic backsliding in the EU to the Covid-19 pandemic, are causing the ground to shift underfoot.

This turbulence can help and hinder policy design and implementation, requiring policy actors to think outside the box and beyond the status quo. This article investigates how the European Commission and other key actors can engage effectively with turbulence to ensure the successful delivery and implementation of the EGD.

It delineates how turbulence differs from crisis;expands the forms of turbulence to include horizontal scalar and policy turbulence, as well as its transversal attribute;and shifts the focus to governing with turbulence rather than against turbulence. The second half undertakes an initial analysis of the EGD in light of turbulence and provides a springboard for further investigations within this thematic issue and beyond. It is apparent that the EGD is both responding and contributing to a varied landscape of turbulence.

To accelerate our understanding of the host-pathogen response to respiratory viruses, the use of more complex in vitro systems such as normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cell culture models has gained prominence as an alternative to animal models. NHBE cells were differentiated under air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions to form an in vitro pseudostratified epithelium. The responses of well-differentiated (wd) NHBE cells were examined following infection with the 2009 pandemic Influenza A/H1N1pdm09 strain or following challenge with the dsRNA mimic, poly(I:C). At 30 h postinfection with H1N1pdm09, the integrity of the airway epithelium was severely impaired and apical junction complex damage was exhibited by the disassembly of zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) from the cell cytoskeleton. wdNHBE cells produced an innate immune response to IAV-infection with increased transcription of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the antiviral viperin but reduced expression of the mucin-encoding MUC5B, which may impair mucociliary clearance. Poly(I:C) produced similar responses to IAV, with the exception of MUC5B expression which was more than 3-fold higher than for control cells.

However, to date, no studies have evaluated the effectiveness of HIAT on academic performance or absenteeism or examined the cost-effectiveness of HIAT relative to other treatments in women with primary dysmenorrhea. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying aerobic exercise-induced analgesia in primary dysmenorrhea remain unclear. The objectives of this study are to: (1) evaluate the effects of HIAT on absenteeism and academic performance among university students, (2) identify the underlying mechanisms associated with aerobic exercise-induced analgesia in primary dysmenorrhea, and (3) determine the cost-effectiveness of HIAT compared with a wait-list control (WLC) group receiving usual care. METHODS: A sequential, embedded, mixed-methods study design, including a crossover, randomised controlled trial (RCT) and semi-structured focus groups, will be conducted alongside an economic evaluation. A total of 130 women aged 18C24 years will be randomised into either HIAT (n = 65) or wait-list control (n = 65) groups. Primary outcomes will include average pain intensity, absenteeism from university, and academic performance. Primary mediators will include salivary progesterone and prostaglandin F2 levels. Outcome and meditator variables will be assessed at baseline and post-treatment, at 12 and 28 weeks. An economic analysis will be conducted from the societal and healthcare perspective of Hong Kong.

RESULTS: 128 critically ill adult subjects were included in the study (median age 68 y [interquartile range 61-76], 45% female, and 64% Black); 124 (97%) required intubation. Eighty (63%) subjects died during their in-patient stay, which did not differ by race/ethnicity. Compared with other racial/ethnic groups, Blacks had a greater proportion of women (52% vs 30%, P = .02) and subjects with hypertension (91% vs 78%, P = .035). Asthma (P = .03) was associated with lower in-patient death, primarily among Black subjects (P = .02). Among Black subjects, increased age (odds ratio 1.06 [95% CI 1.05-1.22] per year), positive fluid balance (odds ratio 1.06 [95% CI 1.01-1.11] per 100 mL), and treatment with tocilizumab (odds ratio 25.0 [95% CI 3.5-180]) were independently associated with in-patient death, while higher platelets (odds ratio 0.65 [95% CI 0.47-0.89] per 50  103/mL) and treatment with intermediate dose anticoagulants (odds ratio 0.08 [95% CI 0.02-0.43]) were protective. Among other race/ethnic groups, higher total bilirubin (odds ratio 1.75 [95% CI 0.94-3.25] per 0.2 mg/dL) and higher maximum lactate (odds ratio 1.43 [95% CI 0.96-2.13] per mmol/L) were marginally associated with increased death, while tocilizumab treatment was marginally protective (odds ratio 0.24 [95% CI 0.05-1.25]).

In a recent publication, we showed that Mn induced oxidative DNA damage and caused lesions in thymines. This study further investigates the mechanisms by which cells process Mn(2+)-mediated DNA damage using the yeast S. cerevisiae. The strains most sensitive to Mn(2+) were those defective in base excision repair, glutathione synthesis, and superoxide dismutase mutants. Mn(2+) caused a dose-dependent increase in the accumulation of mutations using the CAN1 and lys2-10A mutator assays. The spectrum of CAN1 mutants indicates that exposure to Mn results in accumulation of base substitutions and frameshift mutations. The sensitivity of cells to Mn(2+) as well as its mutagenic effect was reduced by N-acetylcysteine, glutathione, and Mg(2+). These data suggest that Mn(2+) causes oxidative DNA damage that requires base excision repair for processing and that Mn interferes with polymerase fidelity.

Consequently, guidelines on their use vary depending on specific patient populations. METHODS: The study population was drawn from the COPE Study (COVID-19 in Older People), a multicentre observational cohort study, across the UK and Italy. Data were collected between 27 February and 28 April 2020 by trained data-collectors and included all unselected consecutive admissions with COVID-19. Load (name/number of medications) and dosage of immunosuppressant were collected along with other covariate data. Primary outcome was time-to-mortality from the date of admission (or) date of diagnosis, if diagnosis was five or more days after admission. Secondary outcomes were Day-14 mortality and time-to-discharge. Data were analysed with mixed-effects, Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models using non-users of immunosuppressants as the reference group. RESULTS: In total 1184 patients were eligible for inclusion. The median (IQR) age was 74 (62C83), 676 (57%) were male, and 299 (25.3%) died in hospital (total person follow-up 15,540 days). Most patients exhibited at least one comorbidity, and 113 (~10%) were on immunosuppressants. Any immunosuppressant use was associated with increased mortality: aHR 1.87, 95% CI: 1.30, 2.69 (time to mortality) and aOR 1.71, 95% CI: 1.01C2.88 (14-day mortality). There also appeared to be a doseCresponse relationship. CONCLUSION: Despite possible indication bias, until further evidence emerges we recommend adhering to public health measures, a low threshold to seek medical advice and close monitoring of symptoms in those who take immunosuppressants routinely regardless of their indication. However, it should be noted that the inability to control for the underlying condition requiring immunosuppressants is a major limitation, and hence caution should be exercised in interpretation of the results. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Regular Use of Immune Suppressing Drugs is Associated with Increased Risk of Death in Hospitalised Patients with COVID-19 Background: We do not have much information on how the COVID-19 virus affects patients who use immunosuppressants, drugs which inhibit or reduce the activity of the immune system. There are various conflicting views on whether immune-suppressing drugs are beneficial or detrimental in patients with the disease. Methods: This study collected data from 10 hospitals in the UK and one in Italy between February and April 2020 in order to identify any association between the regular use of immunosuppressant medicines and survival in patients who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Results: 1184 patients were included in the study, and 10% of them were using immunosuppressants. Any immunosuppressant use was associated with increased risk of death, and the risk appeared to increase if the dose of the medicine was higher. Conclusion: We therefore recommend that patients who take immunosuppressant medicines routinely should carefully adhere to social distancing measures, and seek medical attention early during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Routine use of immunosuppressants is associated with mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Positive-strand RNA viruses have been the etiological agents in several major disease outbreaks over the last few decades. Examples of this include flaviviruses, such as dengue virus and Zika virus that cause millions of yearly infections around the globe, and coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, the source of the current pandemic. The severity of outbreaks caused by these viruses stresses the importance of research aimed at determining methods to limit virus spread and to curb disease severity. Such studies require molecular tools to decipher virus-host interactions and to develop effective treatments. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of a reporter system that can be used to visualize and identify cells infected with dengue virus or SARS-CoV-2. This system is based on viral protease activity that mediates cleavage and nuclear translocation of an engineered fluorescent protein stably expressed in cells. We show the suitability of this system for live cell imaging, for visualization of single infected cells, and for screening and testing of antiviral compounds. With the integrated modular building blocks, this system is easy to manipulate and can be adapted to any virus encoding a protease, thus offering a high degree of flexibility.IMPORTANCE Reporter systems are useful tools for fast and quantitative visualization of virus infected cells within a host cell population. Here we describe a reporter system that takes advantage of virus-encoded proteases that are expressed in infected cells to cleave an ER-anchored fluorescent protein fused to a nuclear localization sequence. Upon cleavage, the GFP moiety translocates to the nucleus, allowing for rapid detection of the infected cells. Using this system, we demonstrate reliable reporting activity for two major human pathogens from the Flaviviridae and the Coronaviridae families: dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2. We apply this reporter system to live cell imaging and use it for proof-of-concept to validate antiviral activity of a nucleoside analogue. This reporter system is not only an invaluable tool for the characterization of viral replication, but also for the discovery and development of antivirals that are urgently needed to halt the spread of these viruses.","output":"A Versatile Reporter System to Monitor Virus Infected Cells and Its Application to Dengue Virus and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Decreases of direct face-to-face contact during the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic would impair human empathy, an essential skill for maintaining relationships with others.

This paper entails risk evaluation that needs to be considered to all the security personnel working in this centre as there was no precedent of similar situation in the country. Method: ology: This is a semi-quantitative and integrated type of hazard identification, risk assessment and risk control (HIRARC) approach where it incorporates risk rating and severity rating to cover four elements, which are people, property, environment, and reputation. Total scores range from 1 to 25 and was further categorized into low, medium and high risk in a color-coded representation. The assessment was done for two weeks from 27 th May 2020 till 11 th June 2020. Result: & Discussion: Four types of occupational and security hazards identified were physical, biological, psychological and ergonomics hazards. this evaluation serves as a good planning tool in optimizing the risk mitigation measures among security personnel working in a biological hazardous environment. Physical hazards with possible violence and riot scored the highest risk while ergonomic issues had the lowest rating. Appropriate control measures to mitigate all the potential risks were appropriately implemented through a solid multi-agencies collaborative effort.

The purpose of this study was to identify the trend of visits to ED for different diseases at the peak and slack stages of the epidemic. Patients and Methods This was a retrospective observational study conducted in a tertiary referral medical center in northern Taiwan. We recorded weekly ED visits for myocardial infarction with or without ST-elevation (STEMI or NSTEMI), out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), acute stroke, and congestive heart failure from 2016 to 2021. We compared the local epidemic peak periods (calendar weeks 4C18, 2020 and calendar weeks 21C31, 2021) and its corresponding slack periods (calendar weeks 4C18, 2021 and calendar weeks 21C31, 2020) with the baseline period (2016C2019) using MannCWhitney test to identify the difference. Results We observed a significant decline in ED visits (median [Q1, Q3]) during the epidemic for OHCA (6 [5, 7] and 5 [4, 6], p = 0.046, for baseline and peak period, respectively, in week 4C18), acute stroke (41.5 [38, 47] and 35 [28, 39], p < 0.001, in week 4C18, 40 [35, 45] and 35 [28, 40], p = 0.039, in week 21C31) and CHF (28 [24.25, 33] and 19 [12, 23], p < 0.001, in week 4C18, 18 [16, 23] and 13 [11, 16], p = 0.001, in week 21C31). Significant difference was not observed in patients with NSTEMI and STEMI in both week 4C18 and 21C31, and cardiac arrest in week 21C31. There was a rebound in ED visits in the slack period. Conclusion This study revealed that ED visits significantly declined during the COVID-19 epidemic and rebounded in the slack period.

The globalists are said to be bent on fostering One World Government, One World Economy and One World Religion on the populace. COVID-19, its second or third wave, attendant lockdowns and restrictions on business activities and religious gatherings are said to be pre-mediated and orchestrated behind the scene to achieve what has since been described by the public and private sectors as the New Normal. The World Health Organisation (WHO), United Nations, communists, desperate leftist Western politicians, billionaire investors, big pharmaceutical companies, big media organisations and compromised scientists have been fingered as the New World Order desperadoes. It is alleged that the new waves of the pandemic and the recent predictions of yet a worse pandemic by the WHO and by a prominent globalist are a confirmation that they are desperate to further pursue and achieve their New World Order aim. Such measures as lockdowns, use of facemask, COVID-19 vaccines and restrictions on business activities and religious gatherings are said to be among their tools for achieving a great reset, mind control, social conditioning and/or further damage to the physical, psychological and spiritual health of the people. Those measures as well as the still unsettled or controversial safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines are analysed in this paper vis--vis the relevant fundamental rights of the people. The growing trend of making the COVID-19 vaccination certificate a requisite to travel overseas or access some public places locally is also examined, more so as this is tantamount to making the COVID-19 vaccination mandatory, not necessarily by law but by policy and not necessarily directly but indirectly. This paper examines whether such measures are in harmony with such fundamental rights as the right to the grant of informed consent, right to personal dignity, right to privacy, freedom of movement and freedom of religion guaranteed by both the municipal law of the nations and the international human rights regime. With the use of indirect, circumstantial and documentary types of evidence available, the paper finds out that the alleged plot to maintain the New Normal and foist a New World Order is neither baseless nor unreasonable. To overcome the pandemic and beyond the vaccines which the new variants of the disease may defy, the need to allow the COVID-19 responses to wear human face and comply with human rights, use of the combination of hydroxychloroquine, zinc and azythromycin in the early stage of the disease, exposure to sunlight and eating of certain immunity-boosting fruits and vegetables are recommended.

METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 120 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who underwent serum ACE detection on admission. The clinical characteristics and laboratory findings during hospitalization were evaluated dynamically to identify the potential risk factors for disease progression. RESULTS: ACE level was demonstrated as one of the independent risk factors. Patients with ACE level  33.5 U/L showed a higher cumulative virus RNA detection rate, elevated pro-inflammatory mediators levels, declined lymphocyte count, and decreased SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies than those with ACE level > 33.5 U/L. CONCLUSION: Lower serum ACE levels in relation to delayed virus elimination, hyperinflammatory condition, and impaired host antiviral immune responses contribute to disease progression of COVID-19.","output":"Lower Serum Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Level in Relation to Hyperinflammation and Impaired Antiviral Immune Response Contributes to Progression of COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pathological scars cause both local physical discomforts and mental disorders for patients.

However, multiple infections have contributed to the outbreak of the disease and also resulted in great difficulties in diagnosis and control of the disease. Thus, a Luminex xTAG multiplex detection method, which was more sensitive and specific than general multiplex PCR method, was developed for the detection of 11 viral diarrhea pathogens, including PKoV, PAstV, PEDV, PSaV, PSV, PTV, PDCoV, TGEV, BVDV, PoRV, and PToV. To investigate the prevalence of diarrhea-associated viruses responsible for the outbreaks, a total of 753 porcine stool specimens collected from 9 pig farms in Shanghai during 2015C2018 were tested and the pathogen spectrums and co-infections were analyzed. As a result, PKoV, PAstV and PEDV were most commonly detected viruses in diarrheal pigs with the rate of 38.65% (291/753), 20.32% (153/753), and 15.54% (117/753), respectively. Furthermore, multiple infections were commonly seen, with positive rate of 28.42%. Infection pattern of the viral diarrhea pathogens in a specific farm was changing, and different farms had the various diarrhea infection patterns. A longitudinal investigation showed that PEDV was the key pathogen which was closely related to the death of diarrhea piglets. Other pathogens might play synergistic roles in the pathogenesis of diarrhea disease. Furthermore, the surveillance confirmed that variant enteropathogenic viruses were leading etiologic agents of porcine diarrhea, either mono-infection or co-infections of PKoV were common in pigs in Shanghai, but PEDV was still the key pathogen and multiple pathogens synergistically complicated the infection status, suggesting that controlling porcine diarrhea might be more complex than previously thought. The study provides a better understanding of diarrhea viruses in piglets, which will aid in better preventing and controlling epidemics of viral porcine diarrhea.","output":"The Complex Co-infections of Multiple Porcine Diarrhea Viruses in Local Area Based on the Luminex xTAG Multiplex Detection Method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between access to adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and mental health outcomes among a sample of U.S. nurses.

The main fenestrated stent-graft was positioned without difficulty, and the renal and superior mesenteric arteries were stented. A stent-graft was placed in the CA, but angiography showed the vessel to be occluded by dissection beyond the stent-graft. Wire manipulations to regain access to the true lumen culminated in perforation. At this point, the gastroduodenal artery was catheterized with a 0.035-inch guidewire, which was advanced in retrograde fashion into the CA true lumen and then snared back to the left brachial artery forming a loop. After exchange for a 0.014-inch system, self-expanding stents were deployed into the hepatic artery. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on day 6.

Moreover, in order to develop treatments for COVID\\\\19, we urgently need to acquire more knowledge about the aged immune system, as older adults are disproportionally and more severely affected. Changes with age lead to impaired responses to infections, malignancies and vaccination, and are accompanied by chronic, low\\\\degree inflammation, which together is termed immunosenescence.

Cellular senescence, characterised by an irreversible cell cycle arrest, is thought to be the cause of tissue and organismal ageing. Thus, better understanding of cellular senescence in immune populations at single\\\\cell level may provide us with insight into how immune cell senescence develops over the life time of an individual.

Using a 5-point Likert scale, residents considered new notes to have increased visual appeal (4 vs 3, p = 0.05) and less redundancy and clutter (4 vs 3, p = 0.006). Overall template satisfaction was not statistically different. Faculty reviewers rated the standard note more up-to-date (4.3 vs 2.7, p = 0.001), accurate (3.9 vs 2.6, p = 0.003), and useful (4 vs 2.8, p = 0.002), but less organized (3.3 vs 4.5, p < 0.001). Total quality was not statistically different. CONCLUSIONS: Residents rated the new note template more visually appealing, shorter, and less cluttered. Faculty reviewers rated both note types equivalent in the overall quality but rated new notes inferior in terms of accuracy and usefulness though better organized. This study demonstrates a novel method of a simulated clinical encounter to evaluate note templates before the introduction into practice.

This study used microbiota high-throughput sequencing to compare the fecal microbial profile of healthy horses to that of geriatric microbial transplant recipients experiencing diarrhea and tested whether FMT restores microbiota diversity. METHODS: To evaluate the effect of environment and donor characteristics on the intestinal microbiota, fecal samples were collected per rectum from 15 healthy young-adult (2C12 years) and 15 geriatric (20 years) horses. Additionally, FMT was performed for 3 consecutive days in 5 geriatric horses with diarrhea using feces from the same healthy donor. Fecal samples were collected from both donor and recipient prior to each FMT and from recipients 24 hours following the last FMT. The profile of the fecal bacterial microbiota was compared using 16S amplicon sequencing. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to diet and farm location, age did not significantly affect the healthy equine fecal microbiota, indicating that both healthy geriatric and young-adult horses may serve as FMT donors. The fecal microbiota of horses with diarrhea was significantly more variable in terms of -diversity than that of healthy horses. An inverse correlation between diarrhea score and relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia was identified in surviving FMT recipients. At study completion, the fecal microbiota of horses which responded to FMT had a higher -diversity than prior to treatment and was phylogenetically more similar to that of the donor.","output":"The fecal microbiota of healthy donor horses and geriatric recipients undergoing fecal microbial transplantation for the treatment of diarrhea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The highly pathogenic filoviruses, Marburg and Ebola virus, are difficult to handle and knowledge of the interactions between filoviruses and their host cells remained enigmatic for many years.

This study was hence aimed to explore whether the Google search volume may have been useful to predict the trajectory of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Italy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We accessed Google Trends for collecting data on weekly Google searches for the keywords \\"tosse\\" (i.e., cough), \\"febbre\\" (i.e., fever) and \\"dispnea\\" (dyspnea) in Italy, between February and May 2020. The number of new weekly cases of COVID-19 in Italy was also obtained from the website of the National Institute of Health. RESULTS: The peaks of Google searches for the three terms predicted by 3 weeks that of newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases. The peaks of weekly Google searches for \\"febbre\\" (fever), \\"tosse\\"( cough) and \\"dispnea\\" (dyspnea) were 1.7-, 2.2- and 7.7-fold higher compared to the week before the diagnosis of the first national case. No significant correlation was found between the number of newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases and Google search volumes of \\"tosse\\" (cough) and \\"febbre\\" (fever), whilst \\"dyspnea\\" (dyspnea) was significantly correlated (r= 0.50; p=0.034). The correlation between newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases and \\"tosse\\" (cough; r=0.65; p=0.008) or \\"febbre\\" (fever; 0.69; p=0.004) become statistically significant with a 3-week delay.

Dental professionals in resource poor countries, as opposed to those in developed countries, face additional challenges due to the lack of personal protective equipment, and chronic infrastructural impediments extant in such jurisdictions, such as regular and chronic interruptions to electricity and water supplies. OBJECTIVES To address this new 'normal' which dictates that dentistry has to 'adapt and adopt' in order to deliver care to the needy, particularly in resource poor nations, whilst care deliverers take appropriate precautionary measures to obviate cross infection. METHODS A review was preformed of the challenges to delivery of infection control measures in dentistry in resource meagre settings, and practical interventional measures proposed to mitigate these challenges, taking South Africa as a case study. RESULTS In reality, optimal infection control measures cannot be implemented in delivering dental care in resource poor settings, a challenge that has been ill addressed by the relevant authoritative bodies. A re-adaptation of infection control guidelines that could be simply implemented in such settings has been formulated. CONCLUSION We present practical infection control guidelines to lessen the burden of dental professionals in resource poor countries who dispense treatment under trying circumstance. The strategic infection control measures, including engineering and administrative controls outlined could be applicable in jurisdictions with a diminished capacity to respond to local, regional or national infection control guide-lines, due to financial, regulatory, or other infrastructural resource deficiencies.","output":"Strategic implementation of dental infection control in resource-poor jurisdictions during COVID-19 pandemic: a perspective from South Africa."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: People with COPD and persons with HIV have been recognized as medically and socially vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic Data on the impact of the pandemic and its response on the psychosocial wellbeing and medical care of persons living with HIV and COPD is lacking We evaluated the mental health and health-care utilization consequences during the pandemic in this population Methods: We surveyed Pittsburgh HIV Lung Cohort participants from May through July 2020 Demographic and clinical data included age, sex, race and smoking history Anxiety, depression and insomnia during the pandemic were evaluated using the General Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 and Insomnia Severity Index The survey assessed for COVID-19 symptoms, health-care access/ utilization and risk/protective behaviours Continuous variables were compared between participants with and without COPD using t-test and Mann-Whitney test as appropriate and categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact test Multiple and ordinal logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of COPD and any interaction effect by HIV status with anxiety, depression, insomnia, general health status, health-care utilization and risk/protective behaviours All statistical tests were two-sided Results: 136 individuals were included: age 57 9 9 5 years;76 5% male;60 3% Caucasian and 39% Black;47% current or former smokers Forty-two (30 9%) respondents screened positive for anxiety disorders, 35 (25 7%) had major depressive disorder and 7 (5 1%) reported insomnia Median scores and proportions across categories by severity of symptoms did not differ by COPD status Of 22 participants with new or worsening symptoms that could be related to COVID-19, only 10 sought medical care Participants with COPD reported similar levels of concern about seeking care due to potential COVID-19 exposures (50 0% versus 42 9%;P=0 64), interruptions in medical care (30 4% versus 27 4%;P=0 801) and a trend to less delay in diagnostic testing as those without COPD (8 7% versus 20 4%;P=0 247) Individuals with COPD were more likely to have sought emergent or urgent care since March (30 4% versus 8 0%;P=0 007) Although all respondents reported practicing social-distancing and masking, the majority (119;87 5%) had in fact continued interacting with people outside the household and 38 (27 9%) joined large gatherings Those with COPD reported similar risk behaviour as those without There was no interaction effect by HIV status See Table 1 Conclusions: Anxiety, depression and concern of COVID-19 exposure were prevalent among persons with and without COPD or HIV Many respondents experienced interruptions in medical care and diagnostic testing and concern about health-care-associated COVID-19 exposure, but this was not more severe inthose with COPD or HIV Despite likely higher risk of poor outcome in those with COPD, individuals with COPD were not more likely to curtail social interactions than those without COPD HIV status also did not seem to modify the impact of COVID-19 on behaviours in this group","output":"The impact of COVID-19 and its response on the psychosocial wellbeing and medical care among persons living with HIV and COPD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although parosmia is a common problem in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, few studies assessed the demographic and clinical aspects of this debilitating symptom. We aimed to evaluate the socio-clinical characteristics and outcome of various options of treatment of individuals with parosmia due to COVID-19 infection. The study was conducted at two main Hospitals in the Ramadi and Tikrit cities, Iraq, on patients with a chief complaint of parosmia due to COVID-19 disease. The study involved 7 months (August 2020-February 2021). Detailed demographic and clinical characteristics and treatment options with their outcome were recorded and analyzed. Out of 268 patients with parosmia, there were 197 (73.5%) females. The majority were from age group &#8804; 30 years (n = 188, 70.1%), housewives (n = 150, 56%), non-smokers (n = 222, 82.8%), and associated with dysgeusia (n = 207, 77.2%) but not associated with nasal symptoms (n = 266, 99.3%). All patients have complained of anosmia (89.9%) or hyposmia (10.1%). Troposmia was reported in the majority of participants. The majority of the patients were suffering from severe parosmia (65.7%). Around 3 quarters of the cases were presented in &#8804; 4 months. Altered quality of life (AQL) was presented in 91.8% of subjects, and there was a significant association with the presence of dysgeusia and type and severity of parosmia.

Rapid response and timely modifications in the emergency department (ED) for infection control are paramount to maintaining basic medical services and preventing the spread of COVID-19. This study presents the unique measure of combining a fever screening station (FSS) and graded approach to isolation and testing in a Taiwanese medical center. METHODS: An FSS was immediately set up outside the ED on January 27, 2019. A graded approach was adopted to stratify patients into high risk, intermediate risk, and undetermined risk for both isolation and testing. RESULTS: A total of 3755 patients were screened at the FSS, with 80.3% visiting the ED from home, 70.9% having no travel history, 21.4% having traveled to Asia, and 10.0% of TVGH staff. Further, 54.9% had fever, 35.5% had respiratory symptoms, 3.2% had gastrointestinal symptoms, 0.6% experienced loss of smell, and 3.1% had no symptoms; 81.3% were discharged, 18.6% admitted, and 0.1% died. About 1.9% were admitted to the intensive care unit, 10.3% to the general ward, and 6.4% were isolated. Two patients tested positive for COVID-19 (0.1%) and 127 (3.4%) tested positive for atypical infection; 1471 patients were tested for COVID-19; 583 were stratified as high-risk, 781 as intermediate-risk, and 107 as undetermined-risk patients. CONCLUSION: Rapid response for infection control is a paramount in the ED to confront the COVID-19 outbreak. The FFS helped divide the flow of high- and intermediate-risk patients; it also decreased the ED workload during a surge of febrile patients. A graded approach to testing uses risk stratification to prevent nosocomial infection of asymptomatic patients. A graded approach to isolation enables efficient allocation of scarce medical resources according to risk stratification.","output":"Emergency department response to coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak with a fever screening station and graded approach for isolation and testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Pre-emptive inhaled antibiotics may be effective to reduce the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia among critically ill patients.

The aim of this study was to highlight how the challenges countered by grant project teams continuing their projects and demonstrating their skills to adapt to an increasingly difficult environment. Methods. This was a mixed methodology study for which data were obtained from the evaluation of annual reports submitted by the projects. The annual reports review comprised of answers to questions on whether project objectives were met, problems or barriers encountered, and reviewer feedback in the form of specific concerns or recommendations. The reports were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. Results. A total of 34 (92%) of annual reports were included with 17 (94%) received in 2020 and 17 (89%) in 2021. Compared to 2020, in 2021 the projects that indicated meeting objectives increased by more than half from 29% to 58%. Over one third of the projects encountered barriers in both years. The percentage of projects with major concerns decreased by almost 2/3 in 2021 while unexpected expenses decreased by 1/3. Four themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: Concerns over COVID-19, Barriers to accomplishing project goals, Positivity around adaptations, and Despair over lack of ability to overcome challenges.

SF3B1 is frequently mutated in cancer and is the target of distinct families of splicing modulators (SMs). Among these, H3B-8800 is of particular interest, as it induces preferential lethality in cancer cells bearing the frequent and highly pathogenic K700E SF3B1 mutation. Despite the potential of H3B-8800 to treat myeloid leukemia and other cancer types hallmarked by SF3B1 mutations, the molecular mechanism underlying its preferential lethality towards spliceosome-mutant cancer cells remains elusive. Here, microsecond-long all-atom simulations addressed the binding/dissociation mechanism of H3B-8800 to wild type and K700E SF3B1-containing SF3b ((K700E)SB3b) complexes at the atomic level, unlocking that the K700E mutation little affects the thermodynamics and kinetic traits of H3B-8800 binding. This supports the hypothesis that the selectivity of H3B-8800 towards mutant cancer cells is unrelated to its preferential targeting of (K700E)SB3b. Nevertheless, this set of simulations discloses that the K700E mutation and H3B-8800 binding affect the overall SF3b internal motion, which in turn may influence the way SF3b interacts with other spliceosome components. Finally, we unveil the existence of a putative druggable SF3b pocket in the vicinity of K700E that could be harnessed in future rational drug-discovery efforts to specifically target mutant SF3b.","output":"Investigating the Molecular Mechanism of H3B-8800: A Splicing Modulator Inducing Preferential Lethality in Spliceosome-Mutant Cancers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has now affected over 72.5 million people worldwide, with nearly 1.6 million deaths reported globally as of December 17, 2020.

Crossing of the species barrier and exhibition of zoonosis have been reported in SARS-CoV-2 in farm (minks), domesticated (cats and dogs), and wild animals (tigers, puma, and lions). Recently, the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in mink farms, which led to the death of a myriad minks. The clinical and pathological findings of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the rapid animal-to-animal transmission in minks are almost similar to the findings observed in patients with COVID-19. Additionally, the rapid virus transmission among minks and the associated mutations resulted in a new mink-associated variant that was identified in both minks and humans, thereby providing evidence of mink-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The new mink-associated SARS-CoV-2 variant with a possible reduced sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies poses serious risks and is expected to have a direct effect on the diagnostic techniques, therapeutics, and vaccines that are currently under development.

The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has imposed severe restrictions to such an interventional environment. The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 is transmitted mainly through expelled respiratory particles, which are known to travel approximately 3-6 feet away from infected persons. During PCI, that contamination range obligatorily poses the team and the patient to direct air exposure. We herein present a case report with the description of a minimum-contact strategy to reduce interpersonal air exposure during PCI. The approach designed to minimize proximity between the patient and the healthcare team included the performance of robotic-assisted PCI, operated by unscrubbed cardiac interventionalists from a control cockpit located outside the catheterization suite. Also included, was the delineation of the potential zone of respiratory particle spread; a circle measuring 4 meters (13.1 feet) in diameter was traced on the floor of the cath lab with red tape, centered on the patient's mouth and nose. The team was rigorously trained and advised to minimize time spent within the 4-meter perimeter as much as possible during the procedure. Following this strategy, a 60-year-old male with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and COVID-19 was treated with successful coronary implantation of two stents in the obtuse marginal branch and one stent in the circumflex artery. The total duration of the procedure was 103 minutes and 22 seconds. During most of the procedure, the 4-meter spread zone was not entered by any personnel. For each individual team member, the proposed strategy was effective in ensuring that they stayed outside of the 4-meter area for the majority of their work time, ranging from 96.9% to 59.7% of their respective participation.

[99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept may be of benefit in OSCC with complex lymphatic drainage patterns and close spatial relation to SLNs. METHODS: A prospective within-patient evaluation study was designed to compare [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept with [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid for SLN detection. A total of 20 patients with early-stage OSCC were included, who underwent lymphoscintigraphy with both tracers. Both lymphoscintigraphic images of each patient were evaluated for SLN detection and radiotracer distribution at 2-4 h post-injection. RESULTS: The injection site's remaining radioactivity was significantly lower for [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept (29.9%), compared with [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid (60.9%; p < 0.001). Radioactive uptake in SLNs was significantly lower for [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept (1.95%) compared with [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid (3.16%; p = 0.010). No significant difference was seen in SLN to injection site ratio in radioactivity between [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept (0.066) and [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid (0.054; p = 0.232). A median of 3.0 and 2.5 SLNs were identified with [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept and [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid, respectively (p = 0.297). Radioactive uptake in higher echelon nodes was not significantly different between [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept (0.57%) and [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid (0.86%) (p = 0.052). A median of 2.0 and 2.5 higher echelon nodes was identified with [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept and [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid, respectively (p = 0.083). CONCLUSION: [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept had a higher injection site clearance, but at the same time a lower uptake in the SLN, resulting in an SLN to injection site ratio, which was not significantly different from [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid. The relatively low-radioactive uptake in SLNs of [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept may limit intraoperative detection of SLNs, but can be overcome by a higher injection dose.","output":"Sentinel lymph node detection in oral cancer: a within-patient comparison between [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept and [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced general practice to react and adapt its modus operandi in various ways We describe most important practical adaptations according to the chronology imposed by the different phases of this unprecedented crisis, during the first three quarters of 2020 The Belgian health system and all its components have been put under tension General medicine has been able to build on its strengths but has also suffered from certain weaknesses Initial lessons must be learnt in order to better respond to the challenges of tomorrow","output":"[Resilience and responsiveness of general practice during the COVID-19 pandemic]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic we, the nuclear medicine (NM) community, expediently mobilized to enable continuity of essential services to the best of our abilities.

Challenges in radionuclide supply chains were identified and often met. NM procedural volumes declined globally and underwent restoration of varying degrees, contingent upon local contexts. Serial surveys have gauged and chronicled such geographical variance of the impact of COVID-19 on NM service delivery and, though it may be too early to fully understand the long-term consequences of reduced NM services, overall we can certainly expect that this era adversely affected the management of many patients afflicted with non-communicable diseases. Today we are unquestionably better prepared to face unforeseen outbreaks, but a degree of uncertainty lingers.

DESIGN: A multicentre study of inpatients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 compared with age/gender-matched patients with COVID-19 alone and cirrhosis alone was performed. COVID-19 and cirrhosis characteristics, development of organ failures and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and mortality (inpatient death+hospice) were compared. RESULTS: 37 patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 were matched with 108 patients with COVID-19 and 127 patients with cirrhosis from seven sites. Race/ethnicity were similar. Patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 had higher mortality compared with patients with COVID-19 (30% vs 13%, p=0.03) but not between patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 and patients with cirrhosis (30% vs 20%, p=0.16). Patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 versus patients with COVID-19 alone had equivalent respiratory symptoms, chest findings and rates of intensive care unit transfer and ventilation. However, patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 had worse Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI 6.53.1 vs 3.32.5, p<0.001), lower presenting GI symptoms and higher lactate. Patients with cirrhosis alone had higher cirrhosis-related complications, maximum model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and lower BiPAP/ventilation requirement compared with patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19, but CCI and ACLF rates were similar. In the entire group, CCI (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.37, p<0.0001) was the only variable predictive of mortality on multivariable regression.

SETTING: A tertiary cancer center in northern Italy. PATIENTS: Overall, 17 patients underwent laparoscopic procedures for the management of suspected or documented gynecologic malignancies. The median age was 57 years (range 26C77). The surgical indications included endometrial cancer (n = 11), borderline ovarian tumor (n = 3), early-stage ovarian cancer (n = 1), stage IA cervical cancer after diagnostic conization (n = 1), and an ovarian cyst that turned out to be benign at final histologic examination (n = 1). INTERVENTIONS: We evaluated all consecutive women scheduled to have laparoscopic procedures for suspected or documented gynecologic cancers. The patients underwent planned laparoscopic surgery. At the end of the laparoscopic procedures (after extubation), we performed reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from both the endotracheal tube and the filter applied on the trocar valve. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In 1 patient, both swab tests (endotracheal tube and trocar valve filter) showed amplification of the N gene on RT-PCR analysis. This case was considered to be a presumptive positive case. In another case, the RT-PCR analysis showed an amplification curve for the N gene only in the swab test performed on the filter.

We aimed to track molecular evolution and spread of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Esteio (Southern Brazil) using phylogenetics and phylodynamics inferences from 21 new genomes in global and regional context. Importantly, the case fatality rate (CFR) in Esteio (3.26%) is slightly higher compared to the Rio Grande do Sul (RS) state (2.56%) and the entire Brazil (2.74%). RESULTS: We provided a comprehensive view of mutations from a representative sampling from May to October 2020, highlighting two frequent mutations in spike glycoprotein (D614G and V1176F), an emergent mutation (E484K) in spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) characteristic of the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages, and the adjacent replacement of 2 amino acids in Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (R203K and G204R). E484K was found in two genomes from mid-October, which is the earliest description of this mutation in Southern Brazil. Lineages containing this substitution must be subject of intense surveillance due to its association with immune evasion.

ObjectiveThis systematic review aims to summarize the reported effectiveness of FTA cards? for storage and transport of viral RNA, as well as the conditions for their handling and use in downstream processes. Finally, the biosafety measures required to protect researchers and clinical lab workers are considered. MethodsWe performed a systematic review following the PRISMA statement. We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus and Web of Science using the keywords FTA cards AND RNA. Articles were screened by title and abstract, and after examination of inclusion and exclusion criteria, relevant information was extracted. The quality of the studies was assessed, and the evidence was qualitatively summarized. ResultsA total of 175 records were retrieved, and 11 additional documents were found by checking references of the eligible articles. A total of 47 articles were included. Samples from animals accounted for 38.3% of the publications, which identified viruses that cause disease in poultry, wild birds, suids, or bovids. Three different methods for RNA extraction were reported. Other factors that vary across reports include the size of RNA amplicon, storage temperature, and duration of storage.

It is considered sufficient for an event if the event is unavoidable in the presence of the cause. The degrees of necessity and sufficiency, ranging from zero to one, are simple, intuitive functions of unconditional and conditional probabilities of an event such as disease or death. These probabilities often will be derived from logistic regression models; the measures, however, do not require any particular model.

A plethora of studies, globally, have suggested the existence of a sex disparity in the outcome of COVID-19 patients, that is mainly due to mechanisms of viral infection, immune response to the virus, development of a hyperinflammation, and development of systemic complications, particularly thromboembolism. These differences appear to be more pronounced in elderly COVID-19 patients. Epidemiological data report a sex difference in the severity and outcome of COVID-19 disease with a more favourable course of the disease in women compared to men, regardless of age range although the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to be similar in both sexes. Sex hormones, including androgens and estrogens, may not only impact viral entry and load, but also shape the clinical manifestations, complications and, ultimately, the outcome of COVID-19 disease. The current review comprehensively summarizes current literature on sex disparities in susceptibility and outcomes of COVID-19 disease as well as the literature underpinning the pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms, which may provide a rationale to a sex disparity. These include sex hormone influences on molecules that facilitate virus entry and priming, as well as the immune and inflammatory response, as well as coagulation and thrombosis diathesis. Based on present evidence, women appear to be relatively protected from COVID-19 because of a more effective immune response and a less pronounced systemic inflammation, with consequent moderate clinical manifestations of the disease, together with a lesser predisposition to thromboembolism. Conversely, men appear to be particularly susceptible to COVID-19 disease because of a less effective immune response with consequent increased susceptibility to infections, together with a greater predisposition to thromboembolism. In elderlies, sex disparities in overall mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection is even more palpable, as elderly men appear more prone to severe COVID-19 because of a greater predisposition to infections, a weaker immune defence and an enhanced thrombotic state compared to women.

DUB activity is usually assayed using full-length ubiquitin, and these enzymes generally show low activity towards small substrates that constitute the P4-P1 LRGG (Lys-Arg-Gly-Gly) C-terminal motif of ubiquitin. To gain insight into the C-terminal recognition region of ubiquitin by DUBs, we synthesized positional scanning libraries of fluorigenic tetrapeptides and tested them on three examples of human DUBs [OTU-1 (ovarian tumour 1), Iso-T (isopeptidase T) and UCH-L3 (ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L3)] and one viral ubiquitin-specific protease, namely PLpro (papain-like protease) from SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus. In most cases the results show flexibility in the P4 position, very high specificity for arginine in the P3 position and glycine in the P2 position, in accord with the sequence of the natural substrate, ubiquitin. Surprisingly, screening of the P2 position revealed that UCH-L3, in contrast with all the other tested DUBs, demonstrates substantial tolerance of alanine and valine at P2, and a parallel analysis using the appropriate mutation of the full-length ubiquitin confirms this. We have also used an optimal tetrapeptide substrate, acetyl-Lys-Arg-Gly-Gly-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, to investigate the activation mechanism of DUBs by ubiquitin and elevated salt concentration.

INTRODUCTION: The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has catalized several changes in many fields of our lives, and also at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of Debrecen, Hungary. OBJECTIVES: We wanted to analyse the compound effect of our new local protocols regarding elective labour inductions at term, the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting infection control measures, the merging of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Ward of the Kenzy County Hospital of Debrecen and the University Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and also the change of the legal environment. METHODS: Local protocols were introduced: 1. Labour induction. 2. Cervical ripening in labour induction. 3. Choosing the route of delivery after cesarean. 4. Management of pregnancy around term in the case of planned trial of labour after cesarean. We compared the obstetrical data (number of deliveries, cesarean section rate, perinatal outcome and the rate and success rate of labour inductions) before and after the implementation of the protocols. The results were also compared to the Hungarian national database. RESULTS: The annual cesarean rate at our department dropped to 33.5% in 2020. In the first 9-month period, after the introduction of the new reforms, the cesarean rate decreased to 30.7%, whereas the Hungarian national rate was 40.3% in 2020. At our department, 20% of all the deliveries were induced and 74% of them led to vaginal deliveries in 2020, while in 2019 only 11% of deliveries were labour inductions, and 47% of these cases were vaginal deliveries. The monthly number of deliveries was rising constantly between January 2020 (250 deliveries) and January 2021 (450 deliveries), and the monthly cesarean rate decreased from 41% to 25%. Comparing the data of 2019 and 2020, the annual perinatal mortality rate dropped from 6.3? in 2019 to 4.2? in 2020. Neonatal morbidity, as measured by admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit, also decreased (14.8% in 2019 and 13.5% in 2020). CONCLUSIONS: As a compound result of the described factors, but mainly due to the new protocols, both the rate and the success rate of labour inductions increased significantly, while the cesarean rate decreased with improving perinatal mortality and morbidity.

Using 508 ESCC genomes, we identified five novel significantly mutated genes and uncovered mutational signature clusters associated with metastasis and patients outcomes. Several functional assays implicated that NFE2L2 may act as a tumor suppressor in ESCC and that mutations in NFE2L2 probably impaired its tumor-suppressive function, or even conferred oncogenic activities. Additionally, we found that the NFE2L2 mutations were significantly associated with worse prognosis of ESCC. We also identified potential noncoding driver mutations including hotspot mutations in the promoter region of SLC35E2 that were correlated with worse survival. Approximately 5.9% and 15.2% of patients had high tumor mutation burden or actionable mutations, respectively, and may benefit from immunotherapy or targeted therapies. We found clinically relevant coding and noncoding genomic alterations and revealed three major subtypes that robustly predicted patients outcomes. Collectively, we report the largest dataset of genomic profiling of ESCC useful for developing ESCC-specific biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.","output":"Whole-genome sequencing of 508 patients identifies key molecular features associated with poor prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human noroviruses (HuNoV) are a significant cause of acute gastroenteritis in the developed world, and yet our understanding of the molecular pathways involved in norovirus replication and pathogenesis has been limited by the inability to efficiently culture these viruses in the laboratory. Using the murine norovirus (MNV) model, we have recently identified a network of host factors that interact with the 5 and 3 extremities of the norovirus RNA genome. In addition to a number of well-known cellular RNA binding proteins, the molecular chaperone Hsp90 was identified as a component of the ribonucleoprotein complex. Here, we show that the inhibition of Hsp90 activity negatively impacts norovirus replication in cell culture. Small-molecule-mediated inhibition of Hsp90 activity using 17-DMAG (17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin) revealed that Hsp90 plays a pleiotropic role in the norovirus life cycle but that the stability of the viral capsid protein is integrally linked to Hsp90 activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both the MNV-1 and the HuNoV capsid proteins require Hsp90 activity for their stability and that targeting Hsp90 in vivo can significantly reduce virus replication. In summary, we demonstrate that targeting cellular proteostasis can inhibit norovirus replication, identifying a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of norovirus infections. IMPORTANCE HuNoV are a major cause of acute gastroenteritis around the world. RNA viruses, including noroviruses, rely heavily on host cell proteins and pathways for all aspects of their life cycle. Here, we identify one such protein, the molecular chaperone Hsp90, as an important factor required during the norovirus life cycle. We demonstrate that both murine and human noroviruses require the activity of Hsp90 for the stability of their capsid proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that targeting Hsp90 activity in vivo using small molecule inhibitors also reduces infectious virus production. Given the considerable interest in the development of Hsp90 inhibitors for use in cancer therapeutics, we identify here a new target that could be explored for the development of antiviral strategies to control norovirus outbreaks and treat chronic norovirus infection in immunosuppressed patients.","output":"Molecular Chaperone Hsp90 Is a Therapeutic Target for Noroviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to provide evidence for, at which vital and laboratory values, increased risk of 7-day mortality in acute adult patients on arrival to an emergency department (ED). DESIGN: A population-based cohort study. SETTING: ED at Odense University Hospital, Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: All patients 18 years with a first-time contact within the study period, 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2015. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was 7-day all-cause mortality. Variables were first recorded vital and laboratory values included in risk stratification scores; respiratory frequency, blood pressure, heart rate, Glasgow Coma Scale, temperature, saturation, creatinine, PaO(2), platelet count and bilirubin. The association between values and mortality was described using a restricted cubic spline. A predefined 7-day mortality of 2.5% was chosen as a relevant threshold. RESULTS: We included 40 423 patients, 52.5% women, median age 57 (IQR 38C74) years and 7-day mortality 2.8%. Seven-day mortality of 2.5% had thresholds of respiratory frequency <12 and >18/min, systolic blood pressure <112 and >192 mm Hg, heart rate <54 and >102 beats/min, temperature <36.0C and >39.8C, saturation <97%, Glasgow Coma Scale score <15, creatinine <41 and >98 mol/L for PaO(2) <9.9 and >12.3 kPa, platelet count <165 and >32710(9)/L and bilirubin >12 mol/L. CONCLUSION: Vital values on arrival, outside the normal ranges for the measures, are indicative of increased risk of short-term mortality, and most of the value thresholds are included in the lowest urgency level in triage and risk stratification scoring systems.","output":"Level of vital and laboratory values on arrival, and increased risk of 7-day mortality among adult patients in the emergency department: a population-based cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To discuss the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the pediatric cataract surgery services in a tertiary care institute in India, as well as the protocol followed for these surgeries. METHODS: COVID-19 has hampered outpatient and elective services and surgeries throughout the world. During the national lockdown imposed in March in India, outpatient services were suspended in our institute, leading to a tremendous backlog of pediatric patients with cataract. Since the delay in surgery in pediatric cataract can cause amblyopia, our institute had resumed pediatric cataract surgeries in June 2020 at the time of Unlock-1 in the country. RESULTS: We have discussed the percentage of reduction in pediatric cataract surgeries in 2020 during the Unlock 1, 2, 3, and 4, as compared to the number of surgeries done by the pediatric ophthalmology unit in the same months last year. We had introduced triage and telemedicine in our department. We have discussed the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative protocol followed in our institute for children with pediatric cataract, and also the measures which can be taken for the safety of patients and staff.

We present a case of an immunocompromised patient with acquired B-cell deficiency who developed an indolent, protracted course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remdesivir therapy alleviated symptoms and produced a transient virologic response, but her course was complicated by recrudescence of high-grade viral shedding. Whole genome sequencing identified a mutation, E802D, in the nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase which was not present in pre-treatment specimens. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the mutation conferred a ~6-fold increase in remdesivir IC50 but resulted in a fitness cost in the absence of remdesivir. Sustained clinical and virologic response was achieved after treatment with casirivimab-imdevimab. Although the fitness cost observed in vitro may limit the risk posed by E802D, this case illustrates the importance of monitoring for remdesivir resistance and the potential benefit of combinatorial therapies in immunocompromised patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"De novo emergence of a remdesivir resistance mutation during treatment of persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection in an immunocompromised patient: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona viruses COVID-19 is a novel and highly infectious virus emerged in December 2019, (Wuhan) China and affected a wide range of global population with deaths worldwide till date Lack of knowledge regarding the clinical management and treatment of infected patient has augmented this epidemic of China to get transformed into a global pandemic This review outlines briefly about the novel coronavirus, its taxonomic classification, associated symptoms, origin, life cycle and the treatment strategy which includes diagnosis as well as on-going trials related to antiviral drugs and vaccine with its pros and cons to combat SARS-CoV 2 infection Presently, to deal with the infection therapeutic strategies are only supportive and prevention is the best weapon to abate transmission in the community Efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus (CoV) infections such as MERS and SARS in the past decades However, to date, no licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS Researchers are searching for effective and suitable vaccine candidates and therapeutics for controlling the deadly COVID-19 There are no effective vaccines or specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19 Hence, we have to rely exclusively on enforcing strict preventive and control measures that minimize the risk of possible disease transmission There is an urgent requirement of vaccine to stop the spreading of SARS-CoV2 infection Since there is no antiviral drug or vaccine so it is important to enhance the host immune response against the infection We except our analysis to become a milestone for future studies helping with acting as a credible groundwork for their results","output":"Analysis on the Advantages and Disadvantages of Coronavirus Disease 19 on-Going Treatments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fate of ongoing infectious disease outbreaks is predicted through reproduction numbers, defining the long-term establishment of the infection, and epidemicity indices, tackling the reactivity of the infectious pool to new contagions. Prognostic metrics of unfolding outbreaks are of particular importance when designing adaptive emergency interventions facing real-time assimilation of epidemiological evidence. Our aim here is twofold. First, we propose a novel form of the epidemicity index for the characterization of cholera epidemics in spatial models of disease spread. Second, we examine in hindsight the survey of infections, treatments and containment measures carried out for the now extinct 2010C2019 Haiti cholera outbreak, to suggest that magnitude and timing of non-pharmaceutical and vaccination interventions imply epidemiological responses recapped by the evolution of epidemicity indices. Achieving negative epidemicity greatly accelerates fading of infections and thus proves a worthwhile target of containment measures. We also show that, in our model, effective reproduction numbers and epidemicity indices are explicitly related. Therefore, providing an upper bound to the effective reproduction number (significantly lower than the unit threshold) warrants negative epidemicity and, in turn, a rapidly fading outbreak preventing coalescence of sparse local sub-threshold flare-ups.","output":"Epidemicity of cholera spread and the fate of infection control measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As an emerging business model, the sharing economy has gained a large amount of academic attention;the pricing problem in the sharing economy has also been widely investigated.

Expending our understanding of the transmission routes of the viral infection is crucial in controlling the outbreak. It is unclear whether the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) can directly infect the testes or male genital tract and be sexually transmitted from males. Methods: From January 31 to March 14, 2020, 12 patients in recovery and one patient died of COVID-19 were included in this descriptive study. The clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, chest CT scans and outcome data were recorded. To examine whether there is sexual transmission from male, we employed realtime polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect 2019-nCov in semen or testicular biopsy specimen. Findings: The age range of the 12 patients in recovery was 22-38 years. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia. As of March 14, 2020, ten patients discharged from the hospital while the rest 2 had developed into recovery stage. All of the patients in recovery tested negative for 2019-nCoV RNA in semen samples.

In an effort to slow down the infection, physical distancing and isolation policies have been implemented in Turkey, likewise the rest of the world. Thereby, rheumatic diseases require to obey the self-isolation recommendations strictly due to general vulnerability to infections in those patients. Due to the precautions taken for isolation, the physical inactivity level of the patients which would affect the disease activity has increased (1). Objectives: The primary purpose of this study was to assess the exercise compliance and clinical status of the patients with rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary aim of the study was to evaluate the physical activity level and quality of life of the patients during the pandemic. Methods: The research is a cross-sectional study. Seventy-nine patients with various rheumatic diseases were included in the study. Standard questions were used to evaluate the exercise habits, the level of pain and morning stiffness and severity of exacerbations. Pain and morning stiffness levels and attack severity were scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS) (0-10;with 0 indicating no pain/stiffness and 10 severe pain/stiffness). Attack duration was recorded in number of exacerbated days. Parameters were compared before and after the pandemic with Paired Samples T Test. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ) and Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) Questionnaire were filled to assess the physical activity level and quality of life. Results: Twenty-eight percent of the patients were diagnosed with Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), 37% were Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), 14% were Systemic Sclerosis (ScS) 14% were Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), 6% were Rheumatoid Arthritis, 1% were Primary Sjogren Syndrome (PSS). Less than half of the patients (46%) did continue exercising regularly during the pandemic and 30 (81%) of them performed only the exercises given by the therapist while 7 (9%) of them tried different exercise types from another source. The reason for discontinuation to exercising expressed by the incompliant patients were mostly unwillingness (17 of 37 patients). Pain, morning stiffness and number of attacks were better during the pandemic compared to before however, a statistically significant difference was found only for morning stiffness (p = .036). The results of IPAQ showed that the majority of the patients (n: 48) were physically inactive, while only 2 patients were active during the pandemic. The most deteriorated quality of life subcategory was energy level of the patients according to the NHP scores. Conclusion: This study results showed that patients with rheumatic diseases stayed physically inactive during the pandemic and the disease status has also been affected negatively. As the duration of the pandemic prolongs, levels of physical inactivity would increase and the progressive physical inactivity is expected to worsen patients' symptoms more. However, as the pandemic appears to continue, face-to-face exercise therapy should still be avoided. For all those reasons above, alternative ways of therapy like tele-rehabilitation would come onto stage to cope with the increasing physical inactivity of the rheumatic patients.","output":"Exercise compliance and disease status in patients with rheumatic diseases during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the rapid emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 lineages B.1.619 and B.1.620 in South Korea.

However, very little is known about how ageing influences human NK cells, especially at the single-cell level. METHODS: We applied single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) to human lymphocytes and NK cells from 4 young and 4 elderly individuals and then analysed the transcriptome data using Seurat. We detected the proportion and phenotype of NK cell subsets in peripheral blood samples from a total of 62 young and 52 elderly healthy donors by flow cytometry. We also used flow cytometry to examine the effector functions of NK cell subsets upon IFN-/IL-12+IL-15/K562/IL-2 stimulation in vitro in peripheral blood samples from a total of 64 young and 63 elderly healthy donors. We finally studied and integrated single-cell transcriptomes of NK cells from 15 young and 41 elderly COVID-19 patients with those from 12 young and 6 elderly healthy control individuals to investigate the impacts of ageing on NK cell subsets in COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: We discovered a memory-like NK subpopulation (NK2) exhibiting the largest distribution change between elderly and young individuals among lymphocytes. Notably, we discovered a unique NK subset that was predominantly CD52(+) NK2 cells (NK2.1). These memory-like NK2.1 cells accumulated with age, exhibited proinflammatory characteristics, and displayed a type I interferon response state. Integrative analyses of a large-cohort COVID-19 dataset and our datasets revealed that NK2.1 cells from elderly COVID-19 patients are enriched for type I interferon signalling, which is positively correlated with disease severity in COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a unique memory-like NK cell subset that accumulates with ageing and correlates with disease severity in COVID-19. Our results identify memory-like NK2.1 cells as a potential target for developing immunotherapies for infectious diseases and for addressing age-related dysfunctions of the immune system.

Activation of pro-oxidative pathways and boosting of inflammatory cytokines are always encountered in viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. So, the importance of counteracting cytokine storm in COVID-19 pathology is highly important, to hamper the immunogenic damage of the endothelium and alveolar membranes. Antioxidants prevent oxidative processes, by impeding radical species generation. It has been proved that vitamin intake lowers oxidative stress markers, alleviates cytokine storm and has a potential role in lowering disease severity, by lowering pro-inflammatory cytokines, hampering hyperinflammation and organ failure.

Clinical guidelines for CLL describe immunoglobulin administration in patients with a low IgG who have experienced a severe/repeated bacterial infection. The utility in hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) remains unknown. Although an early randomized trial demonstrated that IgRT decreased infection risk and transplant-related mortality after HSCT, subsequent clinical trials could not validate the benefit. Consequently, a meta-analysis did not show the benefit of IgRT in HSCT. Most of the available data derives from matched-related HSCT using myeloablative regimen, and the impact in haploidentical and cord blood transplantation, or reduced-intensity HSCT remains unknown. One crucial issue is that no studies exist for patients with only hypogammaglobulinemia after HSCT.

EXPERT OPINION: We advise to establish and improve existing laws, regulations, and also prevention and control systems for the emergent R&D and application of vaccines in response to potential infectious diseases. The strategies would not only help increase the various abilities in response to the research, development, evaluation, production, and supervision of emergency vaccines, but also establish surrogate endpoint of immunogenicity protection in early clinical studies to enable a rapid evaluation of the efficacy of emergency vaccines.","output":"The next major emergent infectious disease: reflections on vaccine emergency development strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Performance-based financing (PBF) is advocated as an effective means to improve the quality of care by changing healthcare providers behavior.

We estimate the effects of discontinuing PBF in Egypt on family planning, maternal health, and child health outcomes. We use a difference-in-differences (DiD) model with fixed effects, exploiting a unique dataset of six waves of spatially constructed facility-level health outcomes. We find that discontinuing performance-based incentives to providers had a negative effect on the knowledge of contraceptive methods, iron supplementation during pregnancy, the prevalence of childhood acute respiratory infection, and, more importantly, under-five child mortality, all of which were indirectly targeted by the PBF scheme. No significant effects are reported for directly targeted outcomes.

In a previous study we laid the foundation of a theory of complexity and showed that because of the blind nature of evolution, and molecular and historical contingency, cells have accumulated unnecessary complexity, complexity beyond what is necessary and sufficient to describe an organism. Here we provide empirical evidence and show that unnecessary complexity has become integrated into the genome in the form of redundancy and is relevant to molecular evolution of phenotypic complexity. Unnecessary complexity creates uncertainty between molecular and phenotypic complexity, such that phenotypic complexity (C(P)) is higher than molecular complexity (C(M)), which is higher than DNA complexity (C(D)). The qualitative inequality in complexity is based on the following hierarchy: C(P) > C(M) > C(D). This law-like relationship holds true for all complex traits, including complex diseases. We present a hypothesis of two types of variation, namely open and closed (hidden) systems, show that hidden variation provides a hitherto undiscovered third source of phenotypic variation, beside genotype and environment, and argue that missing heritability for some complex diseases is likely to be a case of diluted heritability. There is a need for radically new ways of thinking about the principles of genotypeCphenotype relationship. Understanding how cells use hidden, pathway variation to respond to stress can shed light on why two individuals who share the same risk factors may not develop the same disease, or how cancer cells escape death.","output":"Decoding Unnecessary Complexity: A Law of Complexity and a Concept of Hidden Variation Behind Missing Heritability in Precision Medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this paper is to describe the duties of local government units under the legal conditions related to access to the ICT network in Poland Establishing public-private partnerships in the telecommunications sector, which is a field closely tied with cybersecurity, seems inevitable and necessary The need to cooperate is the consequence of the development of information and communication technologies, which leads to their increasingly wide application in all aspects of social life The tasks of local government involving network access have become key to the process of broadband network development That is why public funding becomes particularly important in its absence, justified by the need to provide conditions for internet access as a human right This has become especially topical as we face the challenges of COVID-19","output":"Access to the ICT Network as a Public Task of Local Government"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plant-derived exosome-like nanoparticles (PDENs) are small vesicles released by multivesicular bodies mainly to communicate between cells and regulate immunity against pathogen attack.

However, no studies have been published to give insight into Polish physicians opinions about medical cannabis. Objectives: To investigate physicians opinions about cannabinoids utility in clinical practice, concerns regarding their safety profile, and their clinical experience with cannabinoids. Methods: The survey using a self-developed tool was conducted online; participants were physicians with or without specialist training. Participation was voluntary. Physicians were recruited through personal networks, palliative care courses, and Medical Chambers. Results: From June to October 2020, we recruited 173 physicians from 15/16 voivodeships. The largest age group (43.9%; n = 76) was 30C39 year-olds. A similar proportion declared they never used cannabis and did not receive any training regarding cannabinoids (60% for both). Only 15 (8%) ever prescribed medical cannabis, although about 50% declared knowing suitable patients for such therapy, and 53.8% had at least one patient proactively asking for such treatment in the last 6 mo. The most common indication chosen was pain: chronic cancer-related (n = 128), chronic non-cancer (n = 77), and neuropathic (n = 60). Other commonly chosen conditions were alleviation of cancer treatment side-effects (n = 56) and cachexia (n = 57). The overall safety profile of THC was assessed as similar to most commonly used medications, including opioids; NSAIDs and benzodiazepines were, however, perceived as safer. Conclusions: Polish physicians favored the legalization of medical cannabis. However, it is of concern that a limited number have any experience with prescribing cannabis.

Sympathetic nerve fibres are innervated into all the lymphoid organs (bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes) and provide a communication link between the central nervous system (CNS) and ongoing immune response in the tissue microenvironment. Neurotransmitters such as catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) bind to adrenergic receptors present on most immune and non-immune cells, establish a local neuroimmune-communication system, and help regulate the ongoing immune response. The activation of these receptors varies with the type of receptor-activated, target cell, the activation status of the cells, and timing of activation. Activating adrenergic receptors, specifically -adrenergic signalling in immune cells leads to activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway or other non-canonical pathways. It predominantly leads to immune suppression such as inhibition of IL-2 secretion and a decrease in macrophages phagocytosis. This review discusses the expression of different adrenergic receptors in various immune cells, signalling, and how it modulates immune cell function and contributes to health and diseases. Understanding the neuroimmune communication through adrenergic receptor signalling in immune cells could help to design better strategies to control inflammation and autoimmunity.","output":"Role of adrenergic receptor signalling in neuroimmune communication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To gain a deep insight into the additional drug-resistant profiles, genetic diversity, and transmission dynamics of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) circulating in Hunan province, drug susceptibility testing and whole-genome-sequencing were performed among RR-TB strains collected from Jan. 2013 to Jun. 2018 in Hunan province. A total of 124 RR-TB strains were recovered successfully and included into the final analysis. Lineage 2.2.1 was the dominant sublineage, accounting for 72.6% (90/124), followed by lineage 4.5 (11.3%, 14/124), lineage 4.4 (8.1%, 10/124), lineage 4.2 (6.5%, 8/124) and lineage 2.2.2 (1.6%, 2/124). Overall, 83.1% (103/124) and 3.2% (4/124) of RR-TB were MDR-TB and XDR-TB, respectively. Nearly 30% of RR-TB isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones, and 26.6% (33/124) were pre-XDR-TB. Moreover, 30.6% (38/124) of RR-TB strains were identified as phenotypically resistance to pyrazinamide. Totally, 17 clusters containing 48 (38.7%, 48/124) RR-TB strains were identified, ranging in size from 2 to 10 isolates.

Patients with diabetes are at risk for a severe course when infected with SARS-CoV-2. The present study aims to retrospectively examine mental health changes in patients with diabetes in Germany before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, and to furthermore explore potential predictors of such changes. Methods: Over the course of eight weeks in early summer 2020, 253 individuals diagnosed with diabetes participated in an online cross-sectional study. Participants completed an anonymous survey including demographics, depression (PHQ-2) and generalized anxiety symptoms (GAD-2), distress (DT), and health status (EQ-5D-3L). In addition, all instruments used were adjusted to measure participants mental health and health status before the COVID-19 outbreak. Additionally examined factors were COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions to face the pandemic, and the subjective level of information about COVID-19. Results: This study shows a significant increase in prevalence of depression symptoms, generalized anxiety symptoms and distress, as well as significantly decreased health statuses in diabetes patients after the COVID-19 outbreak. Increased depression symptoms, generalized anxiety symptoms and distress were predicted by COVID-19-related fear, whereas trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19 predicted higher depression symptoms. Conclusions: The results indicate a negative impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and health status in patients with diabetes.

Orf9b is a unique accessory protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. It is implicated in immune evasion by targeting mitochondria, where it associates with the versatile adapter TOM70. Here, we determined the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 orf9b in complex with the cytosolic segment of human TOM70 to 2.2 ?. A central portion of orf9b occupies the deep pocket in the TOM70 C-terminal domain (CTD) and adopts a helical conformation strikingly different from the ?-sheet-rich structure of the orf9b homodimer. Interactions between orf9b and TOM70 CTD are primarily hydrophobic and distinct from the electrostatic interaction between the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) EEVD motif and the TOM70 N-terminal domain (NTD). Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we demonstrated that the orf9b dimer does not bind TOM70, but a synthetic peptide harboring a segment of orf9b (denoted C-peptide) binds TOM70 with nanomolar KD. While the interaction between C-peptide and TOM70 CTD is an endothermic process, the interaction between Hsp90 EEVD and TOM70 NTD is exothermic, which underscores the distinct binding mechanisms at NTD and CTD pockets. Strikingly, the binding affinity of Hsp90 EEVD motif to TOM70 NTD is reduced by ~29-fold when orf9b occupies the pocket of TOM70 CTD, supporting the hypothesis that orf9b allosterically inhibits the Hsp90/TOM70 interaction.

Since then, it has achieved a high standard of success and has been established as a model for FETPs in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Here we describe the J-FETP, its role in building the epidemiologic capacity of Jordans public health workforce, and its activities and achievements, which have grown the program to be self-sustaining within the Jordan Ministry of Health. Since its inception, the programs residents and graduates have assisted the country to improve its surveillance systems, including revising the mortality surveillance policy, implementing the use of electronic data reporting, investigating outbreaks at national and regional levels, contributing to noncommunicable disease research and surveillance, and responding to regional emergencies and disasters. J-FETPs structure and systems of support from the Jordan Ministry of Health and local, regional, and international partners have contributed to the success and sustainability of the J-FETP. The J-FETP has contributed significantly to improvements in surveillance systems, control of infectious diseases, outbreak investigations, and availability of reliable morbidity and mortality data in Jordan. Moreover, the program has supported public health and epidemiology in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Best practices of the J-FETP can be applied to FETPs throughout the world.","output":"Jordan Field Epidemiology Training Program: Critical Role in National and Regional Capacity Building"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enteroviruses are a group of clinically relevant RNA viruses that causes human diseases [...].","output":"Special Issue Enteroviruses 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In democratic countries, public support for the judiciary is crucial to prevent abuse of power by the government. While facing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, governments may overly restrict their citizens' rights to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. This study examined whether voters would support a court's ruling if the court decided that the government's restriction of their rights was illegal and nullified the risk-averse policies. We suppose that voters faced with the risk of a pandemic will support a government with the expertise and resources to prevent a pandemic, and we set up the following hypotheses: If the courts nullify the measures against COVID-19, the public will not support the courts, and the government's failure to comply with the court's ruling will not diminish support for the government. We find support for these hypotheses in the contexts wherein the degree of restriction on voters' rights is weak. Because there is a close relationship between \\"public support for the court\\" and \\"government abuse of power,\\" we need to consider which factors determine support for the court.

We found that T cells, including CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells, were significantly decreased in severe COVID-19 symptoms but not in mild symptoms, in comparison with healthy people. T cells remained at a low level after recovery from severe COVID-19. CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(low) Treg-enriched cells were significantly increased in either mild or severe COVID-19 patients, regardless of recovery or not. Moreover, in either mild or severe COVID-19 patients, Treg-enriched cells up-regulated CD25 and down-regulated CD127. After recovery, CD25 was partially down-regulated but still higher than the normal level, while CD127 returned to the normal level in mild patients but not severe patients. B cells were decreased in mild patients and further decreased in severe patients, and remained low after recovery. NK cells were decreased only in severe COVID-19, with a tendency to return to the normal level after recovery. Plasma IL-6 and IL-10 were both elevated in severe patients but not in mild patients. After recovery, IL-6 remained higher than its normal level, while IL-10 returned to the normal level. Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that CD4(+) T cells, B cells, IL-6, and IL-10 were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity. Therefore, these parameters are indicators of COVID-19 severity.

Over the past decade, Canadians living with chronic pain have faced long waiting times for care within multidisciplinary pain clinics. We are concerned that ceasing in-person pain services exacerbates the daily hardships already faced by Canadians living with chronic pain. Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canadian pain clinics, their responses, and changes to clinic practices that might be maintained when the pandemic is over. Methods: A survey of Canadian adult multidisciplinary pain clinics was conducted to determine impacts on medical and allied health care services and the strategies used to deliver care to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Responses received from 17 adult pain clinics across Canada showed that adult multidisciplinary pain clinics had to cease or significantly reduce in-person patient contacts during the COVID-19 pandemic and responded by offering telehealth options. Despite their efforts, patients are waiting longer and have lost access to usual care. Increased levels of pain, stress, and medication use, particularly opioids and cannabinoids, were reported. Conclusions: Access to adaptable and innovative technologies, such as telehealth, can assist in the care of the one in five Canadians living with chronic pain during times of crises and must be included as a vital component of a comprehensive Canadian pain strategy.","output":"COVID-19 impact and response by Canadian pain clinics: A national survey of adult pain clinics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article offers information on Southern California, there were programs available that provided in-depth Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) classes and clinical training in both programs have subsequently closed, and leaving nowhere for therapists to get basic NICU training Topics include the goal is to reach out to NICU babies' parents and family to support them while their baby is in our care","output":"The Next Generation of NICU Staff"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the source of COVID-19, causes numerous clinical findings including respiratory and gastrointestinal findings.

Hematogenous spread to the nervous system has been described, with viral transmission along neuronal synapses in a retrograde fashion. The penetration of the virus to the central nervous system (CNS) allows for the resulting intracranial cytokine storm, which can result in a myriad of CNS complications.

At 6 months from the diagnosis, psychophysical evaluation of olfactory function was also performed using the 34-item culturally adapted University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (CA-UPSIT). 145 completed both the 6-month subjective and psychophysical olfactory evaluation. According to CA-UPSIT, 87 subjects (60.0%) exhibited some smell dysfunction, with 54 (37.2) being mildly microsmic, 16 (11.0%) moderately microsmic, 7 (4.8%) severely microsmic, and 10 patients (6.9%) being anosmic. At the time CA-UPSIT was administered, a weak correlation was observed between the self-reported alteration of sense of smell or taste and olfactory test scores (Spearman r=-0.26). Among 112 patients who self-reported normal sense of smell at last follow-up, CA-UPSIT revealed normal smell in 46 (41.1%), mild microsmia in 46 (41.1%), moderate microsmia in 11 (9.8%), severe microsmia in 3 (2.3%), and anosmia in 6 (5.4%) patients; however, of those patients self-reporting normal smell but who were found to have hypofunction on testing, 62 out of 66 had self-reported reduction in sense of smell or taste at an earlier time point.

TECHNIQUE For 3DRA, the C-arm was placed in the propeller position with the foot in an isocentric position. The patient's unaffected foot was positioned in a footrest outside the field of view. For correct timing of 3DRA, the delay from contrast injection in the popliteal artery at the level of knee joint to complete pedal arterial enhancement was assessed using DSA. With this delay, 3DRA was started after injection of 15 ml contrast. Imaging of the 3DRA could directly be reconstructed and visualized. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients undergoing 3DRA of the foot were prospectively registered. DSA and 3DRA images were scored separately for arterial patency and presence of collaterals. Treatment strategies were proposed based on DSA with and without the availability of 3DRA. RESULTS Eleven patients underwent 3DRA of the foot. One 3DRA was not included because the acquisition was focused on the heel instead of the entire foot. Diagnostic quality of 3DRA was good in all ten patients. 3DRA compared with DSA showed additional patent arteries in six patients, patent plantar arch in three patients, and collaterals between the pedal arteries in five patients.

To address this gap, we assessed whether adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies affect symptom trajectory during the pandemic. We also examined whether pre-pandemic integrity of brain regions implicated in depression and anxiety affect pandemic symptoms. METHODS: In a naturalistic sample of 169 adults (66.9% female; age 19C74 years) spanning psychiatric diagnoses and subclinical symptoms, we assessed anhedonia, tension, and anxious arousal symptoms using validated components (21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale), coping strategies (BriefCCoping Orientation to Problems Experienced), and gray matter volume (amygdala) and cortical thickness (hippocampus, insula, anterior cingulate cortex) from magnetic resonance imaging T1-weighted scans. We conducted general linear mixed-effects models to test preregistered hypotheses that 1) maladaptive coping pre-pandemic and 2) lower structural integrity pre-pandemic would predict more severe pandemic symptoms; and 3) coping would interact with neural structure to predict pandemic symptoms. RESULTS: Greater use of maladaptive coping strategies was associated with more severe anxious arousal symptoms during the pandemic (p = .011, false discovery rateCcorrected p [p(FDR)] = .035), specifically less self-distraction (p = .014, p(FDR) = .042) and greater self-blame (p = .002, p(FDR) = .012). Reduced insula thickness pre-pandemic predicted more severe anxious arousal symptoms (p = .001, p(FDR) = .027). Self-distraction interacted with amygdala volume to predict anhedonia symptoms (p = .005, p(FDR) = .020).

METHODS: A systematic review was conducted. We included studies that applied a physical capacity test in COVID-19 patients, post-infection. Two independent reviewers analyzed the studies, extracted the data, and assessed the quality of the evidence. RESULTS: A total of 1,228 studies were included, after removing duplicates, 1,005 abstracts were screened and of those 983 were excluded. A final number of nine studies which met the eligibility criteria were included. The findings revealed worsening of physical function and ADL performance in all patients post COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: All included studies found a reduction of ADL beyond the test or scale used, revealing a vital worsening of functional ability in ADL performance and consequently loss of independence in COVID-19 patients after the acute phase of infection.

Mounting evidence shows that COVID-19 is associated with neurological complications as well as effects thought to be related to neuroinflammatory processes. Due to the novelty of COVID-19, there is a need to better understand the possible long-term effects it may have on patients, particularly linkage to neuroinflammatory processes. Perivascular spaces (PVS) are small fluid-filled spaces in the brain that appear on MRI scans near blood vessels and are believed to play a role in modulation of the immune response, leukocyte trafficking, and glymphatic drainage. Some studies have suggested that increased number or presence of PVS could be considered a marker of increased blood-brain barrier permeability or dysfunction and may be involved in or precede cascades leading to neuroinflammatory processes. Due to their size, PVS are better detected on MRI at ultrahigh magnetic field strengths such as 7 Tesla, with improved sensitivity and resolution to quantify both concentration and size. As such, the objective of this prospective study was to leverage a semi-automated detection tool to identify and quantify differences in perivascular spaces between a group of 10 COVID-19 patients and a similar subset of controls to determine whether PVS might be biomarkers of COVID-19-mediated neuroinflammation. Results demonstrate a detectable difference in neuroinflammatory measures in the patient group compared to controls. PVS count and white matter volume were significantly different in the patient group compared to controls, yet there was no significant association between PVS count and symptom measures. Our findings suggest that the PVS count may be a viable marker for neuroinflammation in COVID-19, and other diseases which may be linked to neuroinflammatory processes.","output":"Semi-automated Segmentation and Quantification of Perivascular Spaces at 7 Tesla in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Tocilizumab (TCZ) is an anti-interleukin-6 antibody that has been used for the treatment of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, concrete evidence of its benefit in reducing mortality in severe COVID-19 is lacking. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant studies that compared the efficacy of TCZ in severe COVID-19 vs. standard of care (SOC) alone. Methods: A literature search for studies that compared tocilizumab and standard of care in the treatment of COVID-19 was done using major online databases from December 2019 to June 14, 2020. Search words Tocilizumab, anti-interleukin-6 antibody, and COVID-19 or coronavirus 2019 in various combinations were used. Articles in the form of abstracts, letters without original data, case reports, and reviews were excluded. Data were gathered on an Excel sheet, and statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3. Results: Sixteen studies were eligible from 693 initial studies, including 3,641 patients (64% males). There were 13 retrospective studies and three prospective studies. There were 2,488 patients in the SOC group (61.7%) and 1,153 patients (68.7%) in the TCZ group. The death rate in the TCZ group, 22.4% (258/1,153), was lower than in the SOC group, 26.21% (652/2,488) [pooled odds ratio 0.57 (95% CI 0.36C0.92), p = 0.02]. There was a significant heterogeneity (inconsistency index = 80%) among the included studies. Conclusion: The addition of TCZ to the SOC might reduce mortality in severe COVID-19. More extensive randomized clinical trials are needed to validate these findings.","output":"Addition of Tocilizumab to the Standard of Care Reduces Mortality in Severe COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Amazonas was one of the most heavily affected Brazilian states by the COVID-19 epidemic. Despite a large number of infected people, particularly during the second wave associated with the spread of the Variant of Concern (VOC) Gamma (lineage P.1), SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate in the Amazonas. To understand how SARS-CoV-2 persisted in a human population with a high immunity barrier, we generated 1,188 SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences from individuals diagnosed in the Amazonas state from 1st January to 6th July 2021, of which 38 were vaccine breakthrough infections. Our study reveals a sharp increase in the relative prevalence of Gamma plus (P.1+) variants, designated Pango Lineages P.1.3 to P.1.6, harboring two types of additional Spike changes: deletions in the N-terminal (NTD) domain (particularly Delta 144 or Delta 41-144) associated with resistance to anti-NTD neutralizing antibodies or mutations at the S1/S2 junction (N679K or P681H) that probably enhance the binding affinity to the furin cleavage site, as suggested by our molecular dynamics simulations. As lineages P.1.4 (S:N679K) and P.1.6 (S:P681H) expanded (Re > 1) from March to July 2021, the lineage P.1 declined (Re < 1) and the median Ct value of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in Amazonas significantly decreases. Still, we did not find an increased incidence of P.1 variants among breakthrough cases of fully vaccinated patients (71%) in comparison to unvaccinated individuals (93%). This evidence supports that the ongoing endemic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Amazonas is driven by the spread of new local Gamma/P.1 sublineages that are more transmissible, although not more efficient to evade vaccine-elicited immunity than the parental VOC. Finally, as SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread in human populations with a declining density of susceptible hosts, the risk of selecting more infectious variants or antibody evasion mutations is expected to increase. IMPORTANCE The continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is an expected phenomenon that will continue to happen due to the high number of cases worldwide. The present study analyzed how a Variant of Concern (VOC) could still circulate in a population hardly affected by two COVID-19 waves and with vaccination in progress. Our results showed that the answer behind that was a new generation of Gamma-like viruses, which emerged locally carrying mutations that made it more transmissible and more capable of spreading, partially evading prior immunity triggered by natural infections or vaccines. With thousands of new cases daily, the current pandemics scenario suggests that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to evolve and efforts to reduce the number of infected subjects, including global equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, are mandatory. Thus, until the end of pandemics, the SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance will be an essential tool to better understand the drivers of the viral evolutionary process.","output":"Spread of Gamma (P.1) Sub-Lineages Carrying Spike Mutations Close to the Furin Cleavage Site and Deletions in the N-Terminal Domain Drives Ongoing Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Amazonas, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite direct viral effect, the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) includes an overproduction of cytokines including interleukin 6 (IL-6) Therefore, tocilizumab (TOC), a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptors, was considered as a possible therapeutic option Patients were selected from the SARSTer database, containing 2332 individuals with COVID-19 Current study included 825 adult patients with moderate to severe course Analysis was performed in 170 patients treated with TOC and 655 with an alternative medication The end-points of treatment effectiveness were death rate, need for mechanical ventilation, and clinical improvement Patients treated with TOC were balanced compared to non-TOC regarding gender, age, BMI, and prevalence of coexisting conditions Significant effect of TOC on death was demonstrated in patients with baseline IL-6 &gt;100 pg/mL (hazard ratio [HR]: 0 21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0 08C0 57) The best effectiveness of TOC was achieved in patients with a combination of baseline IL-6 &gt;100 pg/mL and either SpO2  90% (HR: 0 07) or requiring oxygen supplementation (HR: 0 18) Tocilizumab administration in COVID-19 reduces mortality and speeds up clinical improvement in patients with a baseline concentration of IL-6 &gt;100 pg/mL, particularly if they need oxygen supplementation owing to the lower value of SpO2  90%","output":"Tocilizumab Improves the Prognosis of COVID-19 in Patients with High IL-6"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This reflexive essay offers an uncensored narrative and delves deep into the life of one MSW student during the Covid-19 pandemic.

It appears that the promise of the magic bullet has largely been realized. There are currently 22 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use and hundreds are in clinical trials for treatment of various diseases including cancers, immune disorders, and infections. The revenues from the top five therapeutic antibodies (Rituxan, Remicade, Herceptin, Humira, and Avastin) nearly doubled from $6.4 billion in 2004 to $11.7 billion in 2006. During the last several years major pharmaceutical companies raced to acquire antibody companies, with a recent example of MedImmune being purchased for $15.6 billion by AstraZeneca. These therapeutic and business successes reflect the major advances in antibody engineering which have resulted in the generation of safe, specific, high-affinity, and non-immunogenic antibodies during the last three decades. Currently, second and third generations of antibodies are under development, mostly to improve already existing antibody specificities. However, although the refinement of already known methodologies is certainly of great importance for potential clinical use, there are no conceptually new developments in the last decade comparable, for example, to the development of antibody libraries, phage display, domain antibodies (dAbs), and antibody humanization to name a few. A fundamental question is then whether there will be another change in the paradigm of research as happened 1C2 decades ago or the current trend of gradual improvement of already developed methodologies and therapeutic antibodies will continue. Although any prediction could prove incorrect, it appears that conceptually new methodologies are needed to overcome the fundamental problems of drug (antibody) resistance due to genetic or/and epigenetic alterations in cancer and chronic infections, as well as problems related to access to targets and complexity of biological systems. If new methodologies are not developed, it is likely that gradual saturation will occur in the pipeline of conceptually new antibody therapeutics. In this scenario we will witness an increase in combination of targets and antibodies, and further attempts to personalize targeted treatments by using appropriate biomarkers as well as to develop novel scaffolds with properties that are superior to those of the antibodies now in clinical use.","output":"Therapeutic Antibodies: Current State and Future Trends C Is a Paradigm Change Coming Soon?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"W present a rare case of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis after the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

The average labor supply on the gig economy platform increases by 25% during the pandemic. The impact is nationwide and is stronger in states with more confirmed cases of COVID-19. The impact of state-level shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders accounts for only 7%~16% of the overall impact of the pandemic, suggesting that simply lifting the lockdown policies without controlling the disease well is unlikely to get the economy back on track. We also evaluate how female and male workers respond differently. Although both female and male workers increase their labor supply, female workers' increase in labor supply is smaller than male workers', and consequently, the already existing gender gap in labor supply increases by 31%. The increase in gender gap is primarily driven by workers in their age of 30-50, implying that the increase in gender gap is likely to be caused by the school closures during the pandemic and the disproportionate allocation of housework and childcare responsibility across gender.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Gig Economy Labor Supply"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mammary analogue secretory carcinomas (MASCs) of the parotid gland are considered as low-grade malignancies with good clinical outcome but lacking data regarding prognostic factors.

National-level registries found that children, generally, have less severe disease when compared to adults. However, most asymptomatically infected children will not present to hospital and may be missed. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics in pediatric COVID-19 patients in Kuwait, and to estimate the potential duration of viral shedding. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in Jaber Alahmad Hospital (JAH) from Feb. 29th to Apr. 30th, 2020. During the study period and as part of the public health measures to contain COVID-19, all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients 1 month-18 years old, regardless of symptoms, were hospitalized at JAH, and were included. Demographics, clinical data, and laboratory results were collected. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negativity was defined as having two consecutive negative PCR results from a respiratory specimen. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 134 pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified. Of those, 91 patients (67.9%) were asymptomatic, the remaining cases had mild COVID-19 illness and mild pneumonia. The median age was 8.8 years (IQR: 4.7C12.4), 55.2% were males, and 89.5% were healthy. Cough and fever were the most commonly reported symptoms. The median duration to PCR negativity was 15 days (IQR: 13C19) for symptomatic patients and 15.5 days (IQR: 14C21) for asymptomatic patients. Predictors for symptoms included abnormal procalcitonin (aOR 6.6; 95% CI 1.48 -29.3), C-reactive protein (aOR 9.10; 95% CI 1.29C32.13), and X-ray finding of pneumonia (aOR 6.44; 95% CI 1.29C32.13).

It has evolved and yielded four subvariants: delta1, delta2, delta3 and delta4. While trying to understand how these subvariants drive the pandemic in Southeast Asia, I noticed that many d1 genomes from Indonesia encode an extra spike substitution, V1264L. Coincidentally, this confers an acidic dileucine motif because residues 1157-1262 are acidic and residue 1265 is leucine. Such a motif may affect subcellular trafficking of the resulting spike protein. Alarmingly, this V1264L-encoding delta1 subvariant (referred to as delta1L) has become the dominant pandemic driver in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and East Timor. Moreover, it has acquired additional spike substitutions: L1234L in Singapore and D215Y/N in Malaysia. On the average, the resulting sublineages carry 46-48 mutations per genome, making them some of the most mutated variants identified so far. Moreover, a d1 sublineage from the United Kingdom has acquired V1264L along with spike Y145H and A222V, a signature substitution of a SARS-COV-2 clade that was a major pandemic driver in Europe during the summer of 2020. A222V improves an extensive hydrophobic interaction network at the N-terminal domain of spike protein and may make this sublineage more virulent than delta1 and delta1L. Some delta2 subvariant genomes identified in the United States of America and other countries also encode V1264L. Thus, V1264L is a recurrent spike substitution frequently acquired by d subvariants during convergent evolution. This recurrence also suggests that V1264L is one key mechanism by which d variant adopts to expand its evolutionary cage.","output":"Delta-1 variant of SARS-COV-2 acquires spike V1264L and drives the pandemic in Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Other forces related to socio-economic and cultural factors, besides biomedical and behavioural fields, also influence health but receive little attention in health research. This study aims to illuminate social determinants of health and to identify challenges and opportunities in addressing social determinants of child health (SDCH) in rural Cambodia. METHODS: This is a qualitative study based on interviews of frontline primary health care providers, health officials, local authorities and community volunteers in two health districts in Cambodia. The data were supplemented by secondary data on different aspects of the districts and Cambodia. RESULTS: Poverty, lack of basic commodities and adverse social conditions remained problems for population health. While access to health services was considered adequate, households and communities had several major risk exposures. Challenges in addressing SDCH were the high prevalence of social and household adverse conditions, and the lack of training of providers, of information about social services, of effective coordination and of trust in public services. Opportunities were present, including social services being existent albeit poor functioning, the traditional practice of social inquiry, existing frontline providers being open to further information and training, existing subnational coordination bodies at district and provincial levels, and use of evidence in planning and resource allocation. CONCLUSION: Addressing SDCH requires broad and coordinated efforts of stakeholders from multiple sectors. Among the prerequisites are to leverage the existing structures and mechanisms, training primary health care providers and providing them with adequate information about local resources and available supports.

In this subgroup, if testing 100 000 persons with a SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 1%, nasopharyngeal swabs would detect 79 more (95% uncertainty interval, 5 fewer to 166 more) persons with SARS-CoV-2 than saliva, but with an incremental cost per additional infection detected of $8093. LIMITATION: The reference standard was imperfect, and saliva collection procedures varied. CONCLUSION: Saliva sampling seems to be a similarly sensitive and less costly alternative that could replace nasopharyngeal swabs for collection of clinical samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing.

A 23-nucleotide (nt) region that included a 6-nt UUAAAA sequence (designated the AU sequence) common between wild-type RNA2 and mutant RNA3 supported both precise and imprecise homologous recombination, though the latter occurred with lower frequency. Doubling the length of the 6-nt AU sequence in RNA3 increased the incidence of imprecise crossovers by nearly threefold. Duplication or triplication of the length of the AU sequence in both RNA2 and RNA3 further raised the frequency of imprecise crossovers. The majority of imprecise crosses were located within or close to the extended AU sequence. Imprecise recombinants contained either nucleotide substitutions, nontemplated nucleotides, small deletions, or small sequence duplications within the region of crossovers. Deletion of the AU sequence from the homologous region in RNA3 resulted in the accumulation of only precise homologous recombinants. Our results provide experimental evidence that AU sequences can facilitate the formation of imprecise homologous recombinants. The generation of small additions or deletions can be explained by a misannealing mechanism within the AU sequences, while replicase errors during RNA copying might explain the occurrence of nucleotide substitutions or nontemplated nucleotides.","output":"Homologous RNA recombination in brome mosaic virus: AU-rich sequences decrease the accuracy of crossovers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Department of Health and Social Care said that the clinically extremely vulnerable should follow the same advice as the rest of the population, but with some additional suggested precautions such as avoiding enclosed crowded spaces.

To date, however, the effectiveness of teaching ear anatomy using 3-D holographic technology has not been studied. The present study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of learning ear anatomy using a holographic (HG) anatomic model in comparison to didactic lecture (DL) and a computer module (CM). METHODS: A 3-D anatomic model of the middle and inner ear was created and displayed using presentation slides in a lecture, computer module, or via the Microsoft HoloLens. Twenty-nine medical students were randomized to one of the three interventions. All participants underwent assessment of baseline knowledge of ear anatomy. Immediately following each intervention, testing was repeated along with completion of a satisfaction survey. RESULTS: Baseline test scores did not differ across intervention groups. All groups showed an improvement in anatomic knowledge post-intervention (p < 0.001); the improvement was equal across all interventions (p = 0.06). Participants rated the interventions equally for delivery of factual content (p = 0.96), but rated the HG higher than the DL and CM for overall effectiveness, ability to convey spatial relationships, and for learner engagement and motivation (p < 0.001).

Here we examined sex differences in viral loads, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody titres, plasma cytokines and blood-cell phenotyping in patients with moderate COVID-19 who had not received immunomodulatory medications. Male patients had higher plasma levels of innate immune cytokines such as IL-8 and IL-18 along with more robust induction of non-classical monocytes. By contrast, female patients had more robust T cell activation than male patients during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, we found that a poor T cell response negatively correlated with patients' age and was associated with worse disease outcome in male patients, but not in female patients. By contrast, higher levels of innate immune cytokines were associated with worse disease progression in female patients, but not in male patients.

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) in combination with sequential extracorporeal blood purification therapies (EBP) might support renal function, attenuate systemic inflammation, and prevent or mitigate multiple organ dysfunctions in COVID-19. AIM: Describe overtime variations of clinical and biochemical features of critically ill patients with COVID-19 treated with EBP with a hemodiafilter characterized by enhanced cytokine adsorption properties. METHODS: An observational prospective study assessing the outcome of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU (February to April 2020) treated with EBP according to local practice. Main endpoints included overtime variation of IL-6 and multiorgan function-scores, mortality, and occurrence of technical complications or adverse events. RESULTS: The study evaluated 37 patients. Median baseline IL-6 was 1230 pg/ml (IQR 895) and decreased overtime (p < 0.001 Kruskal-Wallis test) during the first 72 h of the treatment, with the most significant decrease in the first 24 h (p = 0.001). The reduction in serum IL-6 concentrations correlated with the improvement in organ function, as measured in the decrease of SOFA score (rho = 0.48, p = 0.0003). Median baseline SOFA was 13 (IQR 6) and decreased significantly overtime (p < 0.001 at Kruskal-Wallis test) during the first 72 h of the treatment, with the most significant decrease in the first 48 h (median 8 IQR 5, p = 0.001). Compared to the expected mortality rates, as calculated by APACHE IV, the mean observed rates were 8.3% lower after treatment. The best improvement in mortality rate was observed in patients receiving EBP early on during the ICU stay. Premature clotting (running < 24 h) occurred in patients (18.9% of total) which featured higher effluent dose (median 33.6 ml/kg/h, IQR 9) and higher filtration fraction (median 31%, IQR 7.4). No electrolyte disorders, catheter displacement, circuit disconnection, unexpected bleeding, air, or thromboembolisms due to venous cannulation of EBP were recorded during the treatment. In one case, infection of vascular access occurred during RRT, requiring replacement. CONCLUSIONS: EBP with heparin-coated hemodiafilter featuring cytokine adsorption properties administered to patients with COVID-19 showed to be feasible and with no adverse events.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of unidentified SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population of Hong Kong. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted in Hong Kong after each major wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (April 21 to July 7, 2020; September 29 to November 23, 2020; and January 15 to April 18, 2021). Adults (age 18 years) who had not been diagnosed with COVID-19 were recruited during each period, and their sociodemographic information, symptoms, travel, contact, quarantine, and COVID-19 testing history were collected. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on spike (S1/S2) protein, followed by confirmation with a commercial electrochemiluminescence immunoassay based on the receptor binding domain of spike protein. RESULTS: The study enrolled 4198 participants (2539 [60%] female; median age, 50 years [IQR, 25 years]), including 903 (22%), 1046 (25%), and 2249 (53%) during April 21 to July 7, 2020; during September 29 to November 23, 2020; and during January 15 to April 18, 2021, respectively. The numbers of participants aged 18 to 39 years, 40 to 59 years, and 60 years or older were 1328 (32%), 1645 (39%), and 1225 (29%), respectively. Among the participants, 2444 (58%) stayed in Hong Kong since November 2019 and 2094 (50%) had negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA test results. Only 170 (4%) reported ever having contact with individuals with confirmed cases, and 5% had been isolated or quarantined. Most (2803 [67%]) did not recall any illnesses, whereas 737 (18%), 212 (5%), and 385 (9%) had experienced respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, or both, respectively, before testing. Six participants were confirmed to be positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG; the adjusted prevalence of unidentified infection was 0.15% (95% CI, 0.06%-0.32%). Extrapolating these findings to the whole population, there were fewer than 1.9 unidentified infections for every recorded confirmed case. The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hong Kong before the roll out of vaccination was less than 0.45%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of participants from the general public in Hong Kong, the prevalence of unidentified SARS-CoV-2 infection was low after 3 major waves of the pandemic, suggesting the success of the pandemic mitigation by stringent isolation and quarantine policies even without complete city lockdown. More than 99.5% of the general population of Hong Kong remain naive to SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the urgent need to achieve high vaccine coverage.","output":"Seroprevalence of Unidentified SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Hong Kong During 3 Pandemic Waves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An overview of the long-established methods of diagnosing onychomycosis (potassium hydroxide testing, fungal culture, and histopathological examination) is provided followed by an outline of other diagnostic methods currently in use or under development.

Visual diagnosis (dermoscopy, optical coherence tomography, confocal microscopy, UV fluorescence excitation) provides clinical evidence of infection, but may be limited by lack of organism information when treatment decisions are needed.

Additionally, artificial intelligence methods are being applied to assist with visual identification, with good success. Despite being considered the gold standard for diagnosis, clinicians are generally well aware that the established methods have many limitations for diagnosis. The new techniques seek to augment established methods, but also have advantages and disadvantages relative to their diagnostic use.

PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient is a 50-year-old man with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). DIAGNOSES: COVID-19 pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was quarantined for 105 days. Of these, inpatient quarantine lasted for 75 days. When the nucleic acid test results were negative for 3 consecutive days, the patient was discharged at Day 75 after disease onset. During this period, multiple samples were collected from the patient's body surface, the surrounding environment, and physical surfaces, but none of these tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. These samples included those from anal swabs, hands, inner surface of mask, cell phone, bed rails, floor around the bed, and toilet bowl surface. However, nucleic acid retest results on Day 80 and Day 92 after disease onset were positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids. OUTCOMES: The patient continued with quarantine and observation at home. After the test results on Days 101 and 105 after disease onset were negative, quarantine was terminated at last. LESSONS: Per our knowledge, this is the longest known time that a patient has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids. No symptoms were observed during follow-up. During hospitalization, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity was not observed in samples from the body surface and surrounding environment, and no verified transmission event occurred during the quarantine at home. After undergoing clinical recovery a minority of patients with COVID-19 have shown long-term positive results for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. This has provided new understanding and research directions for coronavirus infection. Long-term follow-up and quarantine measures have been employed for such patients.

Both variants demonstrate escape of antibodies targeting the N-terminal domain, an important immune hotspot for neutralizing epitopes. Compared to wild-type and Kappa lineages, Delta variant spike proteins show modest increase in ACE2 affinity, likely due to enhanced electrostatic complementarity at the RBD-ACE2 interface, which we characterize by cryo-EM. Unexpectedly, Kappa variant spike trimers form a structural head-to-head dimer-of-trimers assembly, which we demonstrate is a result of the E484Q mutation and with unknown biological implications.

Immunohistochemical staining of the cellular components (macrophages and smooth muscle cells) of aortic atherosclerotic lesions revealed a significant increase (52%) in the macrophage-positive area in only male transgenic rabbits compared with that in the nontransgenic littermates. However, both male and female transgenic rabbits showed a significant decrease (45% in males and 31% in females) in the smooth muscle cell-positive area compared with that of their control littermates.

Meanwhile the wild-type rabbits were continuously subcutaneously infused with urantide (5.4 g kg(?1) h(?1)) using osmotic mini-pumps. Infusion of urantide exerted effects opposite to those caused by UII, as it significantly decreased the macrophage-positive area in male wild-type rabbits compared with that of control rabbits. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, treatment with UII dose-dependently increased the expression of the adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, and this effect was partially reversed by urantide.

The infectious agent hijacks components of the cellular machinery for its profit, circumventing the natural defense mechanisms triggered by the infected cell. The successful completion of the replicative viral cycle within a cell depends on the function of viral components versus the cellular defenses. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are important cellular modulators, either promoting or preventing the progression of viral infections. Among these ncRNAs, the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) family is especially relevant due to their intrinsic functional properties and ubiquitous biological roles. Specific lncRNAs have been recently characterized as modulators of the cellular response during infection of human host cells by single stranded RNA viruses. However, the role of host lncRNAs in the infection by human RNA coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 remains uncharacterized. In the present work, we have performed a transcriptomic study of a cohort of patients with different SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Our results revealed the existence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection-dependent pattern of transcriptional up-regulation in which specific lncRNAs are an integral component. To determine the role of these lncRNAs, we performed a functional correlation analysis complemented with the study of the validated interactions between lncRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). This combination of in silico functional association studies and experimental evidence allowed us to identify a lncRNA signature composed of six elements - NRIR, BISPR, MIR155HG, FMR1-IT1, USP30-AS1, and U62317.2 - associated with the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We propose a competition mechanism between the viral RNA genome and the regulatory lncRNAs in the sequestering of specific RBPs that modulates the interferon response and the regulation of RNA surveillance by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD).

METHODS: Prospective observational study of consecutive hospitalized patients with influenza A H1N1 virus and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We compared cases with and without bacterial co-infection. RESULTS: The incidence of influenza A H1N1 infection in CAP during the pandemic period was 19% (n, 667). We studied 128 patients; 42(33%) had bacterial co-infection. The most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (26, 62%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6, 14%). Predictors for bacterial co-infection were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and increase of platelets count. The hospital mortality was 9%. Factors associated with mortality were age 65 years, presence of septic shock and the need for mechanical ventilation. Although patients with bacterial co-infection presented with higher Pneumonia Severity Index risk class, hospital mortality was similar to patients without bacterial co-infection (7% vs. 11%, respectively, p = 0.54). CONCLUSION: Bacterial co-infection was frequent in influenza A H1N1 pneumonia, with COPD and increased platelet count as the main predictors. Although associated with higher severe scales at admission, bacterial co-infection did not influence mortality of these patients.","output":"Bacterial co-infection with H1N1 infection in patients admitted with community acquired pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Anxiety, depression and reduction of quality of life (QoL) are common in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). Fear of getting sick from COVID-19, governments lockdown and the imposed social distancing might have an impact on psychological distress and QoL. Objectives: The aim of our study was to investigate anxiety, depression and QoL changes in pwMS during SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and lockdown in Italy. Methods: 67 pwMS with a previous (less than 6 months) neuropsychological evaluation before SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (T0) were re-evaluated at the time of the outbreak and lockdown in Italy (T1). They underwent a clinical and neurological evaluation (at T0) and completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y1), the Beck Depression Inventory second edition (BDI-II), and Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MsQoL-54) at T0 and T1. Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was applied. Results: BDI-II and STAI-Y1 scores did not change between T0 and T1, whereas the satisfaction on sexual function subscale of MsQoL-54 was significantly higher at T1 ( p<0.001 ). Conclusions: This is the first study that evaluated mood and QoL levels before and during the lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic in pwMS. No worsening of anxiety and depression levels was found.

The self-employed and the members in their households usually form an economic unit. As a consequence, the income cuts not only affect the self-employed themselves but also the rest of their household. We used the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) to calculate how much income the self-employed are able to sacrifice to achieve a subjective barely sufficient household income, which we interpret as the minimum level to maintain the standard of living. Our results suggest that full-time self-employed are typically the bread-earners in their households and that, as a consequence, even moderate income losses of the self-employed often lead to problems in maintaining the living standards of their households. Conditional on individual and household characteristics, the self-employed with employees are found to live in households that are less resilient to income losses. Furthermore, a negative correlation between falling short of the barely adequate household income and wellbeing was discovered. Self-employed in households with less than adequate incomes also reported higher concerns about social cohesion. These results have implications for policy - especially in light of the economic crisis induced by the pandemic.","output":"Income loss among the self-employed: implications for individual wellbeing and pandemic policy measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the first local transmission of the Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant in mainland China.

The investigation on daily sequential PCR testing of the quarantined subjects indicated the viral load of the first positive test of Delta infections was ~1000 times higher than that of the 19A/19B strains infections back in the initial epidemic wave of 2020, suggesting the potential faster viral replication rate and more infectiousness of the Delta variant at the early stage of the infection. The 126 high-quality sequencing data and reliable epidemiological data indicated some minor intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) could be transmitted between hosts and finally fixed in the virus population during the outbreak. The minor iSNVs transmission between donor-recipient contribute at least 4 of 31 substitutions identified in the outbreak suggesting some iSNVs more likely to arise and reach fixation when the virus spread rapidly. Disease control measures, including the frequency of population testing, quarantine in pre-symptomatic phase and enhancing the genetic surveillance should be adjusted to account for the increasing prevalence of the Delta variant at global level.","output":"Viral infection and Transmission in a large well-traced outbreak caused by the Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Convivial and playful, the ferret has cohabited with humans for hundreds of years.

In a broad sense, new mobility services (NMS) can be characterized as a way of optimizing the ownership and use of a variety of mobility resources, tailored to the needs of an entire (urban) community. In this context, providing an up-to-date and critical review on the impact of NMS is the main contribution and added value of this study. To this end, this study presents an in-depth review of NMS and their diverse features (e.g., car sharing, bike sharing, Mobihubs, etc.), as an alternative to privately-owned travel modes. By reviewing more than 100 relevant sources from academic journals (Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Web of Science) and media reports, this study explains the key elements on how to address the impact assessment of NMS in terms of social, environmental, and economic aspects of sustainable mobility services. This study concludes that the implementation of NMS offers the potential to promote efficiency, sustainability, social equity, and quality of life.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether older adults reported cancellation or avoidance of medical care during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore associations with health and socio-demographic characteristics. METHODS: Cross-sectional data of 880 older adults aged &#8805; 62 years (mean age 73.4 years, 50.3% female) were used from the COVID-19 questionnaire of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, a cohort study among community-dwelling older adults in the Netherlands. Cancellation and avoidance of care were assessed by self-report, and covered questions on cancellation of primary care (general practitioner), cancellation of hospital outpatient care, and postponed help-seeking. Respondent characteristics included age, sex, educational level, loneliness, depression, anxiety, frailty, multimorbidity and information on quarantine. RESULTS: 35% of the sample reported cancellations due to the COVID-19 situation, either initiated by the respondent (12%) or by healthcare professionals (29%). Postponed help-seeking was reported by 8% of the sample. Multimorbidity was associated with healthcare-initiated cancellations (primary care OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.09-3.50; hospital OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.28-2.74) and respondent-initiated hospital outpatient cancellations (OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.04-4.12). Depressive symptoms were associated with postponed help-seeking (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.06-1.24).

METHODS: Retrospective service data (Cambridge, UK; 17 736 consecutive singleton pregnancies, 2004-2008; 826 consecutive gestational diabetes pregnancies, 2014-2019) and 361 women with &#8805;1 gestational diabetes risk factor (OPHELIA prospective observational study, UK) were included. Pregnancy outcomes included gestational diabetes (National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence or International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups criteria), diabetes in pregnancy (WHO criteria), Caesarean section, large-for-gestational age infant, neonatal hypoglycaemia and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Receiver-operating characteristic curves and unadjusted logistic regression were used to compare random plasma glucose, fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c performance. RESULTS: Gestational diabetes diagnosis was significantly associated with random plasma glucose at 12 weeks [area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for both criteria 0.81 (95% CI 0.79-0.83)], fasting plasma glucose [National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence: area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve 0.75 (95% CI 0.65-0.85); International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups: area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve 0.92 (95% CI 0.85-0.98)] and HbA1c at 28 weeks' gestation [National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence: 0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.90); International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups: 0.84 (95% CI 0.77-0.91)].

Family cancer history (FCH) can identify high risk patients and triage them to genetic assessment, however there is wide variability in accuracy, breadth and strategies for FCH collection. We aim to evaluate whether a web-based tool (WBT) can result in improved quality of FCH versus standard FCH collection via face-to-face interview. All patients scheduled for a gynecologic oncology new patient visit between 9/2019-9/2020 were offered enrollment in an institutional review board-approved prospective trial. Patients were randomized to one of three arms: 1) standard of care FCH collection during the interview, 2) WBT administered at home prior to the visit, 3) WBT administered in the office prior to the visit. The primary endpoint was evaluation of FCH quality based on established quality measures. Chi-square test was used to compare FCH quality between intervention arms and ANOVA test for the number of relatives/generations in the pedigree. A Bonferroni correction was used to account for multiple comparison testing. A total of 100 patients were enrolled. The mean age was 56.2 years (SD 15.2). The WBT was completed successfully by 67% (22) of patients randomized to home administration vs 94% (31) randomized to office administration (P=0.01). Patients cited the following reasons for failure to complete the WBT at home: difficulty with technology, concern about privacy and forgetting about the WBT invitation. In the intention-to-treat analysis, office WBT collection resulted in significantly higher quality FCH vs the control and home arms (Table 1). The WBT resulted in significantly greater mean number of relatives included in the pedigree (Arm 1 - 3.9 [SD 3.0], Arm 2 - 32.4 [SD 16.8], Arm 3 - 29.0 [SD 18.3], P<0.001) and significantly greater number of included generations (2.2 [SD 0.9], 3.9 [SD 0.4], 3.7 [SD 0.6], P<0.001). Patient age, race, ethnicity, and personal/family cancer history were not associated with FCH quality. When excluding patients who could not access the WBT at home, there were no differences in FCH quality when WBT was completed at home vs in the office. A total of 39 patients utilizing the WBT (74%) completed a satisfaction survey following the office visit;38 (97%) reported that the WBT was easy to understand and 30 (77%) reported being satisfied with the tool. [Display omitted] FCH collection is an exciting application of information technology in the current healthcare setting with a growing emphasis on cancer genetics, disease prevention and thoughtful use of WBTs.

This has made evident the need for wildlife studies investigating pathogen dynamics in wildlife species. Rodents have proved excellent models, in both laboratory and natural settings for studying disease dynamics. Due to the single introduction point, continuous spread and presence of baseline data, we propose that the recent invasion of Myodes glareolus in Ireland can be used as a model system to understand the changes in helminth species during a biological invasion. Through long-term studies using this invasive species as a model, we will be able to fill large knowledge gaps surrounding the area of pathogen dynamics in wild populations. ABSTRACT: The primary driver of the observed increase in emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) has been identified as human interaction with wildlife and this increase has emphasized knowledge gaps in wildlife pathogens dynamics. Wild rodent models have proven excellent for studying changes in parasite communities and have been a particular focus of eco-immunological research. Helminth species have been shown to be one of the factors regulating rodent abundance and indirectly affect disease burden through trade-offs between immune pathways. The Myodes glareolus invasion in Ireland is a unique model system to explore the invasion dynamics of helminth species. Studies of the invasive population of M. glareolus in Ireland have revealed a verifiable introduction point and its steady spread. Helminths studies of this invasion have identified enemy release, spillover, spillback and dilution taking place. Longitudinal studies have the potential to demonstrate the interplay between helminth parasite dynamics and both immune adaptation and coinfecting microparasites as M. glareolus become established across Ireland. Using the M. glareolus invasion as a model system and other similar wildlife systems, we can begin to fill the large gap in our knowledge surrounding the area of wildlife pathogen dynamics.","output":"The Invasive Bank Vole (Myodes glareolus): A Model System for Studying Parasites and Ecoimmunology during a Biological Invasion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become an innovative strategic management tool of socially and environmentally conscious business organizations in the 21st century Although external CSR activities are better researched, firms internal CSR activities such as workplace health promotion and its impact on employee wellbeing are less understood, especially during a pandemic where job security is relatively lower in many sectors of employment Additionally, wellbeing and good health have been recognized as important targets to achieve as part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 Therefore, this study investigates the relationship between health-related work benefits and employee wellbeing, satisfaction and loyalty to their workplace Large scale survey research was performed with responses from 537 employees in Hungary and 16 hypotheses were tested Data analysis and path modelling using PLS-SEM (Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling) reveal two-layers of factors that impact employee wellbeing, satisfaction and loyalty We term this as internal locus of control and external locus of control variables Internal locus of control variables such as mental and emotional health leads to wellbeing at the workplace but do not directly impact employee satisfaction and loyalty In contrast, external locus of control factors such as healthcare support leads to wellbeing, satisfaction and loyalty Employer commitment to healthcare support system is found pertinent especially during the pandemic We discover wellbeing as a unique standalone construct in this study, which is vital as is it formed by mental and emotional wellbeing of employees, albeit not a determinant of employee workplace satisfaction and loyalty We theorize workers self-reliance and preservation as possible explanations to the disassociation between employee wellbeing and loyalty to workplace during times of crisis and the pandemic","output":"Workplace Health Promotion, Employee Wellbeing and Loyalty during Covid-19 PandemicLarge Scale Empirical Evidence from Hungary"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality thus far. Considering the historical uses of high\\\\voltage X\\\\ray beams for unresolvable pneumonia, we aimed to assess whether low\\\\dose whole\\\\lung irradiation (WLI) could provide any benefits for patients with refractory COVID\\\\19 pneumonia. METHODS: Eleven patients with refractory COVID\\\\19 pneumonia were treated with WLI to a total dose of 1 Gy and compared to 11 patients in a matched control group from June to November 2020. The study's primary endpoint was improvement of chest X\\\\ray severity score (CXRS), followed by changes in mean oxygen (O2) saturation and 28\\\\day mortality as secondary endpoints. RESULTS: The final CXRS was significantly lower in the WLI group (8.7  2.5) compared to the control group (12.3  3.3) (P: 0.016). Change of CXRS from the first to the last chest X\\\\ray was ?2.2  3.1 for the WLI group and 0.7  3.9 for the control group, which showed a trend for lower CXRS in the WLI group (U = 30, p: 0.085).

Biomechanical factors in the fusion segment may influence spinal fusion rates. There are no reports on the relationship between intervertebral union and the absorption of autografts or vertebral endplates. Therefore, the purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the risk factors of nonunion after PLIF and identify preventive measures. METHODS: The authors analyzed 138 patients who underwent 1-level PLIF between 2016 and 2018 (75 males, 63 females; mean age 67 years; minimum follow-up period 12 months). Lumbar CT images obtained soon after the surgery and at 6 and 12 months of follow-up were examined for the mean total occupancy rate of the autograft, presence of a translucent zone between the autograft and endplate (more than 50% of vertebral diameter), cage subsidence, and screw loosening. Complete intervertebral union was defined as the presence of both upper and lower complete fusion in the center cage regions on coronal and sagittal CT slices at 12 months postoperatively. Patients were classified into either union or nonunion groups. RESULTS: Complete union after PLIF was observed in 62 patients (45%), while nonunion was observed in 76 patients (55%). The mean total occupancy rate of the autograft immediately after the surgery was higher in the union group than in the nonunion group (59% vs 53%; p = 0.046). At 12 months postoperatively, the total occupancy rate of the autograft had decreased by 5.4% in the union group and by 11.9% in the nonunion group (p = 0.020). A translucent zone between the autograft and endplate immediately after the surgery was observed in 14 and 38 patients (23% and 50%) in the union and nonunion groups, respectively (p = 0.001). The nonunion group had a significantly higher proportion of cases with cage subsidence and screw loosening at 12 months postoperatively in comparison to the union group (p = 0.010 and p = 0.009, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A lower occupancy rate of the autograft and the presence of a translucent zone between the autograft and endplate immediately after the surgery were associated with nonunion at 12 months after PLIF. It may be important to achieve sufficient contact between the autograft and endplate intraoperatively for osseous union enhancement and to avoid excessive absorption of the autograft.

No evidence is yet available for CoV infection into hosts upon zoonotic disease outbreak, although the CoV epidemy resembles influenza viruses, which use sialic acid (SA). Currently, information on SARS-CoV-2 and its receptors is limited. O-acetylated SAs interact with the lectin-like spike glycoprotein of SARS CoV-2 for the initial attachment of viruses to enter into the host cells. SARS-CoV-2 hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) acts as the classical glycan-binding lectin and receptor-degrading enzyme. Most ?-CoVs recognize 9-O-acetyl-SAs but switched to recognizing the 4-O-acetyl-SA form during evolution of CoVs. Type I HE is specific for the 9-O-Ac-SAs and type II HE is specific for 4-O-Ac-SAs. The SA-binding shift proceeds through quasi-synchronous adaptations of the SA-recognition sites of the lectin and esterase domains. The molecular switching of HE acquisition of 4-O-acetyl binding from 9-O-acetyl SA binding is caused by protein-carbohydrate interaction (PCI) or lectin-carbohydrate interaction (LCI). The HE gene was transmitted to a ?-CoV lineage A progenitor by horizontal gene transfer from a 9-O-Ac-SA-specific HEF, as in influenza virus C/D. HE acquisition, and expansion takes place by cross-species transmission over HE evolution. This reflects viral evolutionary adaptation to host SA-containing glycans. Therefore, CoV HE receptor switching precedes virus evolution driven by the SA-glycan diversity of the hosts. The PCI or LCI stereochemistry potentiates the SA-ligand switch by a simple conformational shift of the lectin and esterase domains. Therefore, examination of new emerging viruses can lead to better understanding of virus evolution toward transitional host tropism. A clear example of HE gene transfer is found in the BCoV HE, which prefers 7,9-di-O-Ac-SAs, which is also known to be a target of the bovine torovirus HE. A more exciting case of such a switching event occurs in the murine CoVs, with the example of the ?-CoV lineage A type binding with two different subtypes of the typical 9-O-Ac-SA (type I) and the exclusive 4-O-Ac-SA (type II) attachment factors. The protein structure data for type II HE also imply the virus switching to binding 4-O acetyl SA from 9-O acetyl SA. Principles of the protein-glycan interaction and PCI stereochemistry potentiate the SA-ligand switch via simple conformational shifts of the lectin and esterase domains. Thus, our understanding of natural adaptation can be specified to how carbohydrate/glycan-recognizing proteins/molecules contribute to virus evolution toward host tropism. Under the current circumstances where reliable antiviral therapeutics or vaccination tools are lacking, several trials are underway to examine viral agents. As expected, structural and non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are currently being targeted for viral therapeutic designation and development. However, the modern global society needs SARS-CoV-2 preventive and therapeutic drugs for infected patients. In this review, the structure and sialobiology of SARS-CoV-2 are discussed in order to encourage and activate public research on glycan-specific interaction-based drug creation in the near future.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Evolutionary Adaptation toward Host Entry and Recognition of Receptor O-Acetyl Sialylation in Virus-Host Interaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Face masking proved essential to reduce transmission of COVID-19 and other respiratory infections in indoor environments, but standards and literature do not provide simple quantitative methods for quantifying air leakage at the face seal. This study reports an original method to quantify outward leakage and how wearing style impacts on leaks and filtration efficiency. The amount of air leakage was evaluated on four medical masks and four barrier face coverings, exploiting a theoretical model and an instrumented dummy head in a range of airflows between 30 and 160 L/min. The fraction of air leaking at the face seal of the medical masks and barrier face coverings ranged from 43% to 95% of exhaled air at 30 L/min and reduced to 10C85% at 160 L/min. Filter breathability was the main driver affecting both leak fraction and total filtration efficiency that varied from 5% to 53% and from 15% to 84% at 30 and 160 L/min, respectively. Minor changes were related to wearing style, supporting indications on the correct mask use. The fraction of air leaking from medical masks and barrier face coverings during exhalation is relevant and varies according to design and wearing style.

Here we report 9 patients who had pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum during their stay in the ICU. Patients who were admitted to ICU between March 2020 and December 2020, were reviewed for presence of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema during their ICU stay. Demographic characteristics, mechanical ventilation settings, documented ventilation parameters, outcomes were studied. A total of 161 patients were admitted to ICU during the study period, 96 were invasively ventilated. Nine patients had developed pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and/or subcutaneous emphysema during their admission. Five of them were men and median age was 66.6 years. All patients were intubated and mechanically ventilated. All patients were managed conservatively. One patient was discharged from ICU, the others were lost due to other complications related to COVID-19. Upon detection of pneumothorax and/or mediastinum all patients were managed conservatively by limiting their PEEP and maximum inspiratory pressures and were followed by daily chest X-rays (CXR) for detection of any progress. None of the patients showed increase in size of their pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum. Hemodynamically instability due to pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum was not observed in any of the patients. Tension pneumothorax was not observed in any of the patients. Most common reason for death was sepsis due to secondary bacterial infections.

It is of great concern which countries/regions would have the most similar patterns to Italy and the comparison of patterns, assuming homogeneity of variance within datasets, among regions worldwide, became necessary. There were no results in past literature regarding the identification of COVID-19 patterns among countries/regions. We were therefore motivated to propose an appropriate mathematic method, using a specific country/region (e.g., Italy), for example, in detecting similar patterns at the respective peak of the outbreak. A visual display highlighting COVID-19 patterns was proposed in this study using vector mathematics. Methods: We downloaded COVID-19 outbreak numbers with confirmed cases in countries/regions on a daily basis from the Github website. The top peak point was identified for each country/region. Next, thirteen-time points were assigned before and after the inflection point. COVID-19 patterns were assessed by inspecting both similarity and distance using angle(or cosine theta in trigonometric function) and Chi-square statistics. Two sets of data on confirmed cases, one based on cases per 100,000 population and the other does not, were compared using rankings as well as four quadrants divided by similarity and distance. An app was developed to display regions with similar COVID-19 patterns to the selected country. Results: The top four countries presenting with the most similar COVID-19 patterns to Italy were Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Luxembourg with Chi-square statistics per one freedom degree at 0.12, 0.37, 0.58, and 0.80, respectively, based on a population of 100,000. Visualizations with four quadrants and world map were shown on Google Maps. Rank correlation in rankings was ? 0.03 between two sets of confirmed cases with and without using the basis of cases per population of 100,000. Conclusion: We proposed and demonstrated a method using both criteria of similarity and distance from vectors in mathematics to identify countries that are most similar to Italy in terms of the pattern at the peak of the outbreak. The app was developed to display countries/regions with the most similar COVID-19 patterns to the targeted country/region using a dashboard laid on Google Maps.

Reduction of various contaminating bacteriae, viruses and parasites by few to several log steps and efficiency to prevent GVHD has been shown. Aim To evaluate and compare advantages and disadvantages of PRT available for practical application in platelets. Materials and Methods PRT for the treatment of platelets is currently offered by two formats: Amotosalen (INTERCEPT, Cerus, Concord, CA, USA) and vitamin B2 (Mirasol, Caridian, Denver, USA). Results from different studies and our own experiences with the two techniques are compared and discussed. Results and Discussion For both technologies, different groups of investigators have shown acceptable in\\\\vitro results with respect to functional and storage data for platelets stored for up to 5 days after production and before transfusion. Initial clinical studies showed no inferiority of the treated platelets in comparison to untreated controls in thrombocytopenic patients. However for both techniques a tendency towards lower CCI has been reported, which may be more pronounced in the platelets treated with the Intercept process. For introduction of PRT many countries require not only CE mark but licensing with the respective authorities since treatment for pathogen reduction is regarded as creating a new blood product. With respect to a platelet loss during pathogen reduction it seems recommendable to increase the lower limit of platelet content of the product to 2.5  10(11). Particularly for the Intercept system, where a considerable amount of platelets is lost in the purification of the product from Amotosalen, a change in the production process to increase the platelet yield may be necessary. Data from our group show a tendency for improved functional and storage parameters for platelets treated with the Mirasol process. Compared to conventional manufacturing of platelets by apheresis or pooling of buffy coats, pathogen reduction requires additional labour, space, and quality control. Shelf life of platelets is limited in most countries because of the risk of bacterial contamination (in Germany presently to 4 days). A prolongation to 5 or more days after pathogen reduction seems feasible but remains a topic for future studies. Conclusion Results of in vitro and clinical studies of pathogen reduced platelets are promising. Larger clinical trials will help to determine whether PRT proves to be beneficial (reduction of transmission of infections, less alloimmunisation) and overall cost effective (bearing in mind that additional costs may be compensated for by omission of gamma irradiation and potential longer shelf life).","output":"Pathogen inactivation/reduction of platelet concentrates: turning theory into practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic disrupted medical education across the world.

The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, reliability and validity of an online Virtual Clinical Encounter Examination (VICEE) to assess non-psychomotor competencies (non-procedure or manual skills) of medical students. METHOD: Sixty-one final year medical students took the VICEE as part of the final summative examination. A panel of faculty experts developed the exam cases and competencies. They administered the test online via real-time interaction with artificial intelligence (AI) based virtual patients, along with faculty and IT support. RESULTS: Student and faculty surveys demonstrated satisfaction with the experience. Confirmatory factor analysis supported convergent validity of VICEE with Direct Observation Clinical Encounter Examination (DOCEE), a previously validated clinical examination. The observed sensitivity was 81.8%, specificity 64.1% and likelihood ratio 12.6, supporting the ability of VICEE to diagnose 'clinical incompetence' among students.

Healthcare workers are playing the role of frontline defense to safeguard the lives of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aimed to investigate the anxiety levels and sleep quality among frontline and second-line healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this cross-sectional study, a validated, self-administered, electronic questionnaire was distributed through email to healthcare workers. The selection of 1678 healthcare workers was based on a convenience sampling technique. The General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) instrument scales were used to assess healthcare workers' anxiety levels and sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Out of 1678 respondents, 1200 (71.5%) were frontline healthcare workers, while 478 (28.5%) were second-line healthcare workers. Among all the healthcare workers, 435 (25.92%) were experiencing moderate to severe anxiety. Among them, 713 (59.4%) frontline healthcare workers were experiencing anxiety in comparison with 277 (57.9%) second-line healthcare workers. Severe anxiety symptoms were seen in 137 (11.41%) frontline healthcare workers compared to 44 (9.20%) second-line healthcare workers. In total, 1376 (82.0%) healthcare workers were found to have poor sleep quality; 975 (58.10%) were frontline, and 407 (23.89%) were second-line healthcare workers. The highest poor sleep quality levels were found among 642 (84.6%) of the healthcare workers who work in frontline areas (emergency departments, intensive care units, and wards) compared to 734 (79.9%) of the healthcare workers who work in second-line areas. These findings provide a substantial contribution to the consolidation of evidence concerning the negative impact of the pandemic on the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs). These results have established an association that the COVID-19 pandemic causes larger negative psychological symptoms in frontline healthcare workers, such as severe anxiety and poor sleep quality. Preventive measures to minimize anxiety levels and maintain sleep quality, addressing this issue nationally and globally, are essential to support the healthcare workers who are sacrificing their mental health for the future of our nations.","output":"Comparison of Generalized Anxiety and Sleep Disturbance among Frontline and Second-Line Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)Cinfected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP. METHODS: We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number. RESULTS: Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).

He later demonstrated recovery of cardiac function and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed signs consistent with myocarditis. DISCUSSION: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be an ongoing issue, it is important to recognize MIS-A, a rare and potentially deadly clinical syndrome that can lead to profound cardiovascular complications. Non-invasive imaging modalities such as cardiac MRI can play a role in the identification of myocarditis.

Here, we demonstrate that the extent of the apparent asynchrony can be substantially reduced when direction change is induced by a voluntary key press following a delay adaptation regime. We also show that the reduced color-motion asynchrony effect size following a motor-sensory recalibration is not a result of a change in the onset of perceived direction change relative to that of the color.

Treatments by pharmacological interventions have been reported to impart negative implications on maternal and fetal health outcomes. Therefore, the use of psychotherapeutic interventions to bypass these side-effects and manage depression, anxiety has received a lot of attention. A meta-statistical consensus regarding the intervention is available, but with several limitations. In this study, we attempt to address these limitations and provide the current state of evidence evaluating the influence of psychotherapy on antenatal depression, anxiety, and maternal quality of life. OBJECTIVE To demonstrate the effects of psychotherapy on depression, anxiety, and maternal quality of life during the antenatal stage of pregnancy. METHODS A systematic identification of literature was performed according to PRISMA guidelines on four academic databases: MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, and CENTRAL. A meta-analysis evaluated the influence of psychotherapy on depression, anxiety, and maternal quality of life as compared to conventional obstetric care. RESULTS Out of 1146 records, 22 articles including 2146 pregnant women (mean age: 28.6  2.8 years) were included in this review. This systematic review presents a 1b level of evidence supporting the use of psychotherapy for reducing depression, anxiety and enhancing maternal quality of life.

RECENT FINDINGS Cardiac involvement is a common feature of IIM and inherited muscle diseases. Frequency according to disease subtype varies, with serotype having particular influence in IIM, and genotype in the inherited muscle diseases. Innovative techniques for examining cardiac function have been investigated further, including speckle-tracking echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance tomography. The present work has highlighted a likely underestimate of the burden of cardiac disease to date. The complex relationship between IIM, atherosclerosis, and traditional cardiovascular risk factors has been further elucidated. Consensus recommendations for managing patients with inherited muscle diseases and prominent cardiac involvement have been recently published. In addition to supportive care, disease modifying treatments are increasingly becoming available for inherited muscle diseases which may also improve cardiac outcomes.

One of the ways COVID-19 has impacted the food supply chain is the food production capacity reduction. It is necessary to develop the optimum food supply chain strategy by determining the optimum food hub location and food network to maintain food security which robust against disruptions and uncertainties. In this study, Robust Optimization (RO) is applied to handle the uncertainties. Nevertheless, the actual uncertain data might be hard to be collected or even unavailable at the moment. Therefore, an innovative framework is proposed to integrate RO with Agent-Based Modelling (ABM). ABM is used to simulate the upstream actor of the food supply chain and predict the uncertain food production capacity, which RO later handles. Particularly, this study focused on rice supply chain. The result shows that the framework is able to handle the uncertain rice supply chain problem, in which the actual uncertain data might be unavailable, and give the robust optimum food hub location and food network. The food hub location and food network are obtained by solving the Robust Counterpart (RC) model with respect to the uncertainty set obtained from the ABM simulation result.","output":"Designing a food supply chain strategy during COVID-19 pandemic using an integrated Agent-Based Modelling and Robust Optimization()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wearing surgical masks is one of the best protective measures to protect humans from viral invasion during the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.

METHODOLOGY: The study included 55 patients who were admitted with diagnosis of COVID-19, and whose illnesses showed a critical course that leads to AKI. The variables were studied as per objective. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 43 out of 55 patients (78.2%) died and 12 (21.8%) were discharged with recovery. The mortality was higher in patients at stage 3 (88.9% mortality) compared to stage 2 (53.8% mortality) (p=0.014). In the nonsurvivor group, RDW (red cell distribution width) and albumin levels were lower at admission; whereas, the LDH levels and CRP/albumin ratios were higher. On regression analysis, low albumin level (OR: 12.793, p = 0.010), high LDH level (OR: 8.454, p = 0.026), and presence of stage 3 AKI (OR: 10.268, p = 0.020) were found as independent risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 patients, who developed AKI.

In order to plan proper portfolio diversification in international financial markets, researchers must examine COVID-19 anxiety in relation to stock market volatility. The stock market volatility connected with the COVID-19 pandemic was measured using AR(1)-GARCH(1,1). COVID-19 fear, according to our research, is the ultimate driver of public attention and stock market volatility. The findings show that throughout the pandemic, stock market performance and GDP growth both declined significantly due to average increases. Furthermore, a 1% increase in COVID-19 causes a 0.8% and 0.56% decline in stock return and GDP, respectively. The stock market, on the other hand, showed a slight movement in GDP growth. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic reported cases index, death index, and global panic index all influenced public perceptions of purchasing and selling. As a result, rather than investing in stocks, it is recommended that you invest in gold. The research also makes policy recommendations for important stakeholders. We look to examine how stock returns respond dynamically to unanticipated changes in the COVID-19 scenarios, as well as the uncertainty that comes with a pandemic. Using daily data from Canada and the USA, we conclude that a spike in COVID-19 instances has a negative impact on the stock market in general. Furthermore, in both the increase and decline scenarios in Canada, the stock return reactions are asymmetric. The disparity is due to the unfavorable impact of the pandemic's unpredictability.

It was used to test 998 samples collected from blood donors during the last week of March or the first week of April 2020.

Seroprevalence values did not differ significantly among age groups (but were slightly higher in donors <30yo and 60yo), and between males and females (2.82% vs 2.69%), unlike what has been observed regarding hospitalizations admission to ICU and death rates in France. By contrast, we observed that the proportion of seropositives was significantly lower in group O donors (1.32% vs 3.86% in other donors, p = 0.014).

We introduce ASMODEE (automatic selection of models and outlier detection for epidemics), a new tool for detecting sudden changes in COVID-19 incidence. Our approach relies on automatically selecting the best (fitting or predicting) model from a range of user-defined time series models, excluding the most recent data points, to characterize the main trend in an incidence. We then derive prediction intervals and classify data points outside this interval as outliers, which provides an objective criterion for identifying departures from previous trends. We also provide a method for selecting the optimal breakpoints, used to define how many recent data points are to be excluded from the trend fitting procedure. The analysis of simulated COVID-19 outbreaks suggests ASMODEE compares favourably with a state-of-art outbreak-detection algorithm while being simpler and more flexible. As such, our method could be of wider use for infectious disease surveillance. We illustrate ASMODEE using publicly available data of National Health Service (NHS) Pathways reporting potential COVID-19 cases in England at a fine spatial scale, showing that the method would have enabled the early detection of the flare-ups in Leicester and Blackburn with Darwen, two to three weeks before their respective lockdown.

Methods We fielded a national household survey in English and Spanish from June 5-10, 2020 (n=1,008). Parents were asked about their likelihood of immunizing their children and themselves against COVID-19. We fit separate regression models of parents' likelihood to vaccinate themselves and their children against COVID-19, using bivariate and multivariable approaches in analyses weighted to be nationally representative. Results Overall, 63% of parents (95% CI: 59%, 66%) were likely to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, and 60% (57%, 64%) were likely to get a vaccine themselves. These responses were highly correlated (Pearson's r=0.89). Parent age, sex, marital status, education level, and income were all associated with parents' likelihood to vaccinate their children and themselves in bivariate analyses; race/ethnicity was significantly associated with parents' likelihood to vaccinate their children. In multivariable analyses, younger parents were significantly less likely than older parents to vaccinate their children and themselves against COVID-19, as were parents with high school or less education compared with parents with bachelor's degrees and non-Hispanic White parents compared with Hispanic parents (all p<.05).

OBJECTIVE Our aim was to determine whether interventions providing whole grain or whole pseudo-grain for dietary consumption improved CVD-related outcomes compared with refined grain or placebo in adults with or without chronic disease and/or associated risk factors. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared whole-grain vs refined-grain or placebo consumption by human adults was conducted. PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched for studies of 12 weeks (or 2 weeks for inflammatory outcomes) duration until 21 February 2020. Data were extracted for 14 types of CVD risk factors (40 outcomes in total). Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool. Meta-analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method was used to determine confidence in the pooled effects and to inform a clinical recommendation. RESULTS Twenty-five randomized controlled trials were included and 22 were meta-analyzed. Interventions ranged from 2 to 16 weeks; most samples were healthy (n = 13 studies) and used mixed whole grains (n = 11 studies). Meta-analysis found that whole-grain oats improved total cholesterol (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.54, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.12) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (SMD = -0.57, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.31), whole-grain rice improved triglycerides (SMD = 0.22, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.01), and whole grains (all types) improved hemoglobin A1c (SMD = -0.33, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.04) and C-reactive protein (SMD = -0.22, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.00). CONCLUSIONS For adults with or without CVD risk factors, consuming whole grains as opposed to refined grains can improve total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, and C-reactive protein. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the whole grains as opposed to refined grains for the prevention and treatment of CVD. Further interventional research is needed to better understand the preventive and treatment potential of whole-grain and whole pseudo-grain dietary intake for cardiovascular disease, particularly among those with existing CVD risk factors.","output":"The Effect of Replacing Refined Grains with Whole Grains on Cardiovascular Risk Factors: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials with GRADE Clinical Recommendation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the goal of protecting injured lungs and extrapulmonary organs, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) has been increasingly adopted as a rescue therapy for patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) when conventional mechanical ventilation failed to provide effective oxygenation and decarbonation.

Here we show essential differences in the way prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HC) process the RR signal from the olfactory bulb (OB) allowing dynamic PFC-HC coupling utilizing this input. We used inter-regional coherences and their correlations in rats, breathing at low rate (~2 Hz) at rest, outside of the short sniffing bouts. We found strong and stable OB-PFC coherence, contrasting OB-HC coherence which was low but highly variable. PFC-HC coupling, however, primarily correlated with the latter, indicating that HC access to the PFC output is dynamically regulated by the responsiveness of HC to the common rhythmic drive. This pattern was present in both theta and non-theta states of waking, whereas PFC-HC communication appeared protected from RR synchronization in sleep states. The findings help to understand the mechanism of rhythmic modulation of non-olfactory cognitive processes by the on-going regular respiration, reported in rodents as well as humans.

METHODS: In this county-level study, we investigated age-adjusted co-mortalities of 20 diseases, including cardiovascular, cancer, drug and alcohol disorder, respiratory and infectious diseases with COVID-19 over the first ten months of epidemic. One-way analysis of variance was applied to the Local Moran's I classes (High-High and Low-Low clusters, and non-significant counties of COVID-19) to examine whether the mean mortality measures of covariates that fall into the classes are significantly different. Moreover, a mixed-effects multinomial logistic regression model was employed to estimate the effects of mortalities on COVID-19 classes. RESULTS: Results showed that the distribution of COVID-19 case fatality ratio (CFR) and mortality rate co-occurrence of High-High clusters were mainly concentrated in Louisiana, Connecticut, and New Jersey. Also, positive associations were observed between High-High cluster of COVID-19 CFR and Asthma (OR = 4.584, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI): 2.583C8.137), Hepatitis (OR = 5.602, CI: 1.265C24.814) and Leukemia (OR = 2.172, CI: 1.518C3.106) mortality rates compared to the non-significant counties, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that counties with higher mortality of some cancers and respiratory diseases are more vulnerable to fall into clusters of HH COVID-19 CFR.

Here we describe the potential for pan-family viral assays to improve early accessibility of large-scale nucleic acid testing. Methods Coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 were used as a case-study for investigating the utility of pan-family viral assays during the early stages of a novel pandemic. Specificity of a pan-coronavirus (Pan-CoV) assay for viral detection was assessed using the frequency of common human coronavirus (HCoV) species in key populations. A reported Pan-CoV assay was assessed to determine sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 and 59 other coronavirus species. The resilience of the primer target regions of this assay to mutation was assessed in 8893 high quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes to predict ongoing utility during pandemic progression. Findings Due to infection with common HCoV species, a Pan-CoV assay would return a false positive for as few as 1% of asymptomatic adults, but up to 30% of immunocompromised patients displaying symptoms of respiratory disease. Two of the four reported pan-coronavirus assays would have identified SARS-CoV-2 and we demonstrate that with small adjustments to the primers, these assays can accommodate novel variation observed in animal coronaviruses. The assay target region of one well established Pan-CoV assay is highly resistant to mutation compared to regions targeted by other widely applied SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays. Interpretation Pan-family assays have the potential to greatly assist management of emerging public health emergencies through prioritization of high-resolution testing or isolation measures, despite limitations in test specificity due to cross-reactivity with common pathogens. Targeting highly conserved genomic regions make pan-family assays robust and resilient to mutation of a given virus. This approach may be applicable to other viral families and has utility as part of a strategic stockpile of tests maintained to better contain spread of novel diseases prior to the widespread availability of specific assays.","output":"Utility of Pan-Family Assays for Rapid Viral Screening: Reducing Delays in Public Health Responses During Pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There have been several reports on why the clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pediatric patients is milder than in adults There are distinctive points in the immune system between children and adults, as well as in the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 gene expression, the characteristics of the respiratory system, the effects of comorbidities and risk factors, and the effect of infection control Even though children tend to have mild forms of COVID-19, this does not mean that we should not regard it as a matter of importance","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019: Reasons for better clinical course for children compared to adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Indonesia is found to be the highest death rate of COVID-19 disease After Indonesian government has been asked to seriously keep on eye the COVID-19 by UN, they begin to make an official report of the effect of COVID-19 outbreak in the beginning of March 2020 The government and NGOs have taken the initiative to provide guidance for the public to avoid this Corona virus However, it found that the death rate is higher rather than the patient's cure rate This study is aimed to investigate the behavioural problem of Indonesian citizen facing COVID-19 The convenience sampling is used to employ the respondent of this study by using an online survey The model of this behavioural is tested by using Structural Equational Model (SEM) approach This study found that Indonesian citizen respond to prevent from COVID-19 They who understand the characteristics of COVID-19 sufferers and know how their transmission, have a slightly different effect to their response in avoiding COVID-19, whereas religiosity and attitude towards COVID-19 are positively influence on their response to avoid COVID-19 The religiosity and attitude towards COVID-19 play a significant role to change the effect of the understanding on characteristics of COVID-19 sufferers and how the transmission of COVID-19 on the respond to avoid COVID-19 Nevertheless, religiosity is found to have smaller effect on the respond to avoid COVID-19 rather than awareness This finding is indicated to show a unique behaviour of Indonesian citizenship to avoid COVID-19 ? 2020, Hampstead Psychological Associates All rights reserved","output":"The Indonesian citizen behavior in facing covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was an impetus for a multitude of transformations - from the ever-changing clinical practice frameworks, to changes in our execution of education and research It called for our decisiveness, innovativeness, creativity, and adaptability in many circumstances Even as care for our patients was always top priority, we tried to integrate, where possible, educational and research activities in order to ensure these areas continue to be harnessed and developed COVID-19 provided a platform that stretched our ingenuity in all these domains One of the mnemonics we use at SingHealth in responding to crisis is PACERS: P: Preparedness (in responding to any crisis, this is critical) A: Adaptability (needed especially with the ever-changing situation) C: Communications (the cornerstone in handling any crisis) E: Education (must continue, irrespective of what) R: Research (new opportunities to share and learn) S: Support (both physical and psychological) This article shares our experience integrating the concept of simulation-based training, quality improvement, and failure mode analysis","output":"Infection control measures, in situ simulation, and failure modes and effect analysis to fine-tune change management during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lyme disease is a bacterial infection spread through the bite of an infected tick.

We quantify the potential impacts of Ethiopia's tobacco tax hike on various outcomeslife years, tax revenues, cigarette expenditures and catastrophic health expenditures (CHE). Using parameters like price elasticity of demand for cigarettes and smoking prevalence in Ethiopia from the existing literature and secondary data sources, we model the potential implications of the reform at the population level and for different wealth quintiles. We focus only on men since a small proportion of Ethiopian women smoke. Results indicate that Ethiopia's tax hike could induce a significant proportion of current smokers to quit smoking and thereby save almost eight million years of life in the current population. The reform is also likely to increase tax revenues by USD26 million in the first year after its introduction. The richest quintile will bear the greatest share of this higher tax burden and the poorest will bear the least. Additionally, deaths due to the main diseases associated with smoking will fall. This is expected to avert up to 173,000 CHE cases due to the out-of-pocket costs that would have been incurred in obtaining medical treatment. This analysis highlights that cigarette tax hikes in countries that have low smoking prevalence can reduce smoking even further, and thereby protect against the future health and financial costs of smoking.

Most of these patients need care in the ICU, which is reduced in capacity in pandemic conditions. It's important to note that delays in the surgery of these patients make them non-operable and on the other hand increase mortality and morbidity. Numerous non-surgical alternative therapies have been proposed in these conditions, but there are fundamental questions about these suggestions. 1 How long should we look for alternative therapies? Because many countries are facing a second wave of the disease. 2 What's the effect of these alternative therapies and the delay in starting standard treatments in patients' survival? Different countries have different financial resources; many countries, patients face restrictions on receiving alternative therapies to standard treatments, and in non-pandemic conditions, long queues are given for non-surgical treatments such as chemo-radiotherapy.

The drug is used in combination with artesunate for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, in adults and children. The present review briefly retraces the discovery of PYR and recent antimalarial studies which has led to the approval of PYR/artesunate combination (Pyramax) by the European Medicines Agency to treat uncomplicated malaria worldwide. PYR also presents a marked antitumor activity and has revealed efficacy for the treatment of other parasitic diseases (notably Babesia and Trypanosoma infections) and to mitigate the Ebola virus propagation. On the one hand, PYR functions has an inhibitor of hemozoin (biomineral malaria pigment, by-product of hemoglobin digestion) formation, blocking the biopolymerization of -hematin and thus facilitating the accumulation of toxic hematin into the digestive vacuole of the parasite. On the other hand, PYR is a bona fide DNA-intercalating agent and an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase 2, leading to DNA damages and cell death. Inhibition of hematin polymerization represents the prime mechanism at the origin of the antimalarial activity, whereas anticancer effects relies essentially on the interference with DNA metabolism, as with structurally related anticancer drugs like amsacrine and quinacrine. In addition, recent studies point to an immune modulatory activity of PYR and the implication of a mitochondrial oxidative pathway. An analogy with the mechanism of action of artemisinin drugs is underlined.

The Chinese government executed a series of interventions to curb the pandemic. The \\"battle\\" against COVID-19 in Shenzhen, China is valuable because populated industrial cities are the epic centres of COVID-19 in many regions. We made use of synthetic control methods to create a reference population matching specific characteristics of Shenzhen. With both the synthetic and observed data, we introduced an epidemic compartmental model to compare the spread of COVID-19 between Shenzhen and its counterpart regions in the United States that didn't implement interventions for policy evaluation. Once the effects of policy interventions adopted in Shenzhen were estimated, the delay effects of those interventions were referred to provide the further control degree of interventions. Thus, the hypothetical epidemic situations in Shenzhen were inferred by using time-varying reproduction numbers in the proposed SIHR (Susceptible, Infectious, Hospitalized, Removed) model and considering if the interventions were delayed by 0 day to 5 days. The expected cumulative confirmed cases would be 1546, which is 5.75 times of the observed cumulative confirmed cases of 269 in Shenzhen on February 3, 2020, based on the data from the counterpart counties (mainly from Broward, New York, Santa Clara, Pinellas, and Westchester) in the United States.

This bacterium produces two large exotoxins, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), which are directly responsible for the onset of clinical symptoms of C. difficile-associated diseases (CDADs), such as antibiotics-associated diarrhea and the severe, life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis. Both toxins are multidomain proteins and taken up into host eukaryotic cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Within the cell, TcdA and TcdB inactivate Rho and/or Ras protein family members by glucosylation, which eventually results in cell death. The cytotoxic mode of action of the toxins is the main reason for the disease. Thus, compounds capable of inhibiting the cellular uptake and/or mode-of-action of both toxins are of high therapeutic interest. Recently, we found that the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2) pathway, which regulates cholesterol content in membranes, is crucial for the intoxication of cells by TcdA and TcdB. Furthermore, it has been shown that membrane cholesterol is required for TcdA- as well as TcdB-mediated pore formation in endosomal membranes, which is a key step during the translocation of the glucosyltransferase domain of both toxins from endocytic vesicles into the cytosol of host cells. In the current study, we demonstrate that intoxication by TcdA and TcdB is diminished in cultured cells preincubated with the compound U18666A, an established inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis and/or intracellular transport. U18666A-pretreated cells were also less sensitive against TcdA and TcdB variants from the epidemic NAP1/027 C. difficile strain.

For example, bronchial hyperresponsiveness may be seen in patients with allergic rhinitis. This could represent coexistent but unrecognized asthma, but also suggests that IgE-dependent inflammation may occur in the lower airway that can increase bronchial hyperresponsiveness without at the same time precipitating obvious obstruction. Clearly, allergic rhinitis is a risk factor for asthma. A second example of the interaction of upper airway inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity are reports that viral upper respiratory tract infections may cause otherwise healthy persons to respond abnormally to inhaled histamine or irritants for several months after the infections. These same viruses usually precipitate attacks in patients with asthma, who already have hyperresponsive airways.

In addition, tube formation and wound healing assays were performed to investigate a possible direct interaction between PSG1 and endothelial cells. PSG1 induced up-regulation of both TGFB1 and VEGFA in human monocytes, macrophages, and two human extravillous trophoblast cell lines. We did not observe induction of VEGFC or PGF by PSG1 in any of the cells tested. PSG1 treatment resulted in endothelial tube formation in the presence and absence of VEGFA.

Since the outbreak began various healthcare providers and academic institutions across the world have been targeted in a variety of complex and coordinatized cyber-attacks. International and national regulatory bodies have stressed the urgent need for healthcare providers and universities to protect themselves against cyber-attacks during COVID-19, recognising that a growing number of cyber-criminals are seeking to capitalise on the vulnerabilities of the healthcare sector during this period. This includes a desire to steal intellectual property such as data relating to COVID-19 vaccine development, modelling and experimental therapeutics. It is therefore essential that healthcare providers and universities ensure they are informed, protected and prepared to respond to any cyber-threat.

The genome was directly accessed from the stool sample of a patient in Beijing. Comparative genomics methods were used to analyze the sequence variations of 116 SARS-CoV genomes (including BJ202) available in the NCBI Gen-Bank. With the genome sequence of GZ02 as the reference, there were 41 polymorphic sites identified in BJ202 and a total of 278 polymorphic sites present in at least two of the 116 genomes. The distribution of the polymorphic sites was biased over the whole genome. Nearly half of the variations (50.4%, 140/278) clustered in the one third of the whole genome at the 3 end (19.0 kb-29.7 kb). Regions encoding Orf10C11, Orf3/4, E, M and S protein had the highest mutation rates. A total of 15 PCR products (about 6.0 kb of the genome) including 11 fragments containing 12 known polymorphic sites and 4 fragments without identified polymorphic sites were cloned and sequenced. Results showed that 3 unique polymorphic sites of BJ202 (positions 13 804, 15 031 and 20 792) along with 3 other polymorphic sites (26 428, 26 477 and 27 243) all contained 2 kinds of nucleotides. It is interesting to find that position 18379 which has not been identified to be polymorphic in any of the other 115 published SARS-CoV genomes is actually a polymorphic site. The nucleotide composition of this site is A (8) to G (6). Among 116 SARS-CoV genomes, 18 types of deletions and 2 insertions were identified. Most of them were related to a 300 bp region (27 700C28 000) which encodes parts of the putative ORF9 and ORF10C11. A phylogenetic tree illustrating the divergence of whole BJ202 genome from 115 other completely sequenced SARS-CoVs was also constructed.

While grocery shopping is an essential activity, not much is known about the dynamic relationship of the COVID-19 pandemic to the behavior of grocery shoppers. With an objective to inform variability in the behavior of grocery shoppers under various scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted an online framed choice experiment to elicit preferences for purchasing methods, time windows, minimum order requirements, and fees. The manipulating factor relates to the trend in the COVID-19 pandemic, where we consider three scenarios: an increasing, decreasing, or constant number of new cases in the past two-week period. Using 32,400 choice decisions from a representative sample of 900 grocery shoppers in the United States, we conclude that the trend in the COVID-19 pandemic causes significant differences in grocery shopping preferences. In situations where COVID-19 is spreading at an increasing rate, consumers are generally less willing to shop inside the grocery store. When COVID-19 is spreading at a decreasing rate, the relative importance of the purchasing method attribute is lower in its entirety.

The data reviewed included clinical manifestations, laboratory test results and radiographic features. The cellular immune function and the expression of inflammatory factors in deceased patients at different stages of the disease were analyzed, and the clinical data and laboratory test results between the deceased group and the moderate group (20 patients), severe group (20 patients) and the critical group (10 patients) were compared.Results Of those who died, the patients consisted of 10 men and 3 women. The average age of those who died was (7419) years, and 10 patients were over 70 years old (76.9%), which was significantly higher than the ages of patients in the moderate group, severe group and critical group. There were no significant differences in sex ratio and clinical manifestations among the 4 groups. For the patients who died, 9presented with underlying diseases,6 of whom had more than 2 diseases, which was significantly higher than the number of underlying disease in the other groups. On admission, the chest computed tomography (CT) for 8 patients (61.5%) mainly showed multiple patchy ground-glass opacities. When the disease progressed, the ground-glass opacities rapidly developed into diffuse lesions in both lungs. The lymphocyte and CD3 + ,CD4 + , and CD8 + T lymphocyte counts in the peripheral blood of 13 patients were significantly lower than normal levels and decreased more substantially during the disease course based on the levels when admitted (P<0.01). Additionally, the IL-6, D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactic acid levels gradually increased, and most peaked before death. There were statistically significant differences in IL-6 expression, lymphocyte count and T lymphocyte subset count between the deceased group and the moderate group, severe group and critical group (P<0.01). However, there were no statistically significant differences in serum CRP lactic acid levels among the 4 groups (P>0.05).The cause of death for most patients was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with type I respiratory failure. Three patients eventually developed multiorgan deficiency syndrome (MODS).Conclusion The risk factors of death for COVID-19 patients included older men, more underlying diseases, poor cellular immune function and overexpression of inflammatory factors.

A quantitative, shortitudinal design (diary study; over a few days) with a multi-level research approach using a daily diary survey method was completed by a convenience sample of nurses working the nightshift in a public hospital (n = 33). The results revealed that the daily need for autonomy and need for relatedness did not significantly predict variance in daily work engagement. However, need for competence did significantly predict variance in daily work engagement, and general emotional load explained significant variability in daily need satisfaction of competence.

The role of IFITM3 in cancer has been preliminarily summarized, but its relationship to antitumor immunity is still unclear. A pancancer analysis was conducted to investigate the expression pattern and immunological role of IFITM3 based on transcriptomic data downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Next, correlations between IFITM3 and immunological features in the bladder cancer (BLCA) tumor microenvironment (TME) were assessed. In addition, the role of IFITM3 in estimating the clinical characteristics and the response to various therapies in BLCA was also evaluated. These results were next confirmed in the IMvigor210 cohort and a recruited cohort. In addition, correlations between IFITM3 and emerging immunobiomarkers, such as microbiota and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) genes, were assessed. IFITM3 was enhanced in most tumor tissues in comparison with adjacent tissues. IFITM3 was positively correlated with immunomodulators, tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs), cancer immunity cycles, and inhibitory immune checkpoints. In addition, IFITM3 was associated with an inflamed phenotype and several established molecular subtypes. IFITM3 expression also predicted a notably higher response to chemotherapy, anti-EGFR therapy, and immunotherapy but a low response to anti-ERBB2, anti-ERBB4, and antiangiogenic therapy. In addition, IFITM3 was correlated with immune-related microbiota and m6A genes. In addition to BLCA, IFITM3 is expected to be a marker of high immunogenicity in most human cancers. In conclusion, IFITM3 expression can be used to identify immuno-hot tumors in most cancers, and IFITM3 may be a promising pancancer biomarker to estimate the immunological features of tumors.","output":"Interferon-Induced Transmembrane Protein 3 Shapes an Inflamed Tumor Microenvironment and Identifies Immuno-Hot Tumors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a potentially fatal adverse reaction after administration of unfractionated or fractionated heparin, which underlies the generation of antibodies to the heparin complex and platelet factor 4 (PF4). It occurs in 5% of patients treated with unfractionated heparin and 0.5 - 1.5% fractionated heparin. The aim of the study is to determine the incidence and outcome of hemodialysis patients with HIT over 4-years period. METHOD: This retrospective study analyzed patients who were tested for evidence of positive anti-heparin antibody in the period from 2015 to 2020 in Zvezdara University Medical Center. The diagnosis was confirmed by the 4T clinical scoring system, a positive antiheparin-PF4 ELISA test and a positive platelet aggregation test with heparin. RESULTS: During observation period, total of 64 tests were performed, out of which 23 patients were positive. Out of them, 14 patients were on HD, 7 patients (geriatric, surgery and cardiology departments) received therapy due to peripheral thrombosis, AIM or arrhythmia and 2 patients during 2020 due to SARS-CoV-2 bilateral pneumonia. All patients treated at nephrology, started hemodialysis (HD) with unfractionated heparin, while others were treated with LMWH. 4T scoring showed that 64% of patients had a moderate risk of developing HIT, while high risk was assessed in 36% of patients. Thrombotic complications in the form of deep venous thrombosis had 53% of patients and pulmonary thromboembolism had 17,5 % of patients. The greatest decrease in Tr was the most commonly observed between 10(th) and 14(th) day (61% of patients) and 39% from 4(th) to 10(th) day from start of heparin administration. In addition to heparin withdrawal and treatment with alternative non-heparin anticoagulation (fondaparinoux), 7 patients needed plasma treatment. 11 patients on HD were transferred to peritoneal dialysis (PD), and 3 patients recovered renal function. Overall mortality was 52%, and it was below 30% in hemodialysis patients. CONCLUSION: HIT should be considered in patients at risk.

The majority of infected patients either traveled to Wuhan or came into contact with an infected person from Wuhan. Investigating members of the public with a travel history to Wuhan became the primary focus of the Chinese governments epidemic prevention and control measures, but several instances of withheld histories were uncovered as localized clusters of infections broke out. This study investigated the publics willingness and cognition toward reporting travel history to high-risk epidemic regions, to provide effective suggestions and measures for encouraging travel reporting. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted online between February 12 and 19, 2020. Descriptive analysis, chi-squared test, and Fishers exact test were used to identify socio-demographic factors and cognition toward reporting, as well as their impact on the willingness to report on travel history to high-risk epidemic regions. Results Of the 1,344 respondents, 91 (6.77%) expressed an inclination to deliberately withhold travel history. Those who understood the benefits of reporting and the legal consequences for deliberately withholding information, showed greater willingness to report their history (P < 0.05);conversely, those who believed reporting would stigmatize them and feared being quarantined after reporting showed less willingness to report (P < 0.05). Conclusions As any incident of withheld history can have unpredictable outcomes, the proportion of people who deliberately withhold information deserves attention. Appropriate public risk communication and public advocacy strategies should be implemented to strengthen the understanding that reporting on travel history facilitates infection screening and prompt treatment, and to decrease the fear of potentially becoming quarantined after reporting. Additionally, social support and policies should be established, and measures should be taken to alleviate stigmatization and discrimination against potential patients and reporters of travel history. Reinforcing the legal accountability of withholding travel history and strengthening systematic community monitoring are the measures that China is currently taking to encourage reporting on travel history to high-risk epidemic regions. These non-pharmaceutical interventions are relevant for countries that are currently facing the spread of the epidemic and those at risk of its potential spread.","output":"Willingness and Cognition Toward Reporting Travel History to High-Risk Coronavirus Disease 2019 Epidemic Regions Among The Chinese Public: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The D614G mutation in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 alters the fitness of the virus, making it the dominant form in the COVID-19 pandemic.

The scarcity of validated guidelines - at the beginning of this healthcare crisis - to direct clinical, ethical, transparent decision-making for head and neck cancer patients requiring palliative reconstructive surgery was a difficult situation. We report a 15-year-old girl with an advanced chemoresistant rare radiotherapy-induced mandibular osteosarcoma during the early phase of the pandemic in the United States in mid-March 2020, when official recommendations for triage were still developing. Local guidelines suggested canceling all elective procedures, and allowed operating emergency and/or nonelective cases only. Many surgeons declined surgery due to patient's poor prognosis and high perioperative risk, but her mother pursued different professional opinions elsewhere. However, upon Beaumont hospital approval, the patient underwent radical en bloc resection of the tumor, hemimandibulectomy, zygomatic resection, maxillectomy, and hemipalate resection followed by reconstruction with free fibula osteocutaneous and anterolateral thigh flaps. The challenging decision to proceed with surgery was based on evidence-based and objective risk-stratifying scores, available at the time, and ethical recommendations from emerging reliable published literature. Despite a favorable postoperative outcome, the patient expired due to cardiac complications of the disease. Our patient taught us that ethical decision-making, sound clinical judgment, and a patient-centered individualized approach remain pivotal aspects of the medical profession. Although the surgery will not provide a cure for the disease, we have found that palliative reconstructive surgery can greatly improve patient's quality of life, and help family cope with the advancing stages of disease. ? 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Cerebellar total volume, gray and white matter volume fractions, molecular and granular layers volume fractions, cerebellar surface area, Purkinje cellular and nuclear volumes, and the Purkinje cell total count were stereologically estimated. For this purpose, cerebellar hemispheres from six adult male guinea pigs were employed. Isotropic, uniform random sections were obtained by applying the orientator method, and subsequently processed for light microscopy. The cerebellar total volume, the white and grey matter volume fractions, and the molecular and granular layer volumes were estimated using the Cavalieri's principle and the point counting system. The cerebellar surface area was estimated through the use of test lines; Purkinje cellular and nuclear volumes were analysed using the nucleator technique, whereas the Purkinje cell total count was obtained by means of the optical disector technique. The mean  standard deviation total volume of a guinea-pig cerebellar hemisphere was 0.11  0.01 cm3 . The mean volumetric proportions occupied by the gray and white matters were, respectively, 78.0  2.6% and 22.0  2.6%, whereas their mean absolute volumes were found to be 0.21  0.02 cm3 and 0.059  0.006 cm3 . The volumes of the molecular and granular layers were estimated at 112.4  20.6 mm3 and 104.4  7.3 mm3 , whereas their mean thicknesses were calculated to be 0.184  0.020 mm and 0.17  0.02 mm.

We further conduct a social network analysis (SNA) on the ERC case in the Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) of Bobai County, Guangxi Province, China to illustrate the hidden interactions and interest transmission structure among stakeholders in ERC. The results show that the ERC presents obvious characteristics of concealment and complexity, and individual capture often evolves into collective capture. Different stakeholders are in different positions and play different roles in the network. The environmental regulatory authority, the commissioned regulatory agency, and the agency of enterprises form the core power circle of the ERC network, in which the first two play the role of intermediary and the latter acts as an initiator. They together occupy the structural hole position and dominate the evolution of the ERC network. Peripheral structure stakeholders play the role of bridge and profit from the expanding ERC network. It is recommended that the principle of decentralization and the balance of power must be taken into consideration. Quantitative analysis methods such as SNA should be applied to clarify accountability when punishing responsible persons.

Self-care in DM refers to the real-life application of the knowledge that the patient gained during the education programmes. The goals are to bring about changes in the patients behaviour, thus improving glycaemic control. We evaluated the influence of DM self-care activities (SCA) on glycaemic control in a total of 159 patients with DM. Plasma glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were used to monitor glycaemic control, while SCA were assessed using the standardised Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire (DSMQ). In our study, 53% of the patients had a HbA1c  7%. In univariate linear regression models, a statistically significant inverse association was observed between the HbA1c (the dependent variable) and both the DSMQ Dietary Control Score (R2 = 0.037, p = 0.0145) and the DSMQ Sum Score (R2 = 0.06, p = 0.0014). The mean absolute change in the HbA1c% associated with one standard deviation (SD) change in the DSMQ Sum Score, independent of the other significant variables retained in the compacted multivariate regression model, was ?0.419% (confidence interval: 95%: from ?0.18 to ?0.65).

The virus is unlike its previous counterparts, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, or anything the world has encountered before both in terms of virulence and severity of the infection. If scientific reports relevant to the SARS-CoV-2 virus are noted, it can be seen that the virus owes much of its killer properties to its unique structure that has a stronger binding affinity with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) protein, which the viruses utilize as an entry point to gain accesses to its hosts. Recent reports suggest that it is not just the lung that the virus may be targeting; the human brain may soon emerge as the new abode of the virus. Already instances of patients with COVID-19 have been reported with mild (anosmia and ageusia) to severe (encephalopathy) neurological manifestations, and if that is so, then it gives us more reasons to be frightened of this killer virus. Keeping in mind that the situation does not worsen from here, immediate awareness and more thorough research regarding the neuroinvasive nature of the virus is the immediate need of the hour. Scientists globally also need to up their game to design more specific therapeutic strategies with the available information to counteract the pandemic.

A very narrow pattern of pandemic flu-specific IgG epitope recognition was observed in the serum from individuals who later contracted H1N1 infection. Moreover, the pandemic influenza infection generated IgG reactivity to two adjacent epitopes of the neuraminidase protein. The differential serum IgG recognition was focused on haemagglutinin 1 (H1) and restricted to classical antigenic sites (Cb) in both the vaccinated controls and individuals with flu infections. We further identified a novel epitope VEPGDKITFEATGNL on the Ca antigenic site (251C265) of the pandemic flu haemagglutinin, which was exclusively recognized in serum from individuals with previous vaccinations and never in serum from individuals with H1N1 infection (confirmed by RNA PCR analysis from nasal swabs). This epitope was mapped to the receptor-binding domain of the influenza haemagglutinin and could serve as a correlate of immune protection in the context of pandemic flu.

In case of COVID-19 patients, diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN) are the prime risk factors and during the course of treatment, patients develop secondary fungal infections like mucormycosis. We conducted a systemic review of the present scenario and tried to evaluate the association of mucormycosis with COVID-19. Methods: We searched articles related to the COVID-19 associated mucormycosis, in PubMed, IndMed, and Cochrane Library. We conducted a meta-analysis on the basis of systemically reviewed all articles which reported COVID-19 associated with mucormycosis. We analyzed comorbidity, treatment, and outcome of patients in association with COVID-19 and mucormycosis.

It is unclear whether tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 infection facilitates ventilator weaning, and long-term outcomes are not yet reported in the literature. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of tracheostomy outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection at a single-center academic tertiary referral intensive care unit. Patients underwent percutaneous tracheostomy at the bedside; the procedure was performed with limited staffing to reduce risk of disease transmission. RESULTS: Between March 1 and June 30, 2020, a total of 206 patients with COVID-19 infection required mechanical ventilation and 26 underwent tracheostomy at a mean of 255 days after initial intubation. Overall, 81% of tracheostomy patients were liberated from the ventilator at a mean of 96 days postprocedure, and 54% were decannulated prior to hospital discharge at a mean of 2110 days postprocedure. Sedation and pain medication requirements decreased significantly in the week after the procedure. In-hospital mortality was 15%. Among tracheostomy survivors, 68% were discharged to a facility. DISCUSSION: The management of patients with COVID-19 related respiratory failure can be challenging due to prolonged ventilator dependency. In our initial experience, outcomes post-tracheostomy in this population are encouraging, with short time to liberation from the ventilator, a high rate of decannulation prior to hospital discharge, and similar mortality to tracheostomy performed for other indications.

IASOS exerted a strong antimicrobial activity towards all the pathogens tested in both culture media. The results demonstrated that salts and organic compounds present in the culture media influenced IASOS efficacy only to a moderate extent. Whereas comparable MBCs (Minimal Bactericidal Concentrations) were observed for G. vaginalis (10 mg/L Ag(+)), E. coli and E. aerogenes (25 mg/L Ag(+)) in both media, higher MBCs were found for S. aureus and S. agalactiae in LAPT cultures (50 mg/L Ag(+) versus 25 mg/L Ag(+)). No minimal concentration totally inhibiting the growth of C. albicans was found. Nevertheless, in both media at the highest ionic silver concentrations (50C200 mg/L Ag(+)), a significant 34C52% drop in Candida growth was observed. pH differently affected the antimicrobial properties of IASOS against bacteria or yeasts; however, a stronger antimicrobial activity at pH higher than the physiological pH was generally observed. It can be therefore concluded that IASOS exerts a bactericidal action against all the tested bacteria and a clear fungistatic action against C. albicans.

DISCUSSION: Aprs une revue de la littrature de tous les articles jusquen 09/21, un seul cas de fuite de LCR due  une rupture de mningocle secondaire  une PCR a t rapport [2]. Ce cas retrouvait seulement un coulement nasal de LCR sans complication infectieuse. Notre cas est le premier cas rapport  notre connaissance de mningite grave rvlant une mningocle rompue secondairement  une PCR nasopharynge avec ncessit dhospitalisation en ranimation et de geste endoscopique pour fermeture de la brche. En France, les pneumocoques sont la premire cause de mningite bactrienne chez ladulte avec une mortalit de 10  30 % qui augmente avec lage et la prsence de comorbidits. De plus, les squelles neurologiques surviennent chez 30  52 % des survivants. Il sagit donc dune infection grave avec une incidence denviron 600 cas/an en France et dont la vaccination a permis une diminution significative ces dernires annes [3]. Le prlvement nasopharyng pour SARSCOV2 est courant (4 millions par semaine en France) et simple. Ce cas permet de rappeler le fait que ce geste peut entra?ner une complication mcanique grave malgr sa raret.

Little is known regarding global variation in patterns of use. Objective: To provide insights into which EHR activities clinicians spend their time doing, the EHR tools they use, the system messages they receive, and the amount of time they spend using the EHR after hours. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study analyzed the deidentified metadata of ambulatory care health systems in the US, Canada, Northern Europe, Western Europe, the Middle East, and Oceania from January 1, 2019, to August 31, 2019. All of these organizations used the EHR software from Epic Systems and represented most of Epic Systems's ambulatory customer base. The sample included all clinicians with scheduled patient appointments, such as physicians and advanced practice practitioners. Exposures: Clinician EHR use was tracked by deidentified and aggregated metadata across a variety of clinical activities. Main Outcomes and Measures: Descriptive statistics for clinician EHR use included time spent on clinical activities, note documentation (as measured by the percentage of characters in the note generated by automated or manual data entry source), messages received, and time spent after hours. Results: A total of 371 health systems were included in the sample, of which 348 (93.8%) were located in the US and 23 (6.2%) were located in other countries. US clinicians spent more time per day actively using the EHR compared with non-US clinicians (mean time, 90.2 minutes vs 59.1 minutes; P < .001). In addition, US clinicians vs non-US clinicians spent significantly more time performing 4 clinical activities: notes (40.7 minutes vs 30.7 minutes; P < .001), orders (19.5 minutes vs 8.75 minutes; P < .001), in-basket messages (12.5 minutes vs 4.80 minutes; P < .001), and clinical review (17.6 minutes vs 14.8 minutes; P = .01). Clinicians in the US composed more automated note text than their non-US counterparts (77.5% vs 60.8% of note text; P < .001) and received statistically significantly more messages per day (33.8 vs 12.8; P < .001). Furthermore, US clinicians used the EHR for a longer time after hours, logging in 26.5 minutes per day vs 19.5 minutes per day for non-US clinicians (P = .01). The median US clinician spent as much time actively using the EHR per day (90.1 minutes) as a non-US clinician in the 99th percentile of active EHR use time per day (90.7 minutes) in the sample. These results persisted after controlling for organizational characteristics, including structure, type, size, and daily patient volume. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that US clinicians compared with their non-US counterparts spent substantially more time actively using the EHR for a wide range of clinical activities or tasks. This finding suggests that US clinicians have a greater EHR burden that may be associated with nontechnical factors, which policy makers and health system leaders should consider when addressing clinician wellness.","output":"Assessment of Electronic Health Record Use Between US and Non-US Health Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH) cause high levels of morbidity and mortality.

Using a systematic review of individual cases and case series and collating elements of the clinical course, the objective of this study was to provide a detailed clinical description and natural history of MIS-C. METHODS: Case reports and series of MIS-C were recovered from repeated MEDLINE searches, a single EMBASE search and table of contents reviews of major general medicine and pediatric journals performed between June 3 and July 23, 2020. Fever, evidence of inflammation, and evidence of organ dysfunction were required for inclusion. RESULTS: MEDLINE and EMBASE searches produced 129 articles and 10 articles were identified from journal contents or article bibliographies; 16 reports describing 505 children with MIS-C comprise this review. Thirty- two children (14.7%) had negative results for SARS-Cov-2 by nucleic acid and/or antibody testing. The weighted median age was 9 years (6 months to 20 years). Clinical findings included fever (100%), gastrointestinal symptoms (88.0%), rash (59.2%), conjunctivitis (50.0%), chelitis/ \\"strawberry tongue\\" (55.7%) or extremity edema/erythema (47.5%). Median serum CRP, ferritin, fibrinogen and D dimer concentrations were above the normal range. Intravenous gammaglobulin (78.1%) and methylprednisolone/prednisone(57.6%) were the most common therapeutic interventions ; immunomodulation was used in 24.3% of cases. Myocardial dysfunction requiring ionotropic support (57.4%) plus extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (5.3%), respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation (26.1%), and acute kidney injury (11.9%) were the major complications; anticoagulation was used commonly (54.4%) but thrombotic events occurred rarely (3.5%).

A priori codes based on diabetes self-care behaviors provided a framework for analyzing and summarizing participant experiences. RESULTS: Both increases and decreases in healthy eating and exercise were described, with improvements in health behaviors attributed to health education messaging via social media. Participants reported increased stress and difficulty monitoring and managing glucose. Difficulty obtaining medication and difficulty seeing their health care provider regularly was reported and attributed to health care provider availability and lack of insurance due to job loss.

BACKGROUND LSG is growing in popularity as a primary bariatric procedure. Technical aspects of LSG including bougie size remain controversial. METHODS Our systematic review yielded 112 studies encompassing 9991 LSG patients. A general estimating equation (GEE) model was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for leak based on bougie size, distance from the pylorus, and use of buttressing on the staple line. Baseline characteristics, including age and body mass index (BMI), were included. A linear repeated measures regression model compared excess weight loss (%EWL) between bougie sizes. RESULTS A total of 198 leaks in 8922 patients (2.2%) were identified. The GEE model revealed that the risk of leak decreased with bougie 40 Fr (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = [0.37-0.77]; P = 0.0009). Buttressing did not impact leak. There was no difference in %EWL between bougie <40 Fr and bougie 40 Fr up to 36 months (mean: 70.1% EWL; P = 0.273). Distance from the pylorus did not affect leak or %EWL. CONCLUSIONS Utilizing bougie 40 Fr may decrease leak without impacting %EWL up to 3 years. Distance from the pylorus does not impact leak or weight loss. Buttressing does not seem to impact leak; however, if surgeons desire to buttress, bioabsorbable material is the most common type used. Longer-term studies are needed to definitively determine the effect of bougie size on weight loss after LSG.","output":"Surgical strategies that may decrease leak after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 9991 cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper studies the electric vehicle (EV) charging scheduling problem where EV arrive at random unknown instants during the day with different charging demands and departure times.

Investigating the formation of the cytoskeleton, we find that katanin p60-like 1 (kat-60L1), a neuronal type of microtubule-severing enzyme, serves two functions. First, it amplifies the mass of microtubules to form the dense microtubule arrays inside the sensory cilia. Second, it generates short microtubules that are required to build the nanoscopic cytoskeleton at the mechanotransduction site. Additional analyses further reveal the functional roles of Patronin and other potential factors in the local regulatory network.

As such, miRNAs are indirectly involved in most cellular mechanisms, including cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, and homeostasis. Several different mechanisms finely regulate miRNA expression levels and functions. Among these, miRNA editing is a type of epitranscriptomic modification that alters the original nucleotide sequence of selected miRNAs, possibly influencing their conformational state and target-binding ability. To date, adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) and cytosine-to-uracil (C-to-U) RNA editing are recognized as the canonical editing types, with the A-to-I type being the predominant one. A comprehensive resource explicitly dedicated to miRNA editing data collection is still missing. Here we present MiREDiBase, a manually curated catalog of editing events in miRNAs. Overall, the current version includes 3059 unique A-to-I and C-to-U editing sites occurring in 626 human miRNA transcripts and three different species of non-human primates. Each editing event is provided with essential information and key relevant details, including biological sample, detection method, enzyme-dependent affinity, editing level, and biological function. Editing events in human mature miRNAs were provided with miRNA-target predictions and enrichment analysis. Minimum free energy structures were inferred for editing events falling into pre-miRNA regions, aiming to help users to interpret the biological information. MiREDiBase represents a valuable tool for cell biology and biomedical research, continuously updated, improved, and expanded with new data from the literature.

Survivors frequently experience long-lasting sequelae, but little is known about the eventual persistence of this immune alteration. Herein, we evaluated TLR-induced cytokine responses in a cohort of mild to critical patients during acute or convalescent phases (n = 97). In the acute phase, we observed impaired cytokine production by monocytes in the patients with the most severe COVID-19. This capacity was globally restored in convalescent patients. However, we observed increased responsiveness to TLR1/2 ligation in patients who recovered from severe disease, indicating that these cells display distinct functional properties at the different stages of the disease. In patients with acute severe COVID-19, we identified a specific transcriptomic and epigenomic state in monocytes that can account for their functional refractoriness. The molecular profile of monocytes from recovering patients was distinct and characterized by increased chromatin accessibility at activating protein 1 (AP1) and MAF loci. These results demonstrate that severe COVID-19 infection has a profound impact on the differentiation status and function of circulating monocytes, during both the acute and the convalescent phases, in a completely distinct manner. This could have important implications for our understanding of short- and long-term COVID-19Crelated morbidity.","output":"Functional reprogramming of monocytes in patients with acute and convalescent severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda, is an invasive migratory pest that prefers to feed on crops of the Gramineae family such as maize and wheat. It has been recorded in different locations in China since its invasion in 2019. To assess its effect on different wheat tissues and to provide a risk evaluation for wheat fields, FAW larvae were reared on the wheat seedling (WS), spike (SPK), peduncle (PDC), flag leaf blade (F-b), and blade of the first leaf under flag (F-1b). The population parameters were recorded, and the data were analyzed using the age-stage, two-sex life table method. The results showed that the FAW achieved successful development on all the substrates, although those fed on F-1b grew the slowest, had the smallest pupal weight, and deposited the fewest eggs. The larval survival rates of those fed on WS, SPK, and PDC were more than 80%, while for F-b and F-1b they were 56.58% and 32.03%, respectively. Feeding on leaf blades also resulted in lower fertility, reproductive capacity, life expectancy, net reproductive rate, intrinsic rate of increase, and finite rate of increase. These results indicated that feeding on WS, SPK, and PDC were more beneficial for development compared to F-b and F-1b alone. However, leaf blades alone can still support the full FAW lifecycle and thus could play an important role in nutrition, especially when quantities of the preferred host tissues are not sufficient. These results provide guidance for assessing the FAW risk in China.

We surveyed 575 eligible participants engagement in preventive behaviors, concern about COVID-19 in their communities, perceived susceptibility to the virus, and reasons for susceptibility across three response options (Yes, No, and Dont Know/Not Sure). Bivariate analyses compared characteristics by level of perceived susceptibility to COVID-19. A multinomial logistic regression model evaluated the association of demographics, health insurance coverage, and chronic illness status with perceived susceptibility. Participants race, gender, and educational attainment were significantly associated with perceived susceptibility to COVID-19. African Americans and males had higher odds of responding No, compared to Yes and Dont Know/Not Sure than Whites and females. Participants with a high school education and lower had higher odds of responding Dont Know/Not Sure versus Yes compared to those with college or higher education. Those unconcerned about COVID-19 in their community had higher odds of responding No (OR = 2.51, CI 1.35C4.68) and Dont Know/Not Sure (OR = 2.51, CI 1.26C4.99) versus Yes, as compared to those who were concerned. Possibility of exposure at work was the most frequent reasons for perceiving themselves susceptible to COVID-19, engagement in recommended preventive measures was the most frequent reason among respondents who indicated No, and uncertainty/perception that everyone is at risk was the most frequent reason among the ones who indicated Dont Know/Not Sure.

Thus, devoted members of the Joint Action on Health Information already in April 20 started to meet regularly online to foster cross-country exchange. In these meetings partners could approach each other for questions and shared views in a trusted environment on an ad-hoc basis. This initiative became an integral part of PHIRI, allowing a quick exchange of data, indicators, good practices and experiences in the COVID-19 crisis response in a structured and efficient way. Methods The bi-weekly 1h online meetings, in a moderated, structured format, have 2 parts: 1 pre-agreed topic (chosen via a survey ex-ante to each meeting) and ad-hoc questions. Answers (backed up by evidence like national reports, guidelines, etc.) are compiled and shared via a devoted platform immediately after the meeting. Every 6 weeks there is a special edition where experts present relevant findings and recent activities in the field. Attendees are project partners, national experts (advisors to ministers and heads of agency), representatives of expert networks (e.g. Healthy Cloud), EU services (ECDC, JRC) and stakeholders (e.g. ELIXIR). Results 12 meetings took place between Nov 20 and April 21 with 25-30 attendees. Topics covered followed a needs assessment in Europe and not surprisingly were in line with public debates at the time: November meetings concentrated around testing options whereas in early 21 vaccination strategies of countries were in the focus. A widely recognised outcome was a survey on the (temporary) cancellation of the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine among most EU countries.

Because of the diverse phenotypes linked to RYR1 mutations it is fundamental to characterize their functional effects to classify variants carried by patients for future therapeutic interventions and identify non-pathogenic variants. Many laboratories have been interested in developing methods to functionally characterize RYR1 mutations expressed in patients' cells. This approach has numerous advantages, including: mutations are endogenously expressed, RyR1 is not over-expressed, use of heterologous RyR1 expressing cells is avoided. However, since patients may present mutations in different genes aside RYR1, it is important to compare results from biological material from individuals harboring the same mutation, with different genetic backgrounds. The present manuscript describes methods developed to study the functional effects of endogenously expressed RYR1 variants in: (a) Epstein Barr virus immortalized human B-lymphocytes and (b) satellite cells derived from muscle biopsies and differentiated into myotubes. Changes in the intracellular calcium concentration triggered by the addition of a pharmacological RyR1 activators are then monitored. The selected cell type is loaded with a ratiometric fluorescent calcium indicator and intracellular [Ca2+] changes are monitored either at the single cell level by fluorescence microscopy or in cell populations using a spectrofluorometer.

This scoping review aimed to examine time points and intervals used to measure timeliness and to critically assess how they are defined by existing studies of the care seeking pathway for lung cancer. METHODS This scoping review was guided by the methodological framework for scoping reviews by Arksey and O'Malley. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO electronic databases were searched for articles published between 1999 and 2019. After duplicate removal, all publications went through title and abstract screening followed by full text review and inclusion of articles in the review against the selection criteria. A narrative synthesis describes the time points, intervals and measurement guidelines used by the included articles. RESULTS A total of 2113 articles were identified from the initial search. Finally, 68 articles were included for data charting process. Eight time points and 14 intervals were identified as the most common events researched by the articles. Eighteen different lung cancer care guidelines were used to benchmark intervals in the included articles; all were developed in Western countries. The British Thoracic Society guideline was the most frequently used guideline (20%). Western guidelines were used by the studies in Asian countries despite differences in the health system structure. CONCLUSION This review identified substantial variations in definitions of some of the intervals used to describe timeliness of care for lung cancer.

METHODOLOGY We conducted an online anonymized and validated survey using a structured questionnaire to get an insight into the neurosurgeons' experience with telemedicine across various continents and rated its usefulness on a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS We received 286 responses across five continents. There was a trend to support a major paradigm shift favoring teleconsultations during this pandemic in respondents from North America (p=0.06). Signed prescriptions were emailed along with video-based teleconsultations preferentially in Europe and North America. In comparison, audio- or text-based teleconsults along with unsigned prescriptions were prevalent in Asia and Africa (p=0.0005). Acceptability and perceived usefulness for telemedicine during this pandemic was similar across the globe, irrespective of the neurosurgeons' experience (mean satisfaction score 3.72+/-1.09; p=0.62). Majority of neurosurgeons from Asia and South America complained of difficulties during teleconsultations owing to lack of appropriate infrastructure, internet connectivity/ prescription related issues, and potential risk of litigation (p=0.0005). Approximately 46% of neurosurgeons, especially from Europe and North America, felt that telemedicine could play a vital role in clinical practice even after the subsidence of this pandemic (mean satisfaction score 3.26+/-1.16; p=0.007).

State mask mandates have generally reduced the spread of the disease, but decisions to wear a mask depend on many factors. Recent increases in case rates in rural areas following initial outbreaks in more densely populated areas highlight the need to focus on prevention and education. Messaging about disease risk has faced challenges in rural areas in the past. While surges in cases within some communities are likely an impetus for behavior change, rising case rates likely explain only part of mask-wearing decisions. The current study examined the relationship between county-level indicators of rurality and mask wearing in the USA. METHODS: National data from the New York Times' COVID-19 cross-sectional mask survey was used to identify the percentage of a county's residents who reported always/frequently wearing a mask (2-14 July 2020). The New York Times' COVID-19 data repository was used to calculate county-level daily case rates for the 2 weeks preceding the mask survey (15 June - 1 July 2020), and defined county rurality using the Index of Relative Rurality (n=3103 counties). Multivariate linear regression was used to predict mask wearing across levels of rurality. The model was adjusted for daily case rates and other relevant county-level confounders, including county-level indicators of age, race/ethnicity, gender, political partisanship, income inequality, and whether each county was subject to a statewide mask mandate. RESULTS: Large clusters of counties with high rurality and low mask wearing were observed in the Midwest, upper Midwest, and mountainous West. Holding daily case rates and other county characteristics constant, the predicted probability of wearing a mask decreased significantly as counties became more rural (=-0.560; p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Upticks in COVID-19 cases and deaths in rural areas are expected to continue, and localized outbreaks will likely occur indefinitely. The present findings highlight the need to better understand the mechanisms underlying perceptions of COVID-19 risk in rural areas.

We propose a simple model for accelerated deaths that draws on the observation that many of those who die from COVID-19 are often, but not always, much less healthy than the average for their age group. The model predicts that, in the absence of additional secondary effects, the impact on the life expectancy of survivors (the anti-selection effect) will be very small, and that the degree of impact depends on the average years of life lost by those who die from COVID-19. The philosophy underpinning the model is supported by reference to both all-cause mortality by age and all-cause mortality by deprivation group. In combination, these support a proportionality link between COVID-19 mortality and individual frailty or death rate. The model predicts potentially low mortality in 2021 (healthy survivors), and we find evidence for a similar effect in mortality from respiratory diseases over the period 2013-15.

The first para-infectious myelitis case was described in Wuhan in February 2020. Nevertheless, data from registries and reviews are scarce. METHODS: A 40-year-old female with T5-T6 SARS-CoV-2 para-infectious myelitis is reported. A literature review of the published literature on the SARS-CoV-2 and para-infectious myelitis was done. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, image, treatment, and outcome data are described. RESULTS: Particular findings of our case are that Covid-19 was asymptomatic and anti-GD2/GD3 IgM was found. 18 para-infectious myelitis occurred over a wide age range (Beh et al., 2013-67), mean age 50.718.6 years, with 10/18 (55.6%) women. Covid-19 involvement was variable from asymptomatic cases to severe Covid-19 resulting in death. The mean time to establish myelitis from the onset of Covid-19 symptoms was 10.3 7.8 days (0-24). The most common clinical form was transverse myelitis (14/18 patients, 77.7%) and the most frequent radiological form was longitudinally extensive myelitis (11/17 patients, 64.7%). In CSF mild lymphocytosis (14/16, 87.5%) with low cellularity (40.949.7/L) and elevated proteins (11/16, 77.8%, mean 145.0 mg159.0/dL) were frequent. Oligoclonal bands were usually negative (7/9, 77.7%) and mirror pattern was found in 2/7 patients (33.3%). SARS-CoV-2 PCR in CSF was negative in 10/10 cases.

Since progression from DCIS to invasive cancer has been linked with overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), and JAM-A regulates HER2 expression, we evaluated JAM-A as a therapeutic target in DCIS. JAM-A expression was immunohistochemically assessed in patient DCIS tissues. A novel JAM-A antagonist (JBS2) was designed and tested alone/in combination with the HER2 kinase inhibitor lapatinib, using SUM-225 cells in vitro and in vivo as validated DCIS models. Murine tumors were proteomically analyzed. JAM-A expression was moderate/high in 96% of DCIS patient tissues, versus 23% of normal adjacent tissues. JBS2 bound to recombinant JAM-A, inhibiting cell viability in SUM-225 cells and a primary DCIS culture in vitro and in a chick embryo xenograft model. JBS2 reduced tumor progression in in vivo models of SUM-225 cells engrafted into mammary fat pads or directly injected into the mammary ducts of NOD-SCID mice.

The consequences caused by the pandemic significantly affected companies' economic sustainability and reflected the urgent need to assess economic sustainability in order to determine its level and further develop theoretical and methodological aspects of Strategic Enterprise Management. This article is aimed at developing a scientific and methodological approach to comprehensively assess the economic stability of a telecommunications company that operates under modern market conditions. Methods. A study was conducted within the scope of existing techniques used to assess economic stability and, thus, the lack of generally accepted assessment methods was observed. A set of indicators to assess the economic stability of the telecommunications company was formed through financial analysis, taking into account the industry practices of communications service provider's functioning. Comprehensive assessment of the economic stability of telecommunications companies was carried out using a statistical data analysis technique - regression analysis. 2016-2020 financial reports and statistical data provided by examined communications service providers from the State Statistics Service of Ukraine and the National Commission of Ukraine for the State Regulation of Communications and Informatization were used as outcoming data. Study results. As part of the study, the existing assessment methods were analyzed, which made it possible to organize, systematize, and identify their advantages and disadvantages. A set of indicators to assess economic stability of a telecommunications company was formed, indicating the selection criteria and identifying dependence on the presence of a communications service provider at a certain stage of its business development. A scientific and methodological approach to a comprehensive assessment of the economic stability of telecommunications companies taking into account their industry characteristics has been developed. Conclusions. The created scientific and methodological approach to assess economic stability of the telecommunications company comprehensively makes it possible to determine the level of economic stability depending on the stage of business development of a company.

The present study aimed to examine the influence of environmental factors on SARS-CoV-2 infection. MethodsThis ecological study analyzed the association between environmental and demographic factors and SARS-CoV-2 infection by province. Environmental temperature and humidity were obtained from the Spanish Meteorological Agency and province extension, and latitude and altitude above sea level of their capital cities from the Geographical Institute. The seroprevalence SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by province was obtained from a nationwide representative survey performed in June 2020, after the first pandemic wave in Spain. Linear regression was used in the analysis.ResultsThe seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of the 50 provinces ranged from 0.2% to 13.6%. Altitude explained nearly half of differences in seroprevalence (determination coefficient [R 2 ]=0.46, p<0.0001). Seroprevalence in people residing in provinces above the median altitude (215 meters) was threefold higher (6.5% vs 2.1%, p<0.0001). In the multivariate linear regression, the addition of population density significantly improved the predictive value of the altitude (R 2 =0.55, p<0.0001). Every 100 meters of altitude increase and 100 inhabitants/km 2 of increase in population density, the seroprevalence increased by 0.84 and 0.63 percentage points, respectively.ConclusionsEnvironmental conditions related to higher altitude in winter-spring, as lower temperature and absolute humidity, may be relevant to SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Only limited observer reliability data exist. We tested inter- and intra-observer reliability for the assessment of CTA in acute ischaemic stroke. METHODS We selected 15 cases from the Third International Stroke Trial (IST-3, ISRCTN25765518) with various degrees of arterial obstruction in different intracranial locations on CTA. To assess inter-observer reliability, seven members of the IST-3 expert image reading panel (>5 years experience reading CTA) and seven radiology trainees (<2 years experience) rated all 15 scans independently and blind to clinical data for: presence (versus absence) of any intracranial arterial abnormality (stenosis or occlusion), severity of arterial abnormality using relevant scales (IST-3 angiography score, Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score, Clot Burden Score), collateral supply and visibility of a perfusion defect on CTA source images (CTA-SI). Intra-observer reliability was assessed using independently repeated expert panel scan ratings. We assessed observer agreement with Krippendorff's-alpha (K-alpha). RESULTS Among experienced observers, inter-observer agreement was substantial for the identification of any angiographic abnormality (K-alpha = 0.70) and with an angiography assessment scale (K-alpha = 0.60-0.66). There was less agreement for grades of collateral supply (K-alpha = 0.56) or for identification of a perfusion defect on CTA-SI (K-alpha = 0.32). Radiology trainees performed as well as expert readers when additional training was undertaken (neuroradiology specialist trainees).

No study has analyzed urologic surgical outcomes among patients evaluated preoperatively via telehealth only. We compared surgical outcomes between patients who had telehealth only versus in-person preoperative visits prior to urologic surgery. METHODS: Retrospective single center review of all urologic surgeries from April-December 2020. Cases were classified based on whether patients visited preoperatively in person or via telehealth. Major exclusion criteria included having both preoperative in person and telehealth visits. Cases were stratified into four categories for analysis based on CPT coding: Upper Tract Endoscopic (UTE), Lower Tract Endoscopic (LTE), Major Abdominal (MA) (Open/ Laparoscopic/Robotic), and Lower Tract Reconstructive (LTR). Covariates of interest included age, sex, race, ASA status, and distance from hospital. Outcomes included need for blood products, complications, operative time, and length of stay (LOS). Complications were identified using reported morbidity and mortality data and organized based on the Clavien-Dindo scale;scores >2 were considered major complications. RESULTS: Table 1 displays demographic and outcomes of interest. 1,405 patients met inclusion criteria with 101 visits being telehealth only. There was no difference in sex, race, and ASA status. Telehealth patients were younger and lived farther away from the hospital and more likely to undergo UTE or MA surgeries compared to in person visits. There was no difference in perioperative complications or transfusion events between groups. Stratified by procedure type, there was no difference operative time or LOS between cohorts for UTE, MA, or LTE surgeries. LTR surgeries were associated with shorter operative times for telehealth patients, but no difference in LOS. CONCLUSIONS: Patients seen preoperatively by telehealth alone experienced no difference in complications or length of stay when undergoing urologic surgery, including major abdominal surgery.

The protective roles of specific ISGs against the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) members of the coronaviruses are largely unknown. This study demonstrates a protective role of the ISG Ifit2 in encephalitis induced by the dual hepato- and neurotropic MHV-A59. Contrasting the mild encephalitis and 100% survival of MHV-A59-infected wild-type (wt) mice, nearly 60% of infected Ifit2(-/-) mice exhibited severe encephalitis and succumbed between 6 and 8 days postinfection. Increased clinical disease in Ifit2(-/-) mice coincided with higher viral loads and enhanced viral spread throughout the CNS parenchyma. Ifit2(-/-) mice also expressed significantly reduced IFN-/ and downstream ISG mRNAs Ifit1, Isg15, and Pkr, while expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines was only modestly affected in the CNS. Impaired IFN-/ induction in the absence of Ifit2 was confirmed by ex vivo mRNA analysis of microglia and macrophages, the prominent cell types producing IFN-/ following MHV CNS infection. Furthermore, both IFN-/ mRNA and protein production were significantly reduced in MHV-infected Ifit2(-/-) relative to wt bone marrow-derived macrophages.

Results: In 115 included patients (median age at surgery 45 years [IQR 29-55]), 55% (62/115) were men and 49% (56/115) were manual laborers. Most affected nerves were in hand or lower forearm (76/115, 66%). Smoking habits, affected nerves, and cause/mechanism(s) of injury differentiated the sexes. More motor nerve injuries were observed among women and more mixed nerve injuries among men. Iatrogenic injuries, such as injury to superficial sensory radial nerve or thenar branch of median nerve, more frequently affected women (27/52, 52%). Pain, the dominant preoperative symptom, improved after surgery. Overall, surgery cured/improved 79 of 115 (69%) patients. Patients treated with repair or reconstruction (n = 62) were younger than patients given neuroma transpositions (n = 43) and sensory nerve injuries were more often treated by transposition.

Objective To analyze the osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) techniques used for the management of patients affected by the Spanish flu according to four themes: the principles and procedures used, frequency and length of OMT, reported side effects, and advice for patients. Methods A structured review of the literature was performed by hand-searching texts at the Museum of Osteopathic Medicine International Center for Osteopathic History in Kirksville, Missouri, and online via PubMed (National Library of Medicine), ScienceDirect (Elsevier), and Google Scholar (Google, Inc). The literature search was carried out between February and March 2020. Three keywords were selected from the medical subject headings database of the National Library of Medicine: manipulation, osteopathic; influenza pandemic, 1918-1919; epidemics. Articles were then reviewed for relevance by screening for articles published between 1900 and 1940 that contained at least 1 of the following keywords in their title: Spanish influenza, flu, epidemic, grippe, pneumonia, or osteopathic management/treatment. All articles that provided information about OMT and advice met the inclusion criteria. Articles that did not report descriptions of manipulative intervention were excluded. Results Our search yielded 63 articles: 23 from the hand-search and 40 from the electronic search. No electronic source was selected for the review because none met inclusion criteria. A total of 16 articles from the hand-searched set met inclusion criteria and were analyzed according to the four main themes stated in the objective.

Recent trials of one-time brief screening for AF have not produced a significant increase in the proportion of patients diagnosed with AF. Trials of longer-term screening have demonstrated an increase in AF diagnoses, primarily paroxysmal AF. To date, however, no trials have demonstrated that screening for AF results in lower rates of stroke. Clinical practice guidelines conflict in their level of support for screening for AF. METHODS: The GUARD-AF individually randomized trial is designed to test whether screening for AF in individuals age 70 years or greater using a 2-week single-lead electrocardiographic patch monitor can identify patients with undiagnosed AF and lead to treatment with OAC, resulting in a reduced rate of stroke in the screened population. The trial's efficacy end point is hospitalization for stroke (either ischemic or hemorrhagic) and the trial's safety end point is hospitalization for a bleeding event. End points will be ascertained via Medicare claims or electronic health records at 2.5 years after study start. Enrollment is based in primary care practices and the OAC decision for screen-detected cases is left to the patient and their physician. The initial planned target sample size was 52,000, with 26,000 allocated to either screening or to usual care. RESULTS: Trial enrollment was severely hampered by the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and stopped at a total enrollment of 11,931 participants. Of 5,965 randomized to the screening arm, 5,713 patients (96%) returned monitors with analyzable results. Incidence of screen-detected and clinically detected AF and associated stroke and bleeding outcomes will be ascertained. CONCLUSIONS: GUARD-AF is the largest AF screening randomized trial using a longer-term patch-based continuous electrocardiographic monitor. The results will contribute important information on the yield of patch-based AF screening, the \\"burden\\" of AF detected (percent time in AF, longest episode), and physicians' OAC decisions as a function of AF burden. GUARD-AF's stroke and bleed results will contribute to pooled trial analyses of AF screening, thereby informing future studies and guidelines.","output":"ReducinG stroke by screening for UndiAgnosed atRial fibrillation in elderly inDividuals (GUARD-AF): Rationale and design of the GUARD-AF randomized trial of screening for atrial fibrillation with a 14-day patch-based continuous ECG monitor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Cancer patients are now facing a double distinctive challenge of survival against both the disease and fear of contracting COVID-19. This challenge has resulted in the forced adoption of social distancing measures and reorganization of the delivery of medical and psychological treatments. The perceived loneliness and uncertainty increased distress and symptoms burden. In the current period, eHealth interventions might provide valuable benefits in the field of cancer care. Objective: The overall goal of the study protocol will be to provide an innovative intervention for cancer patients based on an online platform, to help them manage and prevent psychological problems related to social isolation. Specifically, the efficacy of two web-based interventions aimed at lowering stress in cancer patients will be tested and compared. Methods: One hundred and fifty participants (75 per group) will be enrolled in a two-group randomized trial. The two interventions will be composed either by exercises on relaxation and meditation practices, presented in both automated online content and interactive group sessions or by fixed psychoeducational online content. Stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, distress, resilience, and perceived social isolation will be measured before the start of the interventions (T0), 2 weeks (T1), 4 weeks (T2), and 2 months (T3) after the beginning of the interventions in both groups. A repeated measures ANOVA will be performed to test differences in the questionnaires' scores between groups across the four-time points. Expected Results: We hypothesized greater improvement in the specific domain of stress symptoms (IES-R) assessed in the group receiving the interactive intervention, compared to the group which will receive only fully automated psychoeducational content. Secondarily, we expect the same trend of improvement across all the psychological variables in the blended intervention group. Conclusions: Implementing these practices on people who are forced into mandatory social isolation may help them become more aware of their mind-body condition and reduce negative effects. Moreover, relaxation techniques help individuals in achieving a greater state of well-being, increasing the ability to cope with stressful situations (resilience), and strengthening the immune system.","output":"Remote Relaxation and Acceptance Training for the Management of Stress in Cancer Patients: A Study Protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is growing awareness of the impacts of COVID-19 on children, families, and more recently, early childhood educators.

This study aimed to identify what the additional health-care costs of a strategic preparedness and response plan (SPRP) would be if current transmission levels are maintained in a status quo scenario, or under scenarios where transmission is increased or decreased by 50%. METHODS: The number of COVID-19 cases was projected for 73 low-income and middle-income countries for each of the three scenarios for both 4-week and 12-week timeframes, starting from June 26, 2020. An input-based approach was used to estimate the additional health-care costs associated with human resources, commodities, and capital inputs that would be accrued in implementing the SPRP. FINDINGS: The total cost estimate for the COVID-19 response in the status quo scenario was US$5245 billion over 4 weeks, at $860 per capita. For the decreased or increased transmission scenarios, the totals were $3308 billion and $6192 billion, respectively. Costs would triple under the status quo and increased transmission scenarios at 12 weeks. The costs of the decreased transmission scenario over 12 weeks was equivalent to the cost of the status quo scenario at 4 weeks. By percentage of the overall cost, case management (54%), maintaining essential services (21%), rapid response and case investigation (14%), and infection prevention and control (9%) were the main cost drivers. INTERPRETATION: The sizeable costs of a COVID-19 response in the health sector will escalate, particularly if transmission increases. Instituting early and comprehensive measures to limit the further spread of the virus will conserve resources and sustain the response.

A potential limitation of the FES skills test is the size and cost of the simulator on which it was developed (GI Mentor II virtual reality endoscopy simulator; Simbionix LTD, Israel). A more compact and lower-cost alternative (GI Mentor Express) was developed to address this issue. The purpose of this study was to obtain evidence for the validity of scores obtained on the Express platform, so that it can be used for testing. STUDY DESIGN General surgery residents at various levels of training and practicing endoscopists at five institutions participated. Each completed the five FES tasks on both simulator platforms in random order, with 3-14 days between tests. Scores were calculated using the same standardized computer-generated algorithm and compared using Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS There were 58 participants (mean age 32; 76% male) with a broad range of endoscopic experience. The mean (95% confidence interval) FES scores were 72 (67:77) on the GI Mentor II and 66 (60:71) on the Express. The correlation between scores on the two platforms was 0.86 (0.77:0.91; p < 0.0001).

However, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents a potential challenge to the country's goal for malaria elimination by 2025. The path toward malaria elimination depends on sustained interventions to prevent rapid resurgence, which can quickly set back any gains achieved. Malaria Consortium supported mobile malaria workers (MMWs) to engage with target communities to build acceptance, trust, and resilience. At the start of the pandemic, Malaria Consortium conducted a COVID-19 risk assessment and quickly developed and implemented a mitigation plan to ensure MMWs were able to continue providing malaria services without putting themselves or their patients at risk. Changes in malaria intervention coverage and community uptake have been monitored to gauge the indirect effects of COVID-19. Comparisons have been made between output indicators reported in 2020 and from the same month-period of the previous year. In general, malaria service intervention coverage and utilization rates did not decline in 2020. Rather, the reported figures show there was a substantial increase in service utilization. Preliminary internal reviews and community meetings show that despite a heightened public risk perception toward COVID-19, malaria testing motivation has been well sustained throughout the pandemic.

As the economic impacts multiplied, anecdotal reports noted the increased use of web-based crowdfunding to defray these costs. OBJECTIVE: We examined the web-based crowdfunding response in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States to understand the incidence of initiation of COVID-19Crelated campaigns and compare them to nonCCOVID-19Crelated campaigns. METHODS: On May 16, 2020, we extracted all available data available on US campaigns that contained narratives and were created between January 1 and May 10, 2020, on GoFundMe. We identified the subset of COVID-19Crelated campaigns using keywords relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. We explored the incidence of COVID-19Crelated campaigns by geography, by category, and over time, and we compared the characteristics of the campaigns to those of nonCCOVID-19Crelated campaigns after March 11, when the pandemic was declared. We then used a natural language processing algorithm to cluster campaigns by narrative content using overlapping keywords. RESULTS: We found that there was a substantial increase in overall GoFundMe web-based crowdfunding campaigns in March, largely attributable to COVID-19Crelated campaigns. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic persisted and progressed, the number of campaigns per COVID-19 case declined more than tenfold across all states. The states with the earliest disease burden had the fewest campaigns per case, indicating a lack of a case-dependent response. COVID-19Crelated campaigns raised more money, had a longer narrative description, and were more likely to be shared on Facebook than other campaigns in the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Web-based crowdfunding appears to be a stopgap for only a minority of campaigners.

The long pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is quickly released directly at inflammation sites by many immune cell types. Previous studies have shown that PTX3 correlated with disease severity in various inflammatory conditions. Our study investigated the use of PTX3 as a potential marker of COVID-19 severity and compared its performance in detecting a more severe form of the disease with that of routine laboratory parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Stored serum samples of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases that had been obtained at hospital admission were retrospectively analysed. Intensive care unit (ICU) stay was considered a surrogate endpoint of severe COVID-19. Pentraxin 3 was measured by a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: A total of 96 patients were recruited from May 1st, 2020 to June 30th, 2020; 75/96 were transferred to ICU. Pentraxin 3 was higher in ICU vs non-ICU patients (35.86 vs 10.61 ng/mL, P < 0.001). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models demonstrated that the only significant laboratory predictor of ICU stay was PTX3 (OR: 1.68 (1.19-2.29), P = 0.003), after controlling for comorbidities. The Receiver Operator Characteristic curve analysis showed that PTX3 had a higher accuracy compared to C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LD), ferritin in identifying ICU patients (AUC of PTX3 = 0.98; CRP = 0.66; LD = 0.70; ferritin = 0.67, P < 0.001).

METHODS: Here, by using the live SARS-CoV-2 virus infection assay as well as HIV-1 based pseudotyped-virus carrying the spike (S) gene of the SARS-CoV-2 (ppSARS-2) and SARS-CoV (ppSARS), we examined whether infections with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can induce cross-neutralizing antibodies. FINDINGS: We confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor for SARS-CoV, and we also found that the recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein of SARS-CoV effectively inhibits ppSARS-2 entry in Huh7.5 cells. However, convalescent sera from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 patients showed high neutralizing activity only against the homologous virus, with no or limited cross-neutralization activity against the other pseudotyped virus. Similar results were also observed in vaccination studies in mice.

Both genes displayed a low codon usage bias, with HA higher than NA. The codon usage was driven by mutation pressure and natural selection, although the main contributing factor was natural selection. Additionally, the codon adaptation index (CAI) and deoptimization (RCDI) illustrated the strong adaptability of H7N9 to Gallus gallus. Similarity index (SiD) analysis showed that Homo sapiens posed a stronger selection pressure than Gallus gallus. Thus, we assume that this may be related to the gradual adaptability of the virus to human. In addition, the host strong selection pressure was validated based on CpG dinucleotide content.

Furthermore, many cases of multiorgan failure are thrombotic in nature. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, D-dimer testing has been used extensively to evaluate COVID-19-associated thrombosis, but does not provide a complete view of the disease because it probes blood coagulation, but not platelet activity. Due to this limitation, D-dimer testing fails to account for thrombotic events which occur despite low D-dimer levels, such as sudden stroke in young patients and autopsy-identified widespread microthrombi in multiple organs. Here we report the landscape of circulating platelet aggregates in COVID-19 obtained by large-scale single-cell image-based profiling and temporal monitoring of the blood of COVID-19 patients (n = 110). Surprisingly, our analysis shows the anomalous presence of excessive platelet aggregates in nearly 90% of all COVID-19 patients, including those who were not clinically diagnosed with thrombosis and those with low D-dimer levels (less than 1 ug/mL). Additionally, results indicate a strong link between the concentration of platelet aggregates and the severity and mortality of COVID-19.

While cruise ship travel was suspended, many other segments within the maritime industry, including shipping, infrastructure maintenance, and food production continued. Ships became isolated congregate residential and working environments while at sea. To further understand transmission aboard ships, we examined mariners self-classification of contact with an index case during several independent COVID-19 case investigations. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of mariners aboard vessels with an index case of COVID-19. Data were ed from an academic emergency department-based maritime Telemedical Assistance Service that provides care globally. The first case identified on a vessel was designated the index case and any subsequent cases were designated non-index cases. Immediately upon identification of an index case, mariners were asked to classify their contact with the index case as Casual, Working, and Close, defined as follows: Casual - Passed in passageways but no physical contact. Rarely in the same space for a prolonged period of time. Working - Worked in close proximity (but no physical contact) and shared a workspace on occasion. Close - Had physical contact and was frequently in the same room or workspace. We then identified non-index cases aboard the vessel and examined the self-classification of contact type. This study was approved by the IRB. Results: In the study cohort, 26 of 139 mariners tested positive (19%) and 8 of the 26 (31%) positives were index cases. Of the 18 non-index cases, 11, 2, and 1 mariner(s) reported casual, working, and close contact with an index case, respectively (61.1%, 11.1%, and 5.5%). The remaining 4 mariners did not report a contact type. Of the 113 mariners who tested negative, 68, 27, and 5 reported casual, working, and close contact with an index case respectively (60.1%, 23.4%, 4.4%). No contact at all was reported by 4 (3.5%) mariners and 9 (8%) did not answer. 9 of the 26 (34.6%) positive mariners were asymptomatic, and 2 of the 113 negative mariners reported symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Conclusion: In our cohort, most mariners who were infected reported only casual contact with the index case. This suggests that in this setting, perceived close contact may not accurately identify all those at highest risk. Mariners may find it difficult to accurately rate their level of interaction with their shipmates, and further analysis by department and watch schedule is necessary. Alternatively, the congregate setting aboard the vessel may place mariners at higher risk for contracting COVID-19, regardless of duration of shared physical proximity, due to factors unique to the maritime environment such as ventilation and compartmentalization of space.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted routine face-to-face teaching-learning-assessment dynamics world over. This study assessed the self-perceived preparedness of dental undergraduate students for practice, whose clinical training was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic from dental schools across Malaysia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional web-based questionnaire survey was done among new dental graduates of the academic year 2019-2020 and the final year undergraduate students (academic year 2020-2021) from dental schools in Malaysia, using the Dental Undergraduates Preparedness Assessment Scale (DU-PAS), from 6th to 26th April 2021. The questionnaire addressed clinical skill competence, and cognitive and behavioral attributes. The number of respondents needed to achieve a confidence level of 95% with margin of error of 5% was 306. RESULTS: A total of 453 (243 final year students and 210 new graduates) responded from dental schools nationwide, with a response rate of 30.6%. The overall mean score for preparedness for dental practice was 76.314.7, for clinical skills 39.77.3, and behavioral and cognitive attributes 36.59.1. New graduates had significantly higher mean preparedness score (78.614.4) as compared to students in their final year (74.214.7). Performing endodontic treatment on multi-rooted teeth had the lowest perceived competency (29.8%), followed by assessing treatment needs of patients requiring orthodontics (37.1%), prescribing drugs (46.6%) and providing crowns using principles of tooth preservation (48.1%).

The project digiDEM Bayern will set up a prospective dementia registry to collect long-term data of people with dementia and their caregivers in Bavaria (Germany) supported by more than 300 research partners. Objective The objective of this article is to outline an information technology (IT) architecture for the integration of a registry and comprehensive participant management in a dementia study. Measures to ensure high data quality, study governance, along with data privacy, and security are to be included in the architecture. Methods The architecture was developed based on an iterative, stakeholder-oriented process. The development was inspired by the Twin Peaks Model that focuses on the codevelopment of requirements and architecture. We gradually moved from a general to a detailed understanding of both the requirements and design through a series of iterations. The experience learned from the pilot phase was integrated into a further iterative process of continuous improvement of the architecture. Results The infrastructure provides a standardized workflow to support the electronic data collection and trace each participant's study process. Therefore, the implementation consists of three systems: (1) electronic data capture system for Web-based or offline app-based data collection; (2) participant management system for the administration of the identity data of participants and research partners as well as of the overall study governance process; and (3) videoconferencing software for conducting interviews online. First experiences in the pilot phase have proven the feasibility of the framework. Conclusion This article outlines an IT architecture to integrate a registry and participant management in a dementia research project. The framework was discussed and developed with the involvement of numerous stakeholders.

Ultimately, it is critical how the immune system of a child responds to these influences and whether effective strategies for a balanced and healthy immune maturation can be assured. Pregnancy and early childhood are particularly susceptible for exogenous influences due to the developing nature of a childs immune system. While endogenous influences such as family history and the genetic background are immutable, epigenetic regulations can be modulated by both heredity and environmental exposures. Prenatal influences such as a mothers nutrition, smoking, or infections influence the complex interplay of innate and adaptive immune regulation as well as peri- and postnatal influences including mode of delivery. Early in life, induction and continuous training of healthy maturation include balanced innate immunity (e.g., via innate lymphoid cells) and an equilibrium of T-cell subpopulations (e.g., via regulatory T cells) to counter-regulate potential pro-inflammatory or exuberant immune reactions. Later in childhood, rather compensatory immune mechanisms are required to modulate deviant regulation of a childs already primed immune trajectory. The specific effects of exogenous and endogenous influences on a childs maturing immune system are summarized in this review, and its importance and potential intervention for early prevention and treatment strategies are delineated.","output":"Role of early life immune regulation in asthma development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is causing a severe global health emergency owing to its highly infectious nature.

We assessed the burden imposed by OC on Asian nations from 1990 to 2019 based on gender and age. METHODS: We collected oral cancer data from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study from 1990 to 2019 in 45 Asian countries and territories. Annual case data and age-standardised rates (ASRs) were used to investigate the incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of OC based on age and gender from 1990 to 2019 in 45 Asian countries and territories. Estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were used to assess incidence rate, mortality, and trends in DALYs. RESULTS: The age-standardised incidence rate (ASIR) of OC increased from 1990 to 2019 with an EAPC of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.19-0.46), and the age-standardised death rate of OC remained stable at an EAPC of 0.08 (95%CI, from -0.06 to 0.21). The age-standardised DALYs of OC decreased at an EAPC of -0.16 (95%CI, from -0.30 to -0.02). The proportion of patients older than 70 years increased yearly in terms of incidence, mortality, and DALYs from 1990 to 2019. Of the DALYs, smoking was the main contributor in the Asian regions, and the largest contributor to DALYs in most Asian regions. Other contributors were alcohol use and chewing tobacco. CONCLUSION: Although the burden of OC was declining in Asia, South Asia remained the region with the highest burden. OC caused the greatest burden in Pakistan, Taiwan China, and India. Therefore, measures should be taken to reduce the burden of oral cancer in high-risk regions and countries with attributable risk factors.","output":"Burden of oral cancer in Asia from 1990 to 2019: Estimates from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We elucidate the problem of estimating large-dimensional covariance matrices in the presence of correlations between samples.

Near elimination of the activity of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza viruses were observed, worldwide. Therefore, we assessed the rates of pediatric outpatient clinic visits and medications prescribed at those visits during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and pre-COVID-19 period (2016C2019). METHODS: Monthly and annual incidence rates for respiratory and non-respiratory diagnoses and dispensed prescription rates were calculated. Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) visits were analyzed separately since the mode of transmission is influenced by hygiene and social distancing. RESULTS: Overall, 5,588,702 visits were recorded. Respiratory and AGE visits declined by 49.9% and 47.3% comparing the COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 periods. The respective rate reductions for urinary tract infections, trauma, and skin and soft tissue infections were 18.2%, 19.9%, and 21.8%. Epilepsy visits increased by 8.2%. Overall visits rates declined by 21.6%. Dispensed prescription rates of antibiotics and non-antibiotics respiratory medications declined by 49.3% and 44.4%, respectively. The respective declines for non-respiratory antibiotics and non-antibiotics were 15.1% and 0.2%. Clinic visits and prescription rates reductions were highest in AprilCMay, following the first lockdown in Israel. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a substantial reduction in respiratory outpatient clinic visits and dispensed respiratory drugs, with only a mild reduction seen for non-respiratory visits.

The literature suggests that double-blind, placebo-controlled study results must be reported and carefully analysed for safety and efficacy in patients with COVID-19 before any recommendations can be made regarding the use of ibuprofen in such patients. Limited studies have suggested: (i) no direct interactions between ibuprofen and SARS-CoV-2 and (ii) there is no evidence to suggest ibuprofen affects the regulation of angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for COVID-19, in human studies. Furthermore, in vitro studies suggest ibuprofen may facilitate cleavage of ACE2 from the membrane, preventing membrane-dependent viral entry into the cell, the clinical significance of which is uncertain.

To date, several studies revealed the benefic effects of hypoxic preconditioning in ischemia, kidney failure and in pulmonary function recovery of lung surgery patients. HPC increases the expression of factors that promote cell survival and angiogenesis, induces an anti-inflammatory outcome, triggers coordinated hypoxia responses that promote erythropoiesis, and mobilizes the circulating progenitor cells. Futhermore, the mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) exposed to HPC show improvement of their regenerative capacities, and increases the effectiveness of stem cell therapy in different pathologies, including COVID-19.

The vaccine efficacy (VE) of 1 or 2 doses of AS03-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1) vaccine relative to that of 2 doses of nonadjuvanted influenza A(H1N1) vaccine in children 6 months to <10 years of age in a multinational study conducted during 2010C2011. Methods. A total of 6145 children were randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive 2 injections 21 days apart of A/California/7/2009(H1N1)-AS03 vaccine at dose 1 and saline placebo at dose 2, 2 doses 21 days apart of A/California/7/2009(H1N1)-AS03 vaccine (the Ad2 group), or 2 doses 21 days apart of nonadjuvanted A/California/7/2009(H1N1) vaccine (the NAd2 group). Active surveillance for influenza-like illnesses continued from days 14 to 385. Nose and throat samples obtained during influenza-like illnesses were tested for A/California/7/2009(H1N1), using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety were assessed. Results. There were 23 cases of confirmed 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) (A[H1N1]pdm09) infection for the primary relative VE analysis. The VE in the Ad2 group relative to that in the NAd2 group was 76.8% (95% confidence interval, 18.5%C93.4%). The benefit of the AS03 adjuvant was demonstrated in terms of the greater immunogenicity observed in the Ad2 group, compared with the NAd2 group. Conclusion. The 4C8-fold antigen-sparing adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine demonstrated superior and clinically important prevention of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, compared with nonadjuvanted vaccine, with no observed increase in medically attended or serious adverse events.

The study aims to understand what factors contribute to different COVID-19 impacts at the country level. METHODS: Multivariate statistical analyses were used to evaluate COVID-19 deaths and cases relative to nine other demographic and socioeconomic factors in all countries and regions of the world using data as of August 1, 2020. The factors analyzed in the study include a country's total COVID-19 deaths and cases per million population, per capita gross domestic product (GDP), population density, virus tests per million population, median age, government response stringency index, hospital beds availability per thousand population, extreme poverty rate, Bacille Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccination rate, and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) immunization rate. RESULTS: The study reveals that COVID-19 deaths per million population in a country most significantly correlates, inversely, with the country's BCG vaccination rate (r = - 0.50, p = 5.3e-5), and also significantly correlates a country's per capita GDP (r = 0.39, p = 7.4e-3) and median age (r = 0.30, p = 0.042), while COVID-19 cases per million population significantly correlate with per capita GDP and tests per thousand population. To control for possible confounding effects of age, the correlation was assessed in countries propensity score matched for age. The inverse correlation between BCG vaccination rates and COVID-19 case (r = - 0.30, p = 0.02) and death (r = - 0.42, p = 0.0007) remained significant among the top 61 countries with the highest median age.

Previous SPECT studies in xenografts have shown that the Affibody molecule (111)In-DOTA-Z(HER2)(:2395) can discriminate between high and low human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-expressing tumors, indicating that radiolabeled Affibody molecules have potential for patient selection for HER2-targeted therapy. Compared with SPECT, PET with positron-emitting radionuclides, such as (18)F, may improve imaging of HER2 expression because of higher sensitivity and improved quantification of PET. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the (18)F-labeled NOTA-conjugated Affibody molecule Z(HER2)(:2395) is a suitable agent for imaging of HER2 expression. The tumor-targeting properties of (18)F-labeled Z(HER2)(:2395) were compared with (111)In- and (68)Ga-labeled Z(HER2)(:2395) in mice with HER2-expressing SK-OV-3 xenografts. METHODS Z(HER2)(:2395) was conjugated with NOTA and radiolabeled with (18)F, (68)Ga, and (111)In. Radiolabeling with (18)F was based on the complexation of Al(18)F by NOTA. The 50% inhibitory concentration values for NOTA-Z(HER2)(:2395) labeled with (19)F, (69)Ga, and (115)In were determined in a competitive cell-binding assay using SK-OV-3 cells. Mice bearing subcutaneous SK-OV-3 xenografts were injected intravenously with radiolabeled NOTA-Z(HER2)(:2395). One and 4 h after injection, PET/CT or SPECT/CT images were acquired, and the biodistribution was determined by ex vivo measurement. RESULTS The 50% inhibitory concentration values for (19)F-, (69)Ga-, and (115)In-NOTA-Z(HER2)(:2395) were 5.0, 6.3, and 5.3 nM, respectively. One hour after injection, tumor uptake was 4.4  0.8 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g), 5.6  1.6 %ID/g, and 7.1  1.4 %ID/g for (18)F-, (68)Ga-, and (111)In-NOTA-Z(HER2)(:2395), respectively, and the respective tumor-to-blood ratios were 7.4  1.8, 8.0  1.3, and 4.8  1.3. Tumor uptake was specific, because uptake could be blocked efficiently by coinjection of an excess of unlabeled Z(HER2)(:2395). PET/CT and SPECT/CT images clearly visualized HER2-expressing SK-OV-3 xenografts. CONCLUSION This study showed that (18)F-NOTA-Z(HER2)(:2395) is a promising new imaging agent for HER2 expression in tumors.

Hypoxia-induced inflammatory signaling may lead to retinal inflammation, gliosis and visual disturbances. We investigated the consequences of systemic hypoxia using serial retinal optical coherence tomography and by assessing the earliest changes within 24h after hypoxia by measuring a proteomics panel of 39 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors in the plasma and retina, as well as using retinal histology. We induced severe systemic hypoxia in adult C57BL/6 mice using a hypoxia chamber (10% O2) for 1 week and rapidly assessed measurements within 1h compared with 18h after hypoxia. Optical coherence tomography revealed retinal tissue edema at 18h after hypoxia. Hierarchical clustering of plasma and retinal immune molecules revealed obvious segregation of the 1h posthypoxia group away from that of controls. One hour after hypoxia, there were 10 significantly increased molecules in plasma and 4 in retina. Interleukin-1? and vascular endothelial growth factor were increased in both tissues. Concomitantly, there was significantly increased aquaporin-4, decreased Kir4.1, and increased gliosis in retinal histology. In summary, the immediate posthypoxic period is characterized by molecular changes consistent with systemic and retinal inflammation and retinal glial changes important in water transport, leading to tissue edema. This posthypoxic inflammation rapidly improves within 24h, consistent with the typically mild and transient visual disturbance in hypoxia, such as in high-altitude retinopathy. Given hypoxia increases risk of vision loss, more studies in at-risk patients, such as plasma immune profiling and in vivo retinal imaging, are needed in order to identify novel diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers of visual impairment in systemic hypoxia.","output":"Hypoxia-induced inflammation: Profiling the first 24-hour posthypoxic plasma and central nervous system changes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate phase transitions associated with three control methods for epidemics on small world networks.

Since the field of professional soccer is no exception, such measures may have a negative impact on the player's well-being and their perceived training loads. Objective: To determine the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on the training load and the well-being of female professional soccer players in Chile. Materials and methods: Exploratory, cross-sectional, descriptive study conducted on 32 players of the Chile women's national soccer team. The perception of training load and the level of well-being were assessed by means of the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale and a questionnaire developed in 2010, respectively. Both the administration of the questionnaire and the permanent monitoring of the RPE records were carried out in two periods of 12 weeks: regular preparatory phase (12/12/2019-10/03/2020) and lockdown (16/03/2020-07/06/2020). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the Wilcoxon test was used to determine if there were significant differences between periods. Results: Significant differences (p&lt;0.05) and threshold effect sizes (ES)=1.2, 2.0 and 4.0 (large, very large, and extremely large, respectively) were found between both periods in all variables evaluated by the well-being questionnaire (except for sleep quality): muscle soreness and stress level (ES=1.9), perceived fatigue (ES=2.5), general well-being (ES=2.4), and mood (ES=4.2). No differences were found regarding the perception of the training load (ES=0.1) between both periods. Conclusions: The level of well-being among the participants was negatively affected by the compulsory lock-down. Therefore, coaching staffs should continue to monitor the level of the well-being of professional soccer players during the lockdown, both individually and collectively. Even though the perception of training load was not affected, it is not possible to state that a more extended period of confinement will not reduce it, resulting in a drop in performance.","output":"Effects of COVID-19 confinement measures on training loads and the level of well-being in players from Chile women's national soccer team/ Efectos de las medidas de confinamiento por COVID-19 en el grado de bienestar y la carga de entrenamiento de las jugadoras de la seleccin nacional de ftbol de Chile"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation in intensive care for 48 h or longer is associated with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which might be present at the time ventilatory support is instituted or develop afterwards, predominantly during the first 5 days. Survivors of prolonged mechanical ventilation and ARDS are at risk of considerably impaired physical function that can persist for years. An early pathogenic mechanism of lung injury in mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients is inflammation-induced pulmonary fibrin deposition, leading to thrombosis of the microvasculature and hyaline membrane formation in the air sacs. The main aim of this study was to determine if nebulised heparin, which targets fibrin deposition, would limit lung injury and thereby accelerate recovery of physical function in patients with or at risk of ARDS. METHODS: The Can Heparin Administration Reduce Lung Injury (CHARLI) study was an investigator-initiated, multicentre, double-blind, randomised phase 3 trial across nine hospitals in Australia. Adult intensive care patients on invasive ventilation, with impaired oxygenation defined by a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 300, and with the expectation of invasive ventilation beyond the next calendar day were recruited. Key exclusion criteria were heparin allergy, pulmonary bleeding, and platelet count less than 50a??Xa??109/L. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1, with stratification by site and using blocks of variable size and random seed, via a web-based system, to either unfractionated heparin sodium 25a??000 IU in 5 mL or identical placebo (sodium chloride 09% 5 mL), administered using a vibrating mesh membrane nebuliser every 6 h to day 10 while invasively ventilated. Patients, clinicians, and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the Short Form 36 Health Survey Physical Function Score (out of 100) of survivors at day 60. Prespecified secondary outcomes, which are exploratory, included development of ARDS to day 5 among at-risk patients, deterioration of the Murray Lung Injury Score (MLIS) to day 5, mortality at day 60, residence of survivors at day 60, and serious adverse events. Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. There was no imputation of missing data. The trial is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register, number ACTRN12612000418875 . FINDINGS: Between Sept 4, 2012, and Aug 23, 2018, 256 patients were randomised. Final follow-up was on Feb 25, 2019. We excluded three patients who revoked consent and one ineligible participant who received no intervention. Of 252 patients included in data analysis, the mean age was 58 years (SD 15), 157 (62%) were men, and 118 (47%) had ARDS. 128 (51%) patients were assigned to the heparin group and 124 (49%) to the placebo group, all of whom received their assigned intervention. Survivors in the heparin group (n=97) had similar SF-36 Physical Function Scores at day 60 compared to the placebo group (n=94; mean 536 [SD 316] vs 487 [357]; difference 49 [95% CI -48 to 145]; p=032). Compared with the placebo group, the heparin group had fewer cases of ARDS develop to day 5 among the at-risk patients (nine [15%] of 62 patients vs 21 [30%] of 71 patients; hazard ratio 046 [95% CI 022 to 098]; p=00431), less deterioration of the MLIS to day 5 (difference -014 [-026 to -002]; p=00215), similar day 60 mortality (23 [18%] of 127 patients vs 18 [15%] of 123 patients; odds ratio [OR] 129 [95% CI 066 to 253]; p=046), and more day 60 survivors at home (86 [87%] of 99 patients vs 73 [73%] of 100 patients; OR 245 [118 to 508]; p=00165). A similar number of serious adverse events occurred in each group (seven [5%] of 128 patients in the heparin group vs three [2%] of 124 patients in the placebo group; OR 233 [059 to 924]; p=023), which were a transient increase in airway pressure during nebulisation (n=3 in the heparin group), major non-pulmonary bleeding (n=2 in each group), haemoptysis (n=1 in the heparin group), tracheotomy site bleeding (n=1 in the heparin group), and hypoxaemia during nebulisation (n=1 in the placebo group). INTERPRETATION: In patients with or at risk of ARDS, nebulised heparin did not improve self-reported performance of daily physical activities, but was well tolerated and exploratory outcomes suggest less progression of lung injury and earlier return home. Further research is justified to establish if nebulised heparin accelerates recovery in those who have or are at risk of ARDS.

Empirical models are useful tools to predict future trends of disease progression such as COVID-19 over the near-term. A modified Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (m-IDEA) model was developed to predict the progression of infectious disease outbreaks. The modification allows for the production of precise daily estimates, which are critical during a pandemic of this scale for planning purposes. The m-IDEA model was employed using a range of serial intervals given the lack of knowledge on the true serial interval of COVID-19. Both deterministic and stochastic approaches were applied. Model fitting was accomplished through minimizing the sum-of-square differences between predicted and observed daily incidence case counts, and performance was retrospectively assessed. The performance of the m-IDEA for projection cases in the near-term was improved using shorter serial intervals (1C4 days) at early stages of the pandemic, and longer serial intervals at mid- to late-stages (5C9 days) thus far. This, coupled with epidemiological reports, suggests that the serial interval of COVID-19 might increase as the pandemic progresses, which is rather intuitive: Increasing serial intervals can be attributed to gradual increases in public health interventions such as facility closures, public caution and social distancing, thus increasing the time between transmission events. In most cases, the stochastic approach captured the majority of future reported incidence data, because it accounts for the uncertainty around the serial interval of COVID-19. As such, it is the preferred approach for using the m-IDEA during dynamic situation such as in the midst of a major pandemic.","output":"A novel IDEA: The impact of serial interval on a modified-Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (m-IDEA) model for projections of daily COVID-19 cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aim COVID-19 is an extremely challenging disease, both from a clinical and forensic point of view, and performing autopsies of COVID-19 deceased requires adequately equipped sectorial rooms and exposes health professionals to the risk of contagion Among one of the categories that are most affected by SARS-Cov-2 infection are the elderly residents Despite the need for prompt diagnoses, which are essential to implement all isolation measures necessary to contain the infection spread, deceased subjects in long-term care facilities are still are often diagnosed post-mortem In this context, our study focuses on the use of post-mortem computed tomography for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, in conjunction with post-mortem swabs The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of post-mortem whole CT-scanning in identifying COVID-19 pneumonia as a cause of death, by comparing chest CT-findings of confirmed COVID-19 fatalities to control cases Materials and methods The study included 24 deceased subjects: 13 subjects coming from long-term care facility and 11 subjects died at home Whole body CT scans were performed within 48hours from death in all subjects to evaluate the presence and distribution of pulmonary abnormalities typical of COVID-19-pneumonia, including: ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, and pleural effusion to confirm the post-mortem diagnosis Results Whole-body CT scans was feasible and allowed a complete diagnosis in all subjects In 9 (69%) of the 13 cases from long-term care facility the cause of death was severe COVID 19 pneumonia, while GGO were present in 100% of the study population Conclusion In the context of rapidly escalating COVID-19 outbreaks, given that laboratory tests for the novel coronavirus is time-consuming and can be falsely negative, the post-mortem CT can be considered as a reliable and safe modality to confirm COVID-19 pneumonia This is especially true for specific postmortem chest CT-findings that are rather characteristic of COVID-19 fatalities","output":"Use of post-mortem chest Computed Tomography in Covid-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that can be genetically engineered and differentiated into different types of immune cells, providing an unlimited resource for developing off-the-shelf cell therapies.

ABSTRACT: Cell-based immunotherapy, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, has revolutionized the treatment of hematological malignancies, especially in patients who are refractory to other therapies. However, there are critical obstacles that hinder the widespread clinical applications of current autologous therapies, such as high cost, challenging large-scale manufacturing, and inaccessibility to the therapy for lymphopenia patients. Therefore, it is in great demand to generate the universal off-the-shelf cell products with significant scalability. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide an unlimited supply for cell therapy because of their unique self-renewal properties and the capacity to be genetically engineered. iPSCs can be differentiated into different immune cells, such as T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, gamma delta T (æ T), mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, and macrophages (Ms). In this review, we describe iPSC-based allogeneic cell therapy, the different culture methods of generating iPSC-derived immune cells (e.g., iPSC-T, iPSC-NK, iPSC-iNKT, iPSC-æT, iPSC-MAIT and iPSC-M), as well as the recent advances in iPSC-T and iPSC-NK cell therapies, particularly in combinations with CAR-engineering.

The cut-off value of X-ray score (XRS) to distinguish the patients who needed intensive care at follow-up (n = 12) was 6 (AUC = 0.933, 95% CI = 0.886C0.979, 100% sensitivity, 81% specificity). CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography is more effective in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia at the initial presentation due to the ease detection of GGOs. However, a baseline CXR taken after admission to the hospital can be valuable in predicting patients to be monitored in the intensive care units.","output":"Efficacy of chest X-ray in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia: comparison with computed tomography through a simplified scoring system designed for triage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although most viral infections cause minor, if any, symptoms, a certain number result in serious illness. Viral disease symptoms result both from direct viral replication within host cells and from indirect immunopathological consequences. Dendritic cells (DCs) are key determinants of viral disease outcome; they activate immune responses during viral infection and direct T cells toward distinct T helper type responses. Certain viruses are able to skew cytokine secretion by DCs inducing and/or downregulating the immune system with the aim of facilitating and prolonging release of progeny. Thus, the interaction of DCs with viruses most often results in the absence of disease or complete recovery when natural functions of DCs prevail, but may lead to chronic illness or death when these functions are outmanoeuvred by viruses in the exploitation of DCs.","output":"Influence of Dendritic Cells on Viral Pathogenicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Little or nothing is known about the correlation between the upper limb deep vein thrombosis (UL-DVT) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Initial series have shown a low complication rate with good efficacy. OBJECTIVE To report clinical and anatomical results of the WEB treatment in the cumulated population of WEBCAST (WEB Clinical Assessment of Intrasaccular Aneurysm) and French Observatory series. METHODS WEBCAST and French Observatory are single-arm, prospective, multicenter, Good Clinical Practice studies dedicated to the evaluation of WEB treatment. Ruptured and unruptured bifurcation aneurysms located in the basilar artery, middle cerebral artery, anterior communicating artery, and internal carotid artery terminus were included in both studies. Clinical data were independently evaluated. Postoperative, 6-month (in WEBCAST), and 1-year aneurysm occlusion was independently evaluated with a 3-grade scale: complete occlusion, neck remnant, and aneurysm remnant. RESULTS The cumulated population was 113 patients (74 female, 65.5%) 33 to 74 years of age with 114 aneurysms with a mean neck size of 5.6 mm. There was no mortality at 1 month, and morbidity was 2.7%. A statistically significant difference in the rate of occurrence of thromboembolic events was observed between the use of any antiplatelet agent and the use of no antiplatelet agent (P < .001). At 1 year, complete aneurysm occlusion was observed in 56.0%, neck remnant in 26.0%, and aneurysm remnant in 18.0%. Worsening of aneurysm occlusion between the procedure and 12 months was observed in 2.0% and between 6 months and 1 year in 7.1%.

Previously published phylogenies have used different rootings that do not always provide consistent results. We investigate several different strategies for rooting the SARS-CoV-2 tree and provide measures of statistical uncertainty for all methods. We show that methods based on the molecular clock tend to place the root in the B clade, whereas methods based on outgroup rooting tend to place the root in the A clade. The results from the two approaches are statistically incompatible, possibly as a consequence of deviations from a molecular clock or excess back-mutations. We also show that none of the methods provide strong statistical support for the placement of the root in any particular edge of the tree. These results suggest that phylogenetic evidence alone is unlikely to identify the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and we caution against strong inferences regarding the early spread of the virus based solely on such evidence.","output":"Assessing Uncertainty in the Rooting of the SARS-CoV-2 Phylogeny"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibits variable symptom severity ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening, yet the relationship between severity and the humoral immune response is poorly understood.

Comparative analyses of the structures of genomes and their products have placed the picornaviruses into a large picorna-like virus family, in which they occupy a prominent place. Most human picornavirus infections are self-limiting, yet the enormously high rate of picornavirus infections in the human population can lead to a significant incidence of disease complications that may be permanently debilitating or even fatal. Picornaviruses employ one of the simplest imaginable genetic systems: they consist of single-stranded RNA that encodes only a single multidomain polypeptide, the polyprotein. The RNA is packaged into a small, rigid, naked, and icosahedral virion whose proteins are unmodified except for a myristate at the N-termini of VP4. The RNA itself does not contain modified bases. The key to ultimately understanding picornaviruses may be to rationalize the huge amount of information about these viruses from the perspective of evolution. It is possible that the replicative apparatus of picornaviruses originated in the precellular world and was subsequently refined in the course of thousands of generations in a slowly evolving environment.

Here, we report our findings of a head-to-head comparison of two viral vectors modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) and a novel replication-competent modified vaccinia Tian Tan (MVTT) for inducing neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) via intramuscular and mucosal vaccinations in mice. MVTT is an attenuated variant of the wild-type VTT, which was historically used as a smallpox vaccine for millions of Chinese people. The spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV was used as the test antigen after the S gene was constructed in the identical genomic location of two vectors to generate vaccine candidates MVTT-S and MVA-S. Using identical doses, MVTT-S induced lower levels (2-3-fold) of anti- SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) than MVA-S through intramuscular inoculation. MVTT-S, however, was capable of inducing consistently 20-to-100-fold higher levels of Nabs than MVA-S when inoculated via either intranasal or intraoral routes. These levels of MVTT-S-induced Nab responses were substantially (10-fold) higher than that induced via the intramuscular route in the same experiments. Moreover, pre-exposure to the wild-type VTT via intranasal or intraoral route impaired the Nab response via the same routes of MVTT-S vaccination probably due to the pre-existing anti-VTT Nab response. The efficacy of intranasal or intraoral vaccination, however, was still 20-to-50-fold better than intramuscular inoculation despite the subcutaneous pre-exposure to wild-type VTT. Our data have implications for people who maintain low levels of anti-VTT Nabs after historical smallpox vaccination.

Despite the increased usage, the transfer of VR-adapted skills into the real-world (RW) has not yet been sufficiently studied, and it is still unknown how much of the own body must be visible to complete motoric tasks within VR. In addition, it should be clarified whether older adults also need to perceive their body within VR scenarios to the same extent as younger people extending the usability. Therefore, younger (18-30 years old) and elderly adults (55 years and older) were tested (n = 42) performing a balance-, grasping- and throwing task in VR (HMD based) accompanied with different body visualization types in VR and in the RW having the regular visual input of body's components. Comparing the performances between the age groups, the time for completion, the number of steps (balance task), the subjective estimation of difficulty, the number of errors, and a rating system revealing movements' quality were considered as examined parameters. A one-way ANOVA/Friedmann with repeated measurements with factor [body visualization] was conducted to test the influence of varying body visualizations during task completion. Comparisons between the conditions [RW, VR] were performed using the t-Tests/Wilcoxon tests, and to compare both age groups [young, old], t-Tests for independent samples/Mann-Whitney-U-Test were used. The analyses of the effect of body visualization on performances showed a significant loss in movement's quality when no body part was visualized (p < .05). This did not occur for the elderly adults, for which no influence of the body visualization on their performance could be proven. Comparing both age groups, the elderly adults performed significantly worse than the young age group in both conditions (p < .05). In VR, both groups showed longer times for completion, a higher rating of tasks' difficulty in the balance and throwing task, and less performance quality in the grasping task. Overall, the results suggest using VR for the elderly with caution to the task demands, and the visualization of the body seemed less crucial for generating task completion. In summary, the actual task demands in VR could be successfully performed by elderly adults, even once one has to reckon with losses within movement's quality.

We performed a descriptive statistic of data RESULTS: We tested a total of 80 patients, of which 3 (3.75%) were found positive for COVID-19. A significant proportion of the tested patients were on active immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatment, cytotoxic chemotherapy (na?=a?34), and immunotherapy (na?=a?16). However, all three COVID-19 positive patients were only actively on hormonal therapy. All three patients observed a minimum of 2 weeks home quarantine. None of the patients developed symptoms upon follow up and no changes were required to their treatment plan. CONCLUSIONS: Despite published evidence that cancer patients may be at increased risk of severe COVID -19 infection, our data suggest that some infected cancer patients are asymptomatic. The overall prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in this population of cancer patients was similar to that in the general population. Therefore, since asymptomatic infections are not uncommon in patients with cancer, we recommend universal COVID-19 testing to help guide treatment decisions and prevent the spread of the disease.","output":"The prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in cancer patients.

Fifty-three in-depth interviews were conducted with students, parents, teachers, school principals, and school feeding agency officials. Thematic analysis was then conducted. The study found that the school feeding program has indeed improved school attendance and in class concentration; helped decrease lateness and dropout; reduced child labour and abuse; and taken off parent's burden. The interruption of the program has dire consequences on students' well-being, and their parents. Some effects this study finds troubling are: food shortage; skipping meals; eating poor quality food; eating reduced portion size; and children being subject to child abuse and child labour for menial activities.

The first explored protein was human milk -lactalbumin (-LA), called HAMLET when composed with OA in antitumor form. Several groups have prepared active protein-lipid complexes using a variety of approaches, all of which depend on target protein destabilization or direct OA-protein incubation to alter pH to acid or alkaline condition. In addition to performing vital roles in inflammatory processes and immune responses, fatty acids can disturb different metabolic pathways and cellular signals. Therefore, the tumoricidal action of these complexes is related to OA rather than the protein that keeps OA in solution and acts as a vehicle for transferring OA molecules to tumor cells. However, other studies have suggested that the antitumor efficacy of these complexes was exerted by both protein and OA together. The potential is not limited to the anti-tumor activity of protein-lipid complexes but extends to other functions such as bactericidal activity.

Methods A cross-sectional, anonymous, online questionnaire was completed in JuneCDecember 2020 by 249 women attending fertility clinics across Germany. All women seeking treatment in fertility clinics were eligible to participate. The online survey covered questions about the patients quality of life, their opinions about the professional societies recommendations and their effects as well as any concerns about infection with SARS-CoV-2. Results Three-quarters of participants disagreed with the pausing of fertility treatments. Women who participated from October to December 2020, when the incidence rate was high, were as likely to disagree as participants that participated from June to September 2020 (73% vs 79%, p = 0.3). Seventy-two participants (29%) had their appointments cancelled. Nearly all (97%) reported being upset by this, with 40 (56%) reporting that they were extremely or very disappointed about the cancellation. Women who had to wait 10 weeks or longer were more likely to be upset by the postponement or cancellation of their appointment than women who had to wait a shorter amount of time (p = 0.01). Many participants (41%) were worried about possible negative effects a SARS-CoV-2 infection might have related to their fertility, pregnancy or unborn child. Conclusion Postponement of treatments increased distress among patients and should be avoided when possible. Fertility clinics must provide information about the current state of knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infections in pregnancies and options for immunization.

The \\"Athens Marathon, The Authentic\\" is a 42,195m (26.2mile) race with approximately 18,000 runners that increases annually. On the same day, additional races take place and a grand total of more than 50,000 runners fill the city center of Athens, Greece. Responding effectively to unexpected incidents requires comprehensive planning, clear decision-making structure, and effective collaboration. Nonetheless, there is limited empirical evidence to support interagency collaboration in mass gatherings. PURPOSE This study used the 2017 Athens Marathon and related races as the empirical setting to examine how interagency collaboration was perceived among the multiple public health and safety professionals involved in the marathon command center. METHODS Data comprised 10 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with key informants, direct observations of meetings and the event itself, and documentary analysis. Open coding and thematic analysis were used to analyze the data. RESULTS Findings indicated four key components of interagency collaboration in such an event: organizational culture, team synthesis, on-site spatial planning, and the usage of radio-amateurs. CONCLUSION This study outlined the factors that shaped interagency collaboration in the context of a mass event.

We sought to understand the ways in which COVID-19 prompted changes in clinical practices in abortion care among independent abortion clinics. STUDY DESIGN: We surveyed independent US abortion clinics and documented changes in practice regarding the provision of abortion since March 1, 2020. RESULTS: Among about 153 independent clinics invited, 100 clinics contributed relevant data and were included in the analytic sample. A total of 87% reported changes in protocols in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reported changes included moving to telehealth (phone or video) for follow-up (71%), starting or increasing telehealth for patient consultations and screening (41%), reducing Rh testing (43%) and other tests (42%), and omitting the preabortion ultrasound (15%). A total of 20% reported allowing quick pickup of medication abortion pills, and 4% began mailing medications directly to patients after a telehealth consultation. Clinical practice changes were reported throughout all regions of the US, but facilities in the Northeast (73%) were more likely to report starting or increasing telehealth than facilities in the South (23%, p < .001). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated use of telehealth among independent abortion clinics, but many clinics, particularly those in the South, have been unable to make these changes. Other practices such as reducing preabortion ultrasounds were less common in all regions despite clinical guidelines and evidence supporting such changes in practice and positive benefits for public health and patient-centered care. IMPLICATIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has created a window of opportunity to remove barriers to abortion, including expanding telehealth and reducing preabortion tests. Clinics can strive for a culture shift towards simplifying the provision of medication abortion and routinely avoiding preabortion tests and in-person visits. Such changes in practice could have positive benefits for public health and patient-centered care.","output":"Adoption of no-test and telehealth medication abortion care among independent abortion providers in response to COVID-19()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an immense loss of human life, increased economic uncertainty, and negatively impacted individuals' mental health and close relationships. At the same time, experts have noted a concurrent improvement in many environmental quality indicators, including significant decreases in both localized air pollution and global greenhouse gas emissions. These positive trends are due to changes in human behavior necessitated by social distancing and self-quarantining measures (e.g., reduced car and air travel). However, there is already evidence that these improvements in environmental quality are only temporary. This suggests that more intentional efforts will be necessary in order to maintain positive environmental benefits and address major environmental issues as the world gets back to some version of pre-pandemic economic and social activity. Still, our collective experience over the course of the pandemic provides clear evidence that such change is possible and on a rapid timetable. Our individual and collective responses to COVID-19 reveal that we do indeed have the ability to respond to novel societal threats in highly coordinated and effective ways, suggesting that confronting the existential threat of climate change may in fact be feasible.

However, no comprehensive synthesis of existing research has been published to determine the presentation and impact of existential suffering. AIM: To provide a synthesis of existing evidence on existential suffering for those living with palliative care needs arising from COPD. DESIGN: This is an integrative review paper, undertaken using the methodological approach developed by Soares and reported in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Data analysis was undertaking using an integrated convergent synthesis approach. DATA SOURCES: Nine electronic databases were searched from April 2019 to December 2019. A second search was undertaken in January 2021 to identify recently published papers meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. No date restrictions were imposed. Only papers published in the English Language were considered for inclusion. Empirical research papers employing qualitative and/or quantitative methodologies and systematic literature reviews were included. Articles were accepted for inclusion if they discussed any component of existential suffering when living with COPD and palliative care needs. RESULTS: Thirty-five papers were included within this review comprising of seven systematic reviews, 10 quantitative studies and 18 qualitative studies. The following themes relating to existential suffering were found: Liminality, Lamented Life, Loss of Personal Liberty, Life meaning and Existential isolation. The absence of life meaning, and purpose was of most importance to participants.

Timely access to patients current resuscitation wishes, or code status, should be a key metric of electronic health records (EHR). We sought to determine what percentage of a cohort of patients with end-stage disease who present to the emergency department (ED) have accessible, code status documents, and for those who do, how quickly can this documentation be retrieved. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study of ED patients with end-stage disease (eg, palliative care, metastatic malignancy, home oxygen, dialysis) conducted during purposefully sampled random accrual times we performed a standardized, timed review of available health records, including accompanying transfer documents. We also interviewed consenting patients and substitute decision makers to compare available code status documents to their current wishes. RESULTS: Code status documentation was unavailable within 15 minutes of ED arrival in most cases (54/85, or 63%). Retrieval time was under five minutes in the rest, especially when one click deep in the EHR. When interviewed, 20/32 (63%) expressed do not resuscitate wishes, 10 of whom had no supporting documentation. Patients from assisted-living (odds ratio [OR] 6.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7C26) and long-term care facilities (OR 13; 95% CI, 2.5C65) were more likely to have a documented code status available compared to those living in the community. CONCLUSION: The majority of patients with end-stage disease, including half of those who would not wish resuscitation from cardiorespiratory arrest, did not have code status documents readily available upon arrival to our tertiary care ED. Patients living in the community with advanced disease may be at higher risk for unwanted resuscitative efforts should they present to hospital in extremis.

Others have argued that democratic governments have generally failed relative to more autocratic ones, simply because autocrats can make the hard choices required for stemming the spread of viruses. We address this question by asking whether more 'egalitarian' forms of democracy matter, given that they contain more equitable health-care access and societal infrastructure, such as social capital and trust. METHODS: We use standard regression techniques, including instrumental variables analysis addressing endogeneity on COVID-19 testing and deaths data as of the end of May and beginning of September. We use novel data from the Varieties of Democracy Project on health-system equity and egalitarian democracy. RESULTS: Our results suggest that more equitable access to health care increases testing rates and lowers the death rate from COVID-19. Broader egalitarian governance, measured as egalitarian democracy, however, shows the opposite effect. Thus, factors associated with health-care capacity to reach and treat matter more than broader societal factors associated with social capital and trust. The results are robust to alternative testing procedures, including instrumental variable technique for addressing potential endogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a great deal of public health focus on how equitable governance helps fight the adverse effects of so-called neoliberal pandemics, we find that broadly egalitarian factors have had the opposite effect on fighting COVID-19, especially when an equitable health system has been taken into account. Fighting disease, thus, might be more about the capacity of health systems rather than societal factors, such as trust in government and social capital.","output":"Health-system equity, egalitarian democracy and COVID-19 outcomes: An empirical analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) as circulating biomarkers has been underlined in multiple sclerosis (MS) in the last decade.

Data were collected through a survey encompassing digital divide factors and use of the PHR. A total of 128 participants agreed to complete the survey, 60.15% reported using the PHR. We found a statistically significant correlation of education level, having a personal computer and internet access with PHR use. Concerning PHR users, 45.45% reported needing assistance to use it. Although the elderly population represents a large portion of patients, there is not enough research done on their use experience using eHealth solutions. There is pending work in the eHealth field to integrate these elders into current PHRs and help them enjoy their benefits.","output":"Exploring the Digital Divide as a Barrier to Use of a Personal Health Record in the Elderly."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung-resident (LR) mesenchymal stem and stromal cells (MSCs) are key elements of the alveolar niche and fundamental regulators of homeostasis and regeneration. We interrogated their function during virus-induced lung injury using the highly prevalent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) which causes severe outcomes in infants. We applied complementary approaches with primary pediatric LR-MSCs and a state-of-the-art model of human RSV infection in lamb. Remarkably, RSV-infection of pediatric LR-MSCs led to a robust activation, characterized by a strong antiviral and pro-inflammatory phenotype combined with mediators related to T cell function. In line with this, following in vivo infection, RSV invades and activates LR-MSCs, resulting in the expansion of the pulmonary MSC pool. Moreover, the global transcriptional response of LR-MSCs appears to follow RSV disease, switching from an early antiviral signature to repair mechanisms including differentiation, tissue remodeling, and angiogenesis. These findings demonstrate the involvement of LR-MSCs during virus-mediated acute lung injury and may have therapeutic implications.","output":"Pulmonary mesenchymal stem cells are engaged in distinct steps of host response to respiratory syncytial virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a framework for formal refutational completeness proofs of abstract provers that implement saturation calculi, such as ordered resolution or superposition.

The objective of this research is to analyze the possible association between the structure of the population pyramid, the Gross Domestic Product, the type of isolation and screening used to detect Covid-19 in the countries with the highest and lowest mortality from this disease. Design and Methods: Some variables take part in the Covid- 19 mortality worldwide, such as the population structure, expressed in the population pyramid by country, the type of isolation adopted in each nation, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as well as the type of screening that is implemented in the different countries analyzed. Results: After analyzing the mean difference in the countries with a regressive and progressive population pyramid, an association was identified between the regressive population pyramid structure and the higher mortality rate (p<0.001).

AIM: : The objective of this study was to explore sexual health in heterosexual, lesbian and bisexual cis women during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. METHODS: : An anonymous nationwide online survey was conducted among cis women during the first nationwide lockdown in Germany from April 20th to July 20th, 2020. The questionnaire was distributed via e-mail, online chats and social-media platforms. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: : Demographic variables and self-report measures from the Sexual Behavior Questionnaire (SBQ-G) \\"before the pandemic\\" and \\"since the pandemic\\" were collected. RESULTS: : A total of 1368 cis women participants were included: heterosexual women (n = 844), lesbian women (n = 293), bisexual women (n = 231). Results indicate overall decrease in frequency of sexual contacts and masturbation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding differences before and during the pandemic lesbian women showed significant changes in sexual arousal whereas heterosexual women showed significant changes in all dimensions except capability to enjoy sexual intercourse. The data of bisexual women showed significant changes in almost all dimensions except for frequency of sexual intercourse and sexual arousal. Results of the multiple regression analysis revealed that being younger than 36 years-old, and being in a relationship as well as being heterosexual (compared with being lesbian) is positively associated with general satisfaction with sexual life during the pandemic. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: : The findings suggest that during a pandemic sexual and mental health care for (cis) women should be provided and address the specific needs of sexual minority groups. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: : This is the first study to describe sexual behavior in heterosexual, lesbian and bisexual women during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Limitations, however, include the fact that the data described were obtained at only one time point so there is a possibility of recall bias, and that the results cannot be generalized because of the underrepresentation of women over age 46.

Two of the foremost bioactive factors, bone morphogenetic protein-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), are widely applied using a ceramic scaffold. The aim of this study was to determine the use of hydroxyapatite microcarrier (MC) for dual delivery of osteogenic and angiogenic factors to accelerate hard tissue regeneration during the regenerative process. METHODS: Two MCs of different sizes were fabricated by emulsification of gelatin and alpha-tricalcium phosphate (&#945;-TCP). The experimental group was divided based on the combination of MC size and growth factors. For investigating the in vitro properties, rat mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs) were harvested from bone marrow of the femur and tibia. For in vivo experiments, MC with/without growth factors was applied into the standardized, 5-mm diameter defects, which were made bilaterally on the parietal bone of the rat. The animals were allowed to heal for 8 weeks, and samples were harvested and analyzed by micro-computed tomography and histology. RESULTS: Improved proliferation of rat mesenchymal stem cells was observed with VEGF loaded MC. For osteogenic differentiation, dual growth factors delivered by MC showed higher osteogenic gene expression, alkaline phosphatse production and calcium deposition. The in vivo results revealed statistically significant increase in new bone formation when dual growth factors were delivered by MC. Dual growth factors administered on a calcium phosphate matrix showed significantly enhanced osteogenic potential.

Then, we performed an end-to-end training using the initial pretrained weights on all the layers. Our model was trained using a total of 8644 images with 4000 images each in normal and pneumonia cases and 644 in COVID-19 cases representing a large real dataset.

Based on the current understanding, COVID-19 has become a global issue. Presumably, numerous studies have found that SARS-CoV-2 also transpires in kidney tissue with permanent viral loads. However, it is elusive as to whether SARS-CoV-2 can directly damage the kidney or induce acute renal failure. Hence, to comprehensively understand the impact of COVID-19 on kidney damage, we conducted a retrospective series of case studies to assess kidney functions. Additionally, ACE2 distribution in kidney tissue was analyzed through RNAseq data in open-access databases. Results: According to the findings from transcriptome analysis, we revealed higher ACE2 expression levels in females than males. Similar results were more noticeable in the elderly than in young adults. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis showed high ACE2 expression in kidney tubule and collecting duct principal cells as well as glomerular parietal epithelial cells. On their admission, the patient's serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were elevated to between 36.13% and 16.80%, respectively. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR) of < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 was reported in 10.92 % of the patients. Notably, at admission, increased BUN time varied linearly following the generalized additive mixed model. Thus, the hourly-increase of BUN in patients was 0.495 (95%CI: 0.263, 0.726). Conclusion: Based on clinical findings, it was ascertained that COVID-19 can damage renal function, but it seldom causes acute renal failure. Coronavirus may directly bind to ACE2-positive cells and damage kidney tissue in the analysis of scRNA-seq data in kidney tissue. Therefore, this evidence suggests that kidney tissue act as the SARS-CoV-2 infection site and the findings could provide insight into the pathophysiology of kidney damage. Methods: We systematically analyzed ACE2 expression profiles in organs based on open-access datasets for healthy individuals.

Mixed-model linear regression analysis demonstrated a significant independent positive longitudinal association of the mean blood pressure with both the brachial-ankle PWV (estimate = 5.51, standard error = 0.30, P < 0.01) and the rAI (estimate = 0.19, standard error = 0.02, P < 0.01).

In conclusion, the conventional risk factors for CVD showed heterogeneous longitudinal associations with arterial stiffness and/or abnormal pressure wave reflection. Elevated blood pressure showed independent longitudinal associations with both arterial stiffness (macrovascular damage) and abnormal pressure wave reflection, suggesting that BP is also longitudinally associated, at least in part, with microvascular damage.

This risk is increased in patients who require ventricular assist device (VAD) placement. The most common mechanism suggested for why these patients develop anemia is chronic inflammation caused by the immune system reacting to the VAD components. The inflammatory response that occurs can suppress erythropoiesis by inhibiting production of erythropoietin. Studies have demonstrated that anemic VAD patients have lower-than-expected erythropoietin levels, which leads to the consideration of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in this population. Therapy with ESAs can increase hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, thereby decreasing the need for transfusions, subsequently reducing the risk of anti-human leukocyte antigen antibody development. Concerns that ESAs may increase the risk of thrombotic complications in a population already plagued with physiologic disturbances due to the VAD device remain a main barrier in routine use of these medications.

A total of 4 patients were included with no evidence of adverse effects during a total of 120 patient-days of epoetin therapy. One patient was able to discontinue ESA therapy secondary to robust improvement in cell line counts at the time of discharge, while the other 3 patients received heart transplant prior to the discontinuation of ESA therapy. An increase in hematocrit of 1% to 5.5% was seen from epoetin initiation to discontinuation.","output":"Epoetin alfa in Pediatric Patients With Ventricular Assist Devices: Is It Safe?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The elevation of serum cardiac troponin I (TNI) in patients with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (ntSAH) is a well-known phenomenon. However, the relation between elevated TNI and different cardiopulmonary parameters (CPs) within the first 24 hours after ntSAH is unknown. The present study was conducted to investigate the association between TNI and different CP in patients with ntSAH within the first 24 hours of intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive group of 117 patients with ntSAH admitted to our emergency department between January 2008 and February 2017. Blood samples were taken to determine TNI values on admission. Demographic data, baseline Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) score, baseline Fisher grade (FG), norepinephrine application rate (NAR) in g/kg/min, and inspiratory oxygen fraction (OF) were recorded within the first 24 hours. RESULTS: An increased TNI value was found in 32 (27.4%) of 117 patients. There was a significant correlation between initial elevated TNI and a low WFNS score ( P = .007), a low GCS score ( P = .003) as well as a high OF ( P = <.001). The FG ( P = .27) and NAR ( P = .08) within the first 24 hours of ICU treatment did not show any significant correlation. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, an increased TNI value was significantly associated with a low WFNS score and GCS score on admission. The TNI was a predictor of the need for a higher OF within the first 24 hours after ntSAH so that TNI could be an informative biomarker to improve ICU therapy.","output":"Troponin I as an Early Biomarker of Cardiopulmonary Parameters Within the First 24 Hours After Nontraumatic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in Intensive Care Unit Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a global crisis.

However, owing to the clinical and economic benefits of early extubation, many efforts have been used to assess the clinical predictors for PMV. The aim of our study was to explore the impact of perioperative risk factors, including candidate gene polymorphisms, for PMV in patients undergoing liver transplantation. Methods One hundred forty patients who underwent liver transplantation surgery were enrolled. The duration of mechanical ventilation after surgery was examined, along with the length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay, and 30-day mortality. Patient-related clinical factors and single nucleotide polymorphisms of candidate genes were assessed with regard to PMV, which was defined as mechanical ventilation for > 48 hours (h). Results Twenty-six (19%) patients continued to receive mechanical ventilation at 48 h after surgery. Intraoperative continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and an elevated serum lactate level during the postoperative period were significantly associated with the PMV group, compared to the non-PMV group [odds ratio (OR) = 24.731 (1.077 - 567.915) versus OR = 3.008 (1.497 - 6.045)]. A significant association existed between the HLA-DPA1 rs8486 polymorphism and the risk of PMV under the allele model [OR = 8.060 (1.451 - 44.765)].

The stemCloop was systematically altered to decouple the contributions of local and overall thermodynamic stability towards frameshift efficiency. No correlation between overall stability and frameshift efficiency is observed. In contrast, there is a strong correlation between frameshift efficiency and the local thermodynamic stability of the first 3C4 bp in the stemCloop, which are predicted to reside at the opening of the mRNA entrance channel when the ribosome is paused at the slippery site. Insertion or deletions in the spacer region appear to correspondingly change the identity of the base pairs encountered 8 nt downstream of the slippery site.

One of the more serious symptoms exhibited from patients suffering from an acute COVID-19 infection is breathing difficulties and shortness of breath, which is largely due to the excessive fluid (cellular leakage and cytokine storm) and mucoid debris that have filled lung alveoli, and reduced the surfactant tension resulting in heavy and stiff lungs. In this paper we propose the use of micro-bubbles filled with exosomes that can be released upon exposure to ultrasound signals as a possible rescue therapy in deteriorating COVID-19 patients. Recent studies have shown that exosomes can be used to repair and treat lung damage for patients who have suffered from the viral infection. We have conducted simulations to show the efficacy of the ultrasound signals that will penetrate through layers of tissues reaching the alveoli that contains the micro-bubbles. Our results have shown that ultrasound signals with low frequencies are required to oscillate and rupture the polymer-based micro-bubbles. Our proposed system can be used for patients who require immediate rescue treatments for lung damage, as well as for recovered patients who may suffer from viral relapse infection, where the micro-bubbles will remain dormant for a temporary therapeutic window until they are exposed to the ultrasound signals. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Ultrasound-based Control of Micro-Bubbles for Exosome Delivery in Treating COVID-19 Lung Damage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic places a significant stress on the viral testing capabilities of many countries. The value of rapid point-of-care (PoC) antigen tests is becoming increasingly clear, but implementing frequent large scale testing is costly.

The holder of the device can be produced locally through 3D printing. The extraction and the elution can be performed with the entire set-up encapsulated in a transparent bag, minimizing the risk of infection for the operator.

In Myanmar, ALRI is associated with high morbidity and mortality in children, and detailed information on ALRI is currently lacking. METHODS: This prospective study investigated the viral aetiologies, clinical manifestations, and outcomes of ALRI in hospitalised children aged 1 month to 12 years at the Yankin Children Hospital, Yangon, Myanmar from May 2017 to April 2019. The sample size was set to 300 patients for each year. Two nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained for the patients with suspected viral ALRI; one for rapid tests for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and the other for real-time PCR for the 16 ALRI-causing viruses. Pneumococcal colonization rates were also investigated using real-time PCR. Clinical information was extracted from the medical records, and enrolled patients were categorised by age and severity for comparison. RESULTS: Among the 5463 patients admitted with a diagnosis of ALRI, 570 (10.4%) were enrolled in this study. The median age of the patients was 8 months (interquartile range, 4C15 months). The most common symptoms were cough (93%) and difficulty in breathing (73%), while the most common signs of ALRI were tachypnoea (78%) and chest indrawing (67%). A total of 16 viruses were detected in 502 of 570 patients samples (88%), with RSV B (36%) and rhinovirus (28%) being the most commonly detected. Multiple viruses were detected in 221 of 570 samples (37%) collected from 570 patients. Severe ALRI was diagnosed in 107 of 570 patients (19%), and RSV B and human rhinovirus were commonly detected. The mortality rate was 5%; influenza virus A (29%) and RSV B (21%) were commonly detected, and stunting and lack of immunization were frequently observed in such cases. Additionally, 45% (259/570) of the patients had pneumococcal colonization. CONCLUSIONS: Viral ALRI in hospitalised children with a median of 8 months has significant morbidity and mortality rates in Myanmar. RSV and rhinovirus were the most commonly detected from nasopharyngeal swabs, while influenza virus and RSV were the most frequently associated with fatal cases.

The performed analysis focused on the dynamics of COVID-19 cases in St. Petersburg from 2/3/2020 to 4/4/2021 and on the gender-age profile of patients. The information about patients (age, gender, type of the disease, hospitalization, social, and occupational status) was obtained from the database containing the materials from statistical data form No. 058/u. Results. After one year, the dynamics of reported cases of COVID-19 in St. Petersburg shows two cycles of seasonal surge (spring and autumn-winter) and 8 epidemic periods. It has been found that there are no gender-age differences among COVID-19 patients, which can be seen from the relatively similar number of cases among men and women per 100,000 people in each age group during specific epidemic periods. The strong association between clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and the patients age was detected: Severe cases were more frequently diagnosed in patients over 70 years, regardless of their gender identity. Based on the social and occupational status, the people who were most exposed to the COVID-19 epidemic process were retirees and people whose occupation was associated with health and safety of St. Petersburg. Among the COVID-19 patients, retirees accounted for 13.69% (men) and 17.67% (women). The proportion of healthcare workers was 3.67% (men) and 9.41% (women). Conclusion.

This study was hence aimed to explore whether the Google search volume may have been useful to predict the trajectory of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Italy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We accessed Google Trends for collecting data on weekly Google searches for the keywords tosse (i.e., cough), febbre (i.e., fever) and dispnea (dyspnea) in Italy, between February and May 2020. The number of new weekly cases of COVID-19 in Italy was also obtained from the website of the National Institute of Health. RESULTS: The peaks of Google searches for the three terms predicted by 3 weeks that of newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases. The peaks of weekly Google searches for febbre (fever), tosse( cough) and dispnea (dyspnea) were 1.7-, 2.2- and 7.7-fold higher compared to the week before the diagnosis of the first national case. No significant correlation was found between the number of newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases and Google search volumes of tosse (cough) and febbre (fever), whilst dyspnea (dyspnea) was significantly correlated (r= 0.50; p=0.034). The correlation between newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases and tosse (cough; r=0.65; p=0.008) or febbre (fever; 0.69; p=0.004) become statistically significant with a 3-week delay.

The effectiveness of interventions was assessed by changes in the time-dependent reproductive number (Rt). From 25th January to 29th February, Jiangsu Province reported a total of 134 clusters involving 617 cases. Household clusters accounted for 79.85% of the total. The time interval from onset to report of index cases was 8 days, which was longer than that of secondary cases (4 days) (&#967;2 = 22.763, P < 0.001) and had a relationship with the number of secondary cases (the correlation coefficient (r) = 0.193, P = 0.040). The average interval from onset to report was different between family cluster cases (4 days) and community cluster cases (7 days) (&#967;2 = 28.072, P < 0.001). The average time interval from onset to isolation of patients with secondary infection (5 days) was longer than that of patients without secondary infection (3 days) (F = 9.761, P = 0.002). Asymptomatic patients and non-familial clusters had impacts on the size of the clusters. The average reduction in the Rt value in family clusters (26.00%, 0.26  0.22) was lower than that in other clusters (37.00%, 0.37  0.26) (F = 4.400, P = 0.039).

However, this evidence must be translated into action. Knowledge translation (KT) experts have highlighted the plausible mechanisms to foster the uptake of evidence. The objective of this study was to assess the extent to which structures are in place to boost uptake of evidence, in countries of the WHO African Region. METHODS: Employing a cross-sectional survey, we collected data on the availability of structures to foster the uptake of evidence into policy in 35 out of the 47 member states of the WHO African Region. Data were analysed using a simple counting of the presence or absence of such structures. RESULTS: Less than half of the countries had evidence collation and synthesis mechanisms. The lack of such mechanisms presents a missed opportunity to identify comprehensive solutions that can respond to health sector challenges. Close to 50% of the countries had KT platforms in place. However, the availability of these was in several forms, as an institution-based platform, as an annual event to disseminate evidence and as a series of conferences at the national level. In some countries, KT was mainstreamed into routine health sector performance review processes. Several challenges impacted the functionality of the KT platforms including inadequate funding and lack of dedicated personnel. Regarding dissemination of evidence, sharing reports, scientific publications and one-off presentations in meetings were the main approaches employed. CONCLUSION: The availability of KT platforms in the WHO African countries can be described as at best and non-existent at the worst. The current structures, where these exist, cannot adequately foster KT. Knowledge translation platforms need to be viewed as sector-wide platforms and mainstreamed in routine health sector performance reviews and policymaking processes. Funds for their functionality must be planned for as part of the health sector budget. Dissemination of evidence needs to be viewed differently to embrace the concept of disseminate for impact.

Because human translators, the gold standard for mitigating language barriers, can be cost- and time-intensive, mechanical alternatives such as language translation apps (LTA) have gained in popularity. However, adequate training for physicians in using LTAs remains elusive. OBJECTIVE: A proof-of-concept pilot study was designed to evaluate the use of a speech-to-speech LTA in a specific simulated physician-patient situation, particularly its perceived usability, helpfulness, and meaningfulness, and to assess the teaching unit overall. METHODS: Students engaged in a 90-min simulation with a standardized patient (SP) and the LTA iTranslate Converse. Thereafter, they rated the LTA with six itemshelpful, intuitive, informative, accurate, recommendable, and applicableon a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (dont agree at all) to 7 (completely agree) and could provide free-text responses for four items: general impression of the LTA, the LTAs benefits, the LTAs risks, and suggestions for improvement. Students also assessed the teaching unit on a 6-point scale from 1 (excellent) to 6 (insufficient). Data were evaluated quantitatively with mean (SD) values and qualitatively in thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Of 111 students in the course, 76 (68.5%) participated (59.2% women, age 20.7 years, SD 3.3 years). Values for the LTAs being helpful (mean 3.45, SD 1.79), recommendable (mean 3.33, SD 1.65) and applicable (mean 3.57, SD 1.85) were centered around the average of 3.5. The items intuitive (mean 4.57, SD 1.74) and informative (mean 4.53, SD 1.95) were above average. The only below-average item concerned its accuracy (mean 2.38, SD 1.36). Students rated the teaching unit as being excellent (mean 1.2, SD 0.54) but wanted practical training with an SP plus a simulated human translator first. Free-text responses revealed several concerns about translation errors that could jeopardize diagnostic decisions. Students feared that patient-physician communication mediated by the LTA could decrease empathy and raised concerns regarding data protection and technical reliability. Nevertheless, they appreciated the LTAs cost-effectiveness and usefulness as the best option when the gold standard is unavailable. They also reported wanting more medical-specific vocabulary and images to convey all information necessary for medical communication. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the feasibility of using a speech-to-speech LTA in an undergraduate medical course. Although human translators remain the gold standard, LTAs could be valuable alternatives. Students appreciated the simulated teaching and recognized the LTAs potential benefits and risks for use in real-world clinical settings. To optimize patients and health care professionals experiences with LTAs, future investigations should examine specific design options for training interventions and consider the legal aspects of human-machine interaction in health care settings.","output":"Evaluation of a Language Translation App in an Undergraduate Medical Communication Course: Proof-of-Concept and Usability Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has significant contributions to morbidity and mortality world-wide.

However, as the OSCE typically consists of a large-scale, face-to-face assessment activity, it has been variably criticized over recent years due to the extensive resourcing and relative expense required for delivery. Importantly, due to COVID-pandemic conditions and necessary health guidelines in 2020 and 2021, logistical issues inherent with OSCE delivery were exacerbated for many institutions across the globe. As a result, alternative clinical assessment strategies were employed to gather assessment datapoints to guide decision-making regarding student progression. Now, as communities learn to live with COVID, health professions educators have the opportunity to consider what weight should be placed on the OSCE as a tool for clinical assessment in the peri-pandemic world. In order to elucidate this timely clinical assessment issue, this qualitative study utilized focus group discussions to explore the perceptions of 23 clinical assessment stakeholders (examiners, students, simulated patients and administrators) in relation to the future role of the traditional OSCE. Thematic analysis of the FG transcripts revealed four major themes in relation to participants' views on the future of the OSCE vis-a-vis other clinical assessments in this peri-pandemic climate. The identified themes are (a) enduring value of the OSCE;(b) OSCE tensions;(c) educational impact;and (d) the importance of programs of assessment. It is clear that the OSCE continues to play a role in clinical assessments due to its perceived fairness, standardization and ability to yield robust results. However, recent experiences have resulted in a diminishing and refining of its role alongside workplace-based assessments in the new, peri-pandemic programs of assessment.

The data regarding palliative team involvement in patients with COVID-19, however, remains scarce. We aimed to investigate outcomes of palliative team involvement for the patients with COVID-19 in NYC. METHODS Consecutive 225 patients with confirmed COVID-19 requiring hospitalization in our urban academic medical center in NYC were analyzed. Patients were divided into 2 groups, those with a palliative care consult (palliative group: 14.2% [n = 32]) versus those with no palliative care consult (no palliative group: 85.8% [n = 193]). RESULTS The palliative group was older and had more comorbidities. During the hospital course, the palliative group had more intensive care unit stays, rapid response team activations, and more use of vasopressors (P < .05). Patients with palliative care had higher rates of invasive mechanical ventilation than those without (46.9% vs 10.4%, P < .001). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed in 12 patients (6.5% vs 5.2%, P = .77) and death rate was 100% in both subsets. Notably, initial code status was not different between the 2 groups, however, code status at discharge was significantly different between them (P < .001). The rate of full code decreased by 70% in the palliative group and by 47.5% in the no palliative care group from admission to the time of death.

Current standards in ventilation adjuncts include prone positioning in moderate-severe ARDS and veno-venous extracorporeal life support after prone positioning in patients with severe hypoxemia or who are difficult to ventilate. Pharmacotherapy current standards include corticosteroids for patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 and employing a conservative fluid strategy for patients not in shock; evolving standards may include steroids for ARDS not related to COVID-19, or specific biological agents being tested in appropriate sub-phenotypes of ARDS.

This was achieved using Lycopersicon esculentum lectin (LEL), a lectin widely used in monitoring cancer. Four small identical LEL columns were coupled in series to form a single affinity chromatography system with the last in the series connected to an absorbance detector. The serial affinity column set (SACS) was then loaded with human plasma proteins. At the completion of loading, the column set was disassembled, the four columns were eluted individually, the captured proteins were trypsin digested, the peptides were deglycosylated with PNGase F, and the parent proteins were identified through mass spectral analyses. Significantly different sets of glycoproteins were selected by each column, some proteins appearing to be exclusively bound to the first column while others were bound further along in the series. Clearly, sample displacement chromatography (SDC) occurs. Glycoproteins were bound at different places in the column train, identifying the presence of glycoforms with different affinity on a single glycoprotein. It is not possible to see these phenomena in the single column mode of chromatography. Moreover, low abundance proteins were enriched, which facilitates detection. The great advantage of this method is that it differentiates between glycoproteins on the basis of their binding affinity. Displacement phenomena are concluded to be a significant component of the separation mechanism in heavily loaded lectin affinity chromatography columns. This further suggests that care must be exercised in sample loading of lectin columns to prevent analyte displacement with nonretained proteins.","output":"Displacement phenomena in lectin affinity chromatography."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the only half-metallic ferromagnetic material in 3d transition metal dioxides, CrO2 has attracted great scientific interest from materials science to physical chemistry.

Static calculations have predicted that CrO2 undergoes structural transitions with the sequence of rutile-type  CaCl2-type  pyrite-type  Pnma  (Fe2P-type) I4/mmm at high pressures. In addition, a transition from the ferromagnetic state to the non-magnetic state with the magnetic collapse of Cr is observed in CrO2 at the pyrite-Pnma transition.

Hypertension and respiratory inflammation are exacerbated by the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), which normally protects from rapidly dropping blood pressure via Angiotensin II (Ang II) produced by the enzyme Ace. The Ace paralog Ace2 degrades Ang II, counteracting its chronic effects, and serves as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Ace, the coronavirus, and COVID-19 comorbidities all regulate Ace2, but we do not yet understand how. To exploit zebrafish (Danio rerio) to help understand the relationship of the RAAS to COVID-19, we must identify zebrafish orthologs and co-orthologs of human RAAS genes and understand their expression patterns. To achieve these goals, we conducted genomic and phylogenetic analyses and investigated single cell transcriptomes. Results showed that most human RAAS genes have one or more zebrafish orthologs or co-orthologs. Results identified a specific type of enterocyte as the specific site of expression of zebrafish orthologs of key RAAS components, including Ace, Ace2, Slc6a19 (SARS-CoV-2 co-receptor), and the Angiotensin-related peptide cleaving enzymes Anpep (receptor for the common cold coronavirus HCoV-229E), and Dpp4 (receptor for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus, MERS-CoV).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were collected from 287 consecutive patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at two hospitals in New Orleans, LA, from 30 March to 5 April 2020. MetS was identified per World Health Organization criteria. RESULTS: Among 287 patients (mean age 61.5 years; female, 56.8%; non-Hispanic Black, 85.4%), MetS was present in 188 (66%). MetS was significantly associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.42 [95% CI 1.52C7.69]), intensive care unit requirement (ICU) (aOR 4.59 [CI 2.53C8.32]), invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (aOR 4.71 [95% CI 2.50C8.87]), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (aOR 4.70 [95% CI 2.25C9.82]) compared with non-MetS.

In spite of initial encouraging technical success after femoropopliteal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or stenting, postprocedural restenosis remains the major problem. The challenging idea behind the drug-coated balloon (DCB) concept is the biological modification of the injury response after balloon dilatation. Antiproliferative drugs administered via DCBs or drug-eluting stents are able to suppress neointimal hyperplasia, the main cause of restenosis. This article reviews the results of DCB treatments of femoropopliteal and infrapopliteal lesions in comparison to standard angioplasty with uncoated balloons. A systematic literature search was performed in 1) medical journals (ie, MEDLINE), 2) international registers for clinical studies (ie, www.clinicaltrials.gov), and 3) abstracts of scientific sessions. Several controlled randomized trials with follow-up periods of up to 5 years demonstrated the efficacy of paclitaxel -DCB technology. However, calcified lesions seem to affect the efficacy of DCB. Combinations of preconditioning methods with DCBs showed promising results. Although the mechanical abrasion of calcium via atherectomy or laser ablation showed favorable periprocedural results, the long-term impact on restenosis and clinical outcome has to be demonstrated. Major advantages of the DCBs are the rapid delivery of drug at uniform concentrations with a single dose, their efficacy in areas wherein stents have been contraindicated until now (ie, bifurcation, ostial lesions), and in leaving no stent scaffold behind. Reinterventions are easier to perform because DCBs leave no metal behind. Various combinations of DCBs with other treatment modalities may prove to be viable options in future. The follow-up results of clinical studies will evaluate the long-term impact of DCBs.","output":"Critical appraisal of paclitaxel balloon angioplasty for femoral-popliteal arterial disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The slogan that the virus doesnt discriminate has been belied by the emergence of stark and persistent disparities in rates of infection, hospitalisation, and death from Covid-19 between various social groups.

However, in the case of fatness, individualising and stigmatising narratives have dominated discussions. I suggest that, given racial or ethnic differences in prevalence of fatness, and scholarship casting anti-fatness as historically racialised, the stigmatisation of fatness disproportionately affects racial or ethnic minorities in terms of placing individual blame or responsibility for the increased burden of Covid-19 on these groups.

The tight links that necessarily exist between the virus as it multiplies and the metabolism of its host are systematically ignored. Here we show that the metabolism of all cells is coordinated by the availability of a core building block of the cells genome, cytidine triphosphate (CTP). This metabolite is also the key to the synthesis of the viral envelope and to the translation of its genome into proteins. This unique role explains why evolution has led to the early emergence in animals of an antiviral immunity enzyme, viperin, that synthesizes a toxic analogue of CTP. The constraints arising from this dependency guide the evolution of the virus. With this in mind, we explored the real-time experiment taking place before our eyes using probabilistic modelling approaches to the molecular evolution of the virus. We have thus followed, almost on a daily basis, the evolution of the composition of the viral genome to link it to the progeny produced over time, particularly in the form of blooms that sparked a firework of viral mutations. Some of those certainly increase the propagation of the virus. This led us to make out the critical role in this evolution of several proteins of the virus, such as its nucleocapsid N, and more generally to begin to understand how the virus ties up the host metabolism to its own benefit. A way for the virus to escape CTP-dependent control in cells would be to infect cells that are not expected to grow, such as neurons.

METHODS Patients with symptomatic malignant CAO undergoing various therapeutic bronchoscopy procedures were assessed for symptomatic and functional improvement using the Speiser Score, spirometry, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), and St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) up to 3 months after the procedures. RESULTS A total of 83 intervention procedures were performed in 65 patients, comprising 43 (66.2%) male individuals [overall mean age, 52.4; SD, 15.4 y]. The majority of these (92.3%) was done using rigid bronchoscope under general anesthesia. Airway stenting was the most common intervention performed (56.6%), followed by mechanical debulking (26.5%), cryodebulking (6%), electrosurgical removal (4.8%), balloon dilatation (3.6%), and laser ablation (2.4%).A total of 15 complications (18.1%) were noted. Of these, 8 (53.3%) were early complications and 7 (46.7%) were late complications. Early complications included airway bleeding, hypoxia, vocal cord injury, laryngeal injury, and pneumothorax. Late complications included significant granulation tissue formation in metallic stents and lung collapse because of mucus plug.The survival rates at 4, 8, and 12 weeks were 83%, 70.7%, and 66.1%, respectively. Significant improvement was observed in dyspnea, cough, Speiser Score, 6MWD, forced expiratory volume in 1 s, forced vital capacity, and SGRQ scores at 48 hours, 4 weeks, and at 12 weeks after the procedures and no procedure-related mortality occurred. CONCLUSION Various therapeutic bronchoscopic interventions, including combined modalities, provide rapid and sustained improvements in symptoms, respiratory status, exercise capacity, and quality of life in malignant CAO and have a good safety profile.","output":"A Prospective Outcome Assessment After Bronchoscopic Interventions for Malignant Central Airway Obstruction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Myricetin and 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives were reported to exhibit favorable antiviral and antibacterial activities.

Six months later we obtained retrospective assessments for the same domains (Nscientists = 270;NlayPeople = 411). Scientists and lay people were equally inaccurate in judging COVIDs impact, both in prospective predictions and retrospective assessments, and when using both directional and rank-order estimates.

However, the deterioration of CPM performance over time has rarely been studied. This paper proposes a model updating method to solve the calibration drift issue caused by data drift. MATERIALS AND METHODS This paper proposes a novel model updating method based on lifelong machine learning (LML). The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified in four tumor datasets, and a comprehensive comparison with other model updating methods is performed. RESULTS Changes in data distributions cause model performances to drift. The four compared model updating methods have different effects in terms of improving the discrimination and calibration abilities of the tested models. The LML method proposed in this study improves model performance better than or equivalent to the other methods. The proposed method achieved a mean AUC of 0.8249, 0.8780, 0.8261, and 0.8489, a mean AUPRC of 0.7782, 0.9730, 0.4655, and 0.5728, a mean F1 of 0.6866, 0.9552, 0.2985, and 0.3585, and a mean estimated calibration index (ECI) of 0.0320, 0.0338, 0.0101, and 0.0115 using colorectal, lung, breast and prostate cancer datasets. DISCUSSION The LML framework simultaneously monitors model performance and the distribution of disease risk characteristics, enabling it to effectively address the performance degradation caused by gradual and sudden data drifts and provide reasonable explanations for the causes of performance degradation. CONCLUSION Monitoring model performance and the underlying data distribution can promote model life cycle iteration with \\"development-deployment-maintenance-monitoring\\" as the core, which, in turn, ensures that the model can provide accurate predictions, guides the model update process and explains the causes of model performance changes.","output":"A novel lifelong machine learning-based method to eliminate calibration drift in clinical prediction models."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The research is aimed at investigating computed tomography (CT) image based on deep learning algorithm and the application value of ceramide glycosylation in diagnosing bladder cancer. The images of ordinary CT detection were improved. In this study, 60 bladder cancer patients were selected and performed with ordinary CT detection, and the detection results were processed by CT based on deep learning algorithms and compared with pathological diagnosis. In addition, Western Blot technology was used to detect the expression of glucose ceramide synthase (GCS) in the cell membrane of tumor tissues and normal tissues of bladder. The comparison results found that, in simple CT clinical staging, the coincidence rates of T1 stage, T2a stage, T2b stage, T3 stage, and T4 stage were 28.56%, 62.51%, 78.94%, 84.61%, and 74.99%, respectively; and the total coincidence rate of CT clinical staging was 63.32%, which was greatly different from the clinical staging of pathological diagnosis (P < 0.05). In the clinical staging of algorithm-based CT test results, the coincidence rates of T1 stage and T2a stage were 50.01% and 91.65%, respectively; and those of T2b stage, T3 stage, and T4 stage were 100.00%; and the total coincidence rate was 96.69%, which was not obviously different from the clinical staging of pathological diagnosis (P > 0.05). Therefore, it could be concluded that the algorithm-based CT detection results were more accurate, and the use of CT scans based on deep learning algorithms in the preoperative staging and clinical treatment of bladder cancer showed reliable guiding significance and clinical value. In addition, it was found that the expression level of GCS in normal bladder tissues was much lower than that in bladder cancer tissues. This indicated that the changes in GCS were closely related to the development and prognosis of bladder cancer. Therefore, it was believed that GCS may be an effective target for the treatment of bladder cancer in the future, and further research was needed for specific conditions.","output":"Computed Tomography Image Features under Deep Learning Algorithm Applied in Staging Diagnosis of Bladder Cancer and Detection on Ceramide Glycosylation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Otitis Media with Effusion (OME) causing hearing impairments affects ~1 in 10 children starting school in UK/ Europe. 80% have at least one episode with most having conductive hearing loss.

We aimed to use population-level data to estimate the association between self-reported disability and death involving COVID-19 during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study of adults aged 30C100 years living in private households or communal establishments in England, using data from the Office for National Statistics Public Health Data Asset. Participants were present at the 2011 Census and alive on Jan 24, 2020. Participants reported being limited a lot in their daily activities, limited a little, or not limited at all, in response to a question from the 2011 Census. The outcome was death involving COVID-19, occurring between Jan 24, 2020, and Feb 28, 2021. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between disability and death involving COVID-19, sequentially adjusting for age, residence type (private household, care home, or other communal establishment), geographical characteristics (local authority district and population density), sociodemographic characteristics (ethnicity, highest qualification, Index of Multiple Deprivation decile, household characteristics [National Statistics Socio-economic Classification of the household reference person, tenure of household, household size, family status, household composition, and key worker in household], key worker type, individual and household exposure to disease, and individual and household proximity to others), and health status (pre-existing health conditions, body-mass index, and number of admissions to hospital and days spent in hospital over the previous 3 years). FINDINGS: 29 293 845 adults were included in the study (13 806 623 [47%] men, 15 487 222 [53%] women), of whom 3 038 772 (10%) reported being limited a little and 2 011 576 (7%) reported being limited a lot. During follow-up, 105 213 people died from causes involving COVID-19 in England, 61 416 (58%) of whom were disabled. Age-adjusted analyses showed higher mortality involving COVID-19 among disabled people who were limited a lot (HR 305 [95% CI 298C311] for men; 348 [341C356] for women) and disabled people who were limited a little (HR 188 [184C192] for men; 203 [198C208] for women) than among non-disabled people.

Co-fermentation of xylose and glucose by metabolically engineered cell factories is a promising alternative to chemical hydrogenation of xylose for commercial production of xylitol. Here, we engineered a mutant of SecY protein-translocation channel (SecY [P]) in xylitol-producing E. coli JM109 (DE3) as a passageway for xylose uptake. It was found that SecY (P) channel could rapidly transport xylose without being interfered by XylB-catalyzed synthesis of xylitol-phosphate, which is impossible for native XylFGH and XylE transporters. More importantly, with the coaction of SecY (P) channel and carbon catabolite repression (CCR), the flux of xylose to the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway and the xylitol synthesis pathway in E. coli could be automatically controlled in response to glucose, thereby ensuring that the mutant cells were able to fully utilize sugars with high xylitol yields. The E. coli cell factory developed in this study has been proven to be applicable to a broad range of xylose-glucose mixtures, which is conducive to simplifying the mixed-sugar fermentation process for efficient and economical production of xylitol.

Over 40% of COVID-19 survivors experience persistent dyspnea approximately 60 days following hospital discharge (Carfi et al., JAMA, 2020). Understanding differences in pulmonary function and functional capacity between those that do and do not experience persistent dyspnea may provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of this symptom in survivors of COVID-19. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to compare spirometry, diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and 6-minute walk test (6MWT) outcomes in COVID-19 patients with and without persistent dyspnea. We hypothesized that COVID-19 patients with persistent dyspnea would have lower forced vital capacity (FVC), DLCO, and 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) compared to patients without persistent dyspnea. Methods: Non-critical patients (n=186) with varying degrees of COVID-19 severity reported all persistent symptoms using a standardized questionnaire and underwent pulmonary function testing and a 6MWT between 30 and 90 days following the onset of acute COVID-19 symptoms. Patients were divided into those with (n=70) and those without (n=116) persistent dyspnea. Independent t-tests and Fisher's Exact test were used where appropriate to compare anthropometric, pulmonary function, symptoms, and 6MWT variables. Results: There was no difference in the time of experimental testing relative to the onset of acute COVID-19 symptoms between those with vs. those without dyspnea (5913 vs. 6014 days, respectively). Groups had similar age, height, mass, body mass index, sex, and frequency of comorbidities. Patients with persistent dyspnea had significantly lower FVC (p=0.03), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (p=0.04), and DLCO (p=0.01) compared to non-dyspnea patients. 47% of patients with persistent dyspnea had a restrictive pattern on spirometry compared to 33% in the non-dyspnea group. Patients with persistent dyspnea also had lower 6MWD (% predicted, p=0.03) and nadir oxygen saturation (p&lt;0.001), and higher Borg 0-10 ratings of dyspnea and fatigue (both p&lt;0.001) during the 6MWT compared to patients without persistent dyspnea. Conclusions: We have shown that dyspnea is a common persistent symptom across varying degrees of initial COVID-19 severity. Patients with persistent dyspnea had a number of abnormalities compared to well-matched patients without persistent dyspnea, including greater restriction on spirometry, lower DLCO, reduced functional capacity, and increased desaturation and exertional symptoms during a 6MWT. This suggests that there is a true physiological mechanism that may explain persistent dyspnea after COVID-19.","output":"Pulmonary Function and Functional Capacity in COVID19 Survivors with and Without Persistent Dyspnea in a Mexican Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Messenger RNA (mRNA) has emerged as a critical global technology that requires global joint efforts from different entities to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. However, the chemical properties of RNA pose a challenge in utilizing mRNA as a vaccine candidate. For instance, the molecules are prone to degradation, which has a negative impact on the distribution of mRNA among patients. In addition, little is known of the degradation properties of individual RNA bases in a molecule. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether a hybrid deep learning can predict RNA degradation from RNA sequences. Two deep hybrid neural network models were proposed, namely GCN_GRU and GCN_CNN. The first model is based on graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). The second model is based on GCN and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Both models were computed over the structural graph of the mRNA molecule. The experimental results showed that GCN_GRU hybrid model outperform GCN_CNN model by a large margin during the test time. Validation of proposed hybrid models is performed by well-known evaluation measures. Among different deep neural networks, GCN_GRU based model achieved best scores on both public and private MCRMSE test scores with 0.22614 and 0.34152, respectively. Finally, GCN_GRU pre-trained model has achieved the highest AuC score of 0.938. Such proven outperformance of GCNs indicates that modeling RNA molecules using graphs is critical in understanding molecule degradation mechanisms, which helps in minimizing the aforementioned issues.

The paired-sample t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were included with a mean age of 56.9 (SD 14.2) years and mean symptoms onset of 27.1 (SD 14.3) months. ALSFRS-R mean scores decayed significantly over time when comparing T0-T1 (0.26  0.38) and T1-T2 (1.36  1.43) slopes (p < 0.001). Significant differences were observed between T1 and T2 for ALSSQOL-SF scores (115.31  17.06 vs. 104.31  20.65), especially in four specific domains, and FSS scores (34.06  16.84 vs. 40.09  17.63).

In such difficult time, both national and international societies of thrombosis and hemostasis released prompt and timely responses to guide recognition and management of COVID-19-related coagulopathy. However, latest guidelines released by the international Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) on May 27, 2020, followed the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) on June 2, 2020 showed some discrepancies regarding thromboprophylaxis use. In this forum article, we would like to offer an updated focus on thromboprophylaxis with current incidence of VTE in ICU and non-ICU patients according to recent published studies; highlight the main differences regarding ISTH and CHEST guidelines; summarize and describe which are the key ongoing RCTs testing different anticoagulation strategies in patients with COVID-19; and finally set a proposal for COVID-19 coagulopathy specific risk factors and dedicated trials.","output":"Thromboprophylaxis: balancing evidence and experience during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mental health issues are among the most common health issues nowadays, with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) being the most common neurobehavioral disorder affecting children and adolescents. ADHD is a heterogeneous disease affecting patients in various cognitive domains that play a key role in daily life, academic development, and social abilities. Furthermore, ADHD affects not only patients but also their families and their whole environment. Although the main treatment is based on pharmacotherapy, combined therapies including cognitive training and psychological therapy are often recommended. In this paper, we propose a user-centered application called Alien Attack for cognitive training of children with ADHD, based on working memory, inhibitory control, and reaction-time tasks, to be used as a non-pharmacological complement for ADHD treatment in order to potentiate the patients executive functions (EFs) and promote some beneficial effects of therapy.","output":"Alien Attack: A Non-Pharmaceutical Complement for ADHD Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance Little is known about the extent to which secondhand exposure to household firearms is associated with risk of suicide in adults who do not own guns, most of whom are women. Objective To evaluate changes in risk of suicide among women living in gun-free households after one of their cohabitants became a handgun owner. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study observed participants for up to 12 years and 2 months from October 18, 2004, to December 31, 2016. Data were analyzed from April to November 2021. The study population included 9.5 million adult women in California who did not own guns and who entered the study while living with 1 or more adults in a handgun-free home. Exposures Secondhand exposure to household handguns. Main Outcomes and Measures Suicide, firearm suicide, nonfirearm suicide. Results Of 9.5 million women living in handgun-free homes, 331 968 women (3.5% of the study population; mean [SD] age, 41.6 [18.0] years) became exposed to household handguns during the study period. In the entire study population, 294 959 women died: 2197 (1%) of these were by suicide, 337 (15%) of which were suicides by firearm. Rates of suicide by any method during follow-up were higher among cohort members residing with handgun owners compared with those residing in handgun-free homes (hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.11-1.84). The excess suicide rate was accounted for by higher rates of suicide by firearm (hazard ratio, 4.32; 95% CI, 2.89-6.46). Women in households with and without handguns had similar rates of suicide by nonfirearm methods (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.63-1.27). Conclusions and Relevance In this study, the rate of suicide among women was significantly higher after a cohabitant of theirs became a handgun owner compared with the rate observed while they lived in handgun-free homes.","output":"Suicide Deaths Among Women in California Living With Handgun Owners vs Those Living With Other Adults in Handgun-Free Homes, 2004-2016."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The investigation of topological properties of ovarian cancer network (OCN) and the roles of hubs involved in it by digging the network at various levels of organization are important to understand how OCN is organized to understand disease states.

Also, the network properties at all levels of organization obey one parameter scaling law which lacks centrality lethality rule. We then showed that $\\\\langle k\\\\rangle$ can be taken as a scaling parameter, where, power law exponent can be estimated from the ratio of network diameters, $\\\\lambda=1+\\\\rho\\\\left[\\\\frac{d_c}{d_k}\\\\right]$. The betweenness centrality shows two distinct behaviors one shown by high degree hubs and the other by segregated low degree nodes.

We used 3 different conformations of protease target (6M0K, 6Y2F and 7BQY) and two different score functions to strengthen the probability of inhibitors discovery. After an extensive screening analysis, 20 compounds exhibit good binding affinities to one or both COVID-19 targets. 7 out of 20 compounds were predicted to overcome the activity of both targets. The top 7 hits are, flacourticin (3), sagerinic acid (16), hordatine A (23), hordatine B (24), N-feruloyl tyramine dimer (25), bisavenanthramides B-5 (29) and vulnibactins (40).

This study aimed to systematically evaluate and meta-analyze the comparison of diagnostic accuracy of CBBCT and DBT to characterize breast cancers. Methods: Two independent reviewers identified screening on diagnostic studies from 1 January 2015 to 30 December 2021, with at least reported sensitivity and specificity for both CBBCT and DBT. A univariate pooled meta-analysis was performed using the random-effects model to estimate the sensitivity and specificity while other diagnostic parameters like the area under the ROC curve (AUC), positive likelihood ratio ([Formula: see text]), and negative likelihood ratio ([Formula: see text]) were estimated using the bivariate model. Results: The pooled sensitivity specificity, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] and AUC at 95% confidence interval are 86.7% (80.3C91.2), 87.0% (79.9C91.8), 6.28 (4.40C8.96), 0.17 (0.12C0.25) and 0.925 for the 17 included studies in DBT arm, respectively, while, 83.7% (54.6C95.7), 71.3% (47.5C87.2), 2.71 (1.39C5.29), 0.20 (0.04C1.05), and 0.831 are the pooled sensitivity specificity, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] and AUC for the five studies in the CBBCT arm, respectively.

The success of formally recognized course-embedded mentoring depends on adequate preparation of clinical teacher to act as mentors and effective developing of their mentoring skills. The aim of this study was to evaluate a Mentor Training Program for midwives, the first of its kind in Poland. METHODS: Twenty-one midwives who completed a dedicated Mentor Training Program organized by the Medical University of Warsaw (12C14 June 2017) participated in this study. In Stage 1, 7 days prior to the training course, the participants completed an online questionnaire that identified their motivations and expectations. In Stage 2, they assessed the training program they had completed as well as described any perceived needs of further mentor training. Subsequently a qualitative study of the data was performed using content analysis. RESULTS: In Stage 1, the participants expressed their interest in the Mentor Training Program mostly expecting to develop skills allowing them to implement mentoring in clinical training of student midwives. They were aware of the potential benefits of mentoring for hands-on instruction on the wards and wanted to gain knowledge of this strategy. In Stage 2, the overall satisfaction with the program was high, but the participants assessed their preparedness to act as midwifery mentors as inadequate. The results suggest that the Mentor Training Program should be further refined and expanded while the outcomes need to be evaluated in more detail by both new mentors and their trainers over a longer period of time, possibly after the participants have gained actual experience of mentoring in the clinical setting. CONCLUSION: The participants described the Mentor Training Program as innovative, valuable and largely meeting their expectations. They gained knowledge of the concept of mentoring and its potential application in clinical training of midwifery students in Poland.

During the Fall 2020 and 2021 semesters, one model of hybrid online flipped learning was applied to an introduction to biochemistry lecture course. Normal classroom lectures were turned into voice-over PowerPoint videos. Students were expected to have watched the lecture videos before coming to class. After gaining experience with the flipped classroom and social distancing model, student learning shifted from passive to active engagement by applying their knowledge during in person classroom activities including question response, board problems, 3D molecular modeling kits, and think pair share exercises. Students self-reported that they liked the flexibility of watching the lecture videos before class and the ability to rewind and pause the videos. Students also commented in student evaluations that the in-class activities and practice problems were helpful in applying their understanding. Compared to the previous six years, the withdrawal rate heavily decreased in Fall 2020 using this flipped learning style decreasing from a usual 30% to 10%.

Rapid, specific, simple, and point-of-need molecular detection of the virus is crucial to enable chicken farms to take timely action and contain the spread of infection. The current study describes an isothermal amplification assay for infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) infection and the implementation of this assay in a microfluidic chip suitable for molecular detection and quasi-quantification of ILTV in diagnostic veterinary laboratories with low resources and poultry farms. Our assay performance was compared and favorably agreed with quantitative PCR (qPCR). Clinical tests of our assay and chip with samples from diseased chickens demonstrated good concordance with the gold-standard benchtop qPCR assay. ABSTRACT: Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is a viral disease of chickens respiratory system that imposes considerable financial burdens on the chicken industry. Rapid, simple, and specific detection of this virus is crucial to enable proper control measures. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular tests require relatively expensive instruments and skilled personnel, confining their application to centralized laboratories. To enable chicken farms to take timely action and contain the spread of infection, we describe a rapid, simple, semi-quantitative benchtop isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, and a field-deployable microfluidic device for the diagnosis of ILTV infection in chickens. Our assay performance was compared and favorably agreed with quantitative PCR (qPCR). The sensitivity of our real-time LAMP test is 250 genomic copies/reaction. Clinical performance of our microfluidic device using samples from diseased chickens showed 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity in comparison with benchtop LAMP assay and the gold-standard qPCR.

Timely diagnosis and treatment are therefore prudent. While managing patients with flaccid paralysis, physicians should be aware of TPP as potential etiology and investigate history to identify the triggering factors and provide timely and cautious treatment with replacement of potassium, further addressing permanent approaches to treating thyrotoxicosis to prevent future recurrences of TPP. We report a clinical scenario of a patient who experienced TPP.22-year-old male, laying down at home at around 1:45pm developed sudden onset bilateral lower extremity weakness and was unable to stand up. His weakness was associated with thigh pain with exertion. He was eventually able to walk a few steps, but then fell onto his knees. He reported having a carbohydrate rich lunch at noon. Notably, patient underwent surgery under general anesthesia for a deviated nasal septum the day before. His neurological examination was remarkable for giveaway proximal lower extremity weakness involving only select muscle groups. Examination and CT/CTA of head and neck findings was not consistent with acute stroke. Myopathy secondary to electrolyte imbalance, drug/toxin, infection, or inflammatory disorders, myelopathy and myasthenia gravis were considered in the differential. Labs revealed suppressed TSH <0.01uIU/mL, elevated FT4 of 6ng/dL and low serum potassium of 2.6mmol/L. CT scan of the neck revealed enlarged thyroid gland and thymic enlargement. Patient was given intravenous bolus of potassium chloride 20 mEq and serum potassium normalized in 4 hours to 3.8mmol/L. His lower extremity weakness resolved within 3hours of potassium replacement. The next day his serum potassium was 5.2mmol/L. His thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin index was elevated at 1.4 (normal <1.3). He was started on propranolol, methimazole and advised to return to the endocrinology clinic to discuss permanent treatment options for hyperthyroidism to prevent TPP. Reviewing his prior medical history, he was diagnosed with Graves disease 5 months prior to the emergency room evaluation and was started on methimazole. He took methimazole for 2 months and did not return to follow up until the occurrence of TPP. He did not experience symptoms of hyperthyroidism in the interim. Discussion: TPP is a rare disorder with a prevalence of 0.1-0.2% in North America. TPP commonly affects Asian and Latin Americans males. The episodes of TPP are influenced by genetic, environmental, and ethnic factors. Common environmental triggers include carbohydrate rich meals, rest after intense physical exertion, fever, infection, trauma, emotional stress, and smoking. Thymic hyperplasia has also been reported to be associated with hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Clinical Presentation: The motor weakness tends to affect proximal lower extremities as noted in our patients presentation and is usually associated with hyporeflexia and is painless. Cardiac arrhythmias due to hypokalemia are rare, though ventricular fibrillation have been reported, and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation is a possibility. Pathophysiology: TPP has been thought to be a channelopathy associated with increased Na(+)CK(+) ATPase activity and loss of function mutation of the Kir 2.6 potassium efflux channel resulting in intracellular pooling of potassium and transient hypokalemia. The attacks are stimulated by thyroid hormone excess and/or hyperadrenergic activity and hyperinsulinemia, most commonly due to carbohydrate load or intravenous fluids containing dextrose. Treatment should include:1.Potassium supplementation to reverse paralysis and prevent life threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Care must be taken to not over replace potassium, as it could result in hyperkalemia when potassium channels revert to functioning normally.2.Propranolol, a non-selective betablocker works by blocking the thyroid hormone mediated adrenergic overstimulation of the Na-K ATPase channel, there by limiting the intracellular pooling of potassium.3.Definitive treatment of thyrotoxicosis should be offered. Studies comparing various modalities of treatment of thyrotoxicosis in the setting of TPP indicate permanent treatment with either radioactive iodine or thyroidectomy are often successful in preventing recurrence of TPP, as relapse events are higher in treatment with antithyroid drugs. Caution should be taken to prevent surge of thyroid hormone release following radioactive iodine treatment, as this can trigger TPP. Higher doses of radioactive iodine might be required to render hypothyroidism and prevent TPP recurrences. There is one case report of hypokalemic periodic paralysis associated with thymic hyperplasia that was treated with thymectomy. Our patient had multiple triggers leading to periodic paralysis, including a prior untreated Graves disease due to non-adherence to treatment during COVID-19 pandemic, general anesthesia for nasal septal surgery the day before presenting with TPP, having a carbohydrate rich meal one hour before the episode, and thymic enlargement on neck CT scan. He responded well to potassium replacement, and propranolol. He was started on methimazole and offered permanent treatment options to address hyperthyroidism.

METHODS A retrospective study was conducted of 5 women (age range, 45-55years) with stage I vaginal carcinoma who underwent surgery at Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China, between January 4, 2009, and December 30, 2011. All participants had lesions in the upper third of the vagina and wished to retain sexual function. Patients underwent radical hysterectomy and vaginectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy, followed by sigmoid vaginoplasty for vaginal reconstruction. RESULTS The mean operative time was 248.039.6minutes and the mean intraoperative blood loss was 335.076.6mL. All patients recovered well after surgery and no delayed complications or recurrence were experienced during a mean follow-up of 22.89.98months. None of the patients developed vaginal stenosis and all were satisfied with their postoperative sexuality. The mean Female Sexual Function Index was 28.01.92. CONCLUSION Radical hysterectomy and vaginectomy with sigmoid vaginoplasty was a reasonable option for patients with stage I vaginal carcinoma who wished to retain sexual function after surgery.","output":"Radical hysterectomy and vaginectomy with sigmoid vaginoplasty for stage I vaginal carcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Older adults and those with pre-existing medical conditions are at risk of death from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). In this period of quarantine, one of the reasons for going out is physical activity. This issue is important, as the impact of a sedentary lifestyle might be lower for children and young adults, but is far more severe for older adults. Although older adults need to stay at home because they have a higher risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), they need to avoid a sedentary lifestyle. Physical activity is important for older adults, especially to maintain their level of independence, mental health, and well-being. Maintaining mobility in old age is necessary, as it may predict loss of independence in older adults. OBJECTIVE: Our first objective was to evaluate the impact of this quarantine period on physical activity programs and on the physical and mental health of older adults. Our second objective was to discuss alternatives to physical activity programs that could be suggested for this population to avoid a sedentary lifestyle. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative survey using semistructured interviews with professionals (managers in charge of physical activity programs for older adults and sports trainers who run these physical activity programs) from the French Federation of Physical Education and Voluntary Gymnastics (FFPEVG) and older adults participating in a physical activity program of the FFPEVG. We followed a common interview guide. For analysis, we carried out a thematic analysis of the interviews. RESULTS: This study suggests that the COVID-19 epidemic has affected, before quarantine measures, the number of seniors attending group physical activity programs in the two study territories. In addition, despite the decline in their participation in group physical activities before the quarantine, older adults expressed the need to perform physical activity at home. There is a need to help older adults integrate simple and safe ways to stay physically active in a limited space. A national policy to support older adults for physical activity at home appears essential in this context. CONCLUSIONS: Given the results of our study, it seems necessary to globally communicate how important it is for older adults to maintain physical activity at home. We are concerned about the level of independence and mental health state of older adults after the end of quarantine if there is no appropriate campaign to promote physical activity among them at home.","output":"Impact of Home Quarantine on Physical Activity Among Older Adults Living at Home During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Qualitative Interview Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with portopulmonary hypertension (POPH) have an increased cardiovascular and overall mortality risk when undergoing liver transplant (LT). However, such risk is not captured within their Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) laboratory score. The POPH MELD exception was established in 2006 with the aim of prioritizing these patients for LT prior to pulmonary hypertension (PH) progression and eventual right heart failure. The original criteria emphasized a post-treatment, pre-LT mean pulmonary arterial (mPAP) pressure of < 35 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) < 400 dynes*sec/cm5 or < 5 Wood units. Since 2006, there have been important advances in treatment of POPH with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) targeted therapies and newer evidence regarding LT outcomes and risk factors for perioperative mortality. Specifically, PVR rather than mPAP has been shown to be more strongly associated with outcomes, including mortality. Additionally, among treated patients with POPH, mPAP may be persistently elevated related to an elevated cardiac output or other factors that do not necessarily reflect POPH disease severity. Thus, in February 2021, the Organ Procurement Transplantation Network (OPTN) approved proposed modifications to POPH MELD exception criteria, now allowing either of the following post-treatment, pre-LT hemodynamic profiles: mPAP less than 35 mmHg and post-treatment PVR less than 400 dynes*sec/cm5 (or less than 5 WU) or mPAP greater than or equal to 35 mmHg and less than 45 mmHg and post-treatment PVR less than 240 dynes*sec/cm5 (or less than 3 WU). This article reviews the history of the POPH MELD exception, describes the recent modifications to the exception criteria and the evidence supporting them, and also highlights unanswered questions and areas for future research.","output":"Mending the MELD: An in-depth review of the past, present, and future portopulmonary hypertension MELD exception"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The present study was performed to comparatively evaluate the peri-implant bone stability and conditions of marginal tissues at 3 years following transcrestal and lateral sinus floor elevation (tSFE and lSFE, respectively). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients included in a parallel-arm randomized trial comparatively evaluating tSFE and lSFE were recalled at 3 years post-surgery. Twenty-one and 24 patients in tSFE and lSFE groups, respectively, participated in the follow-up visit. Peri-implant bone support was evaluated as the proportion of the entire implant surface in direct contact with the radiopaque area (totCON%) on 3-year periapical radiographs. The conditions of the marginal peri-implant tissues at 3-year visit were classified as peri-implant health, peri-implant mucositis, or peri-implantitis. RESULTS: At 3 years, both groups showed an implant survival rate of 100%. Median totCON% was stable at 3 years, being 100% in both groups (p = 0.124). Peri-implant health and mucositis were diagnosed in 10 (47.6%) and 11 (52.4%) patients, respectively, in the tSFE group, and in 8 (33.3%) and 16 (66.7%) subjects, respectively, in the lSFE group (p = 0.502). CONCLUSIONS: At 3 years following surgery, implants placed concomitantly with tSFE and lSFE fully maintain peri-implant bone support. Peri-implant mucositis was the most prevalent condition, with a similar prevalence between groups. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Based on 3-year data on peri-implant bone support and prevalence of peri-implant diseases, the study suggests that tSFE and lSFE represent two equally valid options for the rehabilitation of the posterior maxilla.

Both the tumor and its treatment can lead to significant neurological and endocrinological complications. Due to the essential role of the hypothalamus in the complex neurophysiologic process of sleep, tumors involving the hypothalamic area may be responsible for disturbances in sleepCwake regulation with alterations in the circadian rhythm, sleep fragmentation, and increased daytime sleepiness. We report two cases of patients with craniopharyngioma, who came to our attention due to the occurrence of episodes characterized by psychomotor slowing and afinalistic limb movements, temporal and spatial disorientation, psychomotor agitation, and oneiric stupor like episodes. A comprehensive clinical data collection and a targeted diagnostic work-up led to a diagnosis of severe sleep disorder characterized by hypersomnia, altered sleepCwake rhythm, and sleep-related breathing disorder. In addition, the polysomnography revealed peculiar alterations in the sleep structure. The diagnostic work-up lead to an accurate differential diagnosis between epileptic seizures and episodes expressions of sleep disturbances. These clinical features can be challenging to diagnose and can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. Diagnosis of sleep disorders is crucial, considering the impact of sleep on general health, cognition, and neuropsychological functioning.

TRPM8 expression has been found in gut mucosal, submucosal, and muscular nerve endings. Although TRPM8 plays a role in pathological conditions, being involved in visceral pain and inflammation, the physiological functions in the digestive system remain unclear as yet. The aims of the present study were: (i) to verify the TRPM8 expression in human distal colon; (ii) to examine the effects of TRPM8 activation on colonic contractility; (iii) to characterize the mechanism of action. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting were used to analyze TRPM8 expression. The responses of human colon circular strips to different TRPM8 agonists [1-[Dialkyl-phosphinoyl]-alkane (DAPA) 2C5, 1-[Diisopropyl-phosphinoyl]-alkane (DIPA) 1C7, DIPA 1C8, DIPA 1C9, DIPA 1C10, and DIPA 1C12) were recorded using a vertical organ bath. The biomolecular analysis revealed gene and protein expression of TRPM8 in both mucosal and smooth muscle layers. All the agonists tested, except-DIPA 1C12, produced a concentration-dependent decrease in spontaneous contraction amplitude. The effect was significantly antagonized by 5-benzyloxytryptamine, a TRPM8 antagonist. The DIPA 1C8 agonist resulted in the most efficacious and potent activation among the tested molecules. The DIPA 1C8 effects were not affected by tetrodotoxin, a neural blocker, but they were significantly reduced by tetraethylammonium chloride, a non-selective blocker of K(+) channels. Moreover, iberiotoxin, a blocker of the large-conductance Ca(2+)-dependent K(+)-channels, but not apamin, a blocker of small-conductance Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) channels, significantly reduced the inhibitory DIPA 1C8 actions. The results of the present study demonstrated that TRPM8 receptors are also expressed in human distal colon in healthy conditions and that ligand-dependent TRPM8 activation is able to reduce the colonic spontaneous motility, probably by the opening of the large-conductance Ca(2+)-dependent K(+)-channels.","output":"TRPM8 Channel Activation Reduces the Spontaneous Contractions in Human Distal Colon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The grower-finisher stage accounts for 64% of the total on-farm herd water use.

Pigs (n = 672), 11 weeks of age (77  2 days) were used for the experiment. The effect of group size: SMALL (12 pigs), MEDIUM (24 pigs), and LARGE (48 pigs) was assessed across two levels of enrichment (LOWwooden post, hanging rubber toy, HIGHSame as LOW + fresh grass). There was no effect of group size on water use or wastage. Pigs with HIGH enrichment (10.4  0.4 L/pig/day) used less water than LOW enrichment (11.0  0.4 L/pig/day; p < 0.001). The water wastage/drinker/hour was lower in pens with HIGH enrichment than LOW (p = 0.003). The drinking bout number (p = 0.037) and total occupancy/hour (p = 0.048) was also higher for pens with LOW than HIGH enrichment. Aggressive and harmful behaviour were performed less in LARGE groups and pens with HIGH enrichment.

The focus of this book is on climate change, but other hazards help to better illustrate and understand EWS in the context of climate change. These include hazards which manifest rapidly, such as tsunamis, as well as creeping hazards which manifest slowly, such as drought. The fundamental tenet is that each EWS needs to be viewed as a social process which often involves technical components embedded in their social context. That leads to a preference for a First Mile approach for designing EWS, which involves communities from the beginning of developing an EWS, rather than a Last Mile approach, which adds people and communities towards the end of the design process. By keeping people and communities at the centre of an EWS from the beginning, the EWS can contribute to daily life and livelihoods, thereby supporting wider disaster risk reduction and sustainable development endeavours, rather than being a separate system waiting to be triggered only when a hazard appears. Yet any EWS has limitations. Those limitations need to be recognised and overcome through other approaches, with possibilities being to consider medium warning and late warning systems rather than just early warning.","output":"Early Warning Systems Defined"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has become pandemic.

We focus on common chronic inflammatory skin diseases with complex immunological pathogenesis: psoriasis, eczema including atopic dermatitis, type I allergies, autoimmune blistering and inflammatory connective tissue diseases, vasculitis, and skin cancers. Since several other inflammatory skin diseases display related or comparable immunological reactions, clustering of the various inflammatory dermatoses into different disease patterns may help with therapeutic decisions.

To contribute to future COVID-19 countermeasures, we aimed at verifying the results of countermeasures achieved by public health centers (PHCs) against the first wave of COVID-19 in Yamagata Prefecture, Japan. During January-May 2020, 1,253 patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection were invited for testing. Simultaneously, based on retrospective contact tracings, PHCs investigated the infection sources and transmission routes of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and tested 928 contacts. Consequently, 69 cases were confirmed during March 31 - May 4, 58 (84.1%; 95% confidence interval 75.5-92.7) of whom were found from contacts. The spread of infection was triggered by cases harboring epidemiological links outside of Yamagata. Then, the number of cases increased rapidly. However, PHCs identified epidemiological links in 61 (88.4%; 95% confidence interval 80.8-96.0) of the 69 cases and transmission chains up to the fifth generation. Finally, the spread of infection ended after approximately one month.

This study examines the direct effects of COVID-19 on the delivery of inpatient care in Croatia. Materials and Methods: The research is a retrospective, comparative analysis of the hospital admission rate across all Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) classes before and during the pandemic. It is based on DRG data from all non-specialized acute hospitals in Croatia, which account for 96% of national inpatient activity. The study also used COVID-19 data from the Croatian Institute of Public Health (CIPH). Results: The results show a 21% decrease in the total number of admissions [incident rate ratio (IRR) 0.8, p < 0.0001] across the hospital network during the pandemic in 2020, with the greatest drop occurring in April, when admissions plunged by 51%. The decrease in activity occurred in non-elective DRG classes such as cancers, stroke, major chest procedures, heart failure, and renal failure. Coinciding with this reduction however, there was a 37% increase (IRR 1.39, p < 0.0001) in case activity across six COVID-19 related DRG classes. Conclusions: The reduction in hospital inpatient activity during 2020, can be attributed to a number of factors such as lock-downs and quarantining, reorganization of hospital operations, the rationing of the medical workforce, and the reluctance of people to seek hospital care. Further research is needed to examine the consequences of disruption to hospital care in Croatia.

The incidence of COVID-19 myocarditis is still not clear as a wide range of figures have been quoted in the literature; however, it seems that the risk of developing myocarditis increases with more severe infection. Furthermore, the administration of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine has been associated with the development of myocarditis, particularly after the second dose. COVID-19 myocarditis has a wide variety of presentations, ranging from dyspnea and chest pain to acute heart failure and possibly death. It is important to catch any cases of myocarditis, particularly those presenting with fulminant myocarditis which can be characterized by signs of heart failure and arrythmias. Initial work up for suspected myocarditis should include serial troponins and electrocardiograms. If myocardial damage is detected in these tests, further screening should be carried out. Cardiac magnetic resonance imagining and endomyocardial biopsy are the most useful tests for myocarditis. Treatment for COVID-19 myocarditis is still controversial; however, the use of intravenous immunoglobulins and corticosteroids in combination may be effective, particularly in cases of fulminant myocarditis.

The purpose of our project was to interview Indigenous doulas across Canada in order to document how they worked through the logistics of providing doula care and to discern their main challenges and innovations. POPULATION/SETTING: Our paper analyzes interviews conducted with members of five Indigenous doula collectives across Canada, from the provinces of British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with members of the five Indigenous doula collectives across Canada in 2020 as part of the project, She Walks With Me: Supporting Urban Indigenous Expectant Mothers Through Culturally Based Doulas. Interview transcripts were approved by participants and subsequently coded by the entire research team to identify key themes. RESULTS: Our paper examines two themes that emerged in interviews: the main challenges Indigenous doulas describe confronting when working within western systems, and how they navigate and overcome these obstacles. Specifically, interview participants described tensions with the biomedical approach to maternal healthcare and conflicts with the practice of Indigenous infant apprehension. In response to these challenges, Indigenous doulas are working to develop Indigenous-specific doula training curricula, engaging in collective problem-solving, and advocating for the reformation of a grant program in order to fund more Indigenous doulas. CONCLUSIONS: Both the biomedical model of maternal healthcare and the crisis of Indigenous infant apprehension renders Canadian hospitals unsafe and uncomfortable spaces for many Indigenous birthing people and their families. Indigenous doulas are continually navigating these challenges and creatively and concertedly working towards the revitalization of Indigenous birthing care.

To better understand the mechanisms and moderators of child mental health during the pandemic, the current study tested two moderated mediation models in which parent depression and anxiety indirectly impacted child internalizing and externalizing problems through negative effects on multiple parenting variables, with these associations moderated by families exposure to COVID-19-stressors. A national sample representative of U.S. parents (N = 796, 48.2% female, M(age) = 38.87 years, 60.3% Non-Hispanic white, 18.1% Hispanic/Latinx, 13.2% Non-Hispanic Black/African-American, 5.7% Asian, 2.8% Other Race) completed a cross-sectional online survey in February-April 2021.

Parent depression/anxiety was directly and indirectly associated with child internalizing and externalizing problems. For both internalizing and externalizing problems, indirect associations occurred by means of increased parent hostility and inconsistent discipline and decreased routines and parent supportiveness. There were also specific indirect effects through decreased monitoring (internalizing problems) and parenting self-efficacy (externalizing problems). Multiple indirect effects were moderated by number of COVID-19-stressors experienced. Notably, COVID-19-stressors did not have direct effects on child mental health when other variables were considered. Findings highlight the buffering effects of parents for child mental health, the need to address parent depression/anxiety in child interventions, the utility of existing evidence-based parent interventions during the pandemic, and the need to assess families level of exposure to COVID-19-stressors.

Viral genomic sequencing has shown that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) found on ciliated epithelial cells of the human lungs as its specific receptor. Neutralizing antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein were detected in patients recovered from COVID-19; however, both T cells and NK cells were reduced in severe cases. Excessive and uncontrolled releases of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1B, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF&#945;) were increased in severe patients.

This study aims to conduct an in-depth analysis by geographic strata: Wuhan City (hereafter referred to as Wuhan) only, Hubei Province (hereafter referred to as Hubei) excluding Wuhan, and China excluding Hubei. METHODS: Daily cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases between December 8, 2019 (the date of symptom onset based on patients recall), and March 1, 2020, from official sources and published studies were analyzed. The second derivative model was used for information extraction. Data analysis was conducted separately for the three strata. RESULTS: A total of 80 026 diagnosed COVID-19 cases were reported during the first 85 days of the epidemic, with 49 315 cases from Wuhan, 17 788 from Hubei excluding Wuhan, and 12 923 from China excluding Hubei. Analytical results indicate that the COVID-19 epidemic consists of an Acceleration, a Deceleration, and a Stabilization Phase in all three geographic strata, plus a Silent Attack Phase for Wuhan only. Given the reported incubation period of 14 days, effects of the massive anti-epidemic actions were revealed by both the Acceleration and Deceleration Phases. The Acceleration Phase signaled the effect of the intervention to detect the infected; the Deceleration Phase signaled the declines in new infections after the infected were detected, treated and quarantined. CONCLUSION: Findings of the study provide new evidence to better monitor the epidemic, evaluate its response to intervention, and predict the trend long. In addition to re-evaluating the control of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, this study provided a model for monitoring outbreaks of COVID-19 in different countries across the world.","output":"Dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan City, Hubei Province and China: a second derivative analysis of the cumulative daily diagnosed cases during the first 85 days"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Alarming rates of anxiety and burnout in pre-clinical health profession trainees are now challenged by additional COVID-19 stressors This study explored COVID-related stressors among first-year medical, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, and veterinary medical students The authors examined associations between resilience, news monitoring, and COVID stress METHODS: Students completed an online questionnaire that included the Brief Resilience Scale at their matriculation in August 2019 Survey results were linked to demographic information collected by all schools A follow-up survey in May 2020 included original questions on COVID-19 stressors and news monitoring Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and multivariable linear regression models RESULTS: Across schools, 74% (266/360) provided consent for the 2019 survey, and 76% (201/264) responded to COVID-19 questions in the follow-up 2020 survey Students were \\"extremely\\" or \\"very\\" concerned about family members getting infected (n = 71, 76% School of Medicine (SOM);n = 31, 76% School of Nursing (SON);n = 50, 75% School of Veterinary Medicine (SVM)) and curriculum schedule changes (n = 72, 78%, SOM;n = 28, 68% SON;n = 52, 79% SVM) Greater frequency of COVID news monitoring was associated with greater COVID-related stress (p = 0 02) Higher resilience at matriculation was associated with lower COVID-related stress ten months later (p &lt; 0 001) CONCLUSIONS: Amid COVID-19 uncertainty, health science schools should address the immense student stress regarding curriculum disruptions The results of this study underscore the powerful role of resilience in protecting against stress not only during the known academic rigor of health professions training but also during unprecedented crises","output":"Exploring the Relationships Between Resilience and News Monitoring with COVID Distress in Health Profession Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current development around the pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents a significant healthcare resource burden threatening to overwhelm the available nationwide healthcare infrastructure. It is essential to consider, especially for resource-limited nations, strategizing the coordinated response to handle this crisis effectively and preparing for the upcoming emergence of calamity caused by this yet-to-know disease entity. Relevant epidemiological data were retrieved from currently available online reports related to COVID-19 patients. The correlation coefficient was calculated by plotting dependant variables - the number of COVID-19 cases and the number of deaths due to COVID 19 on the Y-axis and independent variables - critical-care beds per capita, the median age of the population of the country, the number of COVID-19 tests per million population, population density (persons per square km), urban population percentage, and gross domestic product (GDP) expense on health care - on the X-axis. After analyzing the data, both the fatality rate and the total number of COVID-19 cases were found to have an inverse association with the population density with the variable - the number of cases of COVID-19 - achieving a statistical significance (p-value 0.01). The negative correlation between critical care beds and the fatality rate is well-justified, as intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators are the critical elements in the management of complicated cases. There was also a significant positive correlation between GDP expenses on healthcare by a country and the number of COVID-19 cases being registered (p-value 0.008), although that did not affect mortality (p-value 0.851).

The current standard in these patients is acetylsalicylic acid, despite high prevalence of yet undetected paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Aim The ATTICUS randomized trial is designed to determine whether the factor Xa inhibitor apixaban administered within 7 days after embolic stroke of undetermined source, is superior to acetylsalicylic acid for prevention of new ischemic lesions documented by brain magnetic resonance imaging within 12 months after index stroke. Design Prospective, randomized, blinded, parallel-group, open-label, German multicenter phase III trial in approximately 500 patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source. A key inclusion criterion is the presence or the planned implantation of an insertable cardiac monitor. Patients are 1:1 randomized to apixaban or acetylsalicylic acid and treated for a 12-month period. It is an event-driven trial aiming for core-lab adjudicated primary outcome events. Study outcomes The primary outcome is the occurrence of at least one new ischemic lesion identified by axial T2-weighted FLAIR magnetic resonance imaging and/or axial DWI magnetic resonance imaging at 12 months when compared with the baseline magnetic resonance imaging. Key secondary outcomes are the combination of recurrent ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes, systemic embolism; combination of MACE including recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death and combination of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding defined according to ISTH, and change of cognitive function and quality of life (EQ-5D, Stroke Impact Scale).

We sought to determine the dynamics of pharmaceutical company drug sales revenue, market capitalization and payments to physicians during the pandemic, focusing on payments to so-called key opinion leaders (KOLs). Methods: We analyzed the CMS Open Payments data of 15 top pharmaceutical company general payments to US physicians. We calculated total payments per year for all physicians, KOLs and 2018 KOLs in subsequent years. Drug-related fold changes in payments, drug revenues and company market capitation were calculated using Q1-2018 as reference. Yearly differences in payments, drug sales revenue and market capitalization were tested using generalized estimation equations (GEE). A double-sided p<0.05 was considered significant. Results: The analyzed dataset comprised 8,563,872 payments to 382,779 physicians. In 2020, we observed a reduction in payments to physicians and KOLs compared to prior years. The total amount per KOL physician per company also decreased for each year for KOLs and the 2018 KOLs in the subsequent years. Payments per drug, but neither drug revenues nor pharmaceutical company market capitalization, followed a downward trend in 2020 compared to prior years. GEE analysis confirmed that, compared to 2018, the decrease in payments to KOLs overall and for the top drugs of each company was statistically significant. Yet, no significant differences in drug sales revenue and market capitalization was observed. Conclusions: A substantial and significant reduction in payments to KOLs during the first fiscal year of the COVID-19 pandemic was not associated with a reduction in drug sales revenue of blockbuster drug products and the market capitalization of 15 top pharmaceutical companies. Overall, these findings suggest that a substantial part of pharmaceutical payments to KOLs do not appear to impact top drug sales revenues.","output":"Payments to key opinion leader physicians and drug sales of top pharmaceutical companies during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The objective of this review is to complete a global synthesis of the evidence on occupational therapy services provided in non-urban areas. INTRODUCTION Worldwide, non-urban populations experience higher levels of disease, mortality, and disease risk factors, yet most health services, including occupational therapy, are disproportionately located in urban areas. Research has predominantly focused on attracting therapists to non-urban practice by exploring generalized expressed needs from existing non-urban therapists, such as access to professional development, backfilling of jobs, peer and other practice supports, or enticing occupational therapy students through placement experiences. However, the types of service that non-urban occupational therapists routinely provide remains unclear. Clarifying the scope of occupational therapy services in non-urban areas will support educators and policy makers to plan curricula and services to support non-urban clinicians and communities. INCLUSION CRITERIA This scoping review will consider qualitative and quantitative research studies and opinion pieces about occupational therapy services provided to any individuals or groups living in rural (non-urban) areas across the world. METHODS The search will be conducted in MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Emcare, and ProQuest Nursing and Allied Health, and limited to studies published from 2010 in English, French, Portuguese, or Spanish.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the epidemiology and characteristics of PE with AE-COPD for current studies. METHODS: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases for studies published prior to October 21, 2020. Pooled proportions with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using a random effects model. Odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals were used as effect measures for dichotomous and continuous variables, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies involving 3170 patients were included. The prevalence of PE and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in AE-COPD patients was 17.2% (95% CI: 13.4%-21.3%) and 7.1% (95% CI: 3.7%-11.4%%), respectively. Dyspnea (OR = 6.77, 95% CI: 1.97C23.22), pleuritic chest pain (OR = 3.25, 95% CI: 2.06C5.12), lower limb asymmetry or edema (OR = 2.46, 95% CI:1.51C4.00), higher heart rates (MD = 20.51, 95% CI: 4.95C36.08), longer hospital stays (MD = 3.66, 95% CI: 3.01C4.31) were associated with the PE in the AE-COPD patients. Levels of D-dimer (MD = 1.51, 95% CI: 0.80C2.23), WBC counts (MD = 1.42, 95% CI: 0.14C2.70) were significantly higher and levels of PaO(2) was lower (MD = -17.20, 95% CI: -33.94- -0.45, P<0.05) in the AE-COPD with PE group. The AE-COPD with PE group had increased risk of fatal outcome than the AE-COPD group (OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.43C3.50). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of PE during AE-COPD varies considerably among the studies. AE-COPD patients with PE experienced an increased risk of death, especially among the ICU patients. Understanding the potential risk factors for PE may help clinicians identify AE-COPD patients at increased risk of PE.

Relying on a methodology that accommodates some salient features of the variables of interest, we find that on average the in-sample predictability of palm oil price for exchange rate movements is stronger for Indonesia than for Malaysia. While Indonesias exchange rate appreciates due to a rise in palm oil price regardless of the choice of predictive model, Malaysias exchange rate only appreciates after adjusting for oil price. However, both exchange rates do not seem to be resilient to the COVID-19 pandemic as they depreciate amidst dwindling palm oil price.

Therefore, detecting molecules that can disrupt the nsp10-nsp16 interaction are prospective antiviral drugs. In this study, we screened the North African Natural Products database (NANPDB) for molecules that can interact with the nsp10 interface and disturb the nsp10-nsp16 complex formation. Following rigorous screening and validation steps, in addition to toxic side effects, drug interactions and a risk /benefit assessment, we identified four compounds (genkwanin-6-C-beta-glucopyranoside, paraliane diterpene, 4,5-di-p-trans-coumaroylquinic acid and citrinamide A) that showed the best binding affinity and most favourable interaction with nsp10 interface residues. To understand the conformational stability and dynamic features of nsp10 bound to the four selected compounds, we subjected each complex to 200 ns molecular dynamics simulations. We then calculated the free binding energies of compounds interacting with nsp10 structure using the molecular mechanics-generalised Born surface area (MMGBSA). Of the four compounds, genkwanin-6-C-beta-glucopyranoside demonstrated the most stable complex with nsp10, in addition to a tighter binding affinity of -37.4 +/- 1.3 Kcal/mol.

We assessed the impact of COVID-19 related societal restrictions and lockdown on trauma admissions to single Level 1 Trauma Center in Westmead, Australia. We hypothesized that the number of trauma admissions would decrease and number of admissions due to self-harm and assault (specifically domestic violence) would increase. METHODS Data was collected from the prospectively maintained Westmead Hospital Trauma Registry. The primary outcome compared the average number of trauma admissions during March and April during years 2016 to 2020. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze means. Pairwise differences among group means were evaluated with Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference test. Secondary outcomes compared were in-hospital interventions and patient outcomes. RESULTS There was a 23-34% decrease (p value 0.018) in the mean monthly average trauma admissions during March/April 2020 compared with previous years 2016-2019.

However, the association between frailty and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prognosis remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between frailty and mortality over 6 months in middle-aged and older patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and the association between acute morbidity severity and mortality across frailty strata. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Large academic medical center in Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1830 patients aged &#8805;50 years hospitalized with COVID-19 (March-July 2020). MEASUREMENTS: We screened baseline frailty using the CFS (1-9) and classified patients as fit to managing well (1-3), vulnerable (4), mildly (5), moderately (6), or severely frail to terminally ill (7-9). We also computed a frailty index (0-1; frail >0.25), a well-known frailty measure. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the association between frailty and time to death within 30 days and 6 months of admission. We also examined whether frailty identified different mortality risk levels within strata of similar age and acute morbidity as measured by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. RESULTS: Median age was 66 years, 58% were male, and 27% were frail to some degree. Compared with fit-to-managing-well patients, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval [CI]) for 30-day and 6-month mortality were, respectively, 1.4 (1.1-1.7) and 1.4 (1.1-1.7) for vulnerable patients; 1.5 (1.1-1.9) and 1.5 (1.1-1.8) for mild frailty; 1.8 (1.4-2.3) and 1.9 (1.5-2.4) for moderate frailty; and 2.1 (1.6-2.7) and 2.3 (1.8-2.9) for severe frailty to terminally ill. The CFS achieved outstanding accuracy to identify frailty compared with the Frailty Index (area under the curve = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.93-0.95) and predicted different mortality risks within age and acute morbidity groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results encourage the use of frailty, alongside measures of acute morbidity, to guide clinicians in prognostication and resource allocation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19 is not over and age is not enough: Using frailty for prognostication in hospitalized patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate the uptake and effectiveness of an existing open access lifestyle intervention forged in collaboration between a third sector organisation, funded by local government and a secondary care non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) service in the North West of England. Method: A service outcome evaluation using precomparison design and postcomparison design was conducted to analyse changes between baseline clinical health records and 12-week follow-up for patients with NAFLD who completed the lifestyle intervention. Lifestyle factors, weight loss, changes in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) enzymes and lipid profiles were compared between patients who completed the programme vs 1:1 matched patients who did not. Results: Only 16 of 167 patients with NAFLD offered the intervention completed the programme. Intervention patients achieved significant weight loss (-2.3% p0.05) over 12 weeks, where the non-intervention group had non-significant weight gain (+0.95%). ALT improved by 20.6 IU/L in the interventional group and 15.75 IU/L in the non-intervention group; however, this was not statistically different. Conclusion: This study presents first of its kind evaluation of a service collaboration in the UK. Only 1 in 10 patients offered the opportunity completed the programme, a limitation that could affect future strategies. Patient and public involvement research is needed to identify barriers to participation, address adherence issues and identify support mechanisms for lifestyle interventions in patients with NAFLD.","output":"Direct access lifestyle training improves liver biochemistry and causes weight loss but uptake is suboptimal in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Within the framework of the concept of complexity, a three-stage model of Auger destruction of inorganic and organic polymers, including the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus, was constructed.

caregiver burden among caregivers of individuals with neurodegenerative diseases has been growing throughout the past few decades, allowing health professionals to gain an understanding of the challenges faced by caregivers and provide important recommendations and interventions to reduce caregiver burden Currently, a new set of challenges has arisen as the US faces the novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which disproportionally impacts older adults Given that the risk of COVID-19 illness severity increases with age, older adults have been advised to self-quarantine and follow stay-at-home orders put in place by government officials This physical isolation is purported to lead to decreased social interaction and physical activity among older adults and their caregivers, removing protective factors for overall well-being, aging, and quality of life, and subsequently increasing caregiver burden Despite the assumed impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on caregivers of individuals with neurodegenerative diseases, a rapid review of the current body of literature is critical to provide a summary of work being conducted in this emerging area As such, the current presentation aims to disseminate the findings of a rapid literature review and lessons learned from translating the findings into clinical recommendations Methods Source documents for this literature review were identified through a computerized search using the APA PsychInfo Database and Google Scholar covering the year 2019 to 2020 The following keywords, and combinations of these were utilized: Caregiver, Caregiver Burden, Family Caregiver, Burden, Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, and COVID-19  All English-Language journal articles that appeared to be relevant for this literature were read After applying exclusion criteria (i e articles unrelated to the COVID-19 Pandemic or those that did not assess caregiver burden associated with older adults), 21 peer-reviewed articles warranted inclusion Results After rapid review of the available literature to date, a total of 12 articles in our review assessed for the impact of COVID-19 on caregiver burden Six articles indicated that the worsening of patients behavioral and psychological symptoms, an increase in patients functional impairment, being the sole caregiver, and increased daily hours of care have all been associated with increased caregiver burden and depression Additional factors such as social support, coping strategies, mindfulness, reduction of social isolation, reinforcement of positive activities, and acceptance of role change and loss, among others, have been identified to protect against caregiver burden, as assessed by 3 articles included in our review Conclusions As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and government officials continue to urge the public to practice social distancing by staying home and keeping interaction with people outside of the household to a minimum, increased experiences of social isolation and continued reduction of readily available outside resources due to the global pandemic is expected to greatly impact caregivers and related caregiver burden Within the past year, researchers have answered the call to better understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic through substantial and timely contributions giving unique insights to help guide practice and future research Within the research to date, the long-term effects of COVID-19 on caregivers and caregiver burden remain unknown Gaining an understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on caregivers will serve to inform caregivers and health professionals about treatment and interventions, as well as raise awareness of the lasting impact COVID-19 will continue to have over the coming years In order to summarize and disseminate timely findings, the current review highlights the dimensions of caregiving that affect the caregiver and the person being cared for;it will also address how those dimensions have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic As seen in our clinical practice, older adults are now faced with additional obstacles when it comes to aging successfully The burden of adapting and facilitating successful aging within the pandemic complicates the burden already felt by the caregiver, compromising the caregiver's self-care and quality of life Implications of this review will serve to call attention to the impact COVID-19 has had and continues to have on caregivers and patients with neurodegenerative diseases, touch on the experiences and consequences

RNAs that suppress gene expression by complementary oligonucleotide binding to the sites in target messenger RNAs. Numerous studies have demonstrated that miRNAs play crucial role in virtually all cellular processes of both plants and animals, such as cell growth, cell division, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. The study of rice MIR168a has demonstrated for the first time that exogenous plant MIR168a influences cholesterol transport in mice by inhibiting low-density lipoprotein receptor adapter protein 1 expression. Inspired by this finding, the cross-kingdom regulation of plant-derived miRNAs has drawn a lot of attention because of its capability to provide novel therapeutic agents in the treatment of miRNA deregulation-related diseases. Notably, unlike mRNA, some plant miRNAs are robust because of their 3 end modification, high G, C content, and the protection by microvesicles, miRNAs protein cofactors or plant ingredients. The stability of these small molecules guarantees the reliability of plant miRNAs in clinical application. Although the function of endogenous miRNAs has been widely investigated, the cross-kingdom regulation of plant-derived miRNAs is still in its infancy. Herein, this review summarizes the current knowledge regarding the anti-virus, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptosis, immune modulation, and intestinal function regulation effects of plant-derived miRNAs in mammals. It is expected that exploring the versatile role of plant-derived miRNAs may lay the foundation for further study and application of these newly recognized, non-toxic, and inexpensive plant active ingredients.","output":"A Timely Review of Cross-Kingdom Regulation of Plant-Derived MicroRNAs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Pertussis is one of the top 10 diseases of children under 10 years of age, and the few vaccine-preventable diseases who is on a rise in China in recent years; however, the true burden of pertussis, including age-stratified incidence and risk factors of severe sequelae, are under-recognised. We aim to estimate the health burden of laboratory-confirmed pertussis by age groups, considering the setting of illness onset (ie, in community, outpatient and inpatient), in a Chinese population (~2.23 million in total) at two sites. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This paper describes the study design of a 1-year, prospective, age-stratified and population-based caseCcontrol study, including site selection, study population, case registry, ascertainment and enrolment, control recruitment, follow-up of case, microbiological methods, data collection, quality control activities and statistical methods used to generate incidence estimates. During June 2021 through May 2022, registry of suspected pertussis cases (namely chronic/persistent cough) will be conducted in several participating hospitals (SHs) at the two sites, which are selected based on Healthcare Utilisation and Attitudes Surveys (HUAS) carried out before study initiation. A caseCcontrol study will be conducted in the SHs and we aim to enrol a total of 1000 suspected pertussis cases (ie, all hospital admissions and the first 1C3 outpatient visits each week each hospital) and 2000 frequency matched healthy controls in community. Our primary study outcome, the laboratory-confirmed Bordetella pertussis infection, will be determined by a comprehensive laboratory methods and procedures (ie, culture, PCR and serological tests) in both cases and controls at enrolment and during 60-days follow-up visits. Finally, data from HUAS (ie, population size), case registry (ie, the total number of suspected pertussis cases) and caseCcontrol study (ie, the prevalence or population attributable fraction of Bordetella pertussis) will be combined to calculate incidence and its 95% CI through bootstrap method. Epidemiological analyses will be conducted to determine the risk factors associated with severe sequelae of pertussis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Preventions Institutional Review Board (no. ICDC-202110). Results will be disseminated via academic presentations and publication in peer-reviewed journals, and will provide valuable scientific data and some new insights into the incidence, aetiology and risk factors for severe sequelae of pertussis to academic societies and the public health authorities who is currently struggling and fighting against this burdensome disease worldwide.","output":"Burden of whooping cough in China (PertussisChina): study protocol of a prospective, population-based caseCcontrol study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To investigate cancer patients knowledge and attitudes regarding fatigue and the potential benefits and acceptability of a brief information booklet. METHODS: The CARPE DIEM study assessed knowledge and attitudes regarding fatigue in a diverse group of 50 cancer patients before (T0) and about one (T1) and four months (T2) after reading the booklet. At T1, participants additionally rated its usefulness. RESULTS: At baseline, 37.5% of respondents did not know the term fatigue or what it meant. Those who already knew something about fatigue mainly had obtained their information from booklets, books, or articles (63.3%) and/or the internet (46.7%). Overall, knowledge gaps existed, particularly about potential fatigue treatment options and whether fatigue is an indicator of cancer progression. Furthermore, 56.4% felt poorly informed, and 46.1% reported feeling helpless in the face of fatigue. Lower knowledge at baseline was significantly associated with lower education and older age. At T1 and T2, there were significant improvements in several knowledge questions and attitudes. Patient-reported benefits included getting new information about fatigue (91.1%), awareness of not being alone with their problems (89.7%), taking appropriate actions (72.9%), and encouragement to talk about their fatigue with family/friends (55.3%) or with a health professional (52.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Specific gaps were identified in the provision of information and education for cancer patients about fatigue. A low-cost intervention asking to read a brief information booklet was associated with improved knowledge. This could be considered as a first step offered as part of a bundle of further efforts to improve knowledge and care of fatigue.

Airway smooth muscle (ASM) spasm leads to airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and bronchial obstruction, which are clinical manifestations of an asthma attack. Botulinum toxin (BTX) is a bacteria toxin that acts as muscle relaxant and may have therapeutic effects on AHR and asthma. OBJECTIVE In this study, the effect of BTX on AHR and related gene expressions was evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS An asthma mice model was developed which was treated with BTX in two ways: intranasally (IN) and via nebulization (N) (0.01, 0.1, and 1 U/mL and 10 U/mL, respectively) on days 25, 27 and 29. AHR was evaluated on days 24, 26, 28, and 30, and gene expressions were evaluated for TrkA, TrkB, M1-M5, 7nAChR, TNF-, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) proteins. For histopathology of the lungs, perivascular and peribronchial inflammation, production of mucus, and goblet cell hyperplasia were studied. RESULTS On day 24, treatment with BTX (for all doses) had no significant effect on AHR, but on days 26 and 28, AHR was decreased and this continued up to day 30 for all treated groups. Treatment with BTX had no significant effect on the gene expressions of TrkA, TrkB, M1-M5, 7nAChR, TNF-, and ERK2 proteins, perivascular inflammation, peribronchial inflammation, hyperplasia of the goblet cell and production of mucus. Besides, mice administered with 10 mg/mL BTX perished. The BTX therapy controlled asthma attacks by decreasing AHR and relaxation of ASMs. CONCLUSION However, BTX had no significant effect on airway inflammation and production of mucus. While using BTX, it is necessary to prescribe safe doses in order to prevent adverse reactions.","output":"Survey of immunopharmacological effects of botulinum toxin in cell signaling of bronchial smooth muscle cells in allergic asthma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, the current global pandemic has caused immense damage to human lives and the global economy.

METHODS We examined the incidence of clinical complications and physiological derangements that occurred in 160 neurologically injured patients (90 males, 70 females, mean age 57  17 years) who underwent intra-hospital transport (288 cases, 237 scheduled, 51 unscheduled) for computed tomography scans. RESULTS Our findings indicate that (1) at least one significant complication (predominantly hemodynamic) occurred in over one-third (36%) of all transports (p = n.s scheduled vs. unscheduled) necessitating the deployment of interventions designed to treat changes in arterial pressure (2) despite the presence of trained medical personnel and availability of specialized equipment, intra-cranial pressure was not adequately monitored during transports (especially in patients with intra-cranial hypertension prior to transport) (3) intra-hospital transfer was associated with minor but statistically significant clinical changes, including a reduction in arterial partial pressure of oxygen (Pa(O(2)))/inspired oxygen fraction (Fi(O(2))) (only in the scheduled transport population), decreased arterial lactate levels (scheduled transport population), lowered body temperature (scheduled transport population), and increased arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pa(CO(2))) (scheduled transport population).

The performance of the VitalPatch is validated by comparing its automated algorithm interval measurements to the manually annotated global intervals of the 12-lead ECG device in 30 subjects. The accuracy of interval monitoring (in terms of mean timing error calculated by subtracting the VitalPatch measurements from the global intervals) is 2.7+/-15.94 ms, -1.97+/-12.29 ms, -14.6+/-12.97 ms, - 15.33+/-14.11 ms, and -15.08+/-13.69 ms for PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, QTb, and QTf, respectively.

In macrophages, heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycans mediate the initial PRRSV attachment and the receptor sialoadhesin mediates both PRRSV attachment and internalization into endosomes. Upon a pH drop, PRRSV is uncoated and its genome is released from the endosomes into the cytoplasm, which allows virus replication. However, expression of heparan sulphate and sialoadhesin in non-susceptible cells only allows virus internalization, but no virus uncoating and infection, indicating that other factors are involved. In the present study, it is shown that treatment of macrophages with serum (mainly the alpha-globulin fraction) inhibited PRRSV infection without affecting attachment and internalization. Because alpha-globulins contain several protease inhibitors, macrophages were treated with different protease inhibitors to investigate the involvement of proteases in PRRSV uncoating. Treatment of macrophages with broadly active inhibitors of serine or aspartic proteases, but not cysteine- or metallo-proteases, inhibited PRRSV uncoating and infection. Further investigation using specific inhibitors indicated that the aspartic protease cathepsin E is involved during PRRSV uncoating, but did not allow identification of the serine protease involved. The involvement of cathepsin E during PRRSV uncoating was confirmed by partial co-localization of internalized PRRSV with cathepsin E. Furthermore, cathepsin E expression increased with macrophage cultivation, which was positively correlated with an increased susceptibility to PRRSV infection. Together, these data show that, in macrophages, both the aspartic protease cathepsin E and an unidentified trypsin-like serine protease are involved in uncoating of internalized PRRSV and subsequent infection.","output":"Involvement of proteases in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus uncoating upon internalization in primary macrophages."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: - With the COVID-19 pandemic wreaking havoc across nations, several research projects are being carried out to study the propagation of the virus. In this study we have made an endeavour to analyse the spread of COVID-19 in the districts of India. Methods- Some districts in India have been much more a ected than the others. A cluster analysis of the worst a ected districts in India provide insight about the similarities between them. The e ects of public health interventions in flattening the curve in their respective states is studied using the individual contact SEIQHRF model. Results - The clustering of hotspot districts in India provide homogeneous clusters of districts that stand out in terms of number of positive COVID-19 cases and covariates like population density and number of COVID-19 special hospitals. The cluster analysis reveal that distribution of number of COVID-19 hospitals in the districts vary from the distribution of con rmed COVID-19 cases. The distribution of hospitals is much less skewed than the population density and COVID-19 cases.

A rapid surge in cases of severe COVID-19 will lead to a corresponding surge in demand for ICU care. Because of constraints on resources, frontline healthcare workers may be unable to provide the frequent monitoring and assessment required for all patients at high risk of clinical deterioration. We developed a machine learning-based risk prioritization tool that predicts ICU transfer within 24 h, seeking to facilitate efficient use of care providers efforts and help hospitals plan their flow of operations. Methods: A retrospective cohort was comprised of non-ICU COVID-19 admissions at a large acute care health system between 26 February and 18 April 2020. Time series data, including vital signs, nursing assessments, laboratory data, and electrocardiograms, were used as input variables for training a random forest (RF) model. The cohort was randomly split (70:30) into training and test sets. The RF model was trained using 10-fold cross-validation on the training set, and its predictive performance on the test set was then evaluated. Results: The cohort consisted of 1987 unique patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted to non-ICU units of the hospital. The median time to ICU transfer was 2.45 days from the time of admission. Compared to actual admissions, the tool had 72.8% (95% CI: 63.2C81.1%) sensitivity, 76.3% (95% CI: 74.7C77.9%) specificity, 76.2% (95% CI: 74.6C77.7%) accuracy, and 79.9% (95% CI: 75.2C84.6%) area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. Conclusions: A ML-based prediction model can be used as a screening tool to identify patients at risk of imminent ICU transfer within 24 h. This tool could improve the management of hospital resources and patient-throughput planning, thus delivering more effective care to patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","output":"Using Machine Learning to Predict ICU Transfer in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus has developed massively in Indonesia, in the face of Coronavirus, Indonesian people are required to be able to survive the outbreak, by not interacting directly between people Pikobar is one of the applications on a smartphone (android), which can provide up-to-date information about the development of the coronavirus in Indonesia (especially in West Java), which allows people to receive that information without having to do physical interaction between communities To find out the level of customer satisfaction in using the pikobar application, the TAM method is used the data collected was obtained from the results of a survey of the Indonesian population The survey results were processed using smartPLS From the results of the study showed if perceived ease ofuse of the application greatly influenced the community to use the pikobar application, so that thepublic could use the application in accordance with the application's purpose, namely to reduce therate of coronavirus spread ? 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd","output":"The Influence of Pikobar Application in Suppressing the Rate of Coronavirus Spread"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we discuss evidence supporting the effective implementation of eHealth, telehealth, and telemedicine during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, with a view towards its permanent future integration in healthcare.

The articles selected describe the use of telemedicine as its advantages in terms of practicality and cost-effectiveness. This synthesis of articles is applicable to high-, middle- and low-income countries. Some of the notable benefits include breaking down geographical and time barriers, reducing waiting lists and crowding in healthcare facilities, and saving on national healthcare expenditure. However, there are a number of difficulties with the widespread implementation of telemedicine services that mainly relate to bureaucratic and regulatory concerns. Moreover, it is also important to make healthcare professionals and providers aware of the limits of this tool to avoid potential cases of negligence. Patients in turn will have to be made aware of and be educated on the use of this new healthcare modality before it is accepted by them. In the current socio-economic climate, it is therefore essential to implement a telehealth model aimed at efficiency and continuity of healthcare, as well as leading to an improvement in the quality of life of patients, whilst optimising existing resources and reducing costs.

Diabetics infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a higher rate of hospital admission, severe pneumonia, and higher mortality compared to non-diabetic subjects. Chronic hyperglycemia can compromise innate and humoral immunity. Furthermore, diabetes is associated with a low-grade chronic inflammatory state that favors the development of an exaggerated inflammatory response and therefore the appearance of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Recent evidence has shown that SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of causing direct damage to the pancreas that could worsen hyperglycemia and even induce the onset of diabetes in previously non-diabetic subjects. Therapeutic strategies should be aimed at facilitating patient access to the healthcare system. Control of blood glucose and comorbidities must be individualized in order to reduce the incidence of complications and decrease the burden on health systems.

However, business model innovation is a complex task, characterized by shifting characteristics in terms of uncertainty, data availability and its impact on decision making. To cope with such challenges, business model evaluation is advocated to make sense of novel business models and to support decision making. Key performance indicators (KPIs) are frequently used in business model evaluation to structure the performance assessment of these models and to evaluate their strategic implications, in turn aiding business model decision making. However, given the shifting characteristics of the innovation process, the application and effectiveness of KPIs depend significantly on how such KPIs are defined. The techniques proposed in the existing literature typically generate or use quantitatively oriented KPIs, which are not well-suited for the early phases of the business model innovation process. Therefore, following a design science research methodology, we have developed a novel method for defining business model KPIs, taking into account the characteristics of the innovation process, offering holistic support toward decision making. Building on theory on linguistic summarization, we use a set of structured templates to define qualitative KPIs that are suitable to support early-phase decision making. In addition, we show how these KPIs can be gradually quantified to support later phases of the innovation process.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigate the role of treadmill-desk interventions on energy expenditure, sitting time, and cardiometabolic health in adults with sedentary occupations. METHODS: Relevant studies published in English were identified using CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases up to December 2020. Random effects meta-analysis models were used to pool study results. RESULTS: Thirteen relevant studies (six workplaces and seven laboratories) were found with a total of 351 participants. Pooled analysis of laboratory studies showed a significant increase in energy expenditure (105.23 kcal per hour, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 90.41 to 120.4), as well as metabolic rate (5.0 mL/kg/min, 95% CI: 3.35 to 6.64), among treadmill desk users compared to sitting conditions.

We assessed 166 pregnant mothers of the PERSIAN cohort population of Isfahan, Iran, in the 1st and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy and their infants at birth. Four common benzophenones (BPs) including 2,4-dihydroxy benzophenone (BP-1), 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzophenone (BP-3), 4-hydroxy benzophenone (4-OH-BP), and 2,2-dihydroxy-4-methoxy benzophenone (BP-8) were measured in maternal urine samples. The median urinary concentrations of 4-OH-BP, BP-3, BP-1, and BP-8 in the 1st trimester were 6.62, 7.5, 4.39, and 1.32 g/g creatinine and those in the 3rd trimester were 3.15, 16.98, 9.95, and 1.04 g/g creatinine, respectively. BP-3 was the predominant metabolite in both trimesters. There was a significant correlation between BP-3, BP-1, and 4-OH-BP levels (p < 0.05) but not BP-8. BP-1 showed a significant positive association with gestational age (GA) in all infants in the 1st trimester, but a negative association was observed between BP-3 and BP-1 levels and GA in girls. Classification of infants birth weight for different GAs represented that the majority of them were appropriate for GA. However, boys weights were heavier than girls. Also, birth outcomes of preterm (< 37 weeks) infants were noticeably lower than term infants (37C42 weeks). This study demonstrated that benzophenone derivatives especially BP-3 can affect the duration of pregnancy and consequently fetal growth in the early and late stages of pregnancy. This is more pronounced in girls; however, more investigations in a different population are needed to prove the results. Therefore, the application of these compounds as a UV protector requires precise regulation to reduce exposure, especially in pregnant women.

The first COVID-19 hospitalization was considered index hospitalization;baseline was defined as first 2 days of index hospitalization;readmission was assessed within 30 days of discharge from index hospitalization. We describe the demographics, treatments and outcomes of the index hospitalization and readmission. Results. For index hospitalization, we identified 111,624 COVID-19 patients from 327 hospitals across US. Mean age was 63 and 54% were male.

He had been recently discharged from a hospital in another country with the diagnosis of infective endocarditis of the mitral valve and mycotic embolization to the superior mesenteric artery. At presentation, oral and genital ulcers were present, raising the suspicion of a flare of BD. Transesophageal echocardiography showed a small vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Blood cultures results were negative. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed extensive inferior vena cava thrombosis. The aneurysm and thrombotic phenomena were interpreted as related to BD: the vegetation on the mitral valve was diagnosed as NBTE of which BD is a recognized cause. With corticosteroid and anticoagulant therapy, the patient's symptoms steadily improved. NBTE is a rare manifestation of BD; differential diagnosis with infective endocarditis can be challenging and should be focused on identifying predisposing conditions.

BNT162b2 is highly efficacious against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and is currently approved, conditionally approved, or authorized for emergency use worldwide. At the time of initial authorization, data beyond 2 months after vaccination were unavailable. METHODS: In an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, multinational, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned 44,165 participants 16 years of age or older and 2264 participants 12 to 15 years of age to receive two 30-g doses, at 21 days apart, of BNT162b2 or placebo. The trial end points were vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety, which were both evaluated through 6 months after vaccination. RESULTS: BNT162b2 continued to be safe and have an acceptable adverse-event profile. Few participants had adverse events leading to withdrawal from the trial. Vaccine efficacy against Covid-19 was 91.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.0 to 93.2) through 6 months of follow-up among the participants without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection who could be evaluated. There was a gradual decline in vaccine efficacy. Vaccine efficacy of 86 to 100% was seen across countries and in populations with diverse ages, sexes, race or ethnic groups, and risk factors for Covid-19 among participants without evidence of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine efficacy against severe disease was 96.7% (95% CI, 80.3 to 99.9). In South Africa, where the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern B.1.351 (or beta) was predominant, a vaccine efficacy of 100% (95% CI, 53.5 to 100) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Through 6 months of follow-up and despite a gradual decline in vaccine efficacy, BNT162b2 had a favorable safety profile and was highly efficacious in preventing Covid-19.

The local epidemic continues to involve predominantly gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM), but in recent years, has expanded further into heterosexual populations. This has coincided with an increase in the number of pregnant women testing positive for syphilis on antenatal screening. The aim of this study is to understand the changing epidemiology in infectious syphilis cases diagnosed in Ottawa to strengthen primary care management and public health response. Methods Surveillance data from the Ontario Ministry of Health were used to describe the evolving epidemiology of infectious syphilis in the Ottawa region from 2010 to 2019, including a comprehensive chart review of cases from 2015-2019. Results The number of cases of infectious syphilis in Ottawa rose from 50 cases in 2010 to 171 cases in 2019.

Primarily due to being ordered to leave by their respective organizations, e.g., overseas development administration (ODA) in the developed world, many highly skilled migrant workers left these countries. This sudden exodus of highly skilled foreigners created a number of problems in these countries;for example, schools suffered from teacher staffing shortages and hospitals had reduced capacity to offer medical services due to the paucity of nurses and doctors. This study aims to examine the situations in the Federated State of Micronesia (FSM), Palau, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), where many foreign workers have left their duty stations to return home under COVID-19, to elicit lessons learned and possible ways and means to alleviate the observed problems. To this end, literature surveys and interviews were conducted with informants. Results indicated that developing and maintaining a remote work environment is a promising method to fill the gaps caused by the sudden absence of foreign workers in management posts, even under non-emergency situation. This is because in the case that highly skilled migrant workers are forced to vacate their duty stations suddenly, immediately hiring replacements is often not possible. Promoting distance education also proved effective for COVID-19-free nations such as the FSM, Palau, and the RMI, not only during emergencies, but also during normal times. Similarly, the daily use of telemedicine is likely to be effective in coping with emergencies, as shown in the case of FSMs Pohnpei State Hospital. We found both distance education and telemedicine to be effective measures to address the sudden departure of highly skilled migrant workers in the fields of education and medical services. Moreover, other forms of remote work should prove useful in other sectors such as industry and administration. These systems should be progressively developed during non-emergency times and integrated into the daily operations of relevant sectors. ? Fuji Technology Press Ltd.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers rapidly shifted to providing telehealth and virtual options for clients. Building Resilience and Attachment in Vulnerable Adolescents (BRAVA) is a group intervention designed for adolescents and their caregivers to reduce adolescent SI. The objective of this study was to adapt BRAVA for virtual delivery and evaluate the feasibility of this adaptation. Methods: We conducted an 8-week open trial between October and December 2020. Twelve participants (6 adolescents and 6 primary caregivers) were recruited from a pediatric hospital in Eastern Ontario. Through Zoom, adolescents and caregivers completed an intake assessment together, 6 weekly BRAVA group sessions separately, and an exit assessment together 1-week post-BRAVA. The primary adolescent outcome variable was the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire Junior (SIQ-JR). Data were analyzed in IBM SPSS v.27. Pre-post comparisons on the SIQ-JR were done with a 2-tailed t test for matched pairs. Results: The study uptake rate was 42.9% of the eligible participants. There were no study dropouts. Adolescent (Mean [M] age = 15.3 years;SD age = 1.0;66.7% female) and caregiver attendance rates for BRAVA group sessions were high (median = 6). Overall group satisfaction scores were high for adolescents (M = 4.2;SD = 0.8) and their caregivers (M = 4.2;SD = 0.7). Most youth (83.4%) and caregivers (66.7%) reported that the virtual process worked well. Whereas all caregivers (100%) agreed they would participate in a virtual group session again, youth responses were more variable (50% agree, 33.3% neutral, 16.7% disagree). Adolescent SI decreased after completing the intervention (M pretreatment [tx] = 50.7, SD pretreatment [tx] = 16.7;M post-tx = 29.7, SD post-tx = 20.4;t = 5.7;95% CI, 11.52-30.5;p = 0.002). Conclusions: Study results indicate that the virtual delivery of BRAVA is feasible. Study uptake was good, retention was complete, and satisfaction was high for adolescents and their caregivers. Importantly, initial results suggest that this adaptation of BRAVA may help reduce SI in adolescents.

He was administered tacrolimus by a predominantly oral route, and less frequently received it by jejunostomy. The aim of this paper is to discuss this administration strategy and whether a different method could have been more suitable. This case report highlights that during the jejunostomy period, the tacrolimus doses that were required to maintain trough concentrations within the therapeutic range were four times higher than those administered after the closure of the jejunostomy. We observed an increase in the Dose-Normalized Trough Concentration (DNTC) values when tacrolimus was administered for 4 consecutive days by jejunostomy as compared to oral administration, indicating that the relative bioavailability of tacrolimus increased. Moreover, when returning to oral administration, the subsequent DNTC value was halved, highlighting a reduction in the tacrolimus bioavailability. Thus, in such a case, administration by jejunostomy could be more appropriate.","output":"Tacrolimus trough levels before, during and after jejunostomy in a liver transplant patient: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Routine health service provision decreased during the 2014C2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Sierra Leone, while caesarean section (CS) rates at public hospitals did not. It is unknown what made staff provide CS despite the risks of contracting EVD. This study explores Sierra Leonean health worker perspectives of why they continued to provide CS. METHODS: This qualitative study documents the experiences of 15 CS providers who worked during the EVD outbreak. We interviewed surgical and non-surgical CS providers who worked at public hospitals that either increased or decreased CS volumes during the outbreak. Hospitals in all four administrative areas of Sierra Leone were included. Semistructured interviews averaged 97 min and healthcare experience 21 years. Transcripts were analysed by modified framework analysis in the NVivo V.11.4.1 software. RESULTS: We identified two themes that may explain why providers performed CS despite EVD risks: (1) clinical adaptability and (2) overcoming the moral dilemmas. CS providers reported being overworked and exposed to infection hazards. However, they developed clinical workarounds to the lack of surgical materials, protective equipment and standard operating procedures until the broader international response introduced formal personal protective equipment and infection prevention and control practices. CS providers reported that dutifulness and sense of responsibility for ones community increased during EVD, which helped them justify taking the risk of being infected. Although most surgical activities were reduced to minimise staff exposure to EVD, staff at public hospitals tended to prioritise performing CS surgery for women with acute obstetric complications. CONCLUSION: This study found that CS surgery during EVD in Sierra Leone may be explained by remarkable decisions by individual CS providers at public hospitals. They adapted practically to material limitations exacerbated by the outbreak and overcame the moral dilemmas of performing CS despite the risk of being infected with EVD.","output":"For this one, let me take the risk: why surgical staff continued to perform caesarean sections during the 2014C2016 Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Health care workers are at significant risk for infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We utilized a point-of-care, lateral flow SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay (RayBiotech) to conduct a seroprevalence study in a cohort of at-risk health care workers (n=339) and normal-risk controls (n=100) employed at an academic medical center. To minimize exposure risk while conducting the study, consents were performed electronically, tests were mailed and then self-administered at home using finger stick blood, and subjects uploaded a picture of the test result while answering an electronic questionnaire. We also validated the assay using de-identified serum samples from patients with PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Between April 14(th) and May 6(th) 2020, 439 subjects were enrolled. Subjects were 68% female, 93% white, and most were physicians (38%) and nurses (27%). In addition, 37% had at least 1 respiratory symptom in the prior month, 34% had cared for a patient with known SARS-CoV-2 infection, 57% and 23% were worried about exposure at work or in the community, respectively, and 5 reported prior documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. On initial testing, 3 subjects had a positive IgG test, 336 had a negative test, and 87 had an inconclusive result. Of those with an inconclusive result who conducted a repeat test (85%), 96% had a negative result. All 3 positive IgG tests were in subjects reporting prior documented infection. Laboratory validation showed that of those with PCR-proven infection more than 13 days prior, 23/30 were IgG positive (76% sensitivity), whereas 1/26 with a negative prior PCR test were seropositive (95% specificity). Repeat longitudinal serologic testing every 30 days for up to 4 times is currently in progress. CONCLUSION: We conducted a contact-free study in the setting of a pandemic to assess SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in an at-risk group of health care workers. The only subjects found to be IgG positive were those with prior documented infection, even though a substantial proportion of subjects reported significant potential occupational or community exposure and symptoms that were potentially compatible with SARS-COV-2 infection.

Methods: In this retrospective chart analysis, we reviewed the clinical, laboratory, and radiographic presentations of teenagers diagnosed with EVALI at UCD Children's Hospital, between February and December 2020. Results: A total of 10 teenagers were hospitalized for EVALI during the study period. The average age was 16.10.8 years;40% of patients were female. 40% were Hispanic;40% were Caucasian. Common presenting symptoms included fever (90%), cough (90%), and abdominal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (90%). The laboratory results showed an elevated white blood cell count (18.194.1) with neutrophil predominance (88.0211.3), and elevated C-reactive protein levels (23.513.6). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing was done in 9/10 patients and all were negative. Chest radiographs were reported as bilateral opacities (70%), normal (20%), and pneumomediastinum (10% of the cases). Chest computerized tomography, done for 8/10 patients, showed bilateral ground glass opacities in 7/8 patients (Figure 1). With high index of suspicion for EVALI, careful and repeat questioning revealed frequent use of tetrahydrocannabinol vaping products in all cases. The average length of stay was 52.7 days;70% needed admission in the pediatric intensive care unit and one patient required intubation. 90% of patients were treated with corticosteroids with a response to treatment within 48 hours. 60% had follow-up in pulmonary clinic, at which point all patients had complete resolution of symptoms. Discussion: Our study shows the similarities in clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings between EVALI and COVID-19. EVALI cases have decreased since legalization of marijuana, mostly due to reduced use of vitamin E acetate, an adulterant in street products and a common culprit in EVALI cases. However, most of our teenagers obtain vaping products from informal sources and therefore outbreaks continue. There may also be potential for increased EVALI cases secondary to COVID-19 social distancing restrictions. When adolescents present with COVID-19 symptoms, providers should elicit pertinent vaping history. SARS-CoV-2 as well as other appropriate diagnostic work-up should be pursued since EVALI is a diagnosis of exclusion. Early initiation of steroids in EVALI can shorten duration of illness. Appropriate vaping cessation counseling and close outpatient monitoring are needed to reduce the risk of recurrence. 3 of 10 cases were previously published as a case report: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33194204/.","output":"E-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury in adolescents during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is an important subject for global health.

However, the association of cardiac injury and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes remains scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of cardiac injury with ECG abnormality and with in-hospital mortality. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who were hospitalised with COVID-19 between 13 March and 31 March 2020. Those patients with troponin I measurement were included in the study and divided into those who had elevated troponin I (cardiac injury group) and those who did not (no cardiac injury group). Statistical analyses were performed to compare difference between the groups, and a multivariate logistic regression model was constructed to assess the effect of cardiac injury on in-hospital mortality. Results One hundred and eight-one (181) patients were included, 54 of whom were in the cardiac injury group and 127 in the no cardiac injury group. The mean age was 64.016.6 years and 55.8% were male. The cardiac injury group was more likely to be older, have a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure compared to the no cardiac injury group (all p<0.05); there was no difference in presence of chest pain (cardiac injury group versus no cardiac injury group: 17.0% versus 22.5%, p=0.92); the cardiac injury group had a significantly higher value of brain natriuretic peptide, procalcitonin, interleukin-6 and D-dimer (all p<0.05); they had numerically more frequent ECG abnormalities such as T wave inversion (13.2% versus 7.5%, p=0.23) and ST depression (1.9% versus 0.0%, p=0.13) although statistically not significant; they had significantly higher in-hospital mortality (42.3% versus 12.6%, p<0.001). With a multivariate logistic regression model, age (odds ratio [95% confidential interval]: 1.033 [1.002C1.065], p=0.034) and cardiac injury (3.25 [1.40C7.54], p=0.006) were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Conclusions Patients with COVID-19 with elevated troponin I had a relatively low proportion of chest pain and ECG abnormality.

In this study, we aim to investigate the evidence regarding the prevalence of cardiac complications and the resulting mortality rate in COVID-19 patients.

Inclusion criterion was reviewing and reporting cardiac complications in patients with confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: The initial search resulted in 853 records, out of which 40 articles were included. Overall analysis showed that the prevalence of acute cardiac injury, heart failure and cardiac arrest were 19.46% (95% CI: 18.23-20.72), 19.07% (95% CI: 15.38-23.04) and 3.44% (95% CI: 3.08-3.82), respectively. Moreover, abnormal serum troponin level was observed in 22.86% (95% CI: 21.19-24.56) of the COVID-19 patients. Further analysis revealed that the overall odds of mortality is 14.24 (95% CI: 8.67-23.38) times higher when patients develop acute cardiac injury. The pooled odds ratio of mortality when the analysis was limited to abnormal serum troponin level was 19.03 (95% CI: 11.85-30.56). CONCLUSION: Acute cardiac injury and abnormal serum troponin level were the most prevalent cardiac complications/abnormalities in COVID-19 patients. The importance of cardiac complications is emphasized due to the higher mortality rate among patients with these complications. Thus, troponin screenings and cardiac evaluations are recommended to be performed in routine patient assessments.","output":"Cardiac Complications and Pertaining Mortality Rate in COVID-19 Patients; a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 induces a proinflammatory environment that is stronger in patients requiring intensive care. The cytokine components of this environment may determine efficacy or otherwise of glucocorticoid therapy. The immunity modulators, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and the nuclear NAD(+)-consuming enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP 1) may play a critical role in COVID-19 pathophysiology. The AhR is overexpressed in coronaviruses, including COVID-19 and, as it regulates PARP gene expression, the latter is likely to be activated in COVID-19. PARP 1 activation leads to cell death mainly by depletion of NAD(+) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), especially when availability of these energy mediators is compromised. PARP expression is enhanced in other lung conditions: the pneumovirus respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). I propose that PARP 1 activation is the terminal point in a sequence of events culminating in patient mortality and should be the focus of COVID-19 immunotherapy. Potent PARP 1 inhibitors are undergoing trials in cancer, but a readily available inhibitor, nicotinamide (NAM), which possesses a highly desirable biochemical and activity profile, merits exploration. It conserves NAD(+) and prevents ATP depletion by PARP 1 and Sirtuin 1 (silent mating type information regulation 2 homologue 1) inhibition, enhances NAD(+) synthesis, and hence that of NADP(+) which is a stronger PARP inhibitor, reverses lung injury caused by ischaemia/reperfusion, inhibits proinflammatory cytokines and is effective against HIV infection. These properties qualify NAM for therapeutic use initially in conjunction with standard clinical care or combined with other agents, and subsequently as an adjunct to stronger PARP 1 inhibitors or other drugs.","output":"Immunotherapy of COVID-19 with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors: starting with nicotinamide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Globally COVID-19 epidemics have caused tremendous disasters.

Consequently, the positive effect on the environment has been witnessed. One of the most prominent evidences has been the drastic air quality improvement, as a direct consequence of lower emissions from reduced industrial activity. While several studies have demonstrated the validity of this hypothesis in mega-cities worldwide, it is still an unsubstantiated fact whether the same holds true for cities with a smaller urban extent and population. In the present study we investigate the temporal development of atmospheric constituent concentrations as retrieved concurrently from the Sentinel-5P satellite and a ground meteorological station. We focus on the period before and during the COVID-19 pandemic over the city of Hat Yai, Thailand and present the effect of the lockdown on the atmospheric quality over this average populated city (156,000 inhabitants). NO(2), PM(2.5) and PM(10) concentrations decreased by 33.7%, 21.8% and 22.9% respectively in the first 3 weeks of the lockdown compared to the respective pre-lockdown period; O(3) also decreased by 12.5% and contrary to similar studies.

Over and above the health sector, education was also hard hit. The harmful effects of the sudden cessation of synchronous learning for learners at every phase of education in South Africa remain perplexing and not yet fully understood. For students in their senior years of qualification in degrees at university, the ramifications of COVID-19 over 2020 have been especially significant given their certain entry into the work arena in 2021. Method: This article highlights how the understanding of the full impact of COVID-19 in the university space cannot be separated from the struggles that have and continue to permeate higher education in South African universities since the fall of apartheid. Results: The need for tangible data showing evidence of transformation within lecture spaces, teaching content, staff and student diversity, as well as access and belonging by students within the academic space, has been less than ideal. Thus, despite the writings in policy, evidence of real change at the ground level has been sparse. Although it is easy to nonchalantly overlook a small department, such as that of speech-language pathology, within the larger higher education sector in Johannesburg, South Africa, we showcase what we believe were gains in transformation in our department, until the somewhat rude appearance of COVID-19. Conclusion: Despite a notable difference in the digital divide between students with and without access (financial, technological, and time), the promulgation for asynchronous online learning to ensure adherence to academic and clinical competency bode well for some, but not all, students.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on Transformation in a Speech-Language Pathology University Program in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting have become invaluable tools to analyze and isolate specific cell populations in a wide range of biomedical research and clinical applications. In countless approaches worldwide, scientists are using single cell analyses to better understand the significance and variation within different cellular populations, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting has become a major technique for cell isolation in both basic and clinical research. However, majority of available cell sorters are pressurized, droplet-based systems, which apply significant environmental pressure and shear stress to cells during sorting. Recently, the flow cytometry community has become increasingly aware about the potential negative effects this could have on sorted cells and the term \\"sorter induced cell stress\\" (SICS) has been proposed. However, up to date only a limited number of studies have investigated the effects of cell sorting on cell viability and function. Therefore, solid data on the effects of sheath pressure and nozzle size on survival and function of sorted cells are surprisingly rare. With this in mind, we sorted \\"CD4+\\" T-cells and \\"live\\" cells from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at different sort conditions and analyzed their quality before and after sorting in a series of assays. Here we present our findings in reference to cell viability and cell proliferation following sorting on different instruments (BD FACSAria III SORP and BD FACSJazz), utilizing different nozzle sizes (70 to 100 m) and sheath pressure settings (20 to 70 psi). The results show no significant differences in cell viability and proliferation after the different tested sort conditions, but rather differences between individual experiments. These findings are evaluated and their potential significance in cell sorting experiments is discussed.","output":"An evaluation of sorter induced cell stress (SICS) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after different sort conditions - Are your sorted cells getting SICS?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), IgM levels increased early after symptom onset for those with mild and severe disease, but IgG levels increased early only in those with severe disease.

RESULTS: There were 336 (29.9%) patients with comorbidities; 309 patients (27.5%) had high, 316 (28.2%) moderate, and 497 (44.3%) low viral load. In univariate analyses, compared to patients with moderate or low viral load, patients with high viral load were older, had more often comorbidities, developed symptomatic disease, were intubated and died; in addition, patients with high viral load had longer stay in intensive care unit and longer intubation compared to patients with low viral load (p-values <0.05 for all). Patients with chronic cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic pulmonary disease, immunosuppression, obesity and chronic neurological disease had more often high viral load (p-value<0.05 for all).

We hypothesized that tumor lymphovascular invasion (LVI) at the primary tumor site favors lymphatic and not blood vessel, capillaries, and systemic metastases (Smets) are dependent upon regional lymph node (RLN) mets. METHODS: Data from BC patients undergoing RLN biopsy was professionally abstracted and maintained in a prospective, precisely managed, single-institution database. Associations of RLN, LVI, and Smets were estimated by univariate and multivariate backward logistic regression models and patient-affiliated demographic, clinicopathologic, treatment type, and molecular marker data. RESULTS: Of 3329 patients, followed 1C22 years (mean 7.8), 463 of 3329 (13.9%) showed LVI, 742 of 3329 (22.3%) had RLN mets, and 262 of 3329 (7.9%) had Smets. Smets occurred in 52 of 252 (21% with LVI+/RLN+); 116 of 2301 (5% with LVI?/RLN?); 65 of 465 (14% with LVI?/RLN+); and 17 of 207 (8% with LVI+/RLN?), p = 0.021 for association between LVI and Smets for RLN+ patients but not for RLN? patients (p = 0.051). Positive RLN, larger tumor size, and higher grade (all p < 0.001) were predictive of Smets by the multivariable model, whereas positive LVI was not. CONCLUSIONS: LVI predicts RLN mets in BC. RLN is critical to Smets from BC, whereas LVI on its own is not. Smets occur significantly more commonly when both LVI and RLN mets occur together. LVI is, thus, likely to be primarily lymphatic invasion, and rarely, blood vessel invasion, supporting the Halsted paradigm. LVI and RLN together predict clinical outcome better than either alone.

METHODS: A nationwide ecologic study based on open-sourced, anonymized, aggregated data provided by the Israel Ministry of Health. The correlations between municipal SES, vaccination percentage and active COVID-19 cases during the vaccination campaign were analysed by using weighted Pearson correlations. To assess the adequacy of first dose vaccination rollout relative to the municipality COVID-19 disease burden, a metric termed the vaccination need ratio was devised by dividing the total number of active cases (per 10 000 people) by the vaccination percentage of the population over 60 in each municipality, and its correlation with the SES was examined. RESULTS: 23 days after initiation of the vaccination campaign, 760 916 (56.8%) individuals over the age of 60 were vaccinated in Israel with the first dose of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. A negative correlation was found between the COVID-19 active case burden and the vaccination percentage of the study population in each municipality (r = -0.47, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.30). The vaccination percentage significantly correlated with the municipal SES (r = 0.83, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.87). This finding persisted but was attenuated over a 5-week period. A negative correlation between the vaccination need ratio and municipal SES (r = -0.80, 95% CI -0.88 to -0.66) was found.

It is expected that many patients will add other symptomatic/adjuvant treatments, such as herbal medicines. AIMS: To provide a benefits/risks assessment of selected herbal medicines traditionally indicated for respiratory diseases within the current frame of the COVID-19 pandemic as an adjuvant treatment. METHOD: The plant selection was primarily based on species listed by the WHO and EMA, but some other herbal remedies were considered due to their widespread use in respiratory conditions. Preclinical and clinical data on their efficacy and safety were collected from authoritative sources. The target population were adults with early and mild flu symptoms without underlying conditions. These were evaluated according to a modified PrOACT-URL method with paracetamol, ibuprofen, and codeine as reference drugs. The benefits/risks balance of the treatments was classified as positive, promising, negative, and unknown. RESULTS: A total of 39 herbal medicines were identified as very likely to appeal to the COVID-19 patient. According to our method, the benefits/risks assessment of the herbal medicines was found to be positive in 5 cases (Althaea officinalis, Commiphora molmol, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Hedera helix, and Sambucus nigra), promising in 12 cases (Allium sativum, Andrographis paniculata, Echinacea angustifolia, Echinacea purpurea, Eucalyptus globulus essential oil, Justicia pectoralis, Magnolia officinalis, Mikania glomerata, Pelargonium sidoides, Pimpinella anisum, Salix sp, Zingiber officinale), and unknown for the rest. On the same grounds, only ibuprofen resulted promising, but we could not find compelling evidence to endorse the use of paracetamol and/or codeine.

In both 2019 and 2020, the largest subgroup of patients were those with non-anginal chest pain (64%, 71%). There were significant differences in investigation and management between the two cohorts (Figure 1). In 2020, a higher proportion of patients were discharged with no investigation (57% vs 23%, p<0.0001). This was driven primarily by changes in management of patients with non-anginal chest pain. There were significantly higher rates of investigation of this subgroup in 2019 by either CT Coronary Angiography (25% versus 4.5%, p<0.001) or functional testing (25% versus 6.5%, p<0.001), with a much higher rate of reassurance and discharge in 2020 (81% versus 36%, p<0.0001). More patients received coronary intervention in 2019 than in 2020 (2.4% vs 0%, p=0.02). In 2020, higher proportions of patients were commenced on medical therapy without further investigation when presenting with atypical (28% versus 1%, p<0.0001) or typical angina (63% versus 11.4%, p<0.0001) (Figure 2). There was no significant difference in the 12 month combined safety endpoint (1.3% in 2019 versus 2.3% in 2020, p=0.39), and no reported cardiac deaths. CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic, as expected, fewer patients were investigated for coronary artery disease, with the preference being to commence medical therapy initially. This did not have a significant effect on safety endpoints. Importantly, clinicians felt comfortable with assessing and discharging patients with non-anginal chest pain remotely in 2020. This is key to the viability of a remote RACPC model, as this subgroup forms the majority of the referrals. We suggest that RACPC is appropriate for a remote model in the long term, in view of the relatively low-risk population and clear management guidelines.

A subproject of CoVaKo aims to identify adverse events of the COVID-19 vaccine and to compare these to adverse events of other vaccines in an online survey. A prior feasibility study was conducted to test study materials for comprehensibility, visual design and motivation to participate and secondly, to test practical implementation and realization in primary care practices and vaccination centres. Methods: : A mixed-methods design was used. Three focus groups with general population participants were performed to evaluate the study materials and survey. Second, a test-roll-out was conducted in vaccination centres and primary care practices, which involved implementation and quantitative evaluation of the online survey. Third, interviews were conducted with participating general practitioners and heads of vaccination centres four weeks after the test-roll-out. Results: : Parts of the study information and registration form proved incomprehensible in the recruitment material and/or online survey. For example, headings were misleading since the COVID-19 vaccination was overemphasized in the title as compared to other vaccinations. Participants requested more information on the procedure and completion time. In 31 days, 2199 participants who received either a COVID-19 vaccination (99 %) or at least one of the control vaccinations (1 %) registered for the study. Participants (strongly) agreed that the registration process was easy to understand, that all relevant information was provided, the completion time was reasonable and technical framework manageable. Physicians and heads of the vaccination centres perceived the study as easy to integrate into their workflow and most of them were willing to participate in the main study. Conclusions: : Our study indicated that capturing adverse events after vaccinations with an online survey is feasible. Testing of materials and surveys provided valuable improvements. Participation of health professionals is important to ensure practicality of the procedures. Flexible adaptation of the study organization to changing structures and requirements is necessary for a successful implementation, especially due to dynamic changes in COVID-19 vaccination strategies.

METHODS: Employing a statistical model that is considered to capture the data-generating process of the outbreak and virus surveillance, maximum likelihood estimation of the asymptomatic ratio was implemented. RESULTS: Assuming that all norovirus outbreaks (n = 55) were the result of random sampling from an identical distribution and ignoring genogroup and genotype specificities, the asymptomatic ratio was estimated at 32.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27.7C36.7). Although not significant, separate estimation of the asymptomatic ratio of the GII.4 genotype appeared to be greater than other genotypes and was estimated at 40.7% (95% CI, 32.8C49.0). CONCLUSION: The present study offered the first explicit empirical estimates of the asymptomatic ratio of norovirus infection in natural infection settings. The estimate of about 30% was consistent with those derived from volunteer challenge studies.

It can appear weeks after infection irrespective of the severity of the illness1. It can affect most, if not all, body systems including heart, lung, kidney, skin, and brain functions. Here we present a case with Covid-19 infection with hyporcortisolism presenting as dyspnea and fatigue as the dominant long Covid-19 symptom. CASE PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old female with a past medical history of hyperthyroidism on propranolol, was diagnosed with mild COVID -19 infection, advised to treat with self-isolation. She revisited ER 6 weeks later with persistent dyspnea, fatigue, and poor ability to focus and concentrate. She was given a trial of the direct oral anticoagulant for 4 weeks with no change in her symptoms. The subsequent workup done;head-computer tomography scan (CTS) was negative for subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral venous thrombosis. The Lungs CTS did not reveal any pulmonary fibrosis. The 6-minute walk test was impaired at 79%. The Pulmonary Function test did not show any significant obstruction or restriction. The Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test overall was suggestive of deconditioning. The laboratory work included creatine kinase, Aldolase, vitamin B12, Folic acid, C-reactive protein, Vitamin D, Antinuclear antibody Thyroid Function test all were unremarkable. The AM cortisol level came back as less than 2. The patient was started on oral prednisone for a diagnosis of relative adrenal insufficiency. All her symptoms improved within 2 weeks of treatment and resolved after 4 -6 weeks, she was tapered down and finally weaned off prednisone. DISCUSSION: The proposed mechanism of COVID-19 induced relative adrenal insufficiency is likely hypophysitis.2 The principal target for the virus entry is the angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor which is found on pneumocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells of many organs including adrenal glands and hypothalamic and pituitary tissues2. Furthermore, SARS- Cov2 virus has amino acid sequences which are similar to the host's ACTH, so antibodies made against the virus destroys the host ACTH and consequently may cause contribute to cortisol insufficiency.2,3 CONCLUSIONS: Post COVID-19 infection has a multifaceted manifestation. Hypocortisolism can persist in patients with post COVID-19 and should be sought for if the symptoms are suggestive. The treatment is simple and effective. REFERENCE #1: Naserghandi, S.F.

This study aimed to assess primary healthcare physicians satisfaction towards work safety and personal protective equipment and their predictors during early stages of COVID-19 pandemic in Qatar. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted in 27 primary healthcare centers in Qatar from 1st June to 30 July 2020. Descriptive and analytical statistics were used when appropriate. A multivariable linear regression analysis was done to identify predictors of satisfaction among participants. RESULTS: A total of 262 participants completed the questionnaire with a response rate of 58.2%. 51.9% were males and 68.3% were family physicians. Only 14.9% and 17.2% of respondents were satisfied or highly satisfied about the overall safety of work and the clinical guidelines on the use of PPE in the context of COVID-19 respectively. Participants who were general practitioners were significantly more likely to be satisfied with maintaining work safety and local PPE guidelines compared to family physicians by 2.93 scores (95% CI 1.43, 4,43 p -value <0.001), and 2.82 scores (95% CI 1.19, 4,44 p -value 0.001) respectively.

However, disparities exist between evidence-based recommendations and clinical practice. Research that quantifies the real-world effect of COPD regimen alignment with the GOLD recommendations on clinical and economic outcomes is needed. OBJECTIVE: To compare COPD-related health care resource utilization (HRU) and costs, as well as exacerbation rates, among patients with COPD on maintenance therapy based on 2017 GOLD treatment recommendation compliance status per GOLD ABCD risk group classification in a U.S. commercially insured/Medicare Advantage population. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized administrative claims data in the HealthCore Integrated Research Database. The COPD population was identified using a previously validated claims-based predictive model. Among this population, patients with  1 claim for a COPD maintenance medication (earliest maintenance fill-date = index date) between January 1, 2014, and March 31, 2017, were identified. Patients were required to be aged  40 years, have  12 months of pre-index and  30 days of post-index health plan enrollment, with no diagnosis for asthma, cystic fibrosis, and/or lung cancer at any time from January 1, 2013, to March 31, 2018. Patients were categorized into exacerbation risk/symptomatology groups according to the 2017 GOLD ABCD assessment recommendations and were then classified into treatment-compliance status based on their maintenance therapy. Multivariable analyses were conducted to examine post-index COPD-related HRU, costs, and exacerbations by compliance status. RESULTS: The primary analytical study sample included 38,382 patients in the GOLD A/B group and 6,525 in the GOLD C/D group. Patients were further categorized into GOLD A (n = 19,345), B (n = 19,037), C (n = 1,865), and D (n = 4,670). GOLD-compliant regimens were observed in 32.9% of patients in the GOLD A/B group and in 58.9% of patients in the GOLD C/D group. Inhaled corticosteroid-containing regimens were the most commonly observed noncompliant regimen. Patients on compliant regimens had significantly fewer COPD-related inpatient and emergency department visits and therefore had significantly lower COPD-related medical costs in both the GOLD A/B and C/D cohorts. Similar results were observed for individual GOLD cohorts B, C, and D. These savings were offset by increased pharmacy expenditures. Being on GOLD guideline-compliant regimens significantly reduced the risk of exacerbation by 8% (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92; P < 0.0001) in the GOLD A/B cohort and by 12% (HR = 0.88; P = 0.0005) in the GOLD C/D cohort, and was also associated with a significantly reduced exacerbation rate in the GOLD A/B (rate ratio [RR] = 0.93; P < 0.0001) and GOLD C/D (RR = 0.93; P = 0.0129) groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a continuing trend of high prevalence of suboptimal prescriber compliance to GOLD treatment recommendations. Treatment regimens compliant with GOLD recommendations were associated with improvement in exacerbations, reduced COPD-related HRU, and COPD-related medical cost offsets.

In this study we will develop, pilot and evaluate the effectiveness of a comprehensive antibiotic stewardship programme in China's primary care hospitals to reduce inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for acute respiratory infections among all ages. METHODS: We will use a parallel-group, cluster-randomised, controlled, superiority trial with blinded outcome evaluation but unblinded treatment (providers and patients). We will randomise 34 primary care hospitals from two counties within Guangdong province into the intervention and control arm (1:1 overall ratio) stratified by county (8:9 within-county ratio). In the control arm, antibiotic prescribing and management will continue through usual care. In the intervention arm, we will implement an antibiotic stewardship programme targeting family physicians and patients/caregivers. The family physician components include: (1) training using new operational guidelines, (2) improved management and peer-review of antibiotic prescribing, (3) improved electronic medical records and smart phone app facilitation. The patient/caregiver component involves patient education via family physicians, leaflets and videos. The primary outcome is the proportion of prescriptions for acute respiratory infections (excluding pneumonia) that contain any antibiotic(s). Secondary outcomes will address how frequently specific classes of antibiotics are prescribed, how frequently key non-antibiotic alternatives are prescribed and the costs of consultations. We will conduct a qualitative process evaluation to explore operational questions regarding acceptability, cultural appropriateness and burden of technology use, as well as a cost-effectiveness analysis and a long-term benefit evaluation. The duration of the intervention will be 12 months, with another 24 months' post-trial long-term follow-up.

Despite this, the initial step of recipient hepatectomy has not been the focus of clinical research thus far. Due to advanced coagulopathy in liver transplant recipients, this part of the operation still carries the risk of severe hemorrhage. This trial is designed to compare an electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing device (LigaSure?) and an ultrasound dissector (HARMONIC ACE?+7) with standard surgical techniques during the recipients' hepatectomy in liver transplantation. METHODS/DESIGN In a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel, three-armed, confirmatory, open trial, LigaSure? and HARMONIC ACE?+7 will be compared with standard surgical techniques that use titanium clips and conventional knot-tying ligations during recipient hepatectomy in liver transplantation. Intraoperative total blood loss is the primary endpoint of the trial. Secondary endpoints include blood loss during hepatectomy, the duration of both the hepatectomy and the entire surgical procedure, and blood transfusion requirements of the procedure. To generate reliable data, intraoperative blood loss will be recorded with respect to all rinse fluids during surgery, ascites, and by weighing used swabs. At 80% power and an alpha of 0.025 for both of the experimental groups, 23 subjects will be analyzed per protocol in each study arm in order to detect clinically relevant reduction of intraoperative blood loss. The intention-to-treat analysis will include 69 patients.

There is little information on safe transitioning from hospital back to the community for patients who have had diabetes therapies adjusted in hospital and it is unclear whether newer technologies may facilitate this process. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine whether offering CGM on discharge would be acceptable and if CGM initiated on hospital discharge in people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) would reduce hospital re-presentations at 1 month. METHODS: This was an open-label study. Adult inpatients with T2DM, who were to be discharged home and required postdischarge glycemic stabilization, were offered usual care consisting of clinic review at 2 weeks and at 3 months. In addition to usual care, participants in the intervention arm were provided with a Libre flash glucose monitoring system (Abbott Australia). An initial run-in phase for the first 20 participants was planned, where all consenting participants were enrolled in an active arm. Subsequently, all participants were to be randomized to the active arm or usual care control group. RESULTS: Of 237 patients screened during their hospital admission, 34 had comorbidities affecting cognition that prevented informed consent and affected their ability to learn to use the CGM device. In addition, 21 were not able to be approached as the material was only in English. Of 101 potential participants who fulfilled eligibility criteria, 19 provided consent and were enrolled. Of the 82 patients who declined to participate, 31 advised that the learning of a new task toward discharge was overwhelming or too stressful and 26 were not interested, with no other details. Due to poor recruitment, the study was terminated without entering the randomization phase to determine whether CGM could reduce readmission rate.

Our approach painstakingly incorporates a watermark into the chosen NIfTI image slice, aiming to accurately fit the watermark, while preserving the medical information contained in the slice. Specifically, the original image was converted through the lifting wavelet transform (LWT), realizing excellent modification during insertion. Next, Z transform was applied over the low-low (LL) band, and the Hessenberg decomposition (HD) was performed on the transformed band, which contains the maximum energy of the image. Afterwards, Arnold Cat map was employed to scramble the watermark, before inserting it into the slice. Simulation results show that our approach strikes a perfect balance between security, imperceptibility, and robustness against various attacks, as suggested by metrics like peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), normalized correlation (NC), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and universal image quality index Q.","output":"Authentication of NIfTI Neuroimages Using Lifting Wavelet Transform, Arnold Cat Map, Z-Transform, and Hessenberg Decomposition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Egypt reacted in an unexpectedly quick and professional approach at the start of the pandemic.

These factors combined led to a dramatic change in the government strategy as it changed from prevention and containment strategies to relaxing the measures before reaching the peak of the disease. Despite fluctuations in government performance, it managed to adopt an empathetic tone and cut through the polarised and politicised information environment. It also succeeded in presenting a new technocratic civilian leadership, in opposition to the single leadership and security apparatus Egyptians are used to.

PPE usage causes headache in majority of users. We evaluated changes in cerebral hemodynamics among healthcare-workers using PPE. METHODS: Frontline healthcare-workers donning PPE at our tertiary center were included. Demographics, co-morbidities and blood-pressure were recorded. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring of middle cerebral artery was performed with 2-MHz probe. Mean flow velocity (MFV) and pulsatility index (PI) were recorded at baseline, after donning N95 respirator-mask, and after donning powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR), when indicated. End-tidal carbon-dioxide (ET-CO2) pressure was recorded for participants donning PAPR in addition to the N95 respirator-mask. RESULTS: A total of 154 healthcare-workers (mean age 29  12 years, 67% women) were included. Migraine was the commonest co-morbidity in 38 (25%) individuals while 123 (80%) developed de-novo headache due to N95 mask. Donning of N95 respirator-mask resulted in significant increase in MFV (4.4  10.4 cm/s, p < 0.001) and decrease in PI (0.13  0.12; p < 0.001) while ET-CO2 increased by 3.1  1.2 mmHg (p < 0.001). TCD monitoring in 24 (16%) participants donning PAPR and N95 respirator mask together showed normalization of PI, accompanied by normalization of ET-CO2 values within 5-min. Combined use of N95 respirator-mask and PAPR was more comfortable as compared to N95 respirator-mask alone. CONCLUSION: Use of N95 respirator-mask results in significant alterations in cerebral hemodynamics. However, these effects are mitigated by the use of additional PAPR.

Moreover, live vaccines can be used as carrier systems for heterologous antigens or therapeutic factors. In each case, the development of a recombinant live attenuated vaccine is a complex task where properties such as targeting specificity, antigen synthesis, antigen release, and safety aspects have to be integrated. A range of such recombinant vaccine candidates have successfully been tested in the clinics, but very few have been approved so far.

IFN-s are IFN-1 (IL-29), IFN-2 (IL-28a), IFN-3 (IL-28b) and IFN-4, which resembles IFN-3. IFN-s have type I-IFN-like immune responses and biological activities, but our knowledge of these novel players in the antiviral response is not well established. In this review, we try to describe the current information on the expression and function of IFN-s in the innate antiviral immune defense and IFN-2's role in regulating and shaping the adaptive immune response. We suggest that IFN-s are key antiviral cytokines, directly performing an antiviral immune response at epithelial surfaces in the early stages of viral infection, and that these cytokines also skew the balance of Th1 and Th2 cells to Th1 phenotype.

A recent hypothesis could shed some light on both aspects. Specifically, it has been proposed that in the subject-to-subject transfer SARS-CoV-2 conserves on its capsid the erythrocytes' antigens of the source subject. Thus these conserved antigens can potentially cause an immune reaction in a receiving subject that has previously acquired specific antibodies for the source subject antigens. This hypothesis implies a blood type-dependent infection rate. The strong geographical dependence of the blood type distribution could be, therefore, one of the factors at the origin of the observed heterogeneity in the epidemics spread. Here, we present an epidemiological deterministic model where the infection rules based on blood types are taken into account and compare our model outcomes with the exiting worldwide infection progression data.

In contrast, the non-IL-2-producing effector cells respond to IL-2 signals and gain effector traits at the expense of memory formation. Despite having distinct properties during the effector phase, IL-2-producing and nonproducing CD8 T cells appear to converge transcriptionally as memory matures to form populations with equal recall abilities.

Background: Neurotologic microsurgery requires work at the limits of human visual and tactile capabilities. Anatomy localization comes at the expense of invasiveness caused by exposing structures and using them as orientation landmarks. In the absence of more-precise and less-invasive anatomy localization alternatives, surgery poses considerable risks of iatrogenic injury and sub-optimal treatment. There exists an unmet clinical need for an accurate, precise, and minimally-invasive means for anatomy localization and instrument navigation during neurotologic surgery. Freehand stereotactic image-guidance constitutes a solution to this. While the technology is routinely used in medical fields such as neurosurgery and rhinology, to date, it is not used for neurotologic surgery due to insufficient accuracy of clinically available systems. Materials and Methods: A freehand stereotactic image-guidance system tailored to the needs of neurotologic surgeryCmost importantly sub-half-millimeter accuracyCwas developed. Its TRE was assessed preclinically using a task-specific phantom. A pilot clinical trial targeting N = 20 study participants was conducted (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03852329) to validate the accuracy and usefulness of the developed system. Clinically, objective assessment of the TRE is impossible because establishing a sufficiently accurate ground-truth is impossible. A method was used to validate accuracy and usefulness based on intersubjectivity assessment of surgeon ratings of corresponding image-pairs from the microscope/endoscope and the image-guidance system. Results: During the preclinical accuracy assessment the TRE was measured as 0.120  0.05 mm (max: 0.27 mm, (TRE) + 3(TRE) = 0.27 mm, N = 310). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study was terminated early after N = 3 participants. During an endoscopic cholesteatoma removal, a microscopic facial nerve schwannoma removal, and a microscopic revision cochlear implantation, N = 75 accuracy and usefulness ratings were collected from five surgeons each grading 15 image-pairs. On a scale from 1 (worst rating) to 5 (best rating), the median (interquartile range) accuracy and usefulness ratings were assessed as 5 (4C5) and 4 (4C5) respectively.

PURPOSE: : At present, there is no Food and Drug Administration-approved drug or vaccine available to treat this disease. Still, people are trying various pre-existing medicines that are known to have anti-viral or anti-parasitic effects. In view of this, the present study aimed to study the binding potential of various phytochemicals present in multiple natural plant extract as a secondary metabolite to non-structural protein 15 (Nsp15) protein, a drug target known to play a crucial role in virulence of coronavirus. METHOD: : Nsp15 protein was selected because it shows 89% similarity to the other SARS-CoV, which caused the earlier outbreak. The assumption is that inhibition of Nsp15 slowdowns the viral replication. Phytochemicals are selected as these are present in various plant parts (seed, flower, roots, etc.), which are used in different food cuisines in different geographical regions across the globe. The molecular docking approach was performed using two different software, i.e., Autodock, and Swissdock, to study the interaction of various phytochemicals with Nsp15 protein. Hydroxychloroquine is used as a positive control as it is used by medical professionals showing some positive effects in dealing with coronavirus. RESULTS: : The present study demonstrated the binding potential of approximately 50 phytochemicals with Nsp15 and capable of inhibiting the viral replication, although in vitro and in vivo tests are required to confirm these findings. CONCLUSIONS: : In conclusion, the present study successfully demonstrated the binding of phytochemicals such as sarsasapogenin, ursonic acid, curcumin, ajmalicine, novobiocin, silymarin and aranotin, piperine, gingerol, rosmarinic acid, and alpha terpinyl acetate to Nsp15 viral protein and they might play a key role in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication.","output":"Identification of phytochemicals as potential therapeutic agents that binds to Nsp15 protein target of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that are capable of inhibiting virus replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To describe the relationship between reported serious operational problems (SOPs), and mortality for patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). DESIGN: English national retrospective cohort study. SETTING: 89 English hospital trusts (i.e. small groups of hospitals functioning as single operational units). PATIENTS: All adults with COVID-19 admitted to ICU between 2nd April and 1st December, 2020 (n = 6,737). INTERVENTIONS: N/A MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hospital trusts routinely submit declarations of whether they have experienced serious operational problems in the last 24 hours (e.g. due to staffing issues, adverse weather conditions, etc.). Bayesian hierarchical models were used to estimate the association between in-hospital mortality (binary outcome) and: 1) an indicator for whether a SOP occurred on the date of a patients admission, and; 2) the proportion of the days in a patients stay that had a SOP occur within their trust. These models were adjusted for individual demographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity), and recorded comorbidities. RESULTS: Serious operational problems (SOPs) were common; reported in 47 trusts (52.8%) and were present for 2,701 (of 21,716; 12.4%) trust days. Overall mortality was 37.7% (2,539 deaths). Admission during a period of SOPs was associated with a substantially increased mortality; adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.34 (95% posterior credible interval (PCI): 1.07 to 1.68). Mortality was also associated with the proportion of a patients admission duration that had concurrent SOPs; OR 1.47 (95% PCI: 1.10 to 1.96) for mortality where SOPs were present for 100% compared to 0% of the stay. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Serious operational problems at the trust-level are associated with a significant increase in mortality in patients with COVID-19 admitted to critical care. The link isnt necessarily causal, but this observation justifies further research to determine if a binary indicator might be a valid prognostic marker for deteriorating quality of care.","output":"A national retrospective study of the association between serious operational problems and COVID-19 specific intensive care mortality risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), the most frequent cause of acute paralytic neuropathy, is an inflammatory polyneuropathy that is autoimmune in nature. Many infectious agents such as Campylobacter jejuni (the most commonly identified bacteria associated with GBS), cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, measles virus, influenza A virus, and Mycoplasma pneumonia, as well as enterovirus D68 and Zika virus and noninfectious agents such as vaccines and surgeries have been reported to trigger GBS. Three main variants of GBS include the classic acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), which is the most common presentation of GBS, Miller Fisher syndrome, and the recently defined axon loss variants (acute motor axonal neuropathy and acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy). One of the assumptions about the mechanisms of GBS is molecular mimicry, which is a process caused due to the structural resemblance between a microorganism and the host. The original concept of GBS is rooted in molecular mimicry defined as the similarity between the microorganisms' peptide sequences or epitopes and ganglioside sequences or structures. Since the coronavirus disease-2019 outbreak in January 2020 there have been cases of GBS reported.

Orthohantaviruses found in Eurasia cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and New World orthohantaviruses cause hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). However, cases of infection with Old World orthohantaviruses with severe pulmonary manifestations have also been observed. Therefore, human airway cells may represent initial targets for orthohantavirus infection and may also play a role in the pathogenesis of infections with Eurasian orthohantaviruses. METHODS: We analyzed the permissiveness of primary endothelial cells of the human pulmonary microvasculature and of primary human epithelial cells derived from bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli for Old World orthohantavirus Puumala virus (PUUV) in vitro. In addition, we examined the expression of orthohantaviral receptors in these cell types. To minimize donor-specific effects, cells from two different donors were tested for each cell type. RESULTS: Productive infection with PUUV was observed for endothelial cells of the microvasculature and for the three tested epithelial cell types derived from different sites of the respiratory tract. Interestingly, infection and particle release were also detected in bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells although expression of the orthohantaviral receptor integrin (3) was not detectable in these cell types. In addition, replication kinetics and viral release demonstrate enormous donor-specific variations. CONCLUSIONS: The human respiratory epithelium is among the first targets of orthohantaviral infection and may contribute to virus replication, dissemination and pathogenesis of HFRS-causing orthohantaviruses. Differences in initial pulmonary infection due to donor-specific factors may play a role in the observed broad variance of severity and symptoms of orthohantavirus disease in patients. The absence of detectable levels of integrin (V)(3) surface expression on bronchial and small airway epithelial cells indicates an alternate mode of orthohantaviral entry in these cells that is independent from integrin (3).","output":"Cells of the human respiratory tract support the replication of pathogenic Old World orthohantavirus Puumala"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Saudi Arabia has been severely affected by COVID-19 since March 2020.

We aimed to investigate the impact of social media infodemics on mental health status among health colleges students, as future healthcare workers, at Saudi universities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We used a cross-sectional web-based survey to collect data from 400 health colleges students. We assessed average time spent on social media and used the shortened Pittsburgh sleep quality index, generalized anxiety disorder scale, and Center for Epidemiology scale for depression to measure sleep quality, generalized anxiety disorder, and depressive symptoms. Generalized linear regression was used to determine associations with mental health burdens. Results: About 21.5% reported more than 3 hours/day of exposure to social media. Prevalence of poor sleep quality, anxiety, and depression disorders was 16%, 31%, and 24%, respectively. No significant difference was determined between males and females (P>0.05);however, a significant association was detected with time spent on social media (P<0.001). Conclusion: We found a significant mental health burden among health colleges students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Spending too much time on social media is a potential risk factor.

This study aimed to evaluate perception and satisfaction of health sciences students towards E-learning during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS A structured questionnaire was distributed to 2000 health care students either through email or social media platforms. The questionnaire was divided into two sections: the first section addressed demographic information such as age, education level, course of study, number of lectures attended and country. The second section gathered information on perception and satisfaction of students using 13 close-ended questions. Frequencies and percentages were assessed for demographic data, perception and satisfaction level of students. The paired sample t-test, independent t test and Spearman correlation were applied to evaluate statistical significance between different variables of the study. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS Data from 1255 participants were included at a response rate of 66.4%. More than one third (37%) of the students took 25 or more online E-learning sessions and 47% preferred Zoom as an online platform. Participants belonged to 11 countries from developed and developing nations. 41% reported interference of E-learning due to network problems. 60% considered that clinical and practical skills are best learned in clinics and laboratories.

Here we present a single center experience using Bamlanivimab and Casirivimab/Imdevimab to prevent hospitalizations due to SARS-COV-2. METHODS: Adult patients who tested positive for SARS-COV-2 in our health system were offered outpatient monoclonal antibody infusion if: (1) testing was done within the previous 7 days, (2) the patient had fewer than 10 days of symptoms, (3) the patient was not currently hospitalized, and (4) met at least 1 of 8 criteria in the FDA EUA Fact Sheet for Bamlanivimab and Casirivimab/Imdevimab. Patients who met the criteria were offered the monoclonal antibody available at time of infusion. Those who declined antibody infusion were used as potential controls. The primary outcome was the discrepancy in hospitalization rates at 14-days past the infusion date for patients receiving the monoclonal antibody regimen versus 14-days past when those in control group would have been scheduled for infusion had they accepted. Secondary outcomes included emergency room visits, duration of hospitalization, and Intensive Care Unit stays. Coarsened exact matching (CEM) was used to obtain balance between treatment and control groups. A logistic regression model measured statistical differences between the groups. RESULTS: Between November 23, 2021 and February 8, 2021, 5567 patients were offered a monoclonal antibody infusion. A total of 894 patients completed infusion who were able to be matched with patients in the control group.

However, in severe infections dysregulation of the complement system contributes to hyperinflammation. The influence of the novel IgM/IgA-enriched immunoglobulin preparation trimodulin on the complement pathway was investigated in in vitro opsonophagocytosis, binding and CDC assays. Immunoglobulin levels before and after trimodulin treatment were placed in relation to complement assessments in humans. In vitro, trimodulin activates complement and induces opsonophagocytosis, but also interacts with opsonins C3b, C4b and anaphylatoxin C5a in a concentration-dependent manner. This was not observed for standard intravenous IgG preparation (IVIg). Accordingly, trimodulin, but not IVIg, inhibited the downstream CDC pathway and target cell lysis. If applied at a similar concentration range in healthy subjects, trimodulin treatment resulted in C3 and C4 consumption in a concentration-dependent manner, which was extended in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia. Complement consumption is found to be dependent on underlying immunoglobulin levels, particularly IgM, pinpointing their regulative function in humans. IgM/IgA provide a balancing effect on the complement system. Trimodulin may enhance phagocytosis and opsonophagocytosis in patients with severe infections and prevent excessive pathogen lysis and release of harmful anaphylatoxins.","output":"The Dual Role of a Polyvalent IgM/IgA-Enriched Immunoglobulin Preparation in Activating and Inhibiting the Complement System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After more than a century since the first appearance of city diplomacy, cities capacity to act internationally is no more in doubt.

Dysregulation of lipid homeostasis, which often leads to adipocyte hypertrophy and/or ectopic lipid deposition in non-adipocyte cells such as muscle and liver, is linked to the development of insulin resistance. Similarly, an altered secretion profile of adipokines or imbalance between calorie intake and energy expenditure is associated with obesity, among other related metabolic disorders. In lungs, lipid-laden adipocyte-like cells known as lipofibroblasts share numerous developmental and functional similarities with adipocytes, and similarly influence alveolar lipid homeostasis by facilitating pulmonary surfactant production. Unsurprisingly, disruption in alveolar lipid homeostasis may propagate several chronic inflammatory disorders of the lung. Given the numerous similarities between the two cell types, dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying adipocyte development and function will offer valuable insights that may be applied to, at least, some aspects of lipofibroblast biology in normal and diseased lungs. FGF10, a major ligand for FGFR2b, is a multifunctional growth factor that is indispensable for several biological processes, including development of various organs and tissues such as the lung and WAT. Moreover, accumulating evidence strongly implicates FGF10 in several key aspects of adipogenesis as well as lipofibroblast formation and maintenance, and as a potential player in adipocyte metabolism.

Setting Thirteen geographically dispersed academic medical centers in the United States. Patients/Subjects We obtained daily ICU censuses from March 26 to June 30, 2020, as well as prepandemic ICU bed capacities. The primary outcome was daily census of ICU patients stratified by coronavirus disease 2019 and mechanical ventilation status in relation to ICU capacity. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results Prepandemic overall ICU capacity ranged from 62 to 225 beds (median 109). During the study period, the median daily coronavirus disease 2019 ICU census per hospital ranged from 1 to 84 patients, and the daily ICU census exceeded overall ICU capacity for at least 1 day at five institutions. The number of critically ill patients exceeded ICU capacity for a median (interquartile range) of 17 (12-50) of 97 days at these five sites. All 13 institutions experienced decreases in their noncoronavirus disease ICU population, whereas local coronavirus disease 2019 cases increased. Coronavirus disease 2019 patients reached their greatest proportion of ICU capacity on April 12, 2020, when they accounted for 44% of ICU patients across all participating hospitals.

The results were then divided in emergency and elective surgeries. To show the personal contacts of the patients in a university hospital, we calculated the patient pathway within the department of urology and urosurgery for April 2020. Therefor we used the electronic patient records. RESULTS: Altogether 7745 surgical procedures in 5985 patients were performed, whereby 39 (0.5%) SARS-CoV-2 tests were positive. 2833 (37%) surgical procedures were emergency cases and 4912 (63%) were elective procedures. 25 (0.9%) of the emergency group and 14 (0.3%) of the elective surgeries had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.

Although the exact etiopathogenesis of SLE is still enigmatic, it has been well demonstrated that a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors trigger a disturbance in immune responses and thereby participate in the development of this condition. Almost all available therapeutic strategies in SLE are primarily based on the administration of immunosuppressive drugs and are not curative. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a subset of non-hematopoietic adult stem cells that can be isolated from many adult tissues and are increasingly recognized as immune response modulating agents. MSC-mediated inhibition of immune responses is a complex mechanism that involves almost every aspect of the immune response. MSCs suppress the maturation of antigen-presenting cells (DC and MQ), proliferation of T cells (Th1, T17, and Th2), proliferation and immunoglobulin production of B cells, the cytotoxic activity of CTL and NK cells in addition to increasing regulatory cytokines (TGF- and IL10), and decreasing inflammatory cytokines (IL17, INF-?, TNF-, and IL12) levels. MSCs have shown encouraging results in the treatment of several autoimmune diseases, in particular SLE. This report aims to review the beneficial and therapeutic properties of MSCs; it also focuses on the results of animal model studies, preclinical studies, and clinical trials of MSC therapy in SLE from the immunoregulatory aspect.","output":"The immunomodulatory effects of mesenchymal stromal cell-based therapy in human and animal models of systemic lupus erythematosus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vertigo and balance disorders in Meniere's disease (MD) may have various etiology.

In contrast, populations of the reservoir hosts of zoonotic pathogens often appear to tolerate these infections with little evidence of disease. Why are viruses more dangerous in one species than another? Immunological studies investigating quantitative and qualitative differences in the host-virus equilibrium in animal reservoirs will be key to answering this question, informing new approaches for treating and preventing zoonotic diseases. Integrating an understanding of host immune responses with epidemiological, ecological, and evolutionary insights into viral emergence will shed light on mechanisms that minimize fitness costs associated with viral infection, facilitate transmission to other hosts, and underlie the association of specific reservoir hosts with multiple emerging viruses. Reservoir host studies provide a rich opportunity for elucidating fundamental immunological processes and their underlying genetic basis, in the context of distinct physiological and metabolic constraints that contribute to host resistance and disease tolerance.","output":"Reservoir Host Immune Responses to Emerging Zoonotic Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: We reviewed and compared current drug shortages and shortage management practices in six selected countries (Hungary, Belgium, Spain, Switzerland, Australia, United States) based on the most comprehensive national shortage databases for each country, for four Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) groups, to analyze the criticality of drug shortages across countries and identify best practices in shortage management strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Countries were selected to cover a wide geographical range of high-income nations where a lack of economic power as a potential source of drug shortages is not observable. ATC groups were selected based on a pre-examination of the databases to analyze groups most often in shortage, and groups where the absence of which could have a severe negative impact on treatment outcomes. The bias originating from the different reporting systems had to be reduced to gain comprehensive and comparable information. The first bias-reducing mechanism was transforming the raw number of shortages into proportion per million people. Secondly, critical cases were classified, and thirdly, critical cases were compared with the Word Health Organization (WHO) Essential Medicine Lists. RESULTS: The results indicate that every European country studied reports significantly higher total and critical shortages per population compared to the US and Australia. Within Europe, Hungary reports the highest number of cases both for total and critical shortages, while Spain has the lowest results in both aspects. While in the US and Australia critical shortages were observable in similar proportions across all ATC groups, in European countries ATC groups of anti-infectives for systemic use (J) and the nervous system (N) were found to account for a notably higher proportion of critical shortages. Current shortage management practices were examined in each country and classified into five groups to identify common best practices. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the different characterization of reporting systems, several bias-reducing mechanisms should be applied to compare and evaluate shortages. In addition, European harmonization should be initiated to create mutually acknowledged definitions and reporting systems, which could be the basis of good drug shortage handling practices in Europe.","output":"Proposal for Handling of Medicine Shortages Based on a Comparison of Retrospective Risk Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is currently causing a widespread outbreak centered on Hubeprovince, China and is a major public health concern Taxonomically 2019-nCoV is closely related to SARS-CoV and SARS-related bat coronaviruses, and it appears to share a common receptor with SARS-CoV (ACE-2) Here, we perform structural modeling of the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module Compared to SARS-CoV, we identify an extended structural loocontaining basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains, which we predict to be proteolytically-sensitive We suggest this looconfers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, and that the presence of this structural looin 2019-nCoV may affect virus stability and transmission","output":"Structural modeling of 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV) spike protein reveals a proteolytically-sensitive activation looas a distinguishing feature compared to SARS-CoV and related SARS-like coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The purpose of our study was to understand the perception of the Latino community in a rural state regarding COVID-19.

Pandemic-related restrictions have compelled programs to deliver content virtually. Study objectives were to determine (1) whether teaching mindfulness-based skills within physician assistant (PA) programs can promote well-being and (2) whether delivery type (virtual vs. in-person) can impact the effectiveness. METHODS: During this 2-year study, a brief mindfulness-based curriculum was delivered to incoming first-year students at six PA programs, while students at two programs served as controls. The curriculum was delivered in-person in year one and virtually in year two. Validated pre- and post-test survey items assessed mindfulness (decentering ability, present moment attention and awareness, and psychological flexibility) and well-being (perceived stress and life satisfaction). RESULTS: As expected, coping abilities and well-being were adversely impacted by educational demands. The mindfulness-based curriculum intervention was effective in increasing mindfulness and life satisfaction, while decreasing perceived stress when delivered in-person. Virtual curricular delivery was effective in decreasing perceived stress but not improving life satisfaction. Over half of the participants receiving the curriculum reported positive changes on mindfulness measures with approximately 14C38% reporting a change of greater than one standard deviation. Changes on mindfulness measures explained 30C38% of the reported changes in perceived stress and 22C26% of the changes in life satisfaction. Therefore, the mindfulness curriculum demonstrated statistically significant improvements in measures of mindfulness and mitigated declines in life satisfaction and perceived stress.

To date, little evidence on COVID-related concerns have been produced and no report has provided structured feedback from the point of view of people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism or of their family/carers. AIMS: To provide systemised evidence-based information of the priority concerns for people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Senior representatives of major UK-based professional and service-user representative organisations with a stake in the care of people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism were contacted to provide a list of concerns across three domains: 'mental health and challenging behaviour', 'physical health and epilepsy' and 'social circumstances and support'. The feedback was developed into statements on frequently reported priorities. These statements were then rated independently by expert clinicians. A video-conference meeting to reconcile outliers and to generate a consensus statement list was held. RESULTS: Thirty-two organisations were contacted, of which 26 (81%) replied. From the respondent's data, 30 draft consensus statements were generated. Following expert clinician review, there was initially strong consensus for seven statements (23%), increasing to 27 statements (90%) following video conferencing.

With the advent of over-the-scope clip (OTSC), scope-induced perforations are increasingly managed conservatively, though there is no study comparing this form of non-surgical treatment with surgery. We aimed to compare OTSC and surgery in the management of scope-induced perforation of the duodenum. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data of scope-induced duodenal perforation patients. Perforations identified and treated within 24 h of procedure were analyzed. Factors analyzed were spectrum, etiology, baseline parameters, perforation size, outcome, comorbidities, and duration of hospital stay. RESULTS: A total of 25 patients had type I duodenal perforations, out of whom five were excluded due to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Of the twenty, eight were treated with OTSC placement while the rest underwent surgery. Age was comparable and the majority were females. Baseline parameters and comorbidities were similar in both the groups. The median size of perforation was 1.5 cm in both the OTSC group and the surgical group. All patients were treated with standard of care according to institutional protocols. Patients in the OTSC group were started orally after 48 h of OTSC placement, while in the surgery group median time to oral intake was 7 days.

We report herein that these N-glycans regulate the proteolytic processing of MET and HGF induced MET signaling, and that this regulation is site specific. Inhibitors of N-glycosylation were found to suppress the processing and trafficking of endogenous MET in H1975 and EBC-1 lung cancer cells and exogenous MET in CHO-K1 cells. We purified the recombinant extracellular domain of human MET and determined the site-specific N-glycan structures and occupancy using mass spectrometry. The results indicated that most sites were fully glycosylated and that the dominant population was the complex-type. To examine the effects of the deletion of N-glycans of MET, we prepared endogenous-MET-knockout Flp-In CHO cells and transfected them with a series of N-glycan deletion mutants of MET. The results showed that several N-glycans are implicated in the processing of MET. The findings also suggested that the N-glycans of the SEMA domain of MET positively regulate HGF signaling, and the N-glycans of the region other than the SEMA domain negatively regulate HGF signaling. Processing, cell surface expression, and signaling were significantly suppressed in the case of the all-N-glycan deletion mutant.

However, a common limitation is inadequate reporting of the applicability of the intervention and trial results for people who are \\"socially disadvantaged\\" and this can affect policy-makers' decisions. We previously developed a framework for identifying health-equity-relevant trials, along with a reporting guideline for transparent reporting. In this study, we provide a descriptive assessment of health-equity considerations in 200 randomly sampled equity-relevant trials. METHODS We developed a search strategy to identify health-equity-relevant trials published between 2013 and 2015. We randomly sorted the 4316 records identified by the search and screened studies until 100 individually randomized (RCTs) and 100 cluster randomized controlled trials (CRTs) were identified. We developed and pilot-tested a data extraction form based on our initial work, to inform the development of our reporting guideline for equity-relevant randomized trials. RESULTS In total, 39 trials (20%) were conducted in a low- and middle-income country and 157 trials (79%) in a high-income country focused on socially disadvantaged populations (78% CRTs, 79% RCTs). Seventy-four trials (37%) reported a subgroup analysis across a population characteristic associated with disadvantage (25% CRT, 49% RCTs), with 19% of included studies reporting subgroup analyses across sex, 9% across race/ethnicity/culture, and 4% across socioeconomic status. No subgroup analyses were reported for place of residence, occupation, religion, education, or social capital. One hundred and forty-one trials (71%) discussed the applicability of their results to one or more socially disadvantaged populations (68% of CRT, 73% of RCT). DISCUSSION In this set of trials, selected for their relevance to health equity, data that were disaggregated for socially disadvantaged populations were rarely reported. We found that even when the data are available, opportunities to analyze health-equity considerations are frequently missed. The recently published equity extension of the Consolidated Reporting Standards for Randomized Trials (CONSORT-Equity) may help improve delineation of hypotheses related to socially disadvantaged populations, and transparency and completeness of reporting of health-equity considerations in RCTs.

Glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide have long been the standard of care. However, B-cell depletion therapy with rituximab has become available for treating antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV). More recently, avacopan, an inhibitor of the complement 5a receptor, was shown to have high efficacy in remission induction against AAV. Thus, treatment options for AAV have been expanded. In contrast, in large vessel vasculitis (LVV), including giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis, tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, was shown to be effective in suppressing relapse and has steroid-sparing effects. However, the relapse rate remains high, and other therapeutic options have long been awaited. In the last decade, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have emerged as therapeutic options for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Their efficacy has been proven in multiple studies; thus, JAK inhibitors are expected to be promising agents for treating other rheumatic diseases, including LVV. This mini-review briefly introduces the mechanism of action of JAK inhibitors and their efficacy in patients with RA. Then, the pathophysiology of LVV is updated, and a rationale for treating LVV with JAK inhibitors is provided with a brief introduction of our preliminary results using a mouse model.

Increasingly, there is an appreciation of the need to consider equity issues in the development and implementation of these plans, not least with respect to gender, given the demonstrated differences in the impacts both of the disease and of control measures on men, women, and non-binary individuals. Humanitarian crises, and particularly those resulting from conflict or violence, exacerbate pre-existing gender inequality and discrimination. To this end, there is a particularly urgent need to assess the extent to which COVID-19 response plans, as developed for conflict-affected states and forcibly displaced populations, are gender responsive. METHODS: Using a multi-step selection process, we identified and analyzed 30 plans from states affected by conflict and those hosting forcibly displaced refugees and utilized an adapted version of the World Health Organizations Gender Responsive Assessment Scale (WHO-GRAS) to determine whether existing COVID-19 response plans were gender-negative, gender-blind, gender-sensitive, or gender-transformative. RESULTS: We find that although few plans were gender-blind and none were gender-negative, no plans were gender-transformative. Most gender-sensitive plans only discuss issues specifically related to women (such as gender-based violence and reproductive health) rather than mainstream gender considerations throughout all sectors of policy planning. CONCLUSIONS: Despite overwhelming evidence about the importance of intentionally embedding gender considerations into the COVID-19 planning and response, none of the plans reviewed in this study were classified as gender transformative. We use these results to make specific recommendations for how infectious disease control efforts, for COVID-19 and beyond, can better integrate gender considerations in humanitarian settings, and particularly those affected by violence or conflict.

While NPM1 is nuclear and LONA cytoplasmic in wild-type NPM1 AML cells, LONA becomes nuclear as mutant NPM1 moves toward the cytoplasm.

In vivo, LONA overexpression acts as an oncogenic lncRNA reducing the survival of mice transplanted with AML cells and rendering AML tumors more resistant to AraC chemotherapy.

Forested areas remain the foci for malaria transmission due to favourable human and environmental factors. Here, we analysed the longitudinal data from 2000 to 2019 to see the trends in forest malaria in India. Population living in forested areas are major malaria contributors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 30 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into Control group and Model group. The rat model of RA was induced by using type II collagen in Model group. The primary synovial cells were isolated from the synovial tissues of the rats and were assigned into Control group, Model group, and lncRNA H19 inhibitor intervention group. 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining was applied to detect cell proliferation in each group. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was employed to determine the cell apoptosis in each group. Western blotting assay was adopted to measure the expression levels of Notch1 and hairy/enhancer of split-1 (Hes1) in each group of cells. RESULTS The RA score of the Model group was higher than that of the Control group. Compared to the Control group, the expression of lncRNA H19, Notch, and Hes1 of the synovial cells in the Model group were significantly elevated. Besides, the cell proliferation rate of the Model was also increased, while the cell apoptosis rate was decreased compared with those in the Control group. Moreover, in comparison with Model group, lncRNA H19 inhibitor intervention group exhibited a lowered lncRNA H19 level, remarkably reduced cell proliferation rate and protein levels of Notch1 and Hes1, as well as notably raised cell apoptosis rate.

Glial cell function is tightly controlled by cellular interactions in which cytokines are important messengers. Recent studies provide evidence that in particular chemokines are important modulators of glial cell function. During the course of CNS diseases like multiple sclerosis or Alzheimers disease, and in the corresponding animal models, the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 are abundantly expressed at sites of glial activation, arguing for an important role of these chemokines and their corresponding receptor CXCR3 in glial activation. To clarify the role of this chemokine system in glial cell activation, we characterized the impact of CXCR3 on glial activation in a model of toxic demyelination in which glial activation without a prominent influx of hematogenous cells is prototypical. METHODS: We investigated the impact of CXCR3 on cuprizone-induced demyelination, comparing CXCR3-deficient mice with wild type controls. The clinical course during cuprizone feeding was documented for five weeks and for the subsequent four days withdrawal of the cuprizone diet (5.5 weeks). Glial activation was characterized using histological, histomorphometric and phenotypic analysis. Molecular analysis for (de)myelination and neuroinflammation was applied to characterize the effect of cuprizone on CXCR3-deficient mice and control animals. RESULTS: CXCR3-deficient mice displayed a milder clinical course during cuprizone feeding and a more rapid body weight recovery after offset of diet. In the CNS, CXCR3 deficiency significantly attenuated the accumulation and activation of microglia and astrocytes. Moreover, a deficiency of CXCR3 reduced the expression of the microglial activation markers CD45 and CD11b. Compared to controls, we observed a vast reduction of RNA levels for proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines like Ccl2, Cxcl10, Tnf and Il6 within the CNS of cuprizone-treated mice. Lastly, CXCR3 deficiency had no major effects on the course of demyelination during cuprizone feeding. CONCLUSIONS: The CXCR3 chemokine system is critically involved in the intrinsic glial activation during cuprizone-induced demyelination, which significantly modulates the distribution of glial cells and the local cytokine milieu.","output":"CXCR3 modulates glial accumulation and activation in cuprizone-induced demyelination of the central nervous system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Promyelocytic Leukemia Nuclear Bodies (PML NBs) are nuclear membrane-less organelles physically associated with chromatin underscoring their crucial role in genome function. The H3.3 histone chaperone complex HIRA accumulates in PML NBs upon senescence, viral infection or IFN-I treatment in primary cells. Yet, the molecular mechanisms of this partitioning and its function in regulating histone dynamics have remained elusive. Here, by using specific siRNAs and protein Affimers, we identify intermolecular SUMO-SIM interactions as an essential mechanism for HIRA recruitment in PML NBs. In addition, we demonstrate that HIRA localization in the nuclear bodies is intimately linked to the presence of a soluble pool of H3.3-H4 dimers inside PML NBs, that is not found in cancer cells. Transcription inhibition prevents HIRA accumulation in PML NBs underscoring the importance of transcriptional activity to drive HIRA through PML NBs. Finally, in the context of inflammatory responses, HIRA and PML are necessary for the prolonged H3.3 deposition at the transcriptional end sites of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), well beyond the peak of transcription. We thus propose that HIRA partitioning in PML NBs is essential to regulate H3.3 deposition on transcriptionally active regions.","output":"Interplay between PML NBs and HIRA for H3.3 deposition on transcriptionally active interferon-stimulated genes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a rare monophasic immune-mediated inflammatory disorder characterized by multifocal demyelinating lesions of the central nervous system.

In order to build a useful disease diagnosis prediction system, advancement in both data representation and development of machine learning architectures are imperative. First, with respect to data collection and representation, we face severe problems due to multitude of formats and lack of coherency prevalent in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). This causes hindrance in extraction of valuable information contained in EHRs. Currently, no universal global data standard has been established. As a useful solution, we develop and publish a Python package to transform public health dataset into an easy to access universal format. This data transformation to an international health data format facilitates researchers to easily combine EHR datasets with clinical datasets of diverse formats. Second, machine learning algorithms that predict multiple disease diagnosis categories simultaneously remain underdeveloped. We propose two novel model architectures in this regard.

Despite the common use of vitamin B6 to control vomiting in children with gastroenteritis, no study has been performed in this field. This study aimed to assess the value of vitamin B6 in the prevention of vomiting in patients with mild to moderate gastroenteritis. METHODOLOGY: This study was a double blind controlled clinical trial on 96 children with mild to moderate gastroenteritis with age range of 6 months to 12 years admitted in Mofid Childrens Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups of 48 subjects matched for age, sex and symptoms of dehydration. Vitamin B6 was given in case group and control group was given placebo. The severity of dehydration and vomiting in patients before and after treatment were evaluated by a physician. All data were recorded in the questionnaire and results in the two treatment groups were compared by using SPSS software (Version 15, Chicago, IL, USA). RESULTS: The mean  SD age of patients whom underwent Vitamin B6 treatment was 2.92.4 versus 2.52 in placebo group. Significant difference between mean age, gender, and severity of dehydration in children of two groups wasnt observed. After treatment in both treatment groups, 40 patients (83.3%) had mild dehydration, and 8 patients (16.7%) had moderate dehydration. Vomiting was noted in 28 patients (58.3%) after treatment with vitamin B6 and in 37 patients (77.1%) after treatment with placebo. The mean frequency of vomiting after treatment with vitamin B6 was 1.71.3 times and in the control group (treated with distilled water) was 1.50.77 time, but no significant difference between the severity of dehydration, controlling vomiting and the mean frequency of vomiting was observed in both groups (P>0.05).

The results showed that NO2, PM2.5, O3, and SO2 concentrations obtained from the automatic ambient air quality monitoring station were reduced by 75.8, 55.9, 21.4, and 60.7%, respectively, compared with historical data. Besides, the concentration of PM2.5 at sampling sites declined by 41.8% during the partial lockdown. Furthermore, there was a drastic negative relationship between the boundary layer height (BLH) and the daily mean PM2.5 in Hanoi. The concentrations of Cd, Se, As, Sr, Ba, Cu, Mn, Pb, K, Zn, Ca, Al, and Mg during the partial lockdown were lower than those before the partial lockdown. The results of enrichment factor (EF) values and principal component analysis (PCA) concluded that trace elements in PM2.5 before the partial lockdown were more affected by industrial activities than those during the partial lockdown.","output":"Impact of Covid-19 partial lockdown on PM2.5, SO2, NO2, O3, and trace elements in PM2.5 in Hanoi, Vietnam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Leveraging previously identified viral interactions with human host proteins, we apply a machine learning-based approach to connect SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins to relevant host biological functions, diseases, and pathways in a large-scale knowledge graph derived from the biomedical literature. Our goal is to explore how SARS-CoV-2 could interfere with various host cell functions, and to identify drug targets amongst the host genes that could potentially be modulated against COVID-19 by repurposing existing drugs. The machine learning model employed here involves gene embeddings that leverage causal gene expression signatures curated from literature. In contrast to other network-based approaches for drug repurposing, our approach explicitly takes the direction of effects into account, distinguishing between activation and inhibition. RESULTS: We have constructed 70 networks connecting SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins to various biological functions, diseases, and pathways reflecting viral biology, clinical observations, and co-morbidities in the context of COVID-19. Results are presented in the form of interactive network visualizations through a web interface, the Coronavirus Network Explorer (CNE), that allows exploration of underlying experimental evidence. We find that existing drugs targeting genes in those networks are strongly enriched in the set of drugs that are already in clinical trials against COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The approach presented here can identify biologically plausible hypotheses for COVID-19 pathogenesis, explicitly connected to the immunological, virological and pathological observations seen in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The discovery of repurposable drugs is driven by prior knowledge of relevant functional endpoints that reflect known viral biology or clinical observations, therefore suggesting potential mechanisms of action. We believe that the CNE offers relevant insights that go beyond more conventional network approaches, and can be a valuable tool for drug repurposing.

The Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) concept has been pivotal in driving new imaging techniques. Metastasis to a SLN is a critical indicator of advanced disease. However, presently, few tools are available for imaging the lymphatics, and even fewer are available for locating the SLN for biopsy. Recently, new macromolecular agents, including gadolinium-labeled dendrimers, fluorescent quantum dots, and fluorescently-labeled immunoglobins, have been used to image the lymphatics and SLN with MRI and optical techniques, and new fluorescent nanoparticles such as upconverting nanocrystals are potential future agents. Additionally, multi-modality probes combining two modalities such as optical/MR dendrimers have been designed to provide both preoperative imaging, and intraoperative guidance during lymph node resections. These probes can map the lymphatic system for maximal therapeutic benefit while minimizing complications such as lymphedema. Advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic spread of tumors offer the opportunity for more targeted imaging of the lymphatic system. Additionally, these imaging agents could be used as powerful research tools for tracking immunological cells and monitoring the immune response as well as providing the means to deliver lymphatic-targeted therapies. The future holds great promise for the translation of these methods to the clinic.","output":"New approaches to lymphatic imaging."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individuals with severe mental illnesses (SMIs) may be disproportionately vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and psychological distress This study investigated the prevalence of engagement in COVID-19 preventative behaviors, predictors of these behaviors, and COVID-19-related psychological distress One hundred and sixty-three individuals with SMIs (94 with schizophrenia spectrum illnesses and 69 with affective disorders) and 27 psychiatrically healthy comparison participants were recruited from ongoing studies across 3 sites, to complete a phone survey querying implementation of 8 specific COVID-19 preventative behaviors that participants engaged in at least once in the past month as well as standard assessments of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, loneliness, and coping Data were collected between 3 April 2020 and 4 June 2020 The large majority of our SMI sample, which consisted of outpatients with relatively mild symptom severity, endorsed engaging in multiple preventative behaviors Relatively few differences were found between groups;however, individuals with SMI were less likely to work remotely than healthy individuals and individuals with schizophrenia spectrum illness were less likely to stay home as a preventative measure, wear face masks, and work remotely than individuals with affective disorders Differences in staying home remained after controlling for potential confounds Although individuals with SMI reported more psychological distress related to COVID-19, this distress was largely unrelated to engagement in preventative behaviors The large majority of individuals with SMI in this outpatient sample, regardless of broad diagnostic category, reported performing multiple behaviors intended to prevent COVID-19 infection at least once a month and reported distress associated with the pandemic These findings suggest a good level of awareness of COVID-19 among stable outpatients with SMI The degree to which more acutely ill persons with SMI engage in such preventative behaviors, however, remains to be examined","output":"COVID-19-related psychological distress and engagement in preventative behaviors among individuals with severe mental illnesses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study proposes a rapid and inexpensive thermocycler that enables rapid heating of samples using a thin glass chip and a cheap chip resistor to overcome the on-site diagnostic limitations of polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

In general, PCR microchips require a thin-film heater fabricated through a semiconductor process, which is a complicated process, resulting in high costs. Therefore, this investigation substituted a general chip resistor for a thin-film heater. The proposed thermocycler consists of a compact glass microchip of 12.5 mm  12.5 mm  2 mm that could hold a 2 L PCR sample and a surface-mounted chip resistor of 6432 size (6.4 mm  3.2 mm). Improving heat transfer from the chip resistor heater to the PCR reaction chamber in the microchip was accomplished via the design and fabrication of a three-dimensional chip structure using selective laser-induced etching, a rapid prototyping technique that allowed to be embedded. The fabricated PCR microchip was combined with a thermistor temperature sensor, a blower fan, and a microcontroller. The assembled thermocycler could heat the sample at a maximum rate of 28.8 C/s per second.

We report on the experience matured at the Regina Elena National Cancer Institute concerning the effects of the restriction measures adopted during the pandemic on the outcomes of surgical site infections (SSIs) in breast cancer patients (BC-pts) undergoing non-deferrable breast cancer surgery. Methods: : Within the frame of an observational study, we compared evidence from two cohorts, namely, the lockdown cohort (LDC) and non-lockdown cohort (NLDC). Patients from the LDC underwent breast cancer surgery between the 15 th March 2020 and the 4 th May 2020. Breast surgery was performed by the same team and postsurgical controls were performed regularly for a minimum of 12-months. SSIs were defined according to the criteria established by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Results: : The LDC originally included 79 breast cancer patients, of whom 62 provided data to the final analysis. In the LDC, initially 64 breast cancer patients, only 52 were finally considered. No relevant differences emerged between LDC and NLDC by general characteristics. We observed significant evidence of lower SSIs in the subgroups of patients having undergone skin reducing mastectomy compared with the remaining subgroups (p=0.003). The overall number of surgical site infections was 10 (8.7%), and the median time to their occurrence17.1 days (7- 42). In the NLDC, 7 (13.5) SSIs were identified, with a median time to occurrence of 18.2 days (7-42). In the LDC, 3 (4.8%) SSIs occurred, with a median time to occurrence of 14.3 days (7 to 21). None of these patients was in need of re-hospitalization and there were no delays in adjuvant treatment starting. Conclusions: : The restrictive measures issued during the lockdown period seemed to lower the SSI rates in breast cancer patients undergoing non-deferrable breast surgery, although, caution is needed due to the limited sample size.","output":"Surgical Site Infections in Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Surgery During the Covid-19 Pandemic.

Recent trials have suggested that its effect on long term functional outcome is neutral or negative, despite apparently promising preclinical data. Systematic review and meta-analysis is a useful tool to collate experimental data and investigate the basis of its conclusions. We searched three online databases to identify studies testing systemic hypothermia as monotherapy for treatment of animals subjected to a TBI. Data pertaining to TBI paradigm, animal subjects and hypothermia management were extracted as well as those relating to risk of bias. We pooled outcome data where sufficient numbers allowed and investigated heterogeneity in neurobehavioral outcomes using multivariate meta-regression. We identified 90 publications reporting 272 experiments testing hypothermia in animals subject to TBI. The subjects were mostly small animals, with well-established models predominating. Target temperature was comparable to clinical trial data but treatment was initiated very early. Study quality was low and there was some evidence of publication bias. Delay to treatment, comorbidity and blinded outcome assessment appeared to predict neurobehavioral outcome on multivariate meta-regression. Therapeutic hypothermia appears to be an efficacious treatment in experimental TBI, which differs from the clinical evidence. The preclinical literature showed limitations in quality and design and these both appeared to affect neurobehavioral experiment outcome.

White blood cells (WBCs), red blood cells, and platelets were counted immediately after blood collection. IL-6 levels were analyzed every 30 minutes using a commercial electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. RESULTS: Correlation coefficients between plasma IL-6 levels and WBC counts ranged between 0.605 and 0.554, higher than those for other cell types. The lowest IL-6 value in healthy individuals was estimated at 0.04 pg/mL and the mean values remained under 2 pg/mL over time.

Scientist/clinician-scientist training programs which provide salary awards as well as training and mentorship are a potential intervention to improve outcomes among women scientists. We hypothesized whether a programmatic approach to scientist/clinician-scientist training is associated with improved outcomes for women scientists in Canada when compared with salary awards alone. Trainees within the Kidney Research Scientist Core Education and National Training Program (KRESCENT), Canadian Child Health Clinician Scientist Program (CCHCSP), and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) salary award programs were evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the structured KRESCENT training program with salary support improves academic success for women scientists relative to salary awards alone. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Canadian national research scientist and clinician-scientist training programs and salary awards. PARTICIPANTS: KRESCENT cohort (n = 59, 2005-2017), CCHCSP cohort (n = 58, 2002-2015), and CIHR (n = 571, 2005-2015) Salary Awardees for postdoctoral fellows (PDF) and new investigators (NI). MEASUREMENTS: National operating grant funding success, achieving an academic position as an Assistant Professor for PDF, or achieving promotion to Associate Professor for NI. METHODS: The gender distribution of each cohort was determined using first name and NamepediA and was examined for PDF and NI, followed by a description of trainee outcomes by gender and training level. RESULTS: KRESCENT and CIHR PDF were balanced (12/27, 44% men and 55/116, 47% women) while CCHCSP had a higher proportion of women (13/20, 65%). KRESCENT and CCHCSP NI retained women scientists (19/32, 59% and 22/38, 58% women), whereas CIHR NI had fewer women (165/455, 36% women vs 290/455, 64% men, P = 0.01). There was a high rate of NI operating grant success (91%-95%) with no gender differences in each cohort. There was a high proportion of CCHCSP PDF who achieved an Assistant Professorship (18/20, 90%) that may be due in part to a longer follow-up period (9.3  3 years) compared with KRESCENT PDF (7/27, 26%, 0.88  4.5 years), and these data were not available for CIHR PDF. Women KRESCENT NI showed increased promotion to Associate Professor (P = 0.02, 0.25  3.2 years follow-up) and CCHCSP NI had high promotion rates (37/38, 97%, 6.9  3.6 years follow-up) irrespective of gender.

LIMITATIONS: KRESCENT and CCHCSP training program cohort size and heterogeneity; assigning gender by first name may result in misclassification; lack of data on the respective applicant pools; and inability to examine intersectionality with gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. CONCLUSION: Overall trainee performance across programs is remarkable by community standards regardless of gender. KRESCENT and CCHCSP training programs demonstrated balanced success in their PDF and NI, whereas the CIHR awardees had reduced representation of women scientists from PDF to NI. This exploratory study highlights the utility of programmatic training approaches like the KRESCENT program as potential tools to support and retain women scientists in the academic pipeline during the challenging PDF to NI transition period.","output":"Training Programs for Fundamental and Clinician-Scientists: Balanced Outcomes for Graduates by Gender"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Efficacious therapeutics for Ebola virus disease are in great demand.

With the current occurrence of pan-resistant bacterial infections and a paucity of novel antimicrobials in development, the world has entered a post-antibiotic era, in which previously treatable, common infections can become fatal. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS), defined as 'co-ordinated interventions to ensure appropriate and rational use of antimicrobials', aims to decrease rates of AMR. OBJECTIVES: To co-ordinate AMS in Western Cape Province. The National Department of Health (NDoH) has identified AMS as a key strategic objective, and the Western Cape has formed a provincial AMS committee. However, not much is known regarding current AMS activities in health facilities in the province. METHODS: A self-administered, email questionnaire was sent to specific staff at all district, regional and tertiary hospitals in the 6 health districts of the Western Cape - 47 facilities in total, of which 35 (74.4%) responded. Respondents included pharmacists, managers, doctors, nurses, infection prevention and control practitioners, as well as quality assurance practitioners. The number of facilities implementing AMS were determined, as well as the composition of AMS committees and the nature and frequency of team activities. Barriers to facility-level AMS were explored. Support and outreach activities were assessed, as well as facilities' needs and expectations of the provincial AMS committee. RESULTS: Approximately half of all responding hospitals (n=19; 54.3%) had active AMS committees. Double the proportion of metropolitan (83.3%) than rural facilities (39.1%) had committees. Stewardship activities included antimicrobial prescription chart reviews and audits, AMS ward rounds, antimicrobial restriction policies and training. Most committees included a pharmacist and an infection prevention and control practitioner. More than a third of hospitals (36.1%) did not review their antimicrobial consumption data on a regular basis. Just over half of the hospitals (n=18; 51.4%) did not review AMR patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the need for effective AMS, there is limited information on AMS in South Africa. Most assistance is required in rural areas and smaller hospitals with low numbers of staff and greater numbers of transient rotating junior staff. Information management support, multidisciplinary teamwork and clinical governance are required to enable regular and ongoing AMS in facilities.

Carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), and nitrous oxide (N 2O) are the primary greenhouse gases (GHGs) mainly responsible for the global warming and climate change. These GHGs have drawn lot of attention due to their significant role in the global warming potential. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested to stop global warming at 1.5oC above preindustrial levels as warming beyond this level might lead to heat extremes, alter insect and plant phenology (Phenological shifts) and more occurrence of vector borne diseases.

Global climate cycles and world food production systems are under threat due to the recent climate extreme events. These events include heat waves and change in the rainfall patterns. Thus, risk reduction intervention in the form of mitigation and adaptation is required to minimize the impacts of climate change. Mitigation option includes understanding the present and future components of the climate system and interaction among them through coupled modeling system i.e. Global Circulation Model (GCM).

In order to identify long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that may be involved in the development of CTEPH, comprehensive lncRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) profiling of endothelial tissues from the pulmonary arteries of CTEPH patients was conducted with microarray analysis. Differential expression of 185 lncRNAs was observed in the CTEPH tissues compared with healthy control tissues. Further analysis identified 464 regulated enhancer-like lncRNAs and overlapping, antisense or nearby mRNA pairs. Coexpression networks were subsequently constructed and investigated. The expression levels of the lncRNAs, NR_036693, NR_027783, NR_033766 and NR_001284, were significantly altered.

Objective: To evaluate the clinical characteristics of multiple sclerosis, including staging, degree of disability, and disease-modifying therapy use that are associated with worse outcomes from COVID-19. Design: Prospective cohort study looking at the outcomes of multiple sclerosis patients with COVID-19 between March 1st and May 18th, 2020. Setting: This is a multicenter study of three distinct hospital systems within the U.S. Participants: The study included 40 consecutive patients with nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection. Exposures: Multiple sclerosis staging, severe disability (based on baseline-extended disability status scale equal to or greater than 6.0) and disease-modifying therapy. Main Outcomes and Measure: Severity of COVID-19 infection was based on hospital course, where a mild course was defined as the patient not requiring hospital admission, moderate severity was defined as the patient requiring hospital admission to the general floor only, and most severe was defined as requiring intensive care unit admission and/or death. Results: For the 40 patients, the median age was 52(45.5-61) years, 16/40(40%) were male, and 21/40(52.5%) were African American. 19/40(47.5%) had mild courses, 15/40(37.5%) had moderate courses, and 6/40(15%) had severe courses. Patients with moderate and severe courses were significantly older than those with a mild course (57[50-63] years old and 66[58.8-69.5] years old vs 48[40-51.5] years old, P=0.0121, P=0.0373). There was differing prevalence of progressive multiple sclerosis staging in those with more severe courses (severe:2/6[33.3%]primary-progressing and 0/6[0%]secondary-progressing, moderate:1/14[7.14%] and 5/14[35.7%] vs mild:0/19[0%] and 1/19[5.26%], P=0.0075, 1 unknown). Significant disability was found in 1/19(5.26%) mild course-patients, but was in 9/15(60%, P=0.00435) of moderate course-patients and 2/6(33.3%, P=0.200) of severe course-patients. Disease-modifying therapy prevalence did not differ among courses (mild:17/19[89.5%], moderate:12/15[80%] and severe:3/6[50%], P=0.123). Conclusions and Relevance: Multiple sclerosis patients with more severe COVID-19 courses tended to be older, were more likely to suffer from progressive staging, and had a higher degree of disability. However, disease-modifying therapy use was not different among courses.","output":"COVID-19 in Multiple Sclerosis Patients and Risk Factors for Severe Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We consider a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) epidemiological model.

Therefore, the solution of this reduced stochastic dynamical system yields excellent agreement, both in amplitude and phase, with the solution of the original stochastic system for a temporal scale that is orders of magnitude longer than the typical relaxation time. This new method allows for improved time series prediction of the number of infectious cases when modeling the spread of disease in a population.

The influence of therapy for CP on spermatogenesis is well studied. However, recently, especially in the era of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19), much attention has been paid to the effects of cytokines on the pathogenesis of the inflammatory process, and their impact on male fertility. AIM: To study the effect of a complex of natural antimicrobial peptides and cytokines (Superlymph) on ejaculate, MAR test, oxidative stress (OS), and sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) in men with infertility and a history of CP. In some patients, the level of cytokines before and after treatment was determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 583 infertile men with a history of CP, aged 18-75 years, were screened according to the inclusion/ exclusion criteria. In group I, patients received antioxidant stimulation of spermatogenesis (triovit, trental, mexidol) in combination with a complex of natural antimicrobial peptides and cytokines (Superlymph) one suppository 25 IU at night for 20 days for 1-3 weeks and for 6-8 weeks for 2 months. In group II, antioxidant stimulation of spermatogenesis was prescribed along with suppositories for the prevention of CP for 2 months. The evaluated criteria included sperm analysis, MAR test, oxidative stress in spermatozoa (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) and SDF. The levels of seminal plasma cytokines were also measured before and after treatment in 32 patients using the Bio-Plex Pro panel for the simultaneous determination of 17 human cytokines, the Human Cytokine 17-plex Assay. Statistica-10 software was used for statistical analysis (p<0.05). RESULTS: Of 135 eligible patients, results were collected from 125 men (mean age 31.7 +/- 13.4 years). In group I, there was a more pronounced increase in motility by 42.3%, a decrease in the MAR-test level by 64.7%, oxidative stress in spermatozoa by 56.1%, and SDF by 25.6%, compared to group II (30.4 %, 10.5%, 45.7%, 21.9%), respectively. All these changes were significant with the exception of a decrease in the level of SDF. In group I, there was a predominant increase in the activity of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, 10, 13), a decrease in the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines ((IL-2, 12). In group II, there was a significant decrease in both pro-inflammatory (IL-2, 6, 8), and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4). The remaining changes were insignificant. Among mild side effects, there were a change in the color of the sclera in 4 (3.2%), anal pain in 3 (2.4%), a decrease in libido in 2 (1.6%) patients. No differences between groups in the frequency of side effects were recorded (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Antioxidant stimulation of spermatogenesis in infertile men and CP is an effective and safe. The addition of a complex of natural antimicrobial peptides and cytokines (Superlymph) leads to a more profound increase in sperm motility, a decrease in the MAR-test, oxidative stress in sperm cells, which potentiates the effects of therapy. The use of Superlymph is accompanied by a more pronounced positive effect on pathospermia, an increase in anti-inflammatory and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines. In the contrary, in control group, where patients received antioxidant stimulation of spermatogenesis, only a decrease in the level of main cytokines was observed. The effect of a complex of natural antimicrobial peptides and cytokines (Superlymph) on the level of SDF, as well as the relationship with fertility and childbirth rates, requires further study.","output":"[The use of a complex of natural antimicrobial peptides and cytokines for treatment of male infertility and chronic prostatitis]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current situation of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has paralyzed non-urgent and / or oncological surgery in many hospitals in our country with what it means for the health of citizens who are awaiting a surgical procedure.

Many studies include the mechanism of formation and inhibition of HS, but it is not fully understood yet. Circular RNA HECTD1 (circHECTD1), for the first time, has been found to have roles in HS physiology. We determined the relative circHECTD1 levels in HS fibrous cells and tissues by RT-qPCR. Afterward, the effect of circHECTD1 knockdown on the proliferation, migration, invasion, fibrosis, and Transforming Growth Factor-beta/small mothers against decapentaplegic (TGF-?/Smad) signaling was studied using CCK-8, wound healing, Transwell, and western blot assays. After the role of circHECTD1 was clarified, its targeted micro RNA (miR) was predicted using the Starbase database, and we constructed a miR-142-3p mimic to study the details of its regulation mechanism. We used the TargetScan database to predict the downstream target high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) of miR-142-3p, and the luciferase report assay verified the binding, and then its effect was determined by RT-qPCR. circHECTD1 is highly expressed in HS tissues and human skin hypertrophic scar fibroblasts (HSF); its loss of function inhibits cell proliferation, migration, invasion, fibrosis, and TGF-?/Smad signaling. However, miR-142-3p inhibitor reverses the effect of circHECTD1 on all the above-mentioned aspects, including HMGB1 expression.

This method was verified by comparing it with experimental and other numerical results. Good agreement was observed between airflow simulation and experimental data. It is also demonstrated that the LES carried out by the MRT-LB method can produce airflow results very similar to the RNG LES and provide better prediction than the standard and RNG kC models. In order to further improve the efficiency of the MRT-LB method, the multi-block grid refinement (MBGR) technique was used.

We aimed to establish an effective screening strategy in Shanghai, China, to aid early identification of patients with COVID-19. Methods: We did a multicentre, observational cohort study in fever clinics of 25 hospitals in 16 districts of Shanghai. All patients visiting the clinics within the study period were included. A strategy for COVID-19 screening was presented and then suspected cases were monitored and analysed until they were confirmed as cases or excluded. Logistic regression was used to determine the risk factors of COVID-19. Findings: We enrolled patients visiting fever clinics from Jan 17 to Feb 16, 2020. Among 53a??617 patients visiting fever clinics, 1004 (19%) were considered as suspected cases, with 188 (04% of all patients, 187% of suspected cases) eventually diagnosed as confirmed cases. 154 patients with missing data were excluded from the analysis. Exposure history (odds ratio [OR] 416, 95% CI 274-633; p<00001), fatigue (OR 156, 101-241; p=0043), white blood cell count less than 4a??a??109 per L (OR 244, 128-464; p=00066), lymphocyte count less than 08a??a??109 per L (OR 182, 100-331; p=0049), ground glass opacity (OR 195, 132-289; p=00009), and having both lungs affected (OR 154, 104-228; p=0032) were independent risk factors for confirmed COVID-19.

METHOD We conducted a cross-sectional study on March 29 to April 5, 2020 based on a national online survey using snowball sampling techniques. A list of emotional states was compared in HCW and non-HCW and within HCW roles. The relationship between COVID-19 related symptoms, information, and protective measures and the emotional state was analyzed. RESULTS Fear (p < .001, c = .11), irritability (p = .001, c = .08), frustration (p < .001, c = .10), anger (p = .013, c = .06), and helplessness (p < .001, c = .13) appear significantly more frequently in HCW compared to non-HCW. Within HCW, a higher percentage of physicians, especially the less experienced, significantly perceived uncertainty and frustration (p = .001, c = .13 and p = .025, c = .10, respectively), while a higher percentage of nurses significantly experienced sadness (p = .024, c = .10).

METHODS Using an online survey conducted during November 9-15, 2021, we collected the demographic data of 400 individuals and their responses to rating scales such as the CRBS, the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 items (SAVE-6), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 items (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items (PHQ-9). We conducted factor analyses and utilized item response theory to confirm the validity and reliability of the Korean version of the CRBS. RESULTS Factor analyses revealed that the single factor model of the Korean version of the CRBS showed a good fit with the CRBS (2=5.475, df=5, p value=0.361, 2/df=1.095, CFI=0.999, TLI=0.998, RMSEA=0.015). Multigroup CFA results indicated that the CRBS measures reassurance-seeking behaviors consistently across variables of sex, depression, general anxiety, and viral anxiety. The CRBS also exhibited good convergent validity with the SAVE-6 (r=0.431, p<0.001), GAD-7 (r=0.574, p<0.001), and PHQ-9 (r=0.575, p<0.001).

Resilience against antiviral drugs or fast evolutionary rate of viruses is stressing the scientific community to identify new therapeutic approaches for timely control of disease. Host metabolic pathways are exquisite reservoir of energy to viruses and contribute a diverse array of functions for successful replication and pathogenesis of virus. Targeting the host factors rather than viral enzymes to cease viral infection, has emerged as an alternative antiviral strategy. This approach offers advantage in terms of increased threshold to viral resistance and can provide broad-spectrum antiviral action against different viruses. The article here provides substantial review of literature illuminating the host factors and molecular mechanisms involved in innate/adaptive responses to viral infection, hijacking of signalling pathways by viruses and the intracellular metabolic pathways required for viral replication. Host-targeted drugs acting on the pathways usurped by viruses are also addressed in this study. Host-directed antiviral therapeutics might prove to be a rewarding approach in controlling the unprecedented spread of viral infection, however the probability of cellular side effects or cytotoxicity on host cell should not be ignored at the time of clinical investigations.","output":"Antiviral strategies targeting host factors and mechanisms obliging +ssRNA viral pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasing evidence indicates that mature B cells in the adjacent tumor tissue, both as an intermediate state, are vital in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC), which is associated with a low survival rate.

We analyzed B cells in the adjacent tissues of CRC samples from different stages using the dynamic network biomarker (DNB) method. Single-cell profiling of 725 CRC-derived B cells revealed the emergence of a mature B cell subtype. Using the DNB method, we identified stage II as a critical period before lymph node metastasis and that reversed difference genes triggered by DNBs were enriched in the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway involving B cell immune capability. DHX9 (DEAH-box helicase 9) was a specific para-cancerous tissue DNB key gene. The dynamic expression levels of DHX9 and its proximate network genes involved in B cell-related pathways were reversed at the network level from stage I to III.

Exposure to violence during the life of young people can increase mental health issues for youth. This study examines the relationship between exposure to violence and mental health issues among youth using a nationally representative study in Malawi. METHODS We analysed data from the nationally representative Violence Against Children Survey from Malawi (2013) to quantify the association between exposures to violence (physical, sexual and emotional) and their relationship with mental distress, self-harm behaviours and suicidal ideation and attempts among youth aged 13-24 years. We evaluated the association of exposures to violence against children with reported mental health conditions among women and men. We used ordinal logistic regression models with appropriate survey weights to assess exposures to violence and the three outcomes of interest. RESULTS Children and youth aged 13-24 years exposed to violence in childhood reported higher levels of adverse mental health effects, including mental distress, self-harm behaviours and suicidal ideation and attempts. The odds of reporting these outcomes increased as the number of violence types increased.

The intranasal approach is constantly associated with standard methods of osteotomies, including percutaneous techniques, which represent certain limitations in working with the bony vault without managing the surface and thickness of its walls and the risk of uncontrolled fractures. OBJECTIVES: The authors apply PEIs for osteotomies and reshaping of the nasal pyramid through the closed approach with preservation rhinoplasty and complete subperichondrial and subperiosteal dissection. METHODS: The technique of working with the nasal pyramid using PEIs with the closed approach is described. The patients were grouped according to the methods of nasal pyramid surgery-Push Down (PD), Let Down (LD) with Rhinosculpture (Rs), or the combinations. The results of the surgeries with the application of PEIs on 134 patients were retrospectively analyzed before the surgery and 12 months after it according to the \\"Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation\\" (ROE). RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 28, 125 were female and 9 were male. The patients' satisfaction was excellent in 96% of all the cases included.

In this article, we argue that pupillometry, or the measurement of pupil size, is an effective method to examine predictive processing in infants and will expand on existing methods (namely looking time and anticipatory eye movements). In particular, we argue that there are three specific features of pupillometry that make it particularly useful for augmenting the investigation of prediction in infancy. First, pupillometry has excellent temporal resolution that will facilitate the differentiation of prediction subcomponents. Second, pupillometry is highly continuous across the life span, allowing researchers to directly compare responses between infants and adults using an identical paradigm. Third, pupillometry can be used in conjunction with other behavioral measures, allowing for different yet complementary results. In addition, we review relevant adult and infant pupillometry studies that will facilitate infancy researchers to adopt this technique.

Steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic methods were used with highly active 3CLpro to characterize the reaction mechanism. We show that 3CLpro has mechanistic features common and disparate to the archetypical proteases papain and chymotrypsin. The kinetic mechanism for 3CLpro-mediated ester hydrolysis, including the individual rate constants, is consistent with a simple double displacement mechanism. The pre-steady-state burst rate was independent of ester substrate concentration indicating a high commitment to catalysis. When homologous peptidic amide and ester substrates were compared, a series of interesting observations emerged. Despite a 2000-fold difference in nonenzymatic reactivity, highly related amide and ester substrates were found to have similar kinetic parameters in both the steady-state and pre-steady-state. Steady-state solvent isotope effect (SIE) studies showed an inverse SIE for the amide but not ester substrates. Evaluation of the SIE in the pre-steady-state revealed normal SIEs for both amide and ester burst rates. Proton inventory (PI) studies on amide peptide hydrolysis were consistent with two proton-transfer reactions in the transition state while the ester data was consistent with a single proton-transfer reaction. Finally, the pH-inactivation profile of 3CLpro with iodoacetamide is indicative of an ion-pair mechanism. Taken together, the data are consistent with a 3CLpro mechanism that utilizes an \\"electrostatic\\" trigger to initiate the acylation reaction, a cysteine-histidine catalytic dyad ion pair, an enzyme-facilitated release of P1, and a general base-catalyzed deacylation reaction.","output":"Steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic evaluation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3CLpro cysteine protease: development of an ion-pair model for catalysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Draws from the equity theory and customer equity literature, this study aims to argue that the implementation of contactless service as an innovative service design in the hospitality industry can generate customers emotional attachment and cognitive evaluation of the brand.

The epitopes of most anti-S MAbs (32 of 38) were localized within the S1 domain, and those of the remaining 6 MAbs were mapped to the S2 domain. Among the anti-S1 MAbs, 17 MAbs targeted the N-terminal region (amino acids [aa] 12 to 327), 9 MAbs recognized the receptor-binding domain (RBD; aa 318 to 510), and 6 MAbs reacted with the C-terminal region of S1 domain that contains the major immunodominant site (aa 528 to 635). Strikingly, all of the RBD-specific MAbs had potent neutralizing activity, 6 of which efficiently blocked the receptor binding, confirming that the RBD contains the main neutralizing epitopes and that blockage of the receptor association is the major mechanism of SARS-CoV neutralization. Five MAbs specific for the S1 N-terminal region exhibited moderate neutralizing activity, but none of the MAbs reacting with the S2 domain and the major immunodominant site in S1 showed neutralizing activity.

If the skin is insufficiently exposed to sunlight, severe deficits can develop. As vitamin D plays an important role not only in the immune system but also in the RAS, and thus at the point where the virus attacks, a good vitamin D supply is an important basis for reducing the risk of severe COVID-19 processes.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May-June, 2020 with a sample of 645 participants aged 18 and above in 26 hospitals across Nepal. Telephone interviews were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire along with a validated psychometric tool, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress (DASS-21) scale. The metrics and scores of symptoms and their severity were created and analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association of potential covariates with outcome variables. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress were 14%, 7% and 5% respectively. In reference to Karnali, participants from Bagmati province reported higher level of anxiety (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.31-9.06), while stress (OR 4.27, 95% CI 1.09-18.32) and depressive symptoms (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.05-9.23) observed higher among the participants in Province 1.

METHODS: This single-center retrospective cohort study included all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed severe COVID-19 in the Respiratory and Critical Care Unit of Dabie Mountain Regional Medical Center, China. Patient information, including demographic data, laboratory indicators, the use of glucocorticoids and IVIG, hospital mortality, the application of mechanical ventilation, and the length of hospital stay was collected. The primary outcome was the composite end point, including death and the use of mechanical ventilation. The secondary outcome was the length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Of the 285 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 113 severely ill patients were included in this study. Compared to the non-IVIG group, more patients in the IVIG group reached the composite end point [12 (25.5%) vs 5 (7.6%), P = 0.008] and had longer hospital stay periods [23.0 (19.0-31.0) vs 16.0 (13.8-22.0), P < 0.001].

Early identification of this population is extremely important to inhibit the spread of infectious diseases. Right now, the whole global world is suffering from a devastating infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this article, a superspreader cluster event in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified by tracking contacting histories of infected patients. This cluster was found to be originated from an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carrier, which resulted in 13 secondary cases getting infected. All the secondary patients presented with non-typical symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, dry cough, and myalgia, one of which died of respiratory failure at the end.

Despite new diagnostic developments, most pneumonia cases continue to be difficult to diagnose clinically, partly due to acquired antibiotic resistance and the lack of a gold standard method of diagnosis. In other words, the lack of a rapid, accurate diagnostic test, as well as the uncertainty of the initial etiologic diagnosis and the risk stratification, results in empirical antibiotic treatments. There are significant changes in the aetiology of patients with ventilator associated lower respiratory tract infections (VA-LRTI), which are characterised by a higher incidence of multi drug resistant organisms. Evidence suggests that when patients with VA-LRTI develop organ failure, the associated mortality can be exceptionally high with frequent complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, and septic shock. Appropriate antibiotic treatments must consider that the present cardiovascular failure seen in patients has a different association with the patients mortality. Unlike patients with less severe clinical presentations, who have a higher chance of survival when the appropriate antibiotics are administered promptly, for patients with a severe subtype of the disease, the appropriateness of antibiotic treatment will impact the patients outcome to a lesser extent.

METHODS: An online national survey of Swedish adolescents (n = 1818) aged 15C19 years was conducted in June 2020. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to predict adolescents reported change in substance use during the pandemic. Person-oriented analyses, were used to identify clusters of participants characterized by similar patterns of substance use following ANOVA analysis with Scheffe post hoc tests testing differences between clusters in terms of family relations, reported changes in family interaction and involvement with peers during the Covid-19 pandemic, and following rules and recommendations during the pandemic. RESULTS: Higher general family conflict, increased involvement with peers, a strained relationship with parents, and less compliance with rules and restrictions during the pandemic predicted a reported increase in adolescent substance use during this period. The grouping of scores for adolescent smoking, alcohol use, inebriation, and use of narcotics resulted in a six-cluster solution. One cluster (n = 767) either did not use or had decreased use of substances during the Covid-19 pandemic. Five other clusters, thus risk clusters, had retained or increased use of substances during the pandemic. Poor general family relations, increased peer involvement, and difficulties to conform to the rules and restrictions during the covid-19 pandemic were characteristics of risk clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Most of adolescents in our study did not increase their substance use during the pandemic. However, adolescents with poor family relations who turn to peers during stressful times and who have difficulty following the governments rules and restrictions, are at risk of increased substance use during the pandemic. This is a potential threat both to adolescents themselves and others in their surroundings which is why at-risk adolescents and their families need more attention from public health and social services during this time of crisis.","output":"Adolescent smoking, alcohol use, inebriation, and use of narcotics during the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Messenger RNA (mRNA)-transfected dendritic cell (DC) vaccines have been shown to be a powerful modality for eliciting antitumor immune responses in mice and humans; however, their application has not been fully optimized since many of the factors that contribute to their efficacy remain poorly understood.

Methods: Consensus clustering by m6A related genes was used to classify 374 patients with HCC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Then we performed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to construct the m6A related genes model. The International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets were used to verify and evaluate the model. ESTIMATE, CIBERSORTx, the expression levels of immune checkpoint genes, and TIDE were used to investigate the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the response to immunotherapy. Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and gene-drug sensitivity were also analyzed. Results: By expression value and regression coefficient of five m6A related genes, we constructed the risk score of each patient. The patients with a higher risk score had a considerably poorer prognosis in the primary and validated cohort. For further discussing TME and the response to immunotherapy, we divided the entire set into two groups based on the risk score. Our findings implied that the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were proportional to the risk scores, which seemed to contradict that patients with higher scores had a poor prognosis. Further, we found that the high-risk group had higher expression of PD-L1, CTLA-4, and PDCD1, indicating immune dysfunction, which may be a fundamental reason for poor prognosis. This was further reinforced by the fact that the low-risk group responded better than the high-risk group to monotherapy and combination therapy. Conclusion: The m6A related risk score is a new independent prognostic factor that correlates with immunotherapy response.

Design/methodology/approach: From the perspective of systems theory, social action in principle does not present itself as a problem but as a solution to (latent) social problems. In the sociological analysis presented here, it is therefore precisely a matter of uncovering or pointing out those (changed) social structures in which a social lockdown appears as a solution. Findings: The paper explains that with the emergence of social media through applications such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, a new force is establishing itself at the level of society as a system. It is one that is characterized by being highly vulnerable to moral communication. A susceptibility to morality manifests, on the one hand, through an individual differentiation of society made possible by social media C for example, in the emerging Chinese social credit system C and, on the other hand, through the specific communicative structures of the social media themselves. It is argued that social media, in the form of a moral authority with a lasting effect on society as a whole, make a significant contribution to realizing the social lockdown.

The present study examined how economic and psychosocial consequences as a result of the pandemic were associated with mental health issues among a community sample of Latinx young adults (N = 83) from Central Texas. Participants completed an online survey of COVID-related experiences and mental health needs. The survey asked about personal and family experiences of COVID-19 in two significant areas: (a) economic strain (e.g., economic hardship, food insecurity) and (b) psychosocial burden (e.g., losing relationships, substance use). Regression analyses examined the association of COVID-19 consequences on level of mental health symptoms and clinically significant outcomes. Relative to economic consequences, psychosocial consequences due to the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with higher levels of mental health symptoms. In contrast, in few cases, economic strain resultant from the pandemic was correlated with clinically significant outcomes among this sample. Collectively, findings suggest that the costs of the pandemic do not only pertain to mortality from illness but also to morbidity as it relates to deteriorating social circumstances and mental health. Findings from this study call for immediate attention to implement policies and programs to help mitigate the economic and social-emotional consequences of COVID-19 such as easy access to low-cost virtual mental health resources to Latinx young adults.

El estudio presente examino como las consecuencias economicas y psicosociales a raiz de la pandemia se asociaron con problemas de salud mental en una muestra comunitaria de adultos jovenes latinos (N = 83) del centro de Texas. Los participantes completaron una encuesta en linea sobre experiencias relacionadas con el COVID-19 y necesidades de salud mental. La encuesta incluyo preguntas sobre las experiencias personales y familiares del COVID-19 en dos areas importantes: (a) tension economica (por ejemplo, dificultades economicas, inseguridad alimentaria) y (b) carga psicosocial (por ejemplo, perdida de relaciones, consumo de sustancias). Los analisis de regresion examinaron la asociacion de las consecuencias del COVID-19 en el nivel de los sintomas de salud mental y los resultados clinicamente significativos. En comparacion a las consecuencias economicas, las consecuencias psicosociales debido a la pandemia de COVID-19 se asociaron con niveles mas altos de sintomas de salud mental. Por el contrario, en unos pocos casos, la tension economica resultante de la pandemia se correlaciono con resultados clinicamente significativos en esta muestra.

There is some anecdotal evidence that in some cases, labor unions play a role in implementing climate protection measures. In other cases, unions were more concerned with saving jobs than with reducing emissions. Nonetheless, empirical studies on the relationship between unions and environmental outcomes are limited. The objective of this study is to fill the gap in the literature by examining if unionization has any impact on CO(2) emissions in Canada, after controlling for energy consumption, unemployment rate, and real GDP per capita. Cointegration techniques including Johansen methods and autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) techniques are applied to a dataset that covers the period from 1969 to 2016. The results suggest that, on average, a 1% increase in unionization reduces CO(2) emissions by approximately 0.25%. This is the first study that examines the union-climate dynamics for Canada. One policy implication of the finding is that the governments should develop incentives for industries to implement climate measures through collective bargaining.","output":"Does unionization reduce CO(2) emissions in Canada?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT We report a case of acute pancreatitis that developed after four days of remdesivir therapy in a patient being treated for COVID-19.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Swiss university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 1459 individuals with a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 infection between 2 March and 23 April 2020. METHODS: We applied the rule of 10 events per variable to construct our multivariable model and included a maximum of eight covariates. We assessed the model performance in terms of discrimination and calibration and performed internal validation to estimate the statistical optimism of the final model. The final prediction model included age, fever, dyspnoea, hypertension and chronic respiratory disease. To develop the OUTCoV score, we assigned points for each predictor that were proportional to the coefficients of the regression equation. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios were estimated, including positive and negative predictive values in different thresholds. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was COVID-19-related hospitalisation. RESULTS: The OUTCoV score ranged from 0 to 7.5 points. The two threshold parameters with optimal rule-out and rule-in characteristics for the risk of hospitalisation were 3 and 5.5, respectively. Outpatients with a score <3 (997/1459; 68.3%) had no follow-up as at low risk of hospitalisation (1.8%; 95% CI 1.1 to 2.8). For a score &#8805;5.5 (20/1459; 1.4%), the hospitalisation risk was higher (30%; 95% CI 11.9 to 54.3). CONCLUSIONS: The OUTCoV score allows to rule out two-thirds of outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection presenting a low hospitalisation risk and to identify those at high risk that require careful follow-up to assess the need for hospitalisation. The model provides a simple decision-making tool for an effective allocation of resources to maintain quality care for outpatient populations.","output":"Development and validation of the OUTCoV score to predict the risk of hospitalisation among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in ambulatory settings: a prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiological characteristics of human infection with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Moscow, Lima, Kuwait, and Singapore to analyze the effects of climate factors on the incidence of COVID-19.

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data were extracted from medical records and compared (false discovery rate corrected) to those of neurologic patients without COVID-19 admitted in the same period. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three patients were included in this study, of whom 56 were positive and 117 were negative for COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 were older (77.0 years, interquartile range [IQR] 67.0-83.8 years vs 70.1 years, IQR 52.9-78.6 years, p = 0.006), had a different distribution regarding admission diagnoses, including cerebrovascular disorders (n = 43, 76.8% vs n = 68, 58.1%), and had a higher quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score on admission (0.9, IQR 0.7-1.1 vs 0.5, IQR 0.4-0.6, p = 0.006).

There is limited evidence of PP effects on awake patients. This study aimed to investigate the effects and feasibility of PP on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated awake patients with ARDS in a subintensive setting of care. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a single-center case-control study involving patients with severe COVID-19 infection. A total of 29 patients underwent noninvasive ventilation, and PP was initiated 12 h from admission; 18 patients tolerated prone and side positioning for at least 10 h/d and cycled their position every 2 h, and 11 patients had no complaints with PP. RESULTS: A total of 29 patients (25 men and 4 women) with a median age of 64 years showed the average baseline white blood cell count of 8.45109 cells/L, C-reactive protein of 10.1 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase of 366 mU/mL, and interleukin-6 of 172 pg/mL. Basal pO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F) was 95 (56.5) and showed no linear correlation with any of the inflammatory markers tested. Computed tomography findings included ground-glass opacities in 100% (29/29) of patients. Consolidation/atelectasis was found in 58% (17/29) of patients. P/F was homogeneously distributed at baseline in patients with PP (96.5) and without PP (95). P/F during PP increased significantly compared with noncompliant controls (288 vs. 202; p=0.0002). Total duration of respiratory failure was significantly shorter in patients with PP (14 vs. 21 days; p=0.002). The number of days to recover from respiratory failure inversely correlated with PP P/F independently from baseline P/F. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 can lead to a severe impairment of gas exchange regardless of inflammatory status. Therefore, respiratory support may play a major role in COVID-19 treatment. We documented substantial efficacy of PP when started early and for at least 10 h/d. On awake patients, PP feasibility strictly depends on patient's compliance. The interface should be carefully chosen to best fit every patient.","output":"Early Prone Positioning and Non-Invasive Ventilation in a Critical COVID-19 Subset.

Sensitive and accurate analyses of monosaccharides remain challenging because of their high hydrophilicities and poor ionization efficiencies. Here, we developed a paired derivatization approach with H/D-labeled hydroxylamines for simultaneous quantification of 12 monosaccharides by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). O-(4-Methoxybenzyl)hydroxylamine hydrochloride (4-MOBHAHCl) showed higher derivatization efficiency for monosaccharides compared to six other hydroxylamine analogues. The derivatization of monosaccharides was readily achieved in an aqueous solution. Furthermore, the deuterium-labeled isotope reagent, d3-4-MOBHAHCl, was newly synthesized to stably label monosaccharides to improve its accuracy and precision in complex matrix analysis. As a result, 12 monosaccharides were rapidly detected by LC-MS/MS within 16 min with significant improvements in chromatographic separation and retention time. The detection sensitivity increased by 83 to 1600-fold with limits of quantitation ranging from 0.25 to 3.00 fmol. With the paired derivatization strategy, the monosaccharides could be accurately quantified with good linearity (R2 > 0.99) and satisfactory accuracy (recoveries: 85-110%). Using this method, we achieved sensitive and accurate quantification of the monosaccharide composition of herbal polysaccharides and the change in monosaccharide levels in human cell lines under physiopathological conditions. More importantly, the developed method was able to differentiate between the levels of the monosaccharides in fecal samples of human ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and UC mice compared to their respective controls. The differential monosaccharides determined in human feces provided a good diagnostic performance in distinguishing the UC patients from healthy individuals, showing potential for clinical application.","output":"Paired Derivatization Approach with H/D-Labeled Hydroxylamine Reagents for Sensitive and Accurate Analysis of Monosaccharides by Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The continent of the Americas has the greatest number of people infected and deaths associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the world.

This is not to suggest that there has been no expansion of LSM. This sector has certainly grown and spread across the continent. The decrease in sovereign risk of mining production that accompanied the end of the apartheid era wars and the heightened investment security arrangements in the post Structural Adjustment Programs has resulted in gold production being dispersed to virtually all parts of the continent. The most significant change that has occurred has not been geographic but rather has been the direct result of changes in the nature and technology of gold production. Gold production was once the sole purview of large mining transnationals. This was largely true even outside South Africa. Prior to the 1990s, small scale mining was largely illegal throughout most parts of the continent because governments sought to assure that large scale mines provided the desperately needed taxation revenue for the economic transformation that they all sought. Aside from taxation issues, the issue of industrialisation in Africa is never far from the lips of policymakers. It is an area replete with policy pronouncements about the direction of industrial policy but the reality is that African countries have done almost nothing to make use of the mining activities to diversify their economic base away from mining. Irrespective of what direction Africa takes with regard to gold, whether it is the development of backward or forward linkages, certain developments are necessary. These relate to competitiveness and the creation of economic structures that are robustly governed and of such an order of magnitude as to make Africa a continent which is more than a market and a source of raw materials but a potential location for investment.

Medical students thought that more could be done to mitigate the COVID-19 situation compared with the allied health students (66.2% compared with 51.6%, p = 0.002 Fisher's Exact test). 63% (n = 431) were worried about getting COVID-19 infection, while 92% (n = 633)) were worried that a family member could be infected with the virus. 97% (n = 655) took precautions when accepting home deliveries, 94% (n = 637) had been washing their hands more frequently, and 95% (n = 643) had been wearing face masks. In conclusion, medical and health sciences students in the UAE showed high levels of knowledge and good attitudes and practices towards the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, they were worried about themselves or their family members becoming infected.

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted. The clinical data of 65 patients with severe and critical COVID-19 admitted to Chongqing Public Health Medical Center and Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital from January 2020 to March 2020 during the period of supporting to combat COVID-19 by the medical team of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University and Chongqing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine were analyzed. According to different treatment regimens, patients were divided into conventional treatment group (conventional antivirus, anti-infection and symptomatic support treatments), Xuebijing group (Xuebijing was applied to patients with elevated inflammatory cytokines) and combination group (Xuebijing combined with human immunoglobulin, human immunoglobulin was applied to patients with low immunity indicated by monitoring results of lymphocytes and their subsets). The improvement of blood routine examination, blood gas analysis, myocardial enzyme spectrum, liver and kidney function, lymphocytes and their subsets and cytokines as well as severity score in three groups before and after treatment were observed. Kaplan-Meier method was used to draw the 28-day survival curve of each group, and the cumulative survival rate among the groups was compared. RESULTS: Among the 65 severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients, only 20 patients received conventional treatment, 22 patients were treated with Xuebijing based on conventional treatment, and 23 patients were treated with Xuebijing combined with human immunoglobulin based on conventional treatment. Before treatment, CD4+ T cell count in combination group was higher than other two groups, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was lower than other two groups, while other indicators showed no statistically significant differences among the three groups, suggesting that the baseline of the three groups was relatively balanced before treatment. The patients in the conventional treatment group were relieved after treatment, and it was characterized by that the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significantly lower than those before treatment [APACHE II score: 5.202.74 vs. 6.201.93, LDH (mols-1L-1): 4.11.0 vs. 4.70.9, both P < 0.01], but there was still liver damage, which was manifested as higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than that before treatment [U/L: 30.5 (23.8, 41.5) vs. 21.0 (17.0, 34.0), P < 0.05].

However, the patients still lived with an \\"inflammatory storm\\" and liver damage after treatment. It was shown that IL-4 was significantly higher than that before treatment (ng/L: 2.571.15 vs. 1.921.04, P < 0.05), while albumin (ALB) decreased significantly compared with before treatment [g/L: 33.0 (30.5, 35.6) vs. 36.2 (32.1, 41.4), P < 0.01]. While the treatment of Xuebijing combined with human immunoglobulin could improve patients' respiratory function and enhance their immunity more effectively, it was shown that arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2), T lymphocyte count, ratio of CD4+ T cell, CD4+ T cell count, CD8+ T cell count and CD4+/CD8+ ratio were significantly higher than those before treatment, while ALB, IL-6, APACHE II score and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score were significantly lower than those before treatment. T lymphocyte count, the ratio of CD4+ T cell and IL-6 in combination group were improved more significantly than those in conventional treatment group and Xuebijing group [T lymphocyte count (109/L): 310.68359.28 vs. 46.54240.01, 81.59256.76; ratio of CD4+ T cell: 14.5314.49 vs. -0.9512.38, 4.866.31; IL-6 (ng/L): -25.5339.05 vs. -1.755.45, 12.7844.81], PaO2/FiO2 was improved more significantly as compared with the Xuebijing group [mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa): 146.31109.73 vs. 59.4187.70], and the differences were statistically different (all P < 0.05).

Even though the social and economic burden associated with hRSV infections is tremendous, there are no approved vaccines to date to prevent the disease caused by this pathogen. Recently, coinfections and superinfections have turned into an active field of study, and interactions between many viral and bacterial pathogens have been studied. hRSV is not an exception since polymicrobial infections involving this virus are common, especially when illness has evolved into pneumonia. Here, we review the epidemiology and recent findings regarding the main polymicrobial infections involving hRSV and several prevalent bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, human rhinoviruses, influenza A virus, human metapneumovirus, and human parainfluenza viruses.

METHODS: Based on the effects of 4 shRNAs targeting different regions of HTNV genomic RNA on viral replication, the most effective RNA interference fragments of the S and M genes were constructed in pSilencer-3.0-H1 vectors, and designated pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M, respectively. The antiviral effect of pSilencer-S/M against HTNV was evaluated in both HTNV-infected Vero-E6 cells and mice. RESULTS: In HTNV-infected Vero-E6 cells, pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M targeted the viral nucleocapsid proteins and envelope glycoproteins, respectively, as revealed in the immunofluorescence assay. Transfection with pSilencer-S or pSilencer-M (1, 2, 4 g) markedly inhibited the viral antigen expression in dose- and time-dependent manners. Transfection with either plasmid (2 g) significantly decreased HTNV-RNA level at 3 day postinfectin (dpi) and the progeny virus titer at 5 dpi. In mice infected with lethal doses of HTNV, intraperitoneal injection of pSilencer-S or pSilencer-M (30 g) considerably increased the survival rates and mean time to death, and significantly reduced the mean virus yields and viral RNA level, and alleviated virus-induced pathological lesions in lungs, brains and kidneys.

DCEs are widely used to understand peoples preferences with respect to the relative importance of the features of, in the present context, lockdowns. The lockdown features, in decreasing order of importance as determined by the DCE in terms of their inconvenience or unpleasantness, are (mean weights in parentheses): travel restrictions (24.6%), total cost of a vaccination (out-of-pocket or from taxes) (22.1%), school closures (19.4%), work from home (17.9%), required to stay at home (9.6%) and required to wear masks in public (6.5%).

The available data on routine laboratory parameters were collected by routine blood tests before the treatment, at three months, and at the final evaluation. RESULTS When the changes in routine laboratory parameters were evaluated by treatment, it was found that the NLR and CRP values decreased statistically significantly in the anti-TNF group compared to the IL inhibitor group. In addition, strong suppression of these inflammation parameters means strong suppression of the immune system response. In addition, AST, ALT, and creatinine values were found to be statistically significantly higher in the anti-TNF group compared to the IL inhibitor group.

The recent appearance of avian cholera, a highly virulent disease of birds caused by the bacterium Pasteurella multocida, at remote Arctic seabird colonies is an emerging conservation concern. Determining disease risk to population viability requires a quantitative understanding of transmission potential and the factors that regulate epidemic persistence. Estimates of the basic (R0 ) and real-time (Rt ) reproductive number are critical in this regard - enumerating the number of secondary infections caused by each primary infection in a newly invaded host population and the decline in transmission rate as susceptible individuals are removed via mortality or immunized recovery. Here, we use data collected at a closely monitored common eider (Somateria mollissima) breeding colony located in the Canadian Arctic to examine transmission and host population dynamics. Specifically, we infer epidemic curves from daily mortality observations and use a likelihood-based procedure to estimate changes in the reproductive number over a series of annual outbreaks. These data are interpreted in relation to concurrent changes in host numbers to assess local extinction risk. Consistent with expectations for a novel pathogen invasion, case incidence increased exponentially during the initial wave of exposure (R0 = 25; generation time = 65 days  11 SD). Disease conditions gradually abated, but only after several years of smouldering infection (Rt  1). In total, 6194 eider deaths were recorded during outbreaks spanning eight consecutive breeding seasons. Breeding pair abundance declined by 56% from the pre-outbreak peak; however, a robust population of >4000 pairs remained intact upon epidemic fade-out. Overall, outbreak patterns were consistent with herd immunity acting as a mitigating factor governing in the extent and duration of mortality. Disease mortality is frequently modelled as a form of stochastic catastrophe in wildlife population assessments, whereas our approach gives shape to the functional response between transmission and host population dynamics. We conclude that increased emphasis on integrating epidemiological and population processes is essential to predicting the conservation impact of emerging infectious diseases in wildlife.","output":"Injecting epidemiology into population viability analysis: avian cholera transmission dynamics at an arctic seabird colony."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The combination of advances in knowledge, technology, changes in consumer preference and low cost of manufacturing is accelerating the next technology revolution in crop, livestock and fish production systems.

RESULTS: Recommendations for surface disinfection refer to predefined risk-categories in the delivery unit. In cooperation with hospital hygiene, the frequency of cleaning and disinfection must be specified in the facilitys internal hygiene plans. To avoid a selection of disinfectant-tolerant germs, it is essential to observe the spectrum of activity and exposure time of each disinfectant. Hand disinfection is the single most effective measure to prevent nosocomial infections. The challenge here is the consistent implementation of the generally known indications for hand disinfection in everyday life. For the hygienically correct management of water birth and maintenance of the bathtub, standards should be developed in every delivery room, the effectiveness of which must be regularly monitored.

Nationally, these disparities have persisted with the COVID-19 pandemic as AIs are more likely than all other races to be infected, hospitalized, or die from SARS-CoV-2. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, the only federally recognized American Indian tribe in the state, has been one of the hardest hit in the nation. METHODS: Using de-identified data from the University of Mississippi Medical Centers COVID-19 Research Registry, a retrospective cohort study was conducted to assess COVID-19 inpatient mortality outcomes among adults ( age 18) admitted at the states safety net hospital in 2020. RESULTS: Exactly 41% (n = 25) of American Indian adults admitted with a deemed diagnosis of COVID-19 died while in hospital, in comparison to 19% (n = 153) of blacks and 23% (n = 65) of whites. Racial disparities persisted even when controlling for those risk factors the CDC reported put adults at greatest risk of severe outcomes from the disease. The adjusted probability of inpatient mortality among American Indians was 46% (p < 0.00) in comparison to 19% among blacks and 20% among whites. CONCLUSION: Although comorbidities were commonly observed among COVID-19 + American Indian inpatients, only one was associated with inpatient mortality. This challenges commonly cited theories attributing disparate COVID-19 mortality experiences among indigenous populations to disparate comorbidity experiences. Expanded studies are needed to further investigate these associations.","output":"COVID-19 Inpatient Mortality Disparities Among American Indian Adults in Mississippis Safety Net Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND COVID-19 is the disease caused by the novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The spectrum of disease seen in patients with COVID-19 infection ranges from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to severe pneumonia and even acute respiratory distress syndrome, which often requires invasive ventilation and intensive care. COVID-19-associated infection can be catastrophic, leading to both arterial and venous occlusion, microinfarcts, and multiorgan failure, although retinal vein occlusion has not yet been reported. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 40-year-old man who presented with a 3-day history of shortness of breath, cough, and fever. He also reported right calf pain and blurring of vision in both eyes. His medical history included hypertension and morbid obesity. The patient was found to have severe COVID-19 pneumonia on high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, right leg deep venous thrombosis on Doppler ultrasonography, and bilateral central retinal vein occlusion (RVO) on fundal examination. He was started on full-dose anticoagulation and discharged on rivaroxaban for 3 months. After 2 weeks of therapy, he had fully recovered from his COVID-19 symptoms and had near-normal vision. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 infection can cause RVO. Early full-dose anticoagulation should be considered in high-risk patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Ophthalmologists and other clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for RVO in patients with COVID-19 infection who presenting with blurred vision and severe pneumonia.","output":"Bilateral Central Retinal Vein Occlusion in a 40-Year-Old Man with Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Accidental falls are a major cause of morbidity placing pressure on hospital capacity and utilizing costly services. Evaluating the burden of falls is key for planning, implementation, and evaluation of prevention strategies. To date, no studies have been published on accidental falls at the population level in Kuwait. We studied the burden of accidental falls on public hospital inpatient capacity in Kuwait and identified the subgroups with the highest utilization of inpatient service days. METHODS: From the national database of inpatient hospitalizations, we selected hospitalizations of patients admitted to Kuwaits public hospitals for unintentional injury caused by an accidental fall from 1 January through 31 December 2016. We studied the number of inpatient service days (bed days), length of stay (LOS), and number of hospitalizations by age group, gender, and nationality. MannCWhitney, Kruskal-Wallis, and Chi square tests were used for comparison. Logistic regression was used to quantify the risk of prolonged LOS and fractures among fall-related hospitalizations. RESULTS: Accidental falls were responsible for 2.9% of inpatient hospitalizations, 3.7% of inpatient service days (61,140 days) with an ALOS of 9.1 days in Kuwaits public hospitals in 2016. Accidental falls were responsible for 4.6% of older adult service days, and an even higher 5.6% of older women service days. In the age group 13C64, fall-related service days for non-Kuwaitis (5.7%) were more than triple those for Kuwaitis (1.8%) with a substantial percentage among male non-Kuwaitis (8.1%). The risk factors for exceeding the national ALOS for fall-related hospitalizations were female gender (OR 1.36), age 65 and older (OR 9.72), age 13C64 (OR 5.20), being non-Kuwaiti (OR 1.39), sustaining a femur fracture (OR 11.67), and undergoing surgery (OR 2.63). Fall-related hospitalizations associated with a higher risk of fractures were females (OR 1.22), patients 65 years and older (OR 5.09), patients aged 13C64 (OR 3.65), and non-Kuwaitis (OR 1.28). CONCLUSIONS: Accidental falls impose a considerable burden on inpatient service utilization in Kuwait. This varies by age, gender, and nationality. To reduce this burden, prevention programs should target working-age non-Kuwaiti males and older females.","output":"Hospitalization of unintentional fall injuries in Kuwait: a national database study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) potently inhibits entry of diverse enveloped viruses by trapping the viral fusion at a hemifusion stage, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that recombinant IFITM3 reconstituted into lipid vesicles induces negative membrane curvature and that this effect maps to its small amphipathic helix (AH). We demonstrate that AH (i) partitions into lipid-disordered domains where IAV fusion occurs, (ii) induces negative membrane curvature, and (iii) increases lipid order and membrane stiffness. These effects on membrane properties correlate with the fusion-inhibitory activity, as targeting the ectopically expressed AH peptide to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the cell plasma membrane diminishes IAV-cell surface fusion induced by exposure to acidic pH. Our results thus imply that IFITM3 inhibits the transition from hemifusion to full fusion by imposing an unfavorable membrane curvature and increasing the order and stiffness of the cytoplasmic leaflet of endosomal membranes.

GANs are popular to generate realistic data by learning the mapping from one domain to another. In our work, the generator of the GAN is trained to generate a segmented mask of a given input CXR. The discriminator distinguishes between a ground truth and the generated mask, and updates the generator through the adversarial loss measure.

In this study, we investigated the significance of prophylactic drain placement after LDG for gastric cancer. METHODS Seventy-eight consecutive patients with gastric cancer who underwent LDG in our department were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups according to the insertion of a prophylactic intra-abdominal drain following LDG. The 'drain group' comprised 45 patients with routine use of a prophylactic intra-abdominal drain, and the 'no-drain group' comprised 33 patients who did not undergo placement of an intra-abdominal drain. RESULTS There were no significant differences in terms of the mean age of the patients, male/female ratio, body mass index, and concurrent diseases between the drain group and the no-drain group. In addition, there were no significant differences in the tumor location, tumor diameter, depth of the tumor, nodal metastasis, and tumor stage between the two groups. All patients in each group were successfully treated with R0 surgery, and no patient required conversion to open surgery. Surgery-related factors, including lymph node dissection and operative time, were similar in the drain group and the no-drain group. A comparison of the amount of intraoperative blood loss between patients with and without postoperative complications revealed that patients who experienced postoperative complications had a significantly larger amount of blood loss than those without postoperative complications. A comparison of operative times between patients with and without surgery-related postoperative local complications revealed that patients who experienced surgery-related postoperative local complications had a significantly longer operative time than those without surgery-related postoperative local complications. Analysis of operative times in each group revealed that patients with surgery-related postoperative local complications had a significantly longer operative time than those without surgery-related postoperative local complications in the no-drain group. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative factors such as the operative time and the amount of intraoperative blood loss affected the occurrence of postoperative complications following LDG.

As proposed, such screening could involve tens of millions of individuals, but detailed estimates of radiation doses and potential risk of radiation-induced cancer are not currently available. We estimated organ-specific radiation doses and associated cancer risks from coronary artery calcification screening with multidetector computed tomography according to patient age, frequency of screening, and scan protocol. METHODS Radiation doses delivered to adult patients were calculated from a range of available protocols using Monte Carlo radiation transport. Radiation risk models, derived using data from Japanese atomic bomb survivors and medically exposed cohorts, were used to estimate the excess lifetime risk of radiation-induced cancer. RESULTS The radiation dose from a single coronary artery calcification computed tomographic scan varied more than 10-fold (effective dose range, 0.8-10.5 mSv) depending on the protocol. In general, higher radiation doses were associated with higher x-ray tube current, higher tube potential, spiral scanning with low pitch, and retrospective gating. The wide dose variation also resulted in wide variation in estimated radiation-induced cancer risk. Assuming screening every 5 years from the age of 45 to 75 years for men and 55 to 75 years for women, the estimated excess lifetime cancer risk using the median dose of 2.3 mSv was 42 cases per 100 000 men (range, 14-200 cases) and 62 cases per 100 000 women (range, 21-300 cases). CONCLUSIONS These radiation risk estimates can be compared with potential benefits from screening, when such estimates are available.

Concern surrounding contagion and the pandemic has been found to affect the number and type of medical emergencies to which Emergency Medical Services (EMS) have responded. AIM: To identify, categorize, and analyze Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's national EMS, pre-hospital activities including patients' refusal to hospital transport, during the COVID-19 pandemic crises. METHODS: A comparative before and after design study of MDA incidents during March/April 2019 and March/April 2020. Medical type, frequency, demographic, location, and transport refusal proportions and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: A decrease of 2.6% in the total volume of incidents was observed during March and April 2020 compared with the equivalent period in 2019. This contrasted with the retrospective trend of annually increase observed through 2016C2019. Medical categories showing increase in 2020 were infectious disease, cardiac arrest, psychiatric, and labor and deliveries, with out-of-hospital deliveries increasing by 14%. Decreases in 2020 were seen in neurology and trauma, with trauma incidents occurring at home showing an 8.6% increase. Patients' refusal to transport rose from 13.4% in 2019 to 19.9% in 2020. Cases of refusals followed by death within 8 days were more prevalent in 2020. CONCLUSION: EMS must be prepared for changes in patients' behavior due to COVID concerns.

During an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the LTCF an effective screening tool is essential to identify the patients at risk for severe disease. We explored the role of interleukin 6 (IL-6) as a predictor for severe disease during the outbreak of Covid-19 in one LTCF in Slovakia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective data analysis of cases of COVID-19, diagnosed during the outbreak in one LTCF in Slovakia between April 11, 2020, and May 5, 2020. Within 24 h after the diagnosis of Covid-19, clinical and laboratory screening was performed in the LTCF to identify patients in need of hospitalization. Patients with oxygen saturation below 90% were immediately referred to the hospital. Patients staying in the LFTC were monitored daily and those that developed hypoxemia were transferred to the hospital. We analyzed the association between the IL-6 at the initial assessment and development of hypoxemia during follow up and determined the cut-off of the IL-6 able to predict the development of hypoxemia requiring oxygen therapy. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (11 men, 42 women) with diagnosed Covid-19 were included in the analysis. 19 (53%) patients developed hypoxemia during the disease. Patients with hypoxemia had significantly higher concentrations of IL-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase at initial screening. ROC analyses identified IL-6 as the most robust predictor of hypoxemia. The concentration of IL-6 > 24 pg/mL predicted the development of hypoxemia with the sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 88.9%. The positive and negative predictive values were 76.9, and 100% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The concentration of IL-6 > 24 pg/mL at initial assessment predicted the development of hypoxemia requiring hospitalization with excellent sensitivity and good specificity. IL-6 appears as a potential predictor for the development of the severe Covid-19 and might serve for early identification of patients in need of hospitalization.

We evaluated new classes of LLINs with two active ingredients with differing modes of action against resistant malaria vectors. METHODS: We did a four-arm, cluster-randomised trial in Misungwi, Tanzania. Clusters were villages, or groups of hamlets, with at least 119 households containing children aged 6 months to 14 years living in the cluster's core area. Constrained randomisation was used to allocate clusters (1:1:1:1) to receive one of four types of LLIN treated with the following: -cypermethrin only (pyrethroid-only [reference] group); pyriproxyfen and -cypermethrin (pyriproxyfen group); chlorfenapyr and -cypermethrin (chlorfenapyr group); or the synergist piperonyl butoxide and permethrin (piperonyl butoxide group). At least one LLIN was distributed for every two people. Community members and the field team were masked to group allocation. Malaria prevalence data were collected through cross-sectional surveys of randomly selected households from each cluster, in which children aged 6 months to 14 years were assessed for Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection by rapid diagnostic tests. The primary outcome was malaria infection prevalence at 24 months after LLIN distribution, comparing each of the dual-active-ingredient LLINs to the standard pyrethroid-only LLINs in the intention-to-treat population. The primary economic outcome was cost-effectiveness of dual-active-ingredient LLINs, based on incremental cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted compared with pyrethroid-only LLINs, modelled over a 2-year period; we included costs of net procurement and malaria diagnosis and treatment, and estimated DALYs in all age groups. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03554616), and is ongoing but no longer recruiting. FINDINGS: 84 clusters comprising 39 307 households were included in the study between May 11 and July 2, 2018. 147 230 LLINs were distributed among households between Jan 26 and Jan 28, 2019. Use of study LLINs was reported in 3155 (721%) of 4378 participants surveyed at 3 months post-distribution and decreased to 8694 (409%) of 21 246 at 24 months, with varying rates of decline between groups. Malaria infection prevalence at 24 months was 549 (458%) of 1199 children in the pyrethroid-only reference group, 472 (375%) of 1258 in the pyriproxyfen group (adjusted odds ratio 079 [95% CI 054C117], p=02354), 512 (407%) of 1259 in the piperonyl butoxide group (099 [067C145], p=09607), and 326 [256%] of 1272 in the chlorfenapyr group (045 [030C067], p=00001). Skin irritation or paraesthesia was the most commonly reported side-effect in all groups. Chlorfenapyr LLINs were the most cost-effective LLINs, costing only US$19 (95% uncertainty interval 1C105) more to public providers or $28 (11C120) more to donors per DALY averted over a 2-year period compared with pyrethroid-only LLINs, and saving costs from societal and household perspectives. INTERPRETATION: After 2 years, chlorfenapyr LLINs provided significantly better protection than pyrethroid-only LLINs against malaria in an area with pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes, and the additional cost of these nets would be considerably below plausible cost-effectiveness thresholds ($292C393 per DALY averted). Before scale-up of chlorfenapyr LLINs, resistance management strategies are needed to preserve their effectiveness. Poor textile and active ingredient durability in the piperonyl butoxide and pyriproxyfen LLINs might have contributed to their relative lack of effectiveness compared with standard LLINs.

Finally, because reproduction is a human right and infertility is considered a health disease, we will discuss how assisted reproductive clinics can cope with the pandemic and what guidelines they should follow to minimise the risk of viral transmission.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 and other viruses on reproductive health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the tremendous growth of factor allocation strategies in active and passive fund management, we investigate whether factor or sector asset allocation strategies provide investors with a superior performance. Our focus is on comparing factor versus sector allocations as some recent empirical evidence indicates the dominance of sector over country portfolios. We analyze the performance and performance differences of sector and factor portfolios for various weighting and portfolio optimization approaches, including equal-weighting (1/N), risk parity, minimum-variance, mean-variance, BayesCStein and BlackCLitterman. We employ a sample-based approach in which the sample moments are the input parameters for the allocation model. For the period from May 2007 to November 2020, our results clearly reveal that, over longer investment horizons, factor portfolios provide relative superior performances. For shorter periods, however, we observe time-varying and alternating performance dominances as the relative advantage of one over the other strategy depends on the economic cycle. One important insight is that during normal times factor portfolios clearly dominate sector portfolios, whereas during crisis periods sector portfolios are superior offering better diversification opportunities.

A small number of studies have reported the anti-viral effects of EBN against influenza infections using in vitro and in vivo models, highlighting the importance of sialic acid and thymol derivatives in their therapeutic effects. At present, studies have reported that EBN suppresses the replicated virus from exiting the host cells, reduces the viral replication, endosomal trafficking of the virus, intracellular viral autophagy process, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reorient the actin cytoskeleton of the infected cells, and increase the lysosomal degradation of viral materials. In other models of disease, EBN attenuates oxidative stress-induced cellular apoptosis, enhances proliferation and activation of B-cells and their antibody secretion. Given the sum of its therapeutic actions, EBN appears to be a candidate that is worth further exploring for its protective effects against diseases transmitted through air droplets. At present, anti-viral drugs are employed as the first-line defense against respiratory viral infections, unless vaccines are available for the specific pathogens. In patients with severe symptoms due to exacerbated cytokine secretion, anti-inflammatory agents are applied. Treatment efficacy varies across the patients, and in times of a pandemic like COVID-19, many of the drugs are still at the experimental stage. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of anti-viral and anti-inflammatory effects of EBN, chemical constituents from various EBN preparation techniques, and drugs currently used to treat influenza and novel coronavirus infections. We also aim to review the pathogenesis of influenza A and coronavirus, and the potential of EBN in their clinical application. We also describe the current literature in human consumption of EBN, known allergenic or contaminant presence, and the focus of future direction on how these can be addressed to further improve EBN for potential clinical application.","output":"The Anti-Viral and Anti-Inflammatory Properties of Edible Bird's Nest in Influenza and Coronavirus Infections: From Pre-Clinical to Potential Clinical Application"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contact tracing is an effective method to control emerging infectious diseases Since the 1980's, modellers are developing a consistent theory for contact tracing, with the aim to find effective and efficient implementations, and to assess the effects of contact tracing on the spread of an infectious disease Despite the progress made in the area, there remain important open questions In addition, technological developments, especially in the field of molecular biology (genetic sequencing of pathogens) and modern communication (digital contact tracing), have posed new challenges for the modelling community In the present paper, we discuss modelling approaches for contact tracing and identify some of the current challenges for the field","output":"Contact tracing - Old models and new challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: This study aimed to investigate morphologic features of optic disc drusen (ODD) and peripapillary hyperreflective ovoid mass-like structures (PHOMS) in children, using enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT). It also assessed if the presence of these features were associated with decreased peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness. METHODS: Retrospective observational study of children with ODD. All subjects underwent complete ophthalmic examination and multimodal imaging. ODD were identified on EDI-OCT as circumscribed hyporeflective spheroidal elements located in front of lamina cribrosa, fully or partially surrounded by a hyperreflective border. PHOMS were identified as hyperreflective ovoid structures located in the peripapillary circumference. Both associations between ODD and RNFL loss and PHOMS and RNFL loss were tested using chi-squared test. RESULTS: In total, 38 eyes of 20 children were analysed. PHOMS were present in 90% of patients. ODD and PHOMS were predominantly found in the nasal, superonasal and inferonasal sectors. A significant positive association was found between ODD and decreased RNFL thickness in the nasal (p = 0.02), superonasal (p = 0.05) and inferotemporal (p = 0.04) sectors. There was no significant association found with the presence of PHOMS. CONCLUSION: EDI-OCT allowed morphological analysis of ODD and PHOMS in children. Drusen were found to be distinct from PHOMS both in their appearance and impact on the RNFL. ODD are hyporeflective and appear on the ONH above the lamina cribrosa and were associated with decreased thickness of the RNFL. On the contrary, PHOMS are hyperreflective structures located around the ONH and were not associated with RNFL loss.","output":"Optic disc drusen in children: morphologic features using EDI-OCT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Unrecognized malposition of the endotracheal tube (ETT) can lead to severe complications in patients under general anesthesia. The focus of this double-blinded randomized study was to assess the accuracy of point-of-care ultrasound in verifying the correct position of the ETT and to compare it with the accuracy of auscultation. METHODS Forty-two adult patients requiring general anesthesia with ETT were consented. Patients were randomized to right main bronchus, left main bronchus, or tracheal intubation. After randomization, the ETT was placed via fiber-optic visualization. Next, the location of the ETT was assessed using auscultation by a separate blinded anesthesiologist, followed by an ultrasound performed by a third blinded anesthesiologist. Ultrasound examination included assessment of tracheal dilation via cuff inflation with air and evaluation of pleural lung sliding. Statistical analysis included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and interobserver agreement for the ultrasound examination (95% CI). RESULTS In differentiating tracheal versus bronchial intubations, auscultation showed a sensitivity of 66% (0.39 to 0.87) and a specificity of 59% (0.39 to 0.77), whereas ultrasound showed a sensitivity of 93% (0.66 to 0.99) and specificity of 96% (0.79 to 1). Identification of tracheal versus bronchial intubation was 62% (26 of 42) in the auscultation group and 95% (40 of 42) in the ultrasound group (P = 0.0005) (CI for difference, 0.15 to 0.52), and the McNemar comparison showed statistically significant improvement with ultrasound (P < 0.0001). Interobserver agreement of ultrasound findings was 100%. CONCLUSION Assessment of trachea and pleura via point-of-care ultrasound is superior to auscultation in determining the location of ETT.","output":"Auscultation versus Point-of-care Ultrasound to Determine Endotracheal versus Bronchial Intubation: A Diagnostic Accuracy Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Assessing and ranking private health insurance companies provides insurance agencies, insurance customers, and authorities with a reliable instrument for the insurance decision-making process.

In one such study, 332 human proteins targeted by nCoV19 were identified. We expanded this set of host proteins by constructing their protein interactome, including in it not only the known protein-protein interactions (PPIs) but also novel, hitherto unknown PPIs predicted with our High-precision Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction (HiPPIP) model that was shown to be highly accurate. In fact, one of the earliest discoveries made possible by HiPPIP is related to activation of immunity upon viral infection. We found that several interactors of the host proteins are differentially expressed upon viral infection, are related to highly relevant pathways, and that the novel interaction of NUP98 with CHMP5 may activate an antiviral mechanism leading to disruption of viral budding. We are making the interactions available as downloadable files to facilitate future systems biology studies and also on a web-server at http://hagrid.dbmi.pitt.edu/corona that allows not only keyword search but also queries such as PPIs where one protein is associated with virus and the interactors with pulmonary.","output":"Interactome of SARS-CoV-2 / nCoV19 modulated host proteins with computationally predicted PPIs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity, defined as having two or more chronic diseases, has a major impact on public health and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). This study aims to assess the prevalence of medication adherence and associated factors among patients with multimorbidity. METHODS: A questionnaire-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted by a trained interviewer across patients with multimorbidity attending outpatient clinics in two tertiary referral hospitals in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Demographic and social variables and the outcome (self-reported adherence to long-term medication) were measured using the General Medication Adherence Scale (GMAS). Multiple logistic regression was used to assess medication adherence and associated factors. RESULTS: From a total of 630 participants included in this study, the estimated prevalence of high medication adherence is 78.57% (1.63478) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) [75.19, 81.61]. The odds of high medication adherence increased with age. The odds of high medication adherence for patients aged 66 years and older than those aged 19C35 years is adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.880, with a 95% CI [1.124, 13.390]. Patients with income more than 50,000 had the odds, AOR = 5.169 with a 95% CI [1.282, 20.843], compared to those earning less than 10,000 Dirhams (AED). Patients aged 36C65 with health insurance coverage had higher medication adherence than groups on the other end. The number of current medications is significantly (p-value = 0.027) associated with high medication adherence with the odds of high medication adherence, AOR = 4.529 with a 95% CI [1.184, 17.326], the highest for those currently taking four medications. CONCLUSION: This study highlights younger population having multimorbidity in the context of an increasing life expectancy and suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, the study highlights multimorbidity is associated with low medication adherence and out-of-pocket payment, and non-availability of insurance is a major hindrance to medication adherence.","output":"Medication Adherence Among Patients with Multimorbidity in the United Arab Emirates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccine hesitancy in the United States iscurrently at a high level.

CASE: Here we report a case of COVID-19 that was initially presented with keratoconjunctivitis with the appearance of respiratory symptoms four days later. The case showed improvement within four days of successful treatment for both covid pneumonia and ocular disease. DISCUSSION: Countable cases reported initial ocular symptoms to co-occur with systemic symptoms or even before. Only two cases reported the diagnosis of keratoconjunctivitis in COVID-19. The two cases differ in the proposed mechanism of developing such disorder. One by direct invasion of the virus, the other one by cytokines-induced epithelial injury. Our case did not show positivity for SARS-CoV 2 in the eye secretion, which aligns with the later proposed mechanism of pathology.

Current asthma management involves a step-up and step-down approach based on asthma control with a large degree of heterogeneity in responses to the main drug classes currently in use: (2)-adrenergic receptor agonists, corticosteroids, and leukotriene modifiers. Importantly, asthma is heterogeneous with respect to clinical presentation and the inflammatory mechanisms that underlie it. This heterogeneity likely contributes to variable results in clinical trials, particularly when targeting specific inflammatory mediators. These factors have motivated a drive toward stratified medicine in asthma based on clinical/cellular outcomes or genetics (i.e., pharmacogenetics). Significant progress has been made in identifying genetic polymorphisms that influence the efficacy and potential for adverse effects of all main classes of asthma drugs. Importantly an emerging role for genetics in phase II development of newer therapies has been demonstrated (e.g., anti-IL4). Similarly, the stratification of patients based on clinical characteristics (e.g., blood and sputum eosinophil levels) has been critical in evaluating newer therapies (e.g., anti-IL5). As a proof of concept, anti-IgE is the latest therapy to be introduced into clinical practice, although only for severe, allergic patients (i.e., in a stratified manner). As new asthma genes are identified using genome-wide association, among other technologies, new targets (e.g., IL33/IL33 receptor (IL1RL1)) will emerge and pharmacogenetics in these development programs will be essential.

Currently available instruments may not be sensitive to the concerns about COVID-19 in postacute and long-term care and their applications in telehealth remain to be clarified. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the psychometric properties of the Mood-5 Scale (M5) as a rapid self-assessment of the COVID-19 psychological burden among postacute and long-term care residents. METHODS: Residents (N=131), aged 50 years and above, from 20 postacute and long-term care facilities in Maryland, USA, were evaluated in-person or via telehealth (43/131, 32.8%) across a 4-week period (May 11 to June 5, 2020) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 psychological burden experienced by the residents was rated by geriatric psychologists who independently reviewed their clinical documentation. Psychometric analyses were performed on the M5 in relation to psychological tests, COVID-19 psychological burden, and diagnostic data collected during the evaluation. RESULTS: The M5 demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach =.77). M5 scores were not confounded by demographic variables or telehealth administration (P>.08). Convergent validity for the M5 was established via positive associations with anxiety (r=0.56, P<.001) and depressive (r=0.49, P<.001) symptoms. An M5 cutoff score of 3 demonstrated strong sensitivity (0.92) and adequate specificity (0.75) for identifying COVID-19 psychological distress among postacute and long-term care residents (area under the curve of 0.89, positive predictive value=0.79, negative predictive value=0.91). CONCLUSIONS: The M5 is a reliable and valid tool for self-assessment of mood that can help identify postacute and long-term care residents with significant psychological burden associated with COVID-19.

Herein, we investigated: (1) whether the effects of KINVIS therapy with therapeutic exercise (TherEx) on motor functions were induced through improved spasticity, (2) the relationship between resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) and motor functions before therapy, and (3) the baseline characteristics of rs-FC in patients with the possibility of improving their motor functions. Methods: Using data from a previous clinical trial, three path analyses in structural equation modeling were performed: (1) a mediation model in which the indirect effects of the KINVIS therapy with TherEx on motor functions through spasticity were drawn, (2) a multiple regression model with pre-test data in which spurious correlations between rs-FC and motor functions were controlled, and (3) a multiple regression model with motor function score improvements between pre- and post-test in which the pre-test rs-FC associated with motor function improvements was explored. Results: The mediation model illustrated that although KINVIS therapy with TherEx did not directly improve motor function, it improved spasticity, which led to ameliorated motor functions. The multiple regression model with pre-test data suggested that rs-FC of bilateral parietal regions is associated with finger motor functions, and that rs-FC of unaffected parietal and premotor areas is involved in shoulder/elbow motor functions. Moreover, the multiple regression model with motor function score improvements suggested that the weaker the rs-FC of bilateral parietal regions or that of the supramarginal gyrus in an affected hemisphere and the cerebellar vermis, the greater the improvement in finger motor function. Conclusion: The effects of KINVIS therapy with TherEx on upper limb motor function may be mediated by spasticity. The rs-FC, especially that of bilateral parietal regions, might reflect potentials to improve post-stroke impairments in using KINVIS therapy with TherEx.","output":"Model-Based Analyses for the Causal Relationship Between Post-stroke Impairments and Functional Brain Connectivity Regarding the Effects of Kinesthetic Illusion Therapy Combined With Conventional Exercise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Autonomy involves making independent decisions and creating lasting and equitable power relationships within families. Many factors, dependent on both the woman and her partner, can influence self-dependence, and subsequent decision-making, exerting a protective or triggering effect on its development. Therefore, the primary objective of the study was to assess autonomy in a sample of Lebanese women. The secondary objective was to evaluate the association between socioeconomic status, psychological factors, and autonomy. METHODS: A web based cross-sectional online study was conducted between June 8 and August 1, 2020. The questionnaire developed on Google Forms was distributed through social media and WhatsApp groups, using the snowball technique. The Womens Autonomy Index (WAI) was created using three items adapted from a previous study. In addition, the Composite Abuse Scale RevisedShort Form (CASR-SF) was used to assess three domains of abuse: physical, sexual, and psychological. The Perceived stress scale short version to measure stress perception, the Lebanese Anxiety Scale to measure anxiety and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess depression. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 25 was used for data analysis. Linear regressions were performed, taking the Womens Autonomy Index as the dependent variable. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 369 Lebanese women. University education level (beta = 1.263), alcohol consumption (beta = 0.586), intermediate income level (beta = 0.702), high income (beta = 0.911), employment (beta = 0.559), and older age (beta = 0.033) were significantly associated with higher WAI. Living in South Lebanon (beta = ? 0.668) and being Druze (beta = ? 323) were associated with lower WAI. Significantly higher mean scores of anxiety and perceived stress were found among women with low autonomy. CONCLUSION: In Lebanon, the autonomy of women depends on several personal and partner-related characteristics (education, socioeconomic status, age), in addition to the cultural (geographic and religious) environment. Furthermore, low autonomy is associated with higher perceived stress and anxiety and probable depression and domestic abuse.

This may exacerbate confusion and ICU-related delirium. The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that average hospital sound levels should not exceed 35 dB with a maximum of 40 dB overnight. We monitored five ICUs to check compliance with these guidelines. METHODS Sound levels were recorded in five adult ICUs in the UK. Two sound level monitors recorded concurrently for 24 hours at the ICU central stations and adjacent to patients. Sample values to determine levels generated by equipment and external noise were also recorded in an empty ICU side room. RESULTS Average sound levels always exceeded 45 dBA and for 50% of the time exceeded between 52 and 59 dBA in individual ICUs. There was diurnal variation with values decreasing after evening handovers to an overnight average minimum of 51 dBA at 4 AM. Peaks above 85 dBA occurred at all sites, up to 16 times per hour overnight and more frequently during the day. WHO guidelines on sound levels could be only achieved in a side room by switching all equipment off. CONCLUSION All ICUs had sound levels greater than WHO recommendations, but the WHO recommended levels are so low they are not achievable in an ICU. Levels adjacent to patients are higher than those recorded at central stations. Unit-wide noise reduction programmes or mechanical means of isolating patients from ambient noise, such as earplugs, should be considered.","output":"An investigation of sound levels on intensive care units with reference to the WHO guidelines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The impact of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on healthcare workers (HCWs) has been under-evaluated in Central America. We performed a seroepidemiological survey at a tertiary healthcare facility in El Salvador, where a large number of confirmed and far more suspected cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected HCWs had been documented during the first wave of the pandemic. Methods During January-February 2021, a total 973 HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Participants completed a questionnaire asking of their demographic data. Occupational risk was assessed by statistically comparing the seropositivity rates among different occupational categories. Results Overall seroprevalence in HCWs reached 52.6% (512 of 973). Of the seropositive individuals, 61.7% (316 of 512) had experienced a documented COVID-19 diagnosis, while the remaining 38.3% (196 of 512) were unrecognized seroconversions. Differences in seropositivity rates existed between occupational categories; nurses demonstrated the highest at 63.8% (222 of 348, risk ratio 1.44, p < 0.0001), followed by auxiliary HCWs assigned to patient-related work (55.9%, 52 of 93), and medical doctors (46.7%, 50 of 107). Several non-patient-related professions showed above-average seroprevalence, suggesting substantial SARS-CoV-2 contacts outside the workplace: 60.0% (6 of 10) and 68.0% (17 of 25) for nutritionists and pharmacists, respectively. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence exceeded 50% among HCWs in El Salvador, with disparity among occupational categories with different workplace exposure risks.

Research on LSG outcomes among adolescents assessed a narrow range of anthropometric, nutritional, or cardiometabolic parameters, leading to an incomplete picture of these changes. We examined a wide variety of anthropometric, nutritional, and cardiometabolic parameters among adolescents before and after LSG. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed medical charts of all obese adolescents who underwent LSG at Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar, between January 2011 and June 2015 (N = 102). We assessed preoperative levels and postoperative changes in 4 anthropometric, 15 nutritional, and 10 cardiometabolic parameters. RESULTS The study sample comprised 79 patients with complete information (36 males, mean age 15.99  1.1 years). At a mean of 24.2 months post-LSG, we observed (1) significantly reduced mean weight and body mass index by 51.82  28.1 kg and 17  6.24 kg/m2, respectively; (2) the highest prevalence of post-LSG deficiencies pertained to vitamin D, albumin, and ferritin (89.3, 38, and 33.3%, respectively); (3) low hemoglobin levels (29.3%) only in females; (4) trace elements were not deficient; (4) significant reductions in percentage of adolescents with elevated low-density lipoprotein (from 66.1 to 38.9%), alanine aminotransferase (from 45.3 to 10.9%), and aspartate aminotransferase (from 24.1 to 8.6%) levels; (5) 100% remission of prediabetes cases; and (6) 80% remission of type 2 diabetes cases. CONCLUSIONS LSG achieved significant weight loss and improvement of cardiometabolic risk factors among adolescents.

AIMS: In this study, we investigate the incidence of postponed, medically necessary, time-sensitive urological procedures due to a patients unwillingness to proceed to a recommended surgical intervention during the first phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHODS: We prospectively monitored all patients undergoing elective urological surgery during the initial phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The primary outcome measurement was incidence of postponed, medically necessary, urological procedures due to the patients decision not to proceed to a recommended urological intervention (16th of MarchC5th of June 2020). The secondary outcome measurements were the type of delayed procedure and duration of postponement. RESULTS: During the initial 12-week period of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, 155 elective urgent urological procedures were scheduled after pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 screening. In total, 140 procedures were performed and 15 (10%) patients intentionally delayed their urological procedure due to the perceived risk of acquiring nosocomial perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection. The duration for procedural delays is currently 42  23 (range: 15C80) days. The most frequently postponed procedures among patients unwilling to proceed to surgery are urgent endourological procedures due to symptomatic urolithiasis (n = 7/15). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence for patients postponing urological procedures due to the risk of acquiring nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 is 10%.

METHODS: Multicentre-combined (retrospectiveCprospective) cohort study with AC patients in the Community of Madrid between 1st March and 30th May 2020. 257 AC patients were involved in 16 public hospital. Multivariant binomial logistic regression (MBLR) was applied to mortality. RESULTS: Of COVID-19 patients, 30 were diagnosed at admission and 12 patients were diagnosed during de admission or 30 days after discharge. In non-COVID-19 patients, antibiotic therapy was received in 61.3% of grade I AC and 40.6% of grade II AC. 52.4% of grade III AC were treated with percutaneous drainage (PD). Median hospital stay was 5 [3C8] days, which was higher in the non-surgical treatment group with 7.51 days (p < 0.001) and a 3.25% of mortality rate (p < 0.21). 93.3% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at admission were treated with non-surgical treatment (p = 0.03), median hospital stay was 11.0 [7.5C27.5] days (p < 0.001) with a 7.5% of mortality rate (p > 0.05). In patients with hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection, 91.7% of grade ICII AC were treated with non-surgical treatment (p = 0.037), with a median hospital stay of 16 [4C21] days and a 18.2% mortality rate (p > 0.05). Hospital-acquired infection risk when hospital stay is > 7 days is OR 4.7, CI 95% (1.3C16.6), p = 0.009. COVID-19 mortality rate was 11.9%, AC severity adjusted OR 5.64 (CI 95% 1.417C22.64).

We aimed to investigate efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of NPI in households with influenza index patients. METHODS: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial during the pandemic season 2009/10 and the ensuing influenza season 2010/11. We included households with an influenza positive index case in the absence of further respiratory illness within the preceding 14 days. Study arms were wearing a facemask and practicing intensified hand hygiene (MH group), wearing facemasks only (M group) and none of the two (control group). Main outcome measure was laboratory confirmed influenza infection in a household contact. We used daily questionnaires to examine adherence and tolerability of the interventions. RESULTS: We recruited 84 households (30 control, 26 M and 28 MH households) with 82, 69 and 67 household contacts, respectively. In 2009/10 all 41 index cases had a influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 infection, in 2010/11 24 had an A (H1N1) pdm09 and 20 had a B infection. The total secondary attack rate was 16% (35/218). In intention-to-treat analysis there was no statistically significant effect of the M and MH interventions on secondary infections. When analysing only households where intervention was implemented within 36 h after symptom onset of the index case, secondary infection in the pooled M and MH groups was significantly lower compared to the control group (adjusted odds ratio 0.16, 95% CI, 0.03-0.92). In a per-protocol analysis odds ratios were significantly reduced among participants of the M group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.30, 95% CI, 0.10-0.94). With the exception of MH index cases in 2010/11 adherence was good for adults and children, contacts and index cases. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that household transmission of influenza can be reduced by the use of NPI, such as facemasks and intensified hand hygiene, when implemented early and used diligently. Concerns about acceptability and tolerability of the interventions should not be a reason against their recommendation.

Only a minority of patients can clear the virus spontaneously. Elimination of HCV during acute infection correlates with a rapid induction of innate, especially interferon (IFN)-induced genes, and a delayed induction of adaptive immune responses. There is a strong association between genetic variants in the IFN (IL28B) locus with the rate of spontaneous clearance. Individuals with the ancestral IFN4 allele capable of producing a fully active IFN4 are paradoxically not able to clear HCV in the acute phase and develop chronic hepatitis C (CHC) with more than 90% probability. In the chronic phase of HCV infection, the wild-type IFN4 genotype is strongly associated with an induction of hundreds of classical type I/type III IFN stimulated genes in hepatocytes. However, the activation of the endogenous IFN system in the liver is ineffective in clearing HCV, and is even associated with impaired therapeutic responses to pegylated (Peg)IFN containing treatments. While the role of genetic variation in the IFN locus to the outcome of CHC treatment has declined, it is clear that variation not only at this locus, but also at other loci, modulate clinically important liver phenotypes, including inflammation, fibrosis progression and the development of hepatocellular cancer.

We compared the proportion of cardiovascular disease history in moderate, severe, and critical cases. We obtained high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTn I) results from 68 patients. Patients were divided into two groups based on positive hs-cTn I result: those with cardiac injury (n = 19) and those without cardiac injury (n = 49). RESULTS: Compared with the group with moderate disease, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and smoking were more common in severe and critical cases. Diabetes mellitus was most common in the critical group. Age older than 65 years, presence of chronic kidney disease, and lower blood lymphocyte percentage were independent risk factors of cardiac injury. The total T- and B-lymphocyte counts and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts were significantly lower in those with cardiac injury. A minimal lymphocyte percentage < 7.8% may predict cardiac injury. The interleukin (IL) 6 level in plasma was elevated in the group with cardiac injury.

We summarized the cases described to date, including only patients with positive RT-PCR testing from nasopharyngeal swabs. Six hundred and fifty-five patients were found who presented different types of skin rashes, from maculopapular, vascular, vesicular, urticarial, to atypical forms and ocular involvement. Chilblains which are lesions resembling frostbite have been more frequent in the younger population and seemed to predict a milder disease course. Vascular-purpuric lesions appeared in older patients and were linked to a more severe evolution. In the case of vesicular rashes, the possibility of herpesvirus co-infections was raised. Moreover, cutaneous hydroxychloroquine drug reactions have been described. For patients with conjunctivitis, eye discharge might be contagious. These skin manifestations may help identify asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers in some cases or predict a more severe evolution in others. ABSTRACT: There have been increasing reports of skin manifestations in COVID-19 patients. We conducted a systematic review and included manuscripts describing patients with positive RT-PCR coronavirus testing from nasopharyngeal swabs who also developed cutaneous manifestations. A total of 655 patients were selected, with different types of skin rashes: Erythematous maculopapular (n = 250), vascular (n = 146), vesicular (n = 99), urticarial (n = 98), erythema multiforme/generalized pustular figurate erythema/Stevens-Johnson syndrome (n = 22), ocular/periocular (n = 14), polymorphic pattern (n = 9), generalized pruritus (n = 8), Kawasaki disease (n = 5), atypical erythema nodosum (n = 3), and atypical Sweet syndrome (n = 1). Chilblain-like lesions were more frequent in the younger population and were linked to a milder disease course, while fixed livedo racemosa and retiform purpura appeared in older patients and seemed to predict a more severe prognosis. For vesicular rashes, PCR determined the presence of herpesviruses in the vesicle fluid, which raised the possibility of herpesvirus co-infections. The erythema-multiforme-like pattern, generalized pustular figurate erythema and Stevens-Johnson syndrome were most frequently linked to hydroxychloroquine intake. A positive PCR determination of SARS-COV-2 from conjunctival swabs suggest that eye discharge can also be contagious.

Booster vaccines were offered starting from August 2021. Methods: The nationwide HUN-VE 3 study examined the effectiveness and durability of primary immunization and single booster vaccinations on SARS-CoV-2-related infection, hospitalization and mortality during the Delta wave. Results: The study population included 8,087,988 individuals aged 18-100 years at the beginning of the pandemic. During the Delta wave, after adjusting for age, sex, calendar day, and chronic diseases, vaccine effectiveness (VE) of primary vaccination against registered SARS-CoV-2 infection was between 11% to 77% and 18% to 79% 14-120 days after primary immunization in the 16-64 and 65-100 years age cohort respectively, while it decreased to close to zero in the younger age group and around 40% or somewhat less in the elderly after 6 months for almost all vaccine types. In the population aged 65-100 years, we found high, 88.1%-92.5% adjusted effectiveness against Covid-19 infection after the Pfizer-BioNTech, and 92.2%-95.6% after the Moderna booster dose, while Sinopharm and Janssen booster doses provided 26.5%-75.3% and 72.9%-100.0% adjusted VE, respectively. Adjusted VE against Covid-19 related hospitalization was high within 14-120 days for Pfizer-BioNTech: 76.6%, Moderna: 83.8%, Sputnik-V: 78.3%, AstraZeneca: 73.8%, while modest for Sinopharm: 45.7% and Janssen: 26.4%. The waning of protection against Covid-19 related hospitalization was modest and booster vaccination with mRNA vaccines or the Janssen vaccine increased adjusted VE up to almost 100%, while the Sinopharm booster dose proved to be less effective. VE against Covid-19 related death after primary immunization was high or moderate: for Pfizer-BioNTech: 81.5%, Moderna: 93.2%, Sputnik-V: 100.0%, AstraZeneca: 84.8%, Sinopharm: 58.6%, Janssen: 53.3%). VE against this outcome also showed moderate decline over time, while booster vaccines restored effectiveness up to almost 100%, except for the Sinopharm booster. Conclusions: The HUN-VE 3 study demonstrated waning VE with all vaccine types for all examined outcomes during the Delta wave and confirmed the outstanding benefit of booster vaccination with the mRNA or Janssen vaccines. This is the first study to provide comparable effectiveness results for six different booster types during the Delta pandemic wave.","output":"Effectiveness and waning of protection with different SARS-CoV-2 primary and booster vaccines during the Delta pandemic wave in 2021 in Hungary (HUN-VE 3 study)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has created massive demand for widespread, distributed tools for detecting SARS-CoV-2 genetic material.

METHODS: A prospective, randomized, controlled trial was conducted among patients with post COVID-19 anosmia. One hundred patients were randomly assigned to two groups; group I included 50 patients received mometasone furoate nasal spray in an appropriate dose of 2 puff (100 g) once daily in each nostril for 3 weeks with olfactory training, group II included 50 patients were advised to keep on olfactory training only. The assessment of smell was done using (Visual Analog Scale from 0 to 10). All patients were initially evaluated after their recovery from COVID-19 and followed up for 3 weeks. The smell scores were recorded weekly and the duration of smell loss was recorded from the onset of anosmia till the full recovery. RESULTS: In both groups, the smell scores significantly improved by the end of the third week (P < 0.001). By comparing smell scores between both groups after 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks of treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between both groups.

The clinical characteristics were descriptively analyzed.The chest CT features were quantitatively evaluated. Mann-Whitney U test was used to test the differences in three groups and between men and women. Spearman rank correlation was used to test the association between the arterial blood gas(ABG) analysis results and chest CT scores. Results Fever (69.1%) and cough (62.8%) were common symptoms. 111(36.2%) patients were anorexia. GGO was the most common manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia, which could be followed by consolidation and fibrosis. Lower lobe or subpleural region was the most common distribution form of lesion.

Type I interferon is crucial for control of viral replication and spread in the natural host, but the specific contributions of MDA5 signaling to this pathway as well as to pathogenesis and subsequent immune responses are largely unknown. In this study, we use MHV infection of the liver as a model to demonstrate that MDA5 signaling is critically important for controlling MHV-induced pathology and regulation of the immune response. Mice deficient in MDA5 expression (MDA5(-/-) mice) experienced more severe disease following MHV infection, with reduced survival, increased spread of virus to additional sites of infection, and more extensive liver damage than did wild-type mice. Although type I interferon transcription decreased in MDA5(-/-) mice, the interferon-stimulated gene response remained intact. Cytokine production by innate and adaptive immune cells was largely intact in MDA5(-/-) mice, but perforin induction by natural killer cells and levels of interferon gamma, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) in serum were elevated. These data suggest that MDA5 signaling reduces the severity of MHV-induced disease, at least in part by reducing the intensity of the proinflammatory cytokine response. IMPORTANCE Multicellular organisms employ a wide range of sensors to detect viruses and other pathogens. One such sensor, MDA5, detects viral RNA and triggers induction of type I interferons, chemical messengers that induce inflammation and help regulate the immune responses. In this study, we sought to determine the role of MDA5 during infection with mouse hepatitis virus, a murine coronavirus used to model viral hepatitis as well as other human diseases. We found that mice lacking the MDA5 sensor were more susceptible to infection than were mice with MDA5 and experienced decreased survival. Viral replication in the liver was similar in mice with and without MDA5, but liver damage was increased in MDA5(-/-) mice, suggesting that the immune response is causing the damage. Production of several proinflammatory cytokines was elevated in MDA5(-/-) mice, suggesting that MDA5 may be responsible for keeping pathological inflammatory responses in check.","output":"MDA5 Is Critical to Host Defense during Infection with Murine Coronavirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance Delirium is a common, serious, and potentially preventable problem for older adults, associated with adverse outcomes. Coupled with its preventable nature, these adverse sequelae make delirium a significant public health concern; understanding its economic costs is important for policy makers and health care leaders to prioritize care. Objective To evaluate current 1-year health care costs attributable to postoperative delirium in older patients undergoing elective surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants This prospective cohort study included 497 patients from the Successful Aging after Elective Surgery (SAGES) study, an ongoing cohort study of older adults undergoing major elective surgery. Patients were enrolled from June 18, 2010, to August 8, 2013. Eligible patients were 70 years or older, English-speaking, able to communicate verbally, and scheduled to undergo major surgery at 1 of 2 Harvard-affiliated hospitals with an anticipated length of stay of at least 3 days. Eligible surgical procedures included total hip or knee replacement; lumbar, cervical, or sacral laminectomy; lower extremity arterial bypass surgery; open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair; and open or laparoscopic colectomy. Data were analyzed from October 15, 2019, to September 15, 2020. Exposures Major elective surgery and hospitalization. Main Outcomes and Measures Cumulative and period-specific costs (index hospitalization, 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year follow-up) were examined using Medicare claims and extensive clinical data. Total inflation-adjusted health care costs were determined using data from Medicare administrative claims files for the 2010 to 2014 period. Delirium was rated using the Confusion Assessment Method. We also examined whether increasing delirium severity was associated with higher cumulative and period-specific costs. Delirium severity was measured with the Confusion Assessment Method-Severity long form. Regression models were used to determine costs associated with delirium after adjusting for patient demographic and clinical characteristics. Results Of the 566 patients who were eligible for the study, a total of 497 patients (mean [SD] age, 76.8 [5.1] years; 281 women [57%]; 461 White participants [93%]) were enrolled after exclusion criteria were applied. During the index hospitalization, 122 patients (25%) developed postoperative delirium, whereas 375 (75%) did not. Patients with delirium had significantly higher unadjusted health care costs than patients without delirium (mean [SD] cost, $146 358 [$140 469] vs $94 609 [$80 648]). After adjusting for relevant confounders, the cumulative health care costs attributable to delirium were $44 291 (95% CI, $34 554-$56 673) per patient per year, with the majority of costs coming from the first 90 days: index hospitalization ($20 327), subsequent rehospitalizations ($27 797), and postacute rehabilitation stays ($2803). Health care costs increased directly and significantly with level of delirium severity (none-mild, $83 534; moderate, $99 756; severe, $140 008), suggesting an exposure-response relationship. The adjusted mean cumulative costs attributable to severe delirium were $56 474 (95% CI, $40 927-$77 440) per patient per year. Extrapolating nationally, the health care costs attributable to postoperative delirium were estimated at $32.9 billion (95% CI, $25.7 billion-$42.2 billion) per year. Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that the economic outcomes of delirium and severe delirium after elective surgery are substantial, rivaling costs associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

Here we present an electrochemical immunosensor platform based on the use of highly porous graphitic carbon electrodes fabricated by direct laser writing of commercial polyimide tapes and chemically modified with capture IL-6 antibodies. The unique porous and 3D morphology, as well as the high density of edge planes of the graphitic carbon electrodes, resulted in a fast heterogeneous electron transfer (HET) rate, k(0) = 0.13 cm/s.

Indeed, several preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that this condition may induce susceptibility and the development of more aggressive infectious diseases, especially those caused by some bacteria (including Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, among others) and viruses [such as coronavirus 2 (CoV2), Influenza A virus, Hepatitis B, etc.]. Although the precise mechanisms that link glycemia to the exacerbated infections remain elusive, hyperglycemia is known to induce a wide array of changes in the immune system activity, including alterations in: (i) the microenvironment of immune cells (e.g., pH, blood viscosity and other biochemical parameters); (ii) the supply of energy to infectious bacteria; (iii) the inflammatory response; and (iv) oxidative stress as a result of bacterial proliferative metabolism. Consistent with this evidence, some bacterial infections are typical (and/or have a worse prognosis) in patients with hypercaloric diets and a stressful lifestyle (conditions that promote hyperglycemic episodes). On this basis, the present review is particularly focused on: (i) the role of diabetes in the development of some bacterial and viral infections by analyzing preclinical and clinical findings; (ii) discussing the possible mechanisms by which hyperglycemia may increase the susceptibility for developing infections; and (iii) further understanding the impact of hyperglycemia on the immune system.","output":"Susceptibility for Some Infectious Diseases in Patients With Diabetes: The Key Role of Glycemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to markets digitalization, both consumers and businesses are increasingly involved in e-commerce activities throughout the globe.

However, the factors that cause vaccine safety risks are complicated and meanwhile, data is difficult to obtain, making it a challenge for analyzing vaccine safety risks quantitatively. This paper concretises the issue of vaccine system safety by creatively proposing an analytical framework for the problem of uncertainty. First, the paper focuses on the whole process of vaccine safety, analyses risk factors affecting vaccine safety in development, approval, production, transportation, and supervision of vaccines in order to build a vaccine risk assessment system. The proposed framework is then used to construct a Bayesian network early warning system for vaccine risk. To address the difficulty of obtaining data, the probability of safety risks occurring throughout the process is calculated by combining expert knowledge and fuzzy set theory to obtain uncertainty data. In response to structural complexity, a comprehensive framework is constructed using fault trees and Bayesian networks to capture the correlation between risk factors. This analytical framework can provide guidance to governments and vaccine-related companies in their decision-making to prevent vaccine safety issues.

It is aimed to explore the residence characteristics of IgA+, IgG+, and IgM+ cells in the sheep small intestine, and the influence of Moniezia benedeni infection on them. Control group (n = 6) and infected group (n = 6) were selected, respectively, and the three subtype cells residing in the small intestine were systematically observed and analyzed. The results showed that in the Control group, the three types of positive cells were all distributed diffusely, and the total densities in jejunum, duodenum and ileum was gradually declined in turn. Notably, the change trend of IgA+ and IgG+ cells densities were both congruent with the total densities, and the differences among them were significant, respectively (P < 0.05); the IgM+ cells density was the highest in duodenum, followed by jejunum and ileum, there was no significant difference between duodenum and jejunum (P > 0.05), but both significantly higher than in ileum (P < 0.05). In the Infected group, their total densities in duodenum, jejunum and ileum were gradually declined in turn. Notably, the IgA+ and IgM+ cells densities change trend was the same as the total densities, and the differences among them were significant, respectively (P < 0.05). The IgG+ cells density in duodenum was the highest, followed by ileum and jejunum and there was significantly difference among them (P < 0.05). The comparison results between Control and Infected groups showed that from the duodenum, jejunum to ileum, IgA+, IgG+, and IgM+ cells were all reduced significantly, respectively.

However, little evidence exists regarding the correct timing for the execution of the swab test, especially for asymptomatic individuals and health care workers. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze changes in the positive findings over time in individual SARS-CoV-2 swab tests during a health surveillance program. METHODS: The study was conducted with 2071 health care workers at the University Hospital of Verona, with a known date of close contact with a patient with COVID-19, between February 29 and April 17, 2020. The health care workers underwent a health surveillance program with repeated swab tests to track their virological status. A generalized additive mixed model was used to investigate how the probability of a positive test result changes over time since the last known date of close contact, in an overall sample of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 and in a subset of individuals with an initial negative swab test finding before being proven positive, to assess different surveillance time intervals. RESULTS: Among the 2071 health care workers in this study, 191 (9.2%) tested positive for COVID-19, and 103 (54%) were asymptomatic with no differences based on sex or age. Among 49 (25.7%) cases, the initial swab test yielded negative findings after close contact with a patient with COVID-19. Sex, age, symptoms, and the time of sampling were not different between individuals with an initial negative swab test finding and those who initially tested positive after close contact. In the overall sample, the estimated probability of testing positive was 0.74 on day 1 after close contact, which increased to 0.77 between days 5 and 8. In the 3 different scenarios for scheduled repeated testing intervals (3, 5, and 7 days) in the subgroup of individuals with an initially negative swab test finding, the probability peaked on the sixth, ninth and tenth, and 13th and 14th days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Swab tests can initially yield false-negative outcomes. The probability of testing positive increases from day 1, peaking between days 5 and 8 after close contact with a patient with COVID-19. Early testing, especially in this final time window, is recommended together with a health surveillance program scheduled in close intervals.","output":"The Effect of Test Timing on the Probability of Positive SARS-CoV-2 Swab Test Results: Mixed Model Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Clarithromycin clinical efficacy has not been described in COVID-19. Research question: Is oral clarithromycin beneficial for treating patients diagnosed with COVID-19? Study and methods: An open-label non-randomized trial in 90 patients with COVID-19 of moderate severity was conducted at four study sites in Greece between May and October 2020. Ninety participants with respiratory tract infections received clarithromycin 500 mg every 12 hours for 7 days; another 90 standard-of-care (SOC) propensity score-matched concurrent controls received azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine. The composite primary endpoint was defined for patients with upper respiratory tract infection as: (a) no need for hospital re-admission or (b) lack of progression into lower respiratory tract infection and, for patients with lower respiratory tract infection, as at least 50% decrease of the score of respiratory symptoms at the end-of-treatment (EOT) without progression into severe respiratory failure (SRF). The incidence SRF at the test-of-cure (TOC) on day 14 was a secondary endpoint. For clarithromycin-treated patients, viral load of SARS-CoV-2, biomarkers, the function of mononuclear cells, and safety were assessed; biomarkers were also measured in SOC comparators. Results: The primary endpoint was attained in 86.7% of patients treated with clarithromycin (95% CIs 78.1-92.2%) and 73.3% of concurrent SOC comparators (95%CIs; 63.4-81.4%). The odds ratio for the primary endpoint with clarithromycin treatment in univariate analysis was 2.36 (95%CIs 1.09-5.08; P: 0.039). Results were confirmed after multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis (odds ratio 3.30; 95% CI 1.10-9.87; P: 0.033). At the TOC visit, the incidence of SRF was 12.2% (n = 11 ; 95%CIs 6.9-20.6%) among patients treated with clarithromycin (odds ratio for SRF 0.38; 95%CIs 0.17-0.84) versus 26.7% (n= 24; 95%CIs 18.6-36.6%) among concurrent SOC comparators (P: 0.023). Clarithromycin use was associated with decreases in circulating levels of C-reactive protein, of tumour necrosis factor-alpha and of interleukin (IL)-6; by an increase of the ratio of Th1 to Th2 mononuclear responses; and by suppression of SARS-CoV-2 relative viral load. No safety concerns were reported. Patients starting clarithromycin with the first five days from symptoms onset achieved better responses. Interpretation: Clarithromycin treatment is associated with early clinical improvement in patients with moderate COVID-19.

Despite important advances in prevention through vaccines, new rapid diagnostic tests and antibiotics, CAP management still has significant drawbacks. Mortality remains very high in severely ill patients presenting with respiratory failure or shock but is also high in the elderly. Even after a CAP episode, higher risk of death remains during a long period, a risk mainly driven by inflammation and patient-related co-morbidities. CAP microbiology has been altered by new molecular diagnostic tests that have turned viruses into the most identified pathogens, notwithstanding uncertainties about the specific role of each virus in CAP pathogenesis. Pneumococcal vaccines also impacted CAP etiology and thus had changed Streptococcus pneumoniae circulating serotypes. Pathogens from specific regions should also be kept in mind when treating CAP. New antibiotics for CAP treatment were not tested in severely ill patients and focused on multidrug-resistant pathogens that are unrelated to CAP, limiting their general use and indications for intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Similarly, CAP management could be personalized through the use of adjunctive therapies that showed outcome improvements in particular patient groups. Although pneumococcal vaccination was only convincingly shown to reduce invasive pneumococcal disease, with a less significant effect in pneumococcal CAP, it remains the best therapeutic intervention to prevent bacterial CAP.

However, the signaling events that trigger TNF-alpha and IL-6 induction in these cells upon MHV infection remain unknown. In this study, we explored the potential signaling events. We found that induction of TNF-alpha and IL-6 occurred as early as 2 h postinfection and was completely dependent on viral replication. Using inhibitors specific for three mitogen-activated protein kinases, we showed that induction of TNF-alpha and IL-6 by MHV-A59 infection was mediated through activation of the Janus N-terminal kinase signaling pathway, but not through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase or p38 signaling pathway. This finding was further confirmed with knockdown experiments using small interfering RNAs specific for Janus N-terminal kinase. Interestingly, while nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), a key transcription factor required for the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in most cell types, was activated in astrocytes during MHV-A59 infection, disruption of the NF-kappaB pathway by peptide inhibitors did not significantly inhibit TNF-alpha and IL-6 expression. Furthermore, experiments using chimeric viruses demonstrated that the viral spike and nucleocapsid proteins, which play important roles in MHV pathogenicity in mice, are not responsible for the differential induction of the cytokines.

METHODS: Retrospective, single-center, observational study at a specialized national weaning center in Germany. Patients medical records were reviewed to obtain data on demographics, comorbidities, respiratory indices, and the result of a prospectively documented, standardized spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) upon admission to the weaning center. Respiratory indices assessed were the ventilatory ratio (VR) and parameters derived from calculated mechanical power (MP). Predictors associated with failure of prolonged weaning and failure of the SBT were assessed using a binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 263 prolonged mechanically ventilated, tracheotomized patients, treated over a 5-year period were analyzed. After 3 weeks of mechanical ventilation, patients with unsuccessful weaning failed a SBT more frequently and showed significantly increased values for inspiratory positive airway pressure, driving pressure, VR, absolute MP, and MP normalized to predicted body weight and dynamic lung-thorax compliance (LTC-MP). In the logistic regression analyses, variables independently correlated with weaning failure were female gender (adjusted odds ratio 0.532 [95% CI 0.291C0.973]; p = 0.040), obesity (body mass index  30 kg/m(2)) (2.595 [1.210C5.562]; p = 0.014), COPD (3.209 [1.563C6.589]; p = 0.002), LTC-MP (3.470 [1.067C11.284]; p = 0.039), P(a)CO(2) on mechanical ventilation (1.101 [95% CI 1.034C1.173]; p = 0.003), and failure of the SBT (4.702 [2.250C9.825]; p < 0.001).

METHODS: Using a mixed methods design, we examined; 1) the impact of COVID-19 on endometriosis related healthcare, symptoms and functioning; and 2) the relationship between a measure of fear of COVID-19 and qualitative impact in 162 women with endometriosis. RESULTS: We found that 60% of women reported impact of the pandemic upon healthcare, with sub-themes documenting the difficulty of cancelled and delayed treatment, specific COVID-19 barriers, and the advantages and disadvantages of telehealth. Only 23% reported negative impact on symptoms, specifically stress; 76% reported impact on daily functioning, with sub-themes related to compromised work, social life and healthy living. A 'hidden benefits' theme revealed ways that COVID-19 had improved some women's lives, including working from home, and the opportunity for healthy lifestyle choices.

Unfortunately, despite the increasing prevalence of the disease, there is no effective drug for the treatment. A computational drug repurposing study would be an appropriate and rapid way to provide an effective drug in the treatment of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In this study, the inhibitory potential of more than 50 antiviral drugs on three important proteins of SARS-CoV-2, was investigated using the molecular docking method. METHODS: By literature review, three important proteins, including main protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and spike, were selected as the drug targets. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of protease, spike, and RdRp proteins was obtained from the Protein Data Bank. Proteins were energy minimized. More than 50 antiviral drugs were considered as candidates for protein inhibition, and their 3D structure was obtained from Drug Bank. Molecular docking settings were defined using Autodock 4.2 software and the algorithm was executed. RESULTS: Based on the estimated binding energy of docking and hydrogen bond analysis and the position of drug binding, five drugs including, indinavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, and remdesivir, had the highest inhibitory potential for all three proteins. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results, among the mentioned drugs, saquinavir and lopinavir showed the highest inhibitory potential for all three proteins compared to the other drugs. This study suggests that saquinavir and lopinavir could be included in the laboratory phase studies as a two-drug treatment for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition.","output":"Computational drug repurposing study of antiviral drugs against main protease, RNA polymerase, and spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using molecular docking method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infection, also called a hospital-acquired infection, is an infection acquired during admitting patients in health care facilities.

METHOD: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among all graduate health science students posted in the different departments at the University of Gondar in the College of Medicine and Health Sciences from February to June 2018. A total of 422 study participants were included. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20. RESULTS: Out of a total of 422 respondents, only 40% have taken training for infection prevention; out of which 39% had taken the training for a year ago. Moreover, only 35.5% have good knowledge of nosocomial infections as a result of the training; and only 32.5% have good understanding of the practical training given on prevention and control. Only 36% have good attitude towards its prevention and control. CONCLUSION: The result shows that only a few of the respondents have taken the infection prevention training. Yet, a smaller proportion of them had good knowledge, attitude, and practice on nosocomial infections.

They are also known as defender cells. But the imbalance in the number of WBCs in the blood can be hazardous. Leukemia is the most common blood cancer caused by an overabundance of WBCs in the immune system. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) usually occurs when the bone marrow creates many immature WBCs that destroy healthy cells. People of all ages, including children and adolescents, can be affected by ALL. The rapid proliferation of atypical lymphocyte cells can cause a reduction in new blood cells and increase the chances of death in patients. Therefore, early and precise cancer detection can help with better therapy and a higher survival probability in the case of leukemia. However, diagnosing ALL is time-consuming and complicated, and manual analysis is expensive, with subjective and error-prone outcomes. Thus, detecting normal and malignant cells reliably and accurately is crucial. For this reason, automatic detection using computer-aided diagnostic models can help doctors effectively detect early leukemia. The entire approach may be automated using image processing techniques, reducing physicians' workload and increasing diagnosis accuracy. The impact of deep learning (DL) on medical research has recently proven quite beneficial, offering new avenues and possibilities in the healthcare domain for diagnostic techniques. However, to make that happen soon in DL, the entire community must overcome the explainability limit. Because of the black box operation's shortcomings in artificial intelligence (AI) models' decisions, there is a lack of liability and trust in the outcomes. But explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can solve this problem by interpreting the predictions of AI systems. This study emphasizes leukemia, specifically ALL. The proposed strategy recognizes acute lymphoblastic leukemia as an automated procedure that applies different transfer learning models to classify ALL. Hence, using local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) to assure validity and reliability, this method also explains the cause of a specific classification. The proposed method achieved 98.38% accuracy with the InceptionV3 model. Experimental results were found between different transfer learning methods, including ResNet101V2, VGG19, and InceptionResNetV2, later verified with the LIME algorithm for XAI, where the proposed method performed the best. The obtained results and their reliability demonstrate that it can be preferred in identifying ALL, which will assist medical examiners.","output":"Explainable AI in Diagnosing and Anticipating Leukemia Using Transfer Learning Method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital health and telehealth connectivity have become important aspects of clinical care.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed the screening system based on data mining, molecular docking and network pharmacology. Data mining and association network were used to mine the high-frequency herbs and formulas from ancient prescriptions. Virtual screening for the effective components of high frequency CMs and compatibility Chinese Medicine was explored by a molecular docking approach. Furthermore, network pharmacology method was used to preliminarily uncover the molecule mechanism. RESULTS: 574 prescriptions were obtained from 96,606 classical prescriptions with the key words to treat \\"Warm diseases (Wenbing)\\", \\"Pestilence (Wenyi or Yibing)\\" or \\"Epidemic diseases (Shiyi)\\". Meanwhile, 40 kinds of CMs, 36 CMs-pairs, 6 triple-CMs-groups existed with high frequency among the 574 prescriptions. Additionally, the key targets of SARS-COV-2, namely 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2), were used to dock the main ingredients from the 40 kinds by the LigandFitDock method. A total of 66 compounds components with higher frequency were docked with the COVID-19 targets, which were distributed in 26 kinds of CMs, among which Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma), HuangQin (Scutellariae Radix), Dahuang (Rhei Radix Et Rhizome) and Chaihu (Bupleuri Radix) contain more potential compounds.

The present in-silico study was attempted to identify peptide fragments from spike surface glycoprotein that can be efficiently used for the designing and development of epitope-based vaccine designing approach. Both B-cell and T-cell epitopes are predicted using integrated computational tools. VaxiJen server was used for prediction of protective antigenicity of the protein. NetCTL was studied for analyzing most potent T cell epitopes and its subsequent MHC-I interaction through tools provided by IEDB. 3D structure prediction of peptides and MHC-I alleles (HLA-C*03:03) was further done to carry out docking studies using AutoDock4.0. Various tools from IEDB were used to predict B-cell epitopes on the basis of different essential parameters like surface accessibility, beta turns and many more.

METHODS: We reviewed 218 intubated patients at Stony Brook University Hospital and stratified them into three groups based on AGI severity, according to data collected in the first 10 days of ICU course. We used chi-square test to compare categorical variables such as age and sex and two-sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U-tests for continuous variables, including important laboratory values. Cox proportional hazards regression models were utilized to determine whether AGI score was an independent predictor of survival, and multivariable analysis was performed to compare risk factors that were deemed significant in the univariable analysis. We performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis based on the AGI score and the presence of FI. RESULTS: The overall incidence of AGI was 95% (45% AGI I/II, 50% AGI III/IV), and FI incidence was 63%. Patients with AGI III/IV were more likely to have prolonged mechanical ventilation (22 days vs 16 days, P-value <0.002) and higher mortality rate (58% vs 28%, P-value <0.001) compared to patients with AGI 0/I/II. This was confirmed with multivariable analysis which showed that AGI score III/IV was an independent predictor of higher mortality (AGI III/IV vs AGI 0/I/II hazard ratio (HR), 2.68; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.69-4.25; P-value <0.0001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that both AGI III/IV and FI (P-value <0.001) were associated with worse outcomes. Patients with AGI III/IV had higher daily and mean D-dimer and CRP levels compared to AGI 0/I/II (P-value <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of AGI and FI among critically ill COVID-19 patients was high. AGI grades III/IV were associated with higher risk for prolonged mechanical ventilation and mortality compared to AGI 0/I/II, while it also correlated with higher D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. FI was independently associated with higher mortality.

We present the rationale and design of the ARISE study, which aims to assess glycaemic control and other clinical parameters associated with IDegAsp use in real world. METHODS: ARISE is a ~26-wk-long, prospective, non-interventional, single-arm study of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) initiating IDegAsp treatment. Approximately 1112 patients with T2D aged 18 years previously on anti-hyperglycaemic drugs except IDegAsp will be enroled across six countries from 15 Aug 2019 to 12 Nov 2020. IDegAsp treatment will be initiated at the physicians discretion and as per the local label. Key exclusion criteria include previous participation, or previous IDegAsp treatment. The primary and secondary endpoints are change in HbA(1c) from baseline (wk 0) to study end (wk 26C36) and the proportion of patients achieving the target HbA(1c) level of <7% at the study end, respectively.

Thus, drugs targeting the preservation and restoration of endothelial function represent an attractive therapeutic target to treat endothelial dysfunction-derived cardiopulmonary diseases. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), especially a sub-family of proton-sensing GPCRs including GPR4 and GPR68, have been recently suggested to play a role in the modulation of endothelial function. In this study, we investigated the barrier protective and anti-inflammatory effects of two recently developed novel class of GPR68 inhibitors: ogremorphins OGM8345 and OGM-1 in cultured human lung endothelial cells as well as in mice. METHODS Endothelial permeability was measured by monitoring transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) across human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (HPAECs). Protein and mRNA expression levels of endothelial inflammation markers were analyzed by western blot and quantitative real time PCR, respectively. Acidosis was induced by switching cells to acidic pH (6.5) medium and luciferase-based Tango assay was performed to evaluate GPR68 activation. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS from Escherichia coli) or heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus (HKSA), and vascular leak/inflammation was assessed by determining the extravasation of intravenously injected Evans blue tracer into lungs and total cells/protein count in bronchoalveolar lavage samples. RESULTS Both OGM8345 (1-5 M) and OGM-1 (0.3-1.5 M) induced a robust dose-dependent increase in basal EC barrier function that was evident by an 150-200% increase in TER values. Both inhibitors also markedly attenuated LPS- and HKSA-induced endothelial hyperpermeability. LPS or HKSA-induced upregulation of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines genes TNF-, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1, and CXCL5 was significantly attenuated by OGMs as demonstrated by RT-PCR analysis. Consistently, both OGMs suppressed LPS- and HKSA-induced protein expression of phospho-NFkB, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. In contrast, pharmacologic inhibition of GPR4 by NE 52-QQ57 failed to alleviate LPS or HKSA-induced EC barrier dysfunction and inflammation. Importantly, LPS, HKSA or acidosis stimulation resulted in increased GPR68 mRNA expression as well as GPR68 activity that was inhibited by OGMs. Both OGMs attenuated vascular leak and lung inflammation caused by intratracheal injection of LPS or HKSA in C57BL/6 mice as illustrated by reduced Evans blue accumulation in the lungs and significant inhibition of inflammatory cells and protein content in bronchoalveolar lavage samples. CONCLUSION Altogether, these results establish an essential role of GPR68 in endothelial dysfunction and strongly suggest a therapeutic potential of GPR68-selective inhibitors in improving endothelial dysfunction-derived lung injuries.","output":"GPR68 Inhibition with a Novel Group of Ogremorphin Inhibitors Upregulate Endothelial Barrier Function and Protect Against Bacterial Pathogens or Acidosis-induced Inflammation in Lung Endothelium."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hand hygiene (HH) is a cost-effective measure to reduce healthcare-associated infections. The overall characteristics and changes of hand hygiene compliance (HHC) among healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic provided evidence for targeted HH intervention measures. AIM: To systematically review the literature and conduct a meta-analysis of studies investigating the rate of HHC and the characteristics of HH during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, WanFang Data, VIP and CBM databases were searched. All the original articles with valid HHC data among healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic (from January 1, 2020 to October 1, 2021) were included. Meta-analysis was performed using a DerSimonian and Laird model to yield a point estimate and a 95% CI for the HHC rate. The heterogeneity of the studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Q test and I(2) statistics and a random-effects model was used to contrast between different occupations, the WHO five-moments of HH and different observation methods. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines were followed. FINDINGS: Seven studies with 2377 healthcare providers reporting HHC were identified. The estimated overall HHC was 74%, which was higher than that reported in previous studies (5%-89%). Fever clinic has become a new key place for HHC observation. Nurses had the highest HHC (80%; 95% CI:74%C87%) while auxiliary workers (70%; 95%CI:62%C77%) had the lowest. For the WHO five-moments, the healthcare providers had the highest HHC after contact with the body fluids of the patients (91%; 95% CI:88%C94%), while before contact with patients healthcare providers had the lowest HHC (68%; 95% CI:62%C74%) which was consistent with before the pandemic. There existed great HHC differences among different monitoring methods (automatic monitoring system:53%; 95% CI:44%C63% vs openly and secretly observation: 91%; 95% CI: 90%C91%). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the compliance of healthcare providers HH showed a great improvement. The fever clinics have become the focused departments for HH monitoring. The HHC of auxiliary workers and the HH opportunity for before contact with patients should be strengthened. In the future, it will be necessary to develop standardized HH monitoring tools for practical work.","output":"Compared Hand Hygiene Compliance among Healthcare Providers before and after the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Rapid Review and Meta-analysis: Hand Hygiene Compliance among Healthcare Providers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the causal relationship between crude oil and gold spot prices to assess how the economic impact of COVID-19 has affected them.

This study examined the prevalence of anxiety and depression during COVID-19 lockdown in Bangladesh, and their association with some less explored factors like perceived and relative health status, having elderly members in the family, fear for own and family future, and others from the Asian context. METHODS: Using an online survey, data were collected from the population aged 18 years and above, on socio-demographic and economic attributes, and two separate standardized twelve-item scales were used to assess the level of anxiety and depression. Both descriptive and multivariate linear regression were used to analyze the factors associated with anxiety and depression scores. RESULTS: The respondents had an average anxiety score of 21.74 (SD = 8.20) on a scale ranging from 12 to 60 and an average depression score of 24.39 (SD = 10.30) on the same scale. The study findings revealed that respondents' concern for future well-being, perceived physical health status compared to others in the same cohort, and perceived physical health status during the survey compared to prior COVID-19 were significantly associated with anxiety and depression scores during COVID-19 lockdown. In addition, the anxiety score was significantly higher (p = 0.046) for women respondents than men. Moreover, respondents aged 18C24 years had significantly higher (p < 0.001) depression than others. CONCLUSIONS: The increased level of anxiety and depression during COVID-19 of adult people in Bangladesh are associated with several factors of which their greater concern about the future of their own and family members and health-related attributes are important. These findings may lead to developing interventions to reduce the psychological crisis during the pandemic in Bangladesh.","output":"Determinants of anxiety and depression among Bangladeshi adults during COVID-19 lockdown: An online survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of the present study was to gain new insights into the evolution, homologous recombination, and selection pressures imposed on the porcine torovirus (PToV), by examining the changes in the hemagglutininCesterase (HE) gene. The most recent common ancestor of PToV was estimated to have emerged 62 years ago based upon HE gene sequence data obtained from PToV isolates originating from Spain, South Korea, Netherlands, Hungary, and Italy and using the HE gene of Bovine torovirus isolates Niigata1 (AB661456) and Niigata3 (AB661458) as outgroups. The HE gene sequence data segregated all the PToV isolates into two well-supported monophyletic groups; however, various isolates from Spain, Italy, and South Korea did not segregate geographically suggesting very recent translocation of the viruses to these localities. Evidence of recombination was observed between two South Korean isolates that partitioned into two distinct subclades. Data further suggest that most of the nucleotides in the HE gene are under negative selection; however, changes within codon 237 showed an evidence of positive selection.

G4 structure dynamics is regulated by G4 structure binding proteins and is thought to be crucial for the maintenance of genome integrity in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Growing research over the last decade has expanded the existing knowledge of the functional diversity of G4 (DNA and RNA) structures across the working models. The control of G4 structure dynamics using G4 binding drugs has been suggested as the putative targets in the control of cancer and bacterial pathogenesis. This review has brought forth the collections of recent information that indicate G4 (mostly G4 DNA) roles in microbial pathogenesis, DNA damaging stress response in bacteria and mammalian cells. Studies in mitochondrial gene function regulation by G4s have also been underscored. Finally, the interdependence of G4s and epigenetic modifications and their speculated medical implications through G4 interacting proteins has been discussed.","output":"Guanine quadruplexes and their roles in molecular processes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Glycyrrhizin (GL) is a major active constituent of licorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra) that is considered one of the oldest and most frequently employed botanicals in Chinese medicine and worldwide, with most effects attributed to its rich GL content. Structurally, GL a triterpene saponin that is widely used as a flavoring agent in foodstuffs and cosmetics, and also proposed for various clinical applications with a myriad of health benefits. Pharmacological and biological activities of GL include antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer activities (in vitro and in vivo). Currently, there is no comprehensive review on GL biological effects and its action mechanisms. PURPOSE This review summarizes GL pharmacological actions from a molecular biology perception, presented on its metabolism and side effects based on in vitro, in vitro and clinical studies. Moreover, the potential of GL as a nanomedicine delivery system is also summarized. The progress in drug delivery research using GL presented herein is expected to provide a theoretical basis for developing other novel drugs formulations. METHODS A systematic review was carried out in several electronic databases (Science Direct, SpringerLink, CNKI, PubMed, Web of Science, Elsevier, and Scopus), using the following key words: glycyrrhizin \\"AND\\" bioactivity \\"OR\\" clinic \\"OR\\" therapeutic \\"OR\\" drug delivery. This search included manuscripts published between 1989 and 2021. RESULTS 126 researches were selected and summarized in this review. The analysis of these studies indicated that GL has antiviral activity against different viruses. Further, GL efficiently suppressed the respiratory manifestations associated with COVID-19 by reducing the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that employed by the virus as an entry point. Otherwise, GL was found to induce antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immune-modulatory, and anticancer activity. Besides, diminution the particle size of GL to nanometer size significantly augments their action and biodistribution. CONCLUSION This article summarizes the pharmacological actions of GL. The potential of GL as a nanomedicine delivery system is also presented. Nevertheless, most studies reported provide no deep insight of GL health effects warranting for more future studies to elucidate its action mechanism and potential therapeutic benefits through preclinical and clinical trials.","output":"Recent advances in glycyrrhizin metabolism, health benefits, clinical effects and drug delivery systems for efficacy improvement; a comprehensive review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this work is to clarify the incidence of meningitis/encephalitis in SARS-CoV-2 patients. We conducted an initial search in PubMed using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms meningitis, and encephalitis,, and COVID-19 to affirm the need for a review on the topic of the relationship between meningitis/encephalitis and SARS-CoV-2 infection. We included case series, case reports and review articles of COVID-19 patients with these neurological symptoms. Through PubMed database we identified 110 records.
