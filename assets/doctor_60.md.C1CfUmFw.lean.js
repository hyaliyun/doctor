The present study substantially highlights the first evidence of West Nile Virus (WNV) infection, a mosquito borne virus in the Malaysian macaques and bats. Of the 81 macaques sampled, 24 of the long-tailed macaques were seropositive to WNV, indicating that they were exposed to the virus in the past. The long-tailed macaques were found in the mangrove forests located in the Central, Southern, and West Peninsular Malaysia. Meanwhile, five out of 41 bats (Lesser Short-nosed Fruit Bats, Lesser Sheath-tailed Bats, and Thai Horseshoe Bats) that were found in the caves from Northern Peninsular Malaysia showed susceptibility to WNV. Therefore, a constant bio surveillance of WNV in the wildlife in Malaysia is a proactive attempt. This study was aligned with the Malaysian governments mission under the Malaysia Strategy for Emerging Diseases and Public Health Emergencies (MYSED) II (2017C2021) and the Ministry of Health priorities in order to enhance the regional capability to rapidly and accurately survey, detect, diagnose, and report outbreaks of pathogens and diseases of security concern. ABSTRACT: The role of wildlife such as wild birds, macaques, and bats in the spreading and maintenance of deadly zoonotic pathogens in nature have been well documented in many parts of the world. One such pathogen is the mosquitoes borne virus, namely the West Nile Virus (WNV). Previous research has shown that 1:7 and 1:6 Malaysian wild birds are WNV antibody and RNA positive, respectively, and bats in North America may not be susceptible to the WNV infection. This study was conducted to determine the status of WNV in Malaysian macaques and bats found in mangrove forests and caves, respectively. Archive sera and oropharyngeal swabs from long-tailed macaques were subjected to the antibody detection using WNV competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) and WNV RNA using RT-PCR, respectively, while the archive oropharyngeal and rectal swabs from bats were subjected to RT-PCR without serological analysis due to the unavailability of serum samples. The analysis revealed a WNV seropositivity of 29.63% (24/81) and none of the macaques were positive for WNV RNA. Meanwhile, 12.2% (5/41) of the bats from Pteropodidae, Emballonuridae, and Rhinolophidae families tested positive for WNV RNA. Here, we show a high WNV antibody prevalence in macaques and a moderate WNV RNA in various Malaysian bat species, suggesting that WNV circulates through Malaysian wild animals and Malaysian bat species may be susceptible to the WNV infection.","output":"Exposure to Zoonotic West Nile Virus in Long-Tailed Macaques and Bats in Peninsular Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND We evaluated different pain profiles as prospective predictors of multisite pain in 13-year-old adolescents (1300 girls and 1457 boys) enrolled in Generation XXI, a birth cohort study in Portugal. METHODS Pain history was queried using the Luebeck Pain Questionnaire through parent proxy- (ages 7 and 10) and adolescent (age 13) self-reports. We estimated the risk of multisite pain (2 or more pain sites) at age 13, according to previous pain experiences, including accumulation and timing. We defined five profiles that combined adverse features at ages 7 and 10 (recurrence, multisite, frequency, duration, intensity, triggers, activity restrictions, passive coping, and family history) and estimated their relative risks (RR) and likelihood ratios (LR) for adolescent multisite pain. RESULTS At age 13, 39.2% of girls and 27.2% of boys reported multisite pain in the previous three months. The risk was higher among girls with multisite and recurrent pain at ages 7 and 10 than in girls without those adverse features, especially if psychosocial triggers were also present (RR 1.87; 95% confidence interval 1.36, 2.36 and LR 3.49; 1.53, 7.96). Boys with recurrent pain of higher frequency and causing activity restrictions at ages 7 and 10 had higher risk of multisite pain at 13 (RR 2.05; 1.03, 3.05 and LR 3.06; 1.12, 8.39). Earlier adverse experiences were more predictive of future pain in girls than in boys. CONCLUSIONS Different profiles were useful to rule in future multisite pain in boys and girls. This provides clues for early stratification of chronic pain risk.","output":"Refining the prediction of multisite pain in 13-year-old boys and girls by using parent-reported pain experiences in the first decade of life."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Since the COVID-19 pandemic there is concern for subclinical cardiac pathology in the absence of clinical symptoms in collegiate athletes, we present 4 cases of abnormal left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS), a red-flag for potential COVID-19 myocardial disease, following diagnosis with diverse abnormalities reported via multimodality imaging weeks into recovery. METHODS: Cardiac imaging studies consisting of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) were performed 10 days post-COVID-19 diagnosis and several weeks into recovery. RESULTS: Initial TTE revealed abnormal left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS), an identified red-flag for potential COVID-19 myocardial disease. Further CMR imaging revealed potential recent/prior myocarditis in 1 athlete. Follow-up TTE several weeks later revealed a return to normal LVGLS.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the monthly pattern of visits to the Paediatric Emergency Department (PED) of patients 0 to 14 years of age, the rate of patients diagnosed with RSV acute bronchiolitis per thousand inhabitants of 0 to 24 months, and the rate of them requiring hospital admission during the winter 2020-2021, in the context of local and national COVID-19 restrictions and compare them to the four previous seasons. METHODS: Interrupted time series analysis of patients assisted in the PED and diagnosed with or admitted for RSV acute bronchiolitis in a tertiary University Hospital from January 2016 to February 2020 (pre-intervention period) and from March 2020 to June 2021 (post-intervention period). INTERVENTION: Preventive PHM implemented by the Spanish government weighted by the Containment and Health Index of the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. RESULTS: The intervention was followed by an immediate reduction of the rate of visits to the PED of -19.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] -24.0, -14.9) per thousand, and the rate of diagnoses and admissions for RSV acute bronchiolitis of -44.3 (95% CI -73.8, -14.8) and -1.4 (95% CI -2.7, -0.1) per thousand, respectively, with a delayed rebound. CONCLUSIONS: After the implementation of PHM to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, an immediate and important decline in the visits to the PED was observed, with an upward change thereafter. There was also an initial reduction in the diagnoses of and admissions by RSV acute bronchiolitis.

This study describes variation in vaccination coverage by sociodemographic characteristics between December 2020 and August 2021. MethodsUsing population-level administrative records linked to the 2011 Census, we estimated monthly first dose vaccination rates by age group and sociodemographic characteristics amongst adults aged 18 years or over in England. We also present a tool to display the results interactively. FindingsOur study population included 35,223,466 adults. A lower percentage of males than females were vaccinated in the young and middle age groups (18-59 years) but not in the older age groups. Vaccination rates were highest among individuals of White British and Indian ethnic backgrounds and lowest among Black Africans (aged []80 years) and Black Caribbeans (18-79 years). Differences by ethnic group emerged as soon as vaccination roll-out commenced and widened over time. Vaccination rates were also lower among individuals who identified as Muslim, lived in more deprived areas, reported having a disability, did not speak English as their main language, lived in rented housing, belonged to a lower socio-economic group, and had fewer qualifications. InterpretationWe found inequalities in COVID-19 vaccination rates by sex, ethnicity, religion, area deprivation, disability status, English language proficiency, socio-economic position, and educational attainment, but some of these differences varied by age group. Research is urgently needed to understand why these inequalities exist and how they can be addressed. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for publications on sociodemographic inequalities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage. Several studies have reported differences in coverage by characteristics such as ethnicity and religion, however these have focused on older adults and the clinically vulnerable who were initially prioritized for vaccination. There is little evidence on sociodemographic inequalities in vaccination coverage among younger adults and evidence is also lacking on coverage by a wider range of characteristics such as sex, disability status, English language proficiency, socio-economic position, and educational attainment. Added value of this studyThis study provides the first evidence for sociodemographic inequalities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage among the entire adult population in England, using population-level administrative records linked to the 2011 Census. By disaggregating the data by age group, we were able to show that disparities in coverage by some sociodemographic characteristics differed by age group. For example, a lower proportion of males than females were vaccinated in the young and middle age groups (18-59 years) but not in the older age groups, and vaccination rates were lowest among Black Africans in those aged []80 years but lowest among Black Caribbeans for all other age groups. Vaccination rates were also lower among individuals who identified as Muslim, lived in more deprived areas, reported having a disability, did not speak English as their main language, lived in rented housing, belonged to a lower socio-economic group, and had fewer qualifications. Implications of all the available evidenceMany of the groups with the lowest rates of COVID-19 vaccination are also the groups that have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, including severe illness and mortality. Research is urgently needed to understand why these disparities exist and how they can be addressed, for example through public health or community engagement programmes. Since the relationships between sociodemographic characteristics and vaccination coverage may differ by age group, it is important for future research to disaggregate by age group when examining these inequalities.","output":"Monitoring sociodemographic inequality in COVID-19 vaccination coverage in England: a national linked data study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is an indolent B-cell malignancy, usually driven by the BRAF V600E mutation.

Based on underlying similarities children were classified as post-COVID MIS-C with overlapping Kawasaki Disease, MISC with no overlapping Kawasaki Disease and MIS-C with shock. Post-discharge, patients were followed at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 16 months. Findings: Forty-one patients predominantly males (73%), at a median age of 7(0.2-16) years fulfilled the World Health Organisation criteria for MIS-C. Cardiac involvement was seen in 15 (36.5%) patients;impaired left ventricle (LV) function in 5 (12.2%), coronary artery involvement in 10 (24.4%), and pericardial effusion in 6 (14.6%) patients. No arrhythmia was noted in any case. There were 2 hospital deaths (4.9%), both in MIS-C shock subgroup (20%). At one-month there was persistent LV dysfunction in 2/5, coronary artery abnormalities in 7/10 and pericardial effusion resolved completely in all patients.

Objective: To investigate the immediate impact of COVID-19 pandemic on life-space mobility of community-dwelling Brazilian older adults and examine the social determinants of health associated with change in life-space mobility. Design: Baseline data from a prospective cohort study (REMOBILIZE Study). Setting: Community. Subject: A convenience snowball sample of participants aged 60 and older (n = 1,482) living in 22 states in Brazil. Methods: We conducted an online and phone survey using an adapted version of the Life-Space Assessment (LSA). Linear regression models were used to investigate social determinants of health on the change in LSA score. Results: Regardless of their gender and social determinants of health, participants showed a significant reduction in life-space mobility since COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.

However, profound impact of coronavirus on host cells remains elusive. In this study, we analyzed transcriptome of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infected human lung-derived cells, and observed that infection of these coronaviruses all induced increase of retrotransposon expression with upregulation of TET genes. Upregulation of retrotransposon was also observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected human intestinal organoids. Retrotransposon upregulation may lead to increased genome instability and enhanced expression of genes with readthrough from retrotransposons. Therefore, people with higher basal level of retrotransposon such as cancer patients and aged people may have increased risk of symptomatic infection. Additionally, we show evidence supporting long-term epigenetic inheritance of retrotransposon upregulation. We also observed chimeric transcripts of retrotransposon and SARS-CoV-2 RNA for potential human genome invasion of viral fragments, with the front and the rear part of SARS-CoV-2 genome being easier to form chimeric RNA. Thus, we suggest that primers and probes for nucleic acid detection should be designed in the middle of virus genome to identify live virus with higher probability. In summary, we propose our hypothesis that coronavirus invades human cells and interacts with retrotransposon, eliciting more severe symptoms in patients with underlying diseases.

Implementation of different strategies to counter the spread of the disease requires a certain degree of a quantitative understanding of the time-dependence of the outcome. Here, we compartmentalize the susceptible population into two categories, (i) vulnerables and (ii) resilients (including asymptomatic carriers), and study the dynamical evolution of the disease progression.

China was the first country to control the COVID-19 pandemic, and domestic air traffic recovers at a fast pace. Compared to 2019 level, world scheduled capacity, passengers carried, and revenues for 2020 were reduced by 50%, 60%, and $371 billion, respectively. Compared with domestic passenger traffic, international passenger traffic reduces more seats, passengers, and revenues. Because air transport contributes to economic growth, many countries or regions provide aviation bailout. The US provides most direct aid, while China mostly provides policy measures.

Debilitating and even deadly complications have occurred to the millions. A recent study reported 31% of right ventricular dilation in the hospitalized COVID\\\\19 patients, which is significantly associated with the mortality. Therefore, we sought to search for the lines of evidence in the literature that COVID\\\\19 may contribute to right heart dysfunction. The relevant literature and data from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library databases, and Web of Science were searched using the MeSH terms including COVID\\\\19, SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, novel coronavirus pneumonia, novel coronavirus, right heart failure, right heart dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism, and various combinations. The collected literature and data were sorted and summarized. Literature reports that angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the host receptor mediating the cell entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Clinical and experimental evidence shows that loss of function of ACE2 aggravates pulmonary hypertension and gain of function of ACE2 exerts protection on cardiopulmonary circulation. Moreover, the patients with COVID\\\\19 are more susceptible to pulmonary embolism and severe pneumonia\\\\induced acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, COVID\\\\19 may cause right heart dysfunction by inducing pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Particular attention should be paid to the function of the right heart, the overlooked chamber in COVID\\\\19. Blood gas analysis, laboratory test of cardiac injury markers, physical examination, and echocardiography should be performed to identify right heart failure as early as possible. Once the right heart failure is confirmed, the therapeutic modalities following the guidelines of European Society of Cardiology should be employed to reduce mortality.","output":"The overlooked chamber in coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: At the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, some countries imposed entry bans against Chinese visitors. We sought to identify the effects of border shutdowns on the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We used the synthetic control method to measure the effects of entry bans against Chinese visitors on the cumulative number of confirmed cases using World Health Organization situation reports as the data source. The synthetic control method constructs a synthetic country that did not shut down its borders, but is similar in all other aspects. RESULTS: Six countries that shut down their borders were evaluated. For Australia, the effects of the policy began to appear 4 days after implementation, and the number of COVID-19 cases dropped by 94.4%. The border shutdown policy took around 13.2 days to show positive effects and lowered COVID-19 cases by 91.7% on average by the end of February. CONCLUSIONS: The border shutdowns in early February significantly reduced the spread of the virus.

Rarely, autoimmune events such as relapses in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have been reported after vaccination. However, the possible effects of vaccination in a patient already experiencing the symptoms of a relapse represent an unusual scenario that has not been described. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective case series of four patients from three major tertiary referral centers that received mRNA COVID-19 vaccination after starting with symptoms of acute demyelination of the central nervous system due to non-recognized MS. A detailed description of each case, including MRI studies, serum light-neurofilament levels, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine profile, is provided. CASE DESCRIPTION: All patients presented exacerbation of ongoing symptoms after vaccination (range 14C112 days first dose). All patients presented MRI features suggestive of highly active MS and fulfilled McDonald 2017 criteria at the time of presentation. All patients presented high serum light-neurofilament levels and oligoclonal G bands restricted to the CSF. Higher levels of interleukin-6 in the CSF were present in the more severe cases. DISCUSSION: We describe exacerbation of relapses after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. We hypothesize RNA sensors such as Toll-like receptor 7 may be activated and contribute to amplify the inflammatory response during a relapse. CONCLUSION: Patients should seek medical attention if experiencing acute neurological symptoms, especially before vaccination. Fast diagnostic procedures and prompt treatment should be performed in these patients.

In particular, the oil extracted from acorns is recognized for having high nutritional quality and for being rich in bioactive compounds. Despite the growing interest, few papers are available about the evolution of acorn oil characteristics during storage. In this framework, our aim was to investigate the storage-related changes in acorn oils extracted from three Quercus species grown in Algeria (Q. ilex, Q. suber and Q. coccifera) after 180 days from production, with a focus on polar and volatile compounds, not yet investigated. In addition, basic quality parameters, phenolic content, antioxidant activity and induction time were monitored. RESULTS The oxidation markers (peroxide value and UV absorptions) increased during storage, whereas antioxidants decreased. A distinctive volatile profile was observed at the time of production, which underwent changes during storage. Polar compounds increased, whereas induction time decreased. The oil extracted from Quercus suber L. was the most affected by storage time. CONCLUSION Floral and fruity volatile compounds detected in the oils headspace could explain the pleasant flavor of acorn oils reported by other authors. Similarly to other vegetable oils, storage depletes both volatiles and antioxidants and produces oxidation compounds, such as oxidized triacylglycerols. However, the studied acorn oils were quite stable under storage in the dark at room temperature for 6 months. This article is protected by copyright.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To study the comparative prevalence of anxiety and depression, and their contributing factors, between nurses working in intensive care units (ICU) with COVID\\\\19 patients (COVID ICU) and nurses working in ICU with patients admitted for other reasons (non\\\\COVID ICU). DESIGN: Quantitative comparative cross\\\\sectional study. METHODS: All frontline nurses working in COVID and non\\\\COVID ICUs at a tertiary care university hospital in Nepal were included. The data were collected using Google Forms. The groups were evaluated and compared in terms of various relevant variables with self\\\\designed socio\\\\demographic questionnaire, the validated Nepali version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ\\\\12). RESULTS: The response rate was 100%. Of the 99 nurses who met the inclusion criteria, three were excluded. Out of the 96 nurses included, psychiatric caseness was present in 82 (85.4%). There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of psychiatric caseness, anxiety, and depression between the COVID ICU and non\\\\COVID ICU nurses (caseness of 90.4% vs 79.5%, P = .134; anxiety of 36.5% vs 27.3%, P = .587; and depression of 21.2% vs 9.1%, P = .214, respectively). Among the factors that could potentially lead to psychiatric caseness, anxiety, and depression, statistically significant differences were observed only in relation to sleep disturbances, confidence in caring for patients with COVID\\\\19 and intentions to discontinue current job, all being significantly higher in COVID ICU nurses. CONCLUSION: Anxiety and depression are common in nurses working in both the COVID and non\\\\COVID ICUs, although the difference is not statistically significant.

In the periphery, dampened IFN-responsiveness is associated with viremia and hypercytokinemia, however the resolution of IFN-dependent innate immune responses in the lungs remains limited. Here, we aimed to elucidate the early dynamics of antiviral immunity and define the IFN-dependent mechanisms limiting viral spread during pulmonary infection with the murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a beta-coronavirus. While several innate immune cell types infiltrated the lungs concomitant with viral replication, the influx of type I IFN-responsive myeloid cells was essential for viral containment and prevention of fatal disease. Combining high-resolution transcriptomic analysis and genetic attenuation of interferon signaling, we delineated IFN-dependent cell-intrinsic and population-based transcriptional changes that determined viral replication and inflammatory maturation, respectively. While monocyte-derived macrophages exhibited the strongest pro-inflammatory transcriptional reprogramming during pulmonary infection, these maturation programs were impaired in the absence of IFN-signalling. Instead, IFN-deficient monocyte-derived macrophages expressed genes encoding for neutrophil attractants and IL1, resulting in enhanced lung injury.

At the early stage, it is not a harmful condition, except for slight discomfort for the patients. However, it will start to affect the eyesight of the patient once the tissues encroach towards the corneal region, with a more serious impact if it has grown into the pupil region. Therefore, this condition needs to be identified as early as possible to halt its growth, with the use of simple eye drops and sunglasses. One of the associated risk factors for this condition is a low educational level, which explains the reason that the majority of the patients are not aware of this condition. Hence, it is important to develop an automated pterygium screening system based on simple imaging modalities such as a mobile phone camera so that it can be assessed by many people. During the early stage of automated pterygium screening system development, conventional machine learning techniques such as support vector machines and artificial neural networks are the de facto algorithms to detect the presence of pterygium tissues. However, with the arrival of the deep learning era, coupled with the availability of large training data, deep learning networks have replaced the conventional networks in screening for the pterygium condition. The deep learning networks have been successfully implemented for three major purposes, which are to classify an image regarding whether there is the presence of pterygium tissues or not, to localize the lesion tissues through object detection methodology, and to semantically segment the lesion tissues at the pixel level. This review paper summarizes the type, severity, risk factors, and existing state-of-the-art technology in automated pterygium screening systems. A few available datasets are also discussed in this paper for both classification and segmentation tasks. In conclusion, a computer-assisted pterygium screening system will benefit many people all over the world, especially in alerting them to the possibility of having this condition so that preventive actions can be advised at an early stage.","output":"Computer-Assisted Pterygium Screening System: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wine has historically been associated with religious rights, used as a salubrious beverage, employed as a medication as well as a medicinal solvent, and consumed as a food accompaniment.

METHODS A systematic search of four electronic databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) was performed to retrieve randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published until March 9, 2020, that evaluated the effect of nutritional interventions to treat protein-energy malnutrition in older adults and those at risk for malnutrition. Two authors screened titles, abstracts and full texts independently. One author extracted data that were cross-checked by another author. RESULTS Sixty-three articles reporting 60 RCTs were identified. Most frequently used outcomes included body weight/body mass index (75.0% of RCTs), dietary intake (61.7%), functional limitations (48.3%), handgrip strength (46.7%), and body circumference (40.0%). The frequencies differed by setting (community, hospital and long-term care). For some outcomes there was a preferred assessment method (e.g., Barthel index for functional limitations), while for other outcomes (e.g., functional performance) a much greater variation was observed. CONCLUSION A large variation in outcomes, not only across but also within settings, was identified in nutritional intervention studies in malnourished older adults and those at risk.

The Infectious Diseases Isolation Unit (IDIU) admits first opinion, second opinion and referred patients with a confirmed infectious disease (ID) or a clinically suspected ID that is awaiting laboratory diagnosis. The primary aims of this study were to describe the annual number and characteristics of patients referred to the IDIU and identify the most frequent IDs in referred dogs and cats. A secondary aim was to investigate possible differences in the length of the hospitalisation and the clinical outcome among referred cases and those admitted to the IDIU after first and second opinion appointments. METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out on patients hospitalised at the unit over 5 years from 9th October 2013 to 31st December 2018. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 365 dogs and 515 cats to give a total of 880 patients hospitalised at the IDIU from October 2013 to December 2018. Among the 96 referred dogs, parvovirosis (37.7%) and leptospirosis (31.1%) were the most frequent IDs. Feline upper respiratory tract infection (38.2%) and feline leukaemia virus infections (36.4%) were the main causes in the 80 referred cats.

A growing body of evidence suggests that a unique subcategory of contemplative landscapes is particularly therapeutic. Previous studies predominantly focused on observational designs in non-clinical populations. It is not known if these effects can be extrapolated to populations suffering from depression, and experimental designs need to be utilized to establish causality. We examined the effects of in-situ passive exposure to three urban spaces on brain activity, namely a Therapeutic Garden with high Contemplative Landscape scores (TG), Residential Green (RG) and Busy Downtown (BD), and self-reported momentary mood in adults aged 21C74 (n = 92), including 24 clinically depressed and 68 healthy participants. Portable, multimodal electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) systems were used to record brain activity, and a Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire was used to record mood before and after exposure. We tested the interactions between the site, time and group for the mood, and between site and group for the neuroelectric oscillations and brain hemodynamics. Self-reported pre- post-mood was significant only at the TG (p = 0.032) in both groups. The lowest Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) was reported at TG and the highest in BD (p = 0.026). Results from fNIRS indicated marginally significant lower oxy-Hb in the frontal region at TG as compared to BD (p = 0.054) across both groups. The marginally significant effect of site and group was also observed (p = 0.062), with the Clinical group showing much lower oxy-Hb at TG than Healthy. The opposite pattern was observed at BD. EEG results showed differences between Healthy and Clinical groups in the Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA) pattern across the sites (p = 0.04), with more frontal alpha right in the Clinical sample and more left lateralization in the Healthy sample at TG. Temporal Beta Asymmetry (TBA) analyses suggested that patients displayed lower bottom-up attention than Healthy participants across all sites (p = 0.039).

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 160 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the National Center for Global Health and Medicine between January 26, 2020 and July 25, 2020. We searched PubMed for prognostic models for COVID-19. The predicted outcome was initiation of respiratory support or death. Performance of the candidate models was evaluated according to discrimination and calibration. We recalibrated the intercept of each model with our data. We also updated each model by adding 2-microglobulin (2MG) to the model and recalculating the intercept and the coefficient of 2MG. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 49.8 years, 68% were male, 88.7% were Japanese. The study outcomes occurred in 15 patients, including two deaths. Two-hundred sixty-nine papers were screened, and four candidate prognostic models were assessed. The model of Bartoletti et al. had the highest area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (0.88; 95% confidence interval 0.81C0.96). All four models overestimated the probability of occurrence of the outcome. None of the four models showed statistically significant improvement in AUCs by adding 2MG.

Their additional importance for brain physiology was discovered decades later. SP-G, a novel amphiphilic SP, was then identified in the lungs and is mostly linked to inflammation. In the brain, it is also present and significantly elevated after hemorrhage in premature infants and in distinct conditions affecting the cerebrospinal fluid circulation of adults. However, current knowledge on SP-G-expression is limited to ependymal cells and some neurons in the subventricular and superficial cortex. Therefore, we primarily focused on the distribution of SP-G-immunoreactivity (ir) and its spatial relationships with components of the neurovascular unit in murine forebrains. Triple fluorescence labeling elucidated SP-G-co-expressing neurons in the habenula, infundibulum, and hypothalamus. Exploring whether SP-G might play a role in Alzheimers disease (AD), 3xTg-AD mice were investigated and displayed age-dependent hippocampal deposits of -amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau separately from clustered, SP-G-containing dots with additional Reelin-irwhich was used as established marker for disease progression in this specific context. Semi-quantification of those dots, together with immunoassay-based quantification of intra- and extracellular SP-G, revealed a significant elevation in old 3xTg mice when compared to age-matched wildtype animals. This suggests a role of SP-G for the pathophysiology of AD, but a confirmation with human samples is required.","output":"Surfactant Protein-G in Wildtype and 3xTg-AD Mice: Localization in the Forebrain, Age-Dependent Hippocampal Dot-like Deposits and Brain Content"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 leading to COVID-19 occurs through exhaled respiratory droplets from infected humans. Currently, however, there is much controversy over whether respiratory aerosol microdroplets play an important role as a route of transmission. By measuring and modeling the dynamics of exhaled respiratory droplets, we can assess the relative contribution of aerosols to the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. We measure size distribution, total numbers, and volumes of respiratory droplets, including aerosols, by speaking and coughing from healthy subjects. Dynamic modeling of exhaled respiratory droplets allows us to account for aerosol persistence times in confined public spaces. The probability of infection by inhalation of aerosols when breathing in the same space can then be estimated using current estimates of viral load and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. The current known reproduction numbers show a lower infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to, for instance, measles, which is known to be efficiently transmitted through the air. In line with this, our study of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that aerosol transmission is a possible but perhaps not a very efficient route, in particular from non-symptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals that exhibit low viral loads.","output":"Aerosol persistence in relation to possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article examines the factors restricting an effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Cameroon. It argues that structural adjustment policies in the 1980s and 1990s as well as corruption and limited investment in recent times have severely weakened the country's health system. This article also emphasises the interconnection between poverty, slums, and COVID-19. This interconnection brings to the fore inequality in Cameroon. Arguably, this inequality could facilitate the spread of COVID-19 in the country. This article draws attention to the political forces shaping the response to the pandemic and contends that in some regions in the country, the lack of an effective response to the pandemic may not necessarily be due to a lack of resources. In so doing, it critiques the COVID-19 orthodoxy that focuses exclusively on the pathology of the disease and advocates \\"technical\\" solutions to the pandemic, while ignoring the political and socio-economic forces that shape the fight against the pandemic. At times, medical supplies and other forms of assistance may be available, but structural violence impairs access to these resources.

This study aimed to determine upgrade rates of DCIS at needle biopsy to invasive carcinoma at surgery among women who meet the eligibility criteria for AS trials. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of consecutive women at an academic medical center with a diagnosis of DCIS at needle biopsy from 2007 to 2016. Medical records were reviewed for mode of presentation, imaging findings, biopsy pathology results, and surgical outcomes. Each patient with DCIS was evaluated for AS trial eligibility based on published criteria for the COMET, LORD, and LORIS trials. RESULTS: During a 10-year period, DCIS was diagnosed in 858 women (mean age 58 years; range 28-89 years). Of the 858 women, 498 (58%) were eligible for the COMET trial, 101 (11.8%) for the LORD trial, and 343 (40%) for the LORIS trial. The rates of upgrade to invasive carcinoma were 12% (60/498) for the COMET trial, 5% (5/101) for the LORD trial, and 11.1% (38/343) for the LORIS trial. The invasive carcinomas ranged from 0.2 to 20 mm, and all were node-negative. CONCLUSIONS: Women who meet the eligibility criteria for DCIS AS trials remain at risk for occult invasive carcinoma at presentation, with upgrade rates ranging from 5 to 12%. These findings suggest that more precise criteria are needed to ensure that women with invasive carcinoma are excluded from AS trials.","output":"Do Eligibility Criteria for Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) Active Surveillance Trials Identify Patients at Low Risk for Upgrade to Invasive Carcinoma?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Methane (CH4) is one of the most important greenhouse gases causing the global warming effect. The mapping data of atmospheric CH4 concentrations in space and time can help us better to understand the characteristics and driving factors of CH4 variation as to support the actions of CH4 emission reduction for preventing the continuous increase of atmospheric CH4 concentrations. In this study, we applied a spatiotemporal geostatistical analysis and prediction to develop an approach to generate the mapping CH4 dataset (Mapping-XCH4) in 1grid and three days globally using column averaged dry air mole fraction of CH4 (XCH4) data derived from observations of the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) from April 2009 to April 2020. Cross-validation for the spatiotemporal geostatistical predictions showed better correlation coefficient of 0.97 and a mean absolute prediction error of 7.66 ppb. The standard deviation is 11.42 ppb when comparing the Mapping-XCH4 data with the ground measurements from the total carbon column observing network (TCCON). Moreover, we assessed the performance of this Mapping-XCH4 dataset by comparing with the XCH4 simulations from the CarbonTracker model and primarily investigating the variations of XCH4 from April 2009 to April 2020. The results showed that the mean annual increase in XCH4 was 7.5 ppb/yr derived from Mapping-XCH4, which was slightly greater than 7.3 ppb/yr from the ground observational network during the past 10 years from 2010. XCH4 is larger in South Asia and eastern China than in the other regions, which agrees with the XCH4 simulations. The Mapping-XCH4 shows a significant linear relationship and a correlation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.66, with EDGAR emission inventories over Monsoon Asia. Moreover, we found that Mapping-XCH4 could detect the reduction of XCH4 in the period of lockdown from January to April 2020 in China, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, we can apply GOSAT observations over a long period from 2009 to 2020 to generate a spatiotemporally continuous dataset globally using geostatistical analysis. This long-term Mpping-XCH4 dataset has great potential for understanding the spatiotemporal variations of CH4 concentrations induced by natural processes and anthropogenic emissions at a global and regional scale.","output":"Spatiotemporal Geostatistical Analysis and Global Mapping of CH4 Columns from GOSAT Observations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak caused by COVID-19 is causing a major challenge to clinical management and a worldwide threat to public health.

Performance of emergency surgery require complex and varied skills and abilities to achieve procedures from different fields of surgery: abdominal, urologic, thoracic, vascular, soft tissue, skeletal) within an interval of 24 hours (1). In U.S., since 2008, Acute Care Surgery concept was introduced, and nowadays is an evolving specialty with three essential components- trauma, critical care and emergency surgery (2). In UK there is an increasing subspecialisation within general surgery over the last ten years. More recently, there has been an increase in focus on emergency general surgery (3,4). This may not come as a surprise given the fact that trafic crashes kill 1.2 million people annually around the world (3242 people/day) and 90% are in middle and low income countries. In US trauma is the leading cause of death in persons up to 40 years. Optimal care for emergency surgical patients is one of the major challenges for every healthcare system worldwide.

However, estimating vaccine effectiveness using observational data is inherently challenging because of the non-randomised design and the potential for unmeasured confounding. Methods: We used a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) to estimate vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 mortality in England, exploiting the discontinuity in vaccination rates resulting from the UK's age-based vaccination priority groups. We used the fact that people aged 80 or over were prioritised for the vaccine roll-out in the UK to compare the risk of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 death in people aged 75-79 and 80-84. Findings: The prioritisation of vaccination of people aged 80 or above led to a large discrepancy in vaccination rates in people 80-84 compared to those 75-79 at the beginning of the vaccination campaign. We found a corresponding difference in COVID-19 mortality, but not in non-COVID-19 mortality, suggesting that our approach appropriately addresses the issue of unmeasured confounding factors. Our results suggest that the first vaccine dose reduced the risk of COVID-19 death by 70.5% (95% CI 18.2-117.7) in those aged 80. Interpretations: Our results support existing evidence that a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine has a strong protective effect against COVID-19 mortality in older adults.

The main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV is an attractive target for anti-SARS drug development as it is essential for the polyprotein processing. M(pro) is initially produced as part of viral polyproteins and it is matured by autocleavage. Here, we report that, with the addition of an N-terminal extension peptide, M(pro) can form a domain-swapped dimer. After complete removal of the extension peptide from the dimer, the mature M(pro) self-assembles into a novel super-active octamer (AO-M(pro)). The crystal structure of AO-M(pro) adopts a novel fold with four domain-swapped dimers packing into four active units with nearly identical conformation to that of the previously reported M(pro) active dimer, and 3D domain swapping serves as a mechanism to lock the active conformation due to entanglement of polypeptide chains. Compared with the previously well characterized form of M(pro), in equilibrium between inactive monomer and active dimer, the stable AO-M(pro) exhibits much higher proteolytic activity at low concentration. As all eight active sites are bound with inhibitors, the polyvalent nature of the interaction between AO-M(pro) and its polyprotein substrates with multiple cleavage sites, would make AO-M(pro) functionally much more superior than the M(pro) active dimer for polyprotein processing. Thus, during the initial period of SARS-CoV infection, this novel active form AOM(pro) should play a major role in cleaving polyproteins as the protein level is extremely low. The discovery of AOM(pro) provides new insights about the functional mechanism of M(pro) and its maturation process.

ABSTRACT: The Covid-19 pandemic has been found to negatively impact the psychological well-being of significant numbers of people globally. Many individuals have been challenged by social distancing mandates and the resultant social isolation. Humans, in our modern world, have rarely been as isolated and socially restricted. Social connectedness and support are critical protective factors for human survival and well-being. Social isolation can lead to loneliness, boredom, and can become a risk factor for physical and mental health issues such as anxiety and depression.

Lam. are traditionally used against diabetes in many countries, including Mauritius. This study endeavoured to evaluate the inhibitory potential of leaves, roots, twigs and fruits extracts (decoction and maceration) of B. gymnorhiza against key enzymes relevant to diabetes. Considering complications related to diabetes, other clinical enzymes, namely, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), tyrosinase, elastase and pancreatic lipase, were used. Identification of compounds was carried out using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Antioxidant capacities were assessed using DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, CUPRAC, phosphomolybdenum, metal chelating. The relationship between mode of extraction, plant parts and biological activities was determined using multivariate analysis. Macerated fruits, rich in phytochemicals (phenolic, flavanol, tannin, and triterpenoid), exhibited substantially high antioxidant capacities related to radical scavenging (DPPH: 547.75  10.99 and ABTS: 439.59  19.13 mg TE/g, respectively) and reducing potential (CUPRAC: 956.04  11.90 and FRAP: 577.26  4.55 mg TE/g, respectively). Additionally, the same extract significantly depressed AChE and BChE (3.75  0.03 and 2.19  0.13 mg GALAE/g, respectively), tyrosinase (147.01  0.78 mg KAE/g), elastase (3.14  0.08 mg OE/g) and amylase (1.22  0.01 mmol ACAE/g) enzymatic activities. Phytochemical results confirmed the presence of 119 compounds in all maceration and 163 compounds in all decoction samples. The screening also revealed important compounds in the extracts, namely, quinic acid, brugierol, bruguierol A, epigallocatechin, chlorogenic acid, to name a few. Multivariate analysis reported that the plant parts of B. gymnorhiza greatly influenced the observed biological activities in contrast to the types of extraction methods employed. Docking calculations have supported the findings of the experimental part through the high binding affinity and strong interactions of some compounds against tyrosinase, AChE, BChE and elastase enzymes. The decocted root and leaf of B. gymnorhiza showed low to moderate antidiabetic activity, thereby partially supporting its traditional uses in the management of diabetes.

The results showed that porcine ch25h was induced by either interferon or PRV infection. PRV infection of porcine alveolar macrophages (3D4/21 cells) was attenuated by CH25H overexpression and enhanced by silencing of CH25H. Furthermore, treatment of 3D4/21 cells with 25HC inhibited the growth of PRV in vitro, suggesting that CH25H may restrict PRV replication by 25HC production. We further identified that the anti-PRV role of CH25H and 25HC was subject to their inhibitory effect on PRV attachment and entry.

The bacterial community from these samples was explored using next generation sequencing and compared to samples from 75 non-wheezing controls. No significant difference in bacterial diversity was observed between samples from those with wheeze and healthy controls. Within the wheezing group, attendance at kindergarten or preschool was however, associated with increased bacterial diversity. Rhinovirus (RV) infection did not have a significant effect on bacterial community composition. A significant difference in bacterial richness was observed between children with RV-A and RV-C infection, however this is likely due to the differences in age group between the patient cohorts. The bacterial community within the oropharynx was found to be diverse and heterogeneous. Age and attendance at day care or kindergarten were important factors in driving bacterial diversity. However, wheeze and viral infection were not found to significantly relate to the bacterial community.

Existing literature studying fake news elaborates primarily on fake news classification models. Approaches exploring fake news characteristics to distinguish it from real news are minimal. Not much research has focused on statistical testing and generating new factor discoveries. This study assumes fifteen hypotheses to identify factors exhibiting a relationship with fake news. We perform the experiments on two real-world COVID-19 datasets using qualitative and quantitative testing methods. We determine the impact of conditional effects among sentiment, gender, and media usage. This study concludes that sentiment polarity and gender can significantly identify fake news. Dependence on the presence of visual media is, however, inconclusive. Additionally, Twitter-specific user engagement factors like followers count, friends count, favorite count, and retweet count significantly differ in fake and real news.

Hospital visits to receive treatment and interaction with health care workers (HCW) represent potential contagious events. We aimed to determine SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among patients with cancer and HCW of a chemoradiotherapy unit localized in a center designated as a COVID-19 priority facility in Mexico City. We also determined the diagnostic performance of a clinical questionnaire (CQ) as a screening tool and antiCSARS-CoV-2 antibody seroconversion rate. METHODS: HCW and patients with solid tumors attending the chemoradiotherapy unit signed informed consent. To determine SARS-CoV-2 infection rate prospectively, a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed every 2 weeks in asymptomatics. An electronic CQ interrogating COVID-19Crelated symptoms was sent daily. AntiCSARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were measured at baseline and at the end of the study period. RESULTS: From June to September 2020, we included 130 asymptomatic participants, 44.6% HCW and 55.4% patients with cancer. During a median follow-up of 85 days, 634 nasopharyngeal swabs were performed. Average SARS-CoV-2 monthly incidence was 4.6% (3.15%-7.47%), and cumulative infection rate was 13.8% (18 of 130). Cases were mostly asymptomatic (66%), and no hospitalizations or deaths were recorded. The CQ as a screening tool provided a sensitivity of 27.7%, a positive predictive value of 26.3%, and a positive likelihood ratio of 12. SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion rate was 27.7% among those with a positive RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: Patients with cancer on treatment can have uncomplicated COVID-19 outcomes. Biweekly RT-qPCR testing detects asymptomatic infections, prevents transmission, and should be implemented in units to increase patient safety. CQ increase RT-qPCR diagnostic yield and may prioritize testing in resource-deprived settings.

METHODS This was a retrospective review of pediatric patients that were originally scheduled for TT for recurrent AOM and/or OME, but had their procedure cancelled due to COVID-19. The chi-square test was used to compare the proportion of patients who no longer met indications for surgery stratified by original indication. Data was also collected for TT volume in the months before and after the start of the pandemic. RESULTS Of 59 patients originally scheduled for TT, 31.0% of the 42 patients who returned for follow-up still met indications for a procedure after a period of home-quarantine.

When COVI-19 infect the upper and lower respiratory tract it can cause mild or highly acute respiratory syndrome with consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1? and IL-6. The binding of COVI-19 to the Toll Like Receptor (TLR) causes the release of pro-IL-1? which is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by inflammasome activation and production of active mature IL-1? which is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever and fibrosis.

Cytokine IL-37 has the ability to suppress innate and acquired immune response and also has the capacity to inhibit inflammation by acting on IL-18R&#945; receptor.

Best practices for ensuring high-quality data were employed. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals who are 18 years of age or older, living in the USA, and English-speaking were eligible for the study. Of 1086 unique responses, 1015 completed responses are included. SETTING: Population-based. MAIN OUTCOMES: Exposure to and stressfulness of COVID-19 stressors, coping strategies, and adherence to CDC guidelines. RESULTS: The sample was 53.9% women (n = 547), with an average age of 38.9 years (SD = 13.50, range = 18-88), most of whom were White (n = 836, 82.4%), non-Hispanic (n = 929, 91.5%), and straight/heterosexual (n = 895, 88.2%); 40% were currently married (n = 407), and 21.6% (n = 219) were caregivers. About half (50.5%) endorsed having at least \\"mostly\\" enough money to meet their needs. Respondents' locations across the USA ranged from 18.5% in the Northeast to 37.8% in the South. The most commonly experienced stressors were reading/hearing about the severity and contagiousness of COVID-19, uncertainty about length of quarantine and social distancing requirements, and changes to social and daily personal care routines. Financial concerns were rated most stressful. Younger age, female gender, and caregiver status increased risk for stressor exposure and greater degree of stressfulness. The most frequently reported strategies to manage stress were distraction, active coping, and seeking emotional social support. CDC guideline adherence was generally high, but several key social distancing and hygiene behaviors showed suboptimal adherence, particularly for men and younger adults. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Americans have high COVID-19 stress exposure and some demographic subgroups appear particularly vulnerable to stress effects.

Data were entered into Epi data manager version 4.0.2 and exported to SPSS version 24 for analysis. Multiple linear regression analysis was done to identify factors associated with risk perception. A p-value of less than 0.05 was used as a level of significance. RESULTS: A total of 416 waiters were interviewed, with a 98.6% response rate. The mean age of respondents was 27.26 (SD=8.35) years. More than half (53.4%) agreed that COVID-19 causes more deaths than other respiratory diseases. Regarding overall risk perception, two hundred twenty-two (53.4%) participants had high-risk perceptions concerning COVID-19. Risk perception was associated with age (= 0.10; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.18), knowledge of COVID-19 (=0.50, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.76) and preventive behaviors (=0.62; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.90). CONCLUSION: A higher level of risk perception was found regarding the COVID-19. Proper risk communication to promote protective behaviors is very essential since waiters are more at risk to be infected with COVID-19 and their infection with the virus has important public health implications.","output":"Risk Perception Towards COVID-19 and Its Associated Factors Among Waiters in Selected Towns of Southwest Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Heplisav-B, a hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine with an immunostimulatory adjuvant, was FDA-approved in 2017 for adults >18 years.

METHODS This retrospective cohort study evaluated PWH aged >18 years without current HBV seroprotection (anti-HBV surface antibody level <10 mIU/mL) who were administered Heplisav-B. Patients without post-immunization titers were excluded. The primary outcome was the SPR, the proportion of participants with HBV seroprotection at any point following the first vaccination. RESULTS Among 64 PWH included, median time to anti-HBs measurement after vaccination was 13 weeks. Median age was 58 years, 81% were men, and 95% had a viral load <200. The SPR was 81% in the entire cohort (and 86% in those without significant non-HIV immunosuppression), 79% in those with no prior HBV vaccination and no anti-HBc positivity, and 84% in those with prior vaccine non-response. Lower current and nadir CD4+ counts were associated with progressively lower seroprotection. CONCLUSION In the first single-center retrospective study of Heplisav-B in PWH, the SPR compared favorably to the SPR seen among PWH from prior HBV vaccines across key subgroups. Given these findings, Heplisav-B should be considered for expanded use for HBV vaccination in PWH.

We aimed to determine whether a national index can account for deprivation regardless of location characteristics. In Metropolitan France, 43,853 residential census block groups (IRIS) were divided into eight area types based on quality of life. We calculated score deprivation for each IRIS using the French version of the European Deprivation Index (F-EDI). We decomposed the score by calculating the contribution of each of its components by area type, and we assessed the impact of removing each component and recalculating the weights on the identification of deprived IRIS. The set of components most contributing to the score changed according to the area type, but the identification of deprived IRIS remained stable regardless of the component removed for recalculating the score. Not all components of the F-EDI are markers of deprivation according to location characteristics, but the multidimensional nature of the index ensures its robustness. Further research is needed to examine the limitations of using these indices depending on the purpose of the study, particularly in relation to the geographical grid used to calculate deprivation scores.","output":"Can an Ecological Index of Deprivation Be Used at the Country Level?

Our objective was to evaluate host endothelial, epithelial and inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 171 ICU patients, including 78 (46%) patients positive and 93 (54%) negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection from April to September, 2020. We compared 22 plasma biomarkers in blood collected within 24 h and 3 days after ICU admission. RESULTS: In critically ill COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, the most common ICU admission diagnoses were respiratory failure or pneumonia, followed by sepsis and other diagnoses. Similar proportions of patients in both groups received invasive mechanical ventilation at the time of study enrollment. COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients had similar rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe acute kidney injury, and in-hospital mortality. While concentrations of interleukin 6 and 8 were not different between groups, markers of epithelial cell injury (soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products, sRAGE) and acute phase proteins (serum amyloid A, SAA) were significantly higher in COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19, adjusting for demographics and APACHE III scores. In contrast, angiopoietin 2:1 (Ang-2:1 ratio) and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR-1), markers of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, were significantly lower in COVID-19 (p < 0.002). Ang-2:1 ratio and SAA were associated with mortality only in non-COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that, unlike other well-studied causes of critical illness, endothelial dysfunction may not be characteristic of severe COVID-19 early after ICU admission.

They have been particularly affected by the opioid crisis. However, no study to date has used a randomized controlled design to test preventive interventions of opioid and other drug use among this vulnerable population. Resolution of youth homelessness through housing and supportive services including prevention services, often referred to as Housing First, has great potential to reduce the likelihood for the development of an opioid use disorder as well as other problem behaviors associated with living on the streets. Housing First has been tested through randomized trials among homeless adults with mental health and substance use disorders, but has not been empirically tested for opioid prevention among homeless youth. METHODS: Homeless youth will be recruited from a drop-in shelter site frequented by disconnected youth; they will be screened for eligibility, including current homelessness, age 18C24 years, and not currently meeting criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD). In a controlled trial, 240 youth will then be randomized to one of two conditions, (1) housing + opioid and related risk prevention services, or (2) opioid and related risk prevention services alone. This project utilizes existing efficacious models of prevention to address opioid-related risks, including motivational interviewing, strengths-based outreach and advocacy, and an HIV risk preventive intervention. Follow-up will be conducted at 3, 6, 9 and 12-months post-baseline. The economic cost of each intervention will be determined to support implementation decisions with other providers and their funders. DISCUSSION: This study will provide essential information for researchers and providers on the efficacy of housing + opioid and related risk prevention services in an RCT for effects on opioid use and mechanisms underlying change. Because youth experiencing homelessness are at increased risk for a variety of adverse outcomes, the proposed intervention may produce substantial health care benefits to the youths and society at large.

As of Feb 28, 2018, 2182 cases of MERS-CoV infection (with 779 deaths) in 27 countries were reported to WHO worldwide, with most being reported in Saudi Arabia (1807 cases with 705 deaths). MERS-CoV features prominently in the WHO blueprint list of priority pathogens that threaten global health security. Although primary transmission of MERS-CoV to human beings is linked to exposure to dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius), the exact mode by which MERS-CoV infection is acquired remains undefined. Up to 50% of MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia have been classified as secondary, occurring from human-to-human transmission through contact with asymptomatic or symptomatic individuals infected with MERS-CoV. Hospital outbreaks of MERS-CoV are a hallmark of MERS-CoV infection. The clinical features associated with MERS-CoV infection are not MERS-specific and are similar to other respiratory tract infections. Thus, the diagnosis of MERS can easily be missed, unless the doctor or health-care worker has a high degree of clinical awareness and the patient undergoes specific testing for MERS-CoV. The largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in South Korea in May, 2015, resulting in 186 cases with 38 deaths. This outbreak was caused by a traveller with undiagnosed MERS-CoV infection who became ill after returning to Seoul from a trip to the Middle East. The traveller visited several health facilities in South Korea, transmitting the virus to many other individuals long before a diagnosis was made. With 10 million pilgrims visiting Saudi Arabia each year from 182 countries, watchful surveillance by public health systems, and a high degree of clinical awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV infection is essential.

The maintenance of epithelial integrity is based on the self-renewal and differentiation of alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, which require sufficient energy. However, the role of glutamine metabolism in the maintenance of the alveolar epithelium remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of glutamine metabolism in AT2 cells of patients with IPF and in mice with bleomycin-induced fibrosis. (2) Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), transcriptome, and metabolomics analyses were conducted to investigate the changes in the glutamine metabolic pathway during pulmonary fibrosis. Metabolic inhibitors were used to stimulate AT2 cells to block glutamine metabolism. Regeneration of AT2 cells was detected using bleomycin-induced mouse lung fibrosis and organoid models. (3) Results: Single-cell analysis showed that the expression levels of catalytic enzymes responsible for glutamine catabolism were downregulated (p < 0.001) in AT2 cells of patients with IPF, suggesting the accumulation of unusable glutamine. Combined analysis of the transcriptome (p < 0.05) and metabolome (p < 0.001) revealed similar changes in glutamine metabolism in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice.

Specimens were obtained within 1-2 hours after individuals had succumbed to critical illness associated with respiratory infections, with 4 of 8 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19. Control kidney tissues were obtained post-mortem or after nephrectomy from individuals without AKI. Results High-depth single cell-resolved gene expression data of human kidneys affected by AKI revealed enrichment of novel injury-associated cell states within the major cell types of the tubular epithelium, in particular in proximal tubules, thick ascending limbs and distal convoluted tubules. Four distinct, hierarchically interconnected injured cell states were distinguishable and characterized by transcriptome patterns associated with oxidative stress, hypoxia, interferon response, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, respectively. Transcriptome differences between individuals with AKI were driven primarily by the cell type-specific abundance of these four injury subtypes rather than by private molecular responses.

METHODS Oncology care providers (n=2,008) participated in a survey in which they identified barriers and promoters for delivering psychosocial care at their respective institutions. Multilevel modeling was used to examine (1) the extent to which provider and institutional characteristics were associated with the most common barriers, and (2) associations between perceived barriers and institutional capacity to deliver psychosocial services as measured by the Cancer Psychosocial Care Matrix. RESULTS Across 58 Commission on Cancer-accredited programs in North America, the most frequently reported barriers were inadequate number of psychosocial care personnel, lack of funding, inadequate amount of time, lack of systematic procedures, and inadequate training for oncology providers. Overall, there were few significant differences in reported barriers by type of institution or type of provider. In general, the most frequently reported barriers were significantly associated with the institution's capacity to deliver quality psychosocial care. In particular, the lack of a systematic process for psychosocial care delivery significantly predicted lower levels of institutional capacity to deliver quality psychosocial care. CONCLUSIONS When identifying barriers, respondents reported a greater number of institutional barriers than barriers related to individual provider or patient characteristics. These results present a compelling case for cancer programs to implement and monitor systematic procedures for psychosocial care and to integrate these procedures in routine clinical practice.

Targeted temperature management (TTM) is the only strategy shown to reduce the risk of neurologic disability cardiac arrest patients. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of TTM with an emphasis on recent trials. RECENT FINDINGS: After early studies demonstrating the benefit of TTM in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to a shockable rhythm, newer studies have extended the benefit of TTM to patients with a nonshockable rhythm and in-hospital cardiac arrest. A target temperature of 33 C was not superior to 36 C, suggesting that a lenient targeted temperature may be appropriate especially for patients unable to tolerate lower temperatures. Although early initiation of TTM appears to be beneficial, the benefit of prehospital cooling has not been shown and use of intravenous cold saline in the prehospital setting may be harmful. SUMMARY: There is substantial risk of neurological injury in cardiac arrest survivors who remain comatose.

(J Eur Econ Assoc, 2021) suggests that industrial robot adoption in Germany has led to a sectoral reallocation of employment from manufacturing to services, leaving total employment unaffected. We rationalize this evidence through the lens of a general equilibrium model with two sectors, matching frictions and endogenous participation. Automation induces firms to create fewer vacancies and job seekers to search less in the automatable sector (manufacturing). The service sector expands due to the sectoral complementarity in the production of the final good and a positive wealth effect for the household. Analysis across steady states shows that the reduction in manufacturing employment can be offset by the increase in service employment. The model can also replicate the magnitude of the decline in the ratio of manufacturing employment to service employment in Germany between 1994 and 2014.

We found the propagation of droplets and aerosols highly affected by this condition. The spread of respiratory droplets by the action of sneezing is characterized by the dynamics of two groups of droplets of different sizes: Larger droplets (300-900 m) have a ballistic trajectory and can be spread up to 5 m, while a cloud of smaller droplets (100-200 m) can be transported and dispersed at longer distances up to 18 m by the action of the turbulent airflow. In relation to the spread of exhaled aerosols during respiration, these remain in the air for long periods of time. In the presence of intense or moderate airflow, this set of particles follow airflow streamlines, and thus their propagation is directly determined by the air velocity field. Given the scientific evidence, these results should be considered in public debate about the aerodynamic dispersion characteristics of scenarios where social interactions occur and about the measures to mitigate the spread of the virus. ? 2021 by the authors.

Testing, contact tracing, and isolating/quarantining is a key strategy that has been used to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 and other pathogens. However, manual contact tracing is a time-consuming process and as case numbers increase a smaller fraction of cases' contacts can be traced, leading to additional virus spread. Delays between symptom onset and being tested (and receiving results), and a low fraction of symptomatic cases being tested and traced can also reduce the impact of contact tracing on transmission. We examined the relationship between increasing cases and delays and the pathogen reproductive number Rt, and the implications for infection dynamics using deterministic and stochastic compartmental models of SARS-CoV-2. We found that Rt increased sigmoidally with the number of cases due to decreasing contact tracing efficacy. This relationship results in accelerating epidemics because Rt initially increases, rather than declines, as infections increase. Shifting contact tracers from locations with high and low case burdens relative to capacity to locations with intermediate case burdens maximizes their impact in reducing Rt (but minimizing total infections may be more complicated). Contact tracing efficacy decreased sharply with increasing delays between symptom onset and tracing and with lower fraction of symptomatic infections being tested. Finally, testing and tracing reductions in Rt can sometimes greatly delay epidemics due to the highly heterogeneous transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. These results demonstrate the importance of having an expandable or mobile team of contact tracers that can be used to control surges in cases. They also highlight the synergistic value of high capacity, easy access testing and rapid turn-around of testing results, and outreach efforts to encourage symptomatic cases to be tested immediately after symptom onset.","output":"Contact tracing efficiency, transmission heterogeneity, and accelerating COVID-19 epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus which has appeared from China, has been circulating hastily around the world.

This study aimed to examine sexual and risk behaviors of young Canadian adults both at-home and during international travel. METHODS: Sexually-active Canadians, aged 18-25 years (N = 646) who travelled abroad in 2016, completed an online, cross-sectional survey analyzed by descriptive statistics. Outcome measures included young Canadian adults lifestyle risk and sexual behaviors at-home and abroad. RESULTS: Sexual behaviors, both penetrative and non-penetrative activities, decreased significantly (p < 0.001; McNemar test) abroad compared to at-home. International travel elicited a statistically significant increase in alcohol consumption compared to at-home (Wilcoxon, z = ? 11.341, p < 0.001). Partner type (new trip-acquired partner) abroad was associated with a greater number of travel-acquired sexual partners (Mann-Whitney, U = 4901, p < 0.001), inconsistent condom use during penetrative sex (U = 7215, p = 0.009), and sex under the influence of alcohol (Test of Two Proportions, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although many young Canadian respondents practiced abstinence in their 2016 travel, for sexually-active travelers, new partner-type was related to high risk sexual behaviors.

Our patient presented during the COVID19 pandemic, which further blurred our diagnostic sense. Clinical Case: A 26-year-old female presented with sudden intractable non-bloody non-bilious vomiting occurring every 30 minutes along with sharp epigastric pain radiating to her back, dizziness, and extreme fatigue for the last 2 days. She had similar but milder episodes in the past 2C3 years as well and endorsed unintentional weight loss for the same duration. She had been extensively investigated previously but was misdiagnosed as gastroparesis or anxiety and was prescribed medications for the same (pantoprazole, sucralfate, and Lexapro). On presentation this time, she was hypotensive and tachycardic but partially responsive to IV fluids. Her BMI was 15.31 and the abdominal exam was benign. Her basic labs showed Na 125, K 4.9, Calcium 10.5, Cr 1, WBCs 9K, lipase 8, normal LFTs, TSH 6.96, Free T4 1.18. Infectious workup was done and the patient was started on empirical antibiotics. Negative infectious workup, hypotension partially responsive to IV fluid, along with hyponatremia and borderline high potassium level prompted us to check Cortisol. We found Cortisol of 1.3(very low for the degree of her illness). ACTH stimulation test with 250mcg IV cosyntropin showed cortisol of 1.3 at 30 minutes and 1.1 at 60 minutes confirming the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Further workup revealed a positive 21 hydroxylase antibody and ACTH level of 322 (high due to lack of negative feedback to the pituitary). She was comprehensively tested for other autoimmune diseases which showed positive Endomysial IgA and Tissue Transglutaminase antibodies indicating asymptomatic celiac disease. She improved drastically after starting hydrocortisone. TSH was repeated in 3 months which was normal. Conclusion: The onset of chronic adrenal insufficiency is very gradual with vague presentation and it may go undetected unless illness or other stress precipitates acute crisis as in our patient. Since autoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addisons disease), patients with a confirmed diagnosis should also undergo workup for other autoimmune diseases.","output":"Adrenal Insufficiency: Hidden Mimicker With Other Autoimmune Disease Potentials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To compare the standardized severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroprevalence of high epicenter region with non-epicenter region, serological studies were performed with a total of 3,268 sera from Daegu City and 3,981 sera from Chungbuk Province.

Jansa's government systematically ignores professional competencies in cultural institutions as well as in science, especially in relation to the epidemic.The voice of experts in the field of culture is ignored, and this is precisely because their specialized knowledge is not neutral. In a time when the space for free speech is shrinking, the need for a clear positioning becomes even more pressing. The author discusses the exhibition Bigger than Myself / Heroic Voices from Ex-Yugoslavia, which she curated for Rome's MAXXI museum last summer. The work shown there addressed Yugoslav emancipatory histories in relation to the issues of particular urgency today: global capitalism, the posthuman condition, and the return of authoritarianism, in particular. The Slovenian authorities took a hostile attitude towards the exhibition, not only because it presented critical voices from the region but also because artists from the former Yugoslavia were presented there, who, according to Slovenian right-wingers, are no longer worthy of participating in national cultural projects. Concerning the example of what is happening in Slovenia today, the essay asks why there has been such a strong turn to the right in Central and Eastern Europe, which is reviving \\"traditional\\" morality, patriarchy, and nationalism and engaging in political interference in cultural institutions. The current governments of Slovenia and other countries in the region want to get rid of the critical voices of left-wing experts in culture by favoring ostensibly neutral experts.

Sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) using Hefei Cohort was performed and prediction models were deduced. Prediction results were evaluated by receiver operator characteristic curve and decision curve analysis (DCA) in above two cohorts. RESULTS: SPCA using Hefei Cohort revealed that the first 13 principal components (PCs) account for 80.8% of the total variance of original data. The PC1 and PC12 were significantly associated with disease severity with odds ratio of 4.049 and 3.318, respectively. They were used to construct prediction model, named Model-A.

Methods An electronic survey was developed to record the general characteristics of the laboratory, as well as the pre-analytical, analytical, post-analytical and operational practices of biochemistry laboratories that are managing clinical samples of patients with COVID-19. Results A total of 1210 submissions were included in the analysis. The majority of responses came from hospital central/core laboratories that serve hospital patient groups and handle moderate daily sample volumes. There has been a decrease in the use of pneumatic tube transport, increase in hand delivery and increase in number of layers of plastic bags for samples of patients with clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Surgical face masks and gloves are the most commonly used personal protective equipment (PPE). Just >50% of the laboratories did not perform an additional decontamination step on the instrument after analysis of samples from patients with clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19. A fifth of laboratories disallowed add-on testing on these samples. Less than a quarter of laboratories autoclaved their samples prior to disposal. Conclusions The survey responses showed wide variation in pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical practices in terms of PPE adoption and biosafety processes.

Although there have been many studies on HER 2 breast cancer treatment and management in recent years, there is a lack of comprehensive reports on the treatment outcomes and disparities within the available literature. Hence, this review aimed to determine the treatment outcomes and their associated factors among patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. METHODS A computer-based systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, and Google scholar databases of articles published from 2000 to 2020. The following key terms (HER 2 positive breast cancer, predictor, determinant, associated factor) and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms (breast neoplasms, treatment outcome, and risk factors) were used to search the English language published articles. RESULTS In most studies, trastuzumab was the most commonly used treatment regimen used in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. Generally, most of the studies (15 studies) showed that the overall survival outcome was relatively higher after treatment among HER2 positive breast cancer patients. Nonetheless, two studies showed that the absence of significant change in the overall survival despite adequate treatment was given to the study participants. In addition, three studies demonstrated a partial response after treating HER2-positive breast cancer patients. CONCLUSION Generally, the overall survival outcome was relatively higher after treatment among HER2 positive breast cancer patients. The addition of trastuzumab in most of the studies has shown improvement in the overall survival and the disease-free survival rate of the study patients.","output":"Treatment outcomes among human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer patients: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an abundantly available antioxidant with a wide range of antidotal properties currently best studied for its use in treating acetaminophen overdose.

We previously reported that the innate immune system via the toll-like receptor (TLR) response induced by corticosteroids leads to the development of ONFH and that repression of IRF7 activity by an inhibitor could interfere with the development of ONFH while maintaining the therapeutic effect of the corticosteroids. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we hypothesize that lansoprazole has the potential to suppress IRF7 activity and prevent corticosteroid-induced ONFH in rats. Furthermore, we conducted a preliminary clinical trial to prevent corticosteroid-induced ONFH in autoimmune disease patients. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups. On Day 1, each rat was injected with TLR4 ligand (LPS) or TLR7 ligand (imiquimod), followed by methylprednisolone with or without lansoprazole on Day 2. They were killed at 1 or 14 days after the last injection.We prospectively recruited 30 patients requiring primary high-dose corticosteroid treatment for immune diseases. All patients were administered lansoprazole, starting the night before corticosteroid treatment began. MRI was performed before corticosteroid treatment, and at 4, 12 and 24 weeks afterward. RESULTS: In rats, co-treatment of lansoprazole with corticosteroids significantly repressed both IRF7 activity and the development of ONFH. Moreover, in the human patients, the incidence of ONFH was significantly decreased from 53.4 to 13.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Although the present study is preliminary, the results show that co-treatment of lansoprazole with corticosteroids prevents ONFH development. Lansoprazole may be both safe and effective in preventing osteonecrosis of the femoral head in patients needing corticosteroid treatment.","output":"The proton pump inhibitor, lansoprazole, prevents the development of non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head: an experimental and prospective clinical trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The biological utilization of dissolved silicon (DSi) influences ocean ecology and biogeochemistry. In the deep sea, hexactinellid sponges are major DSi consumers that remain poorly understood. Their DSi consumption departs from the Michaelis-Menten kinetics of shallow-water demosponges and appears particularly maladapted to incorporating DSi from the modest concentrations typical of the modern ocean. Why did sponges not adapt to the shrinking DSi availability that followed diatom expansion some 100 to 65 million years ago? We propose that sponges incorporate DSi combining passive (aquaglyceroporins) and active (ArsB) transporters, while only active transporters (SITs) operate in diatoms and choanoflagellates. Evolution of greater silicon transport efficiency appears constrained by the additional role of aquaglyceroporins in transporting essential metalloids other than silicon. We discuss the possibility that lower energy costs may have driven replacement of ancestral SITs by less efficient aquaglyceroporins, and discuss the functional implications of conservation of aquaglyceroporin-mediated DSi utilization in vertebrates.","output":"Cooperation between passive and active silicon transporters clarifies the ecophysiology and evolution of biosilicification in sponges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThis study measured the long-term health-related quality of life of non-hospitalised COVID-19 cases with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2(+) infection using the recommended instrument in England (the EQ-5D).

Data were analyzed for clinical outcomes, including all-cause or CV death, and heart failure hospitalization (HFH). Results Among 5 RCTs (mean age: 63 years; 78% male; 76% White) with moderate overall risk of bias, clinical outcomes in patients with an ICD (n = 3260) vs a control group (n = 3685) were compared. No between-group sex differences were observed for all-cause death (odds ratio [OR] 0.86, P = 0.51), CV death (OR 0.98, P = 0.96), HFH (OR 0.95, P = 0.87), or HFH and all-cause death (OR 0.83, P = 0.51) in the ICD group, in a comparison of male vs female sex.

Most RCTs originated in North America, had male leadership, and were evenly sponsored by industry vs peer-reviewed funding. Conclusions Outcomes data are sparse, by sex, race, and age, in current RCTs evaluating ICD therapy. Although ICD patient outcomes did not significantly differ by sex or race, improved data analyses and reporting are needed to determine the relationship between these sociocultural factors and clinical outcomes among distinct ICD patient cohorts.","output":"Sex, Race, and Age Differences in Cardiovascular Outcomes in Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Randomized Controlled Trials: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) was coined way back in 1987 by Warren Bennis and Burt Nanus.

While the medical community and public showed great interest in gross and histologic findings in COVID-affected patients, paradoxically many autopsy services nationwide closed due to uncertainties surrounding the proximity to infected patient tissue, shortages in personal protective equipment, and pressures to discontinue perceived nonessential hospital operations. These disruptions furthermore negatively impacted pathology trainee education. The autopsy division at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, with the belief that a fully functioning autopsy service is especially crucial at this time, adopted a framework for continuing at full capacity for both clinical care and education. New operations were modeled on national protocols by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the College of American Pathologists, and the service continually adjusted policies to reflect rapidly changing guidelines and feedback from trainees and staff. Between January and December 2020, we performed 182 adult autopsies including 45 COVID-19 autopsies. Twelve residents, 4 staff, and 5 attendings rotated through the service.

More recently, however, some patients have tested positive for COVID-19 after developing gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms either solely or in conjunction with respiratory symptoms. This may be due to SARS-CoV-2 infection of the GI tract. In patients with chronic GI illnesses, COVID-19 may initially present as a flare of their underlying GI conditions as viruses have historically been implicated in exacerbations of GI disorders, including gastroparesis. PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a case of a 37-year-old female with a history of diabetic gastroparesis who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with nausea and vomiting similar to her gastroparesis flares. DIAGNOSES: Her symptoms in the ED failed to improve with fluids and anti-emetic medications. After developing a fever, she was tested and found to be positive for COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: She was started on antibiotic, steroid, and antiviral medications. OUTCOMES: Her symptoms improved, her fever defervesced on day 4 of hospitalization, and she was discharged on day 5 of hospitalization. The patient reported symptom improvement at a follow-up outpatient gastroenterology visit 2 months after hospitalization. LESSONS: To the best of our knowledge, at the present time, this is the first report of a patient with COVID-19 presenting with signs and symptoms of a gastroparesis flare. This case illustrates that COVID-19 may present in an exacerbation of symptoms of an underlying disorder, such as a severe gastroparesis flare, in a patient with underlying gastroparesis. Initial presentation of these patients manifesting as a flare of their chronic GI disease, more severe than usual, should prompt an index of suspicion for COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19 infection manifesting as a severe gastroparesis flare: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: The Austrian supply of COVID-19 vaccine is limited for now.

First, outcomes were optimized for an initially available vaccine batch for 200,000 individuals. Second, stepwise optimization was performed deriving a prioritization sequence for 2.45 million individuals, maximizing the reduction in total hospitalizations and deaths compared to no vaccination.

METHODS: We administered self-answered structured questionnaires in three malls in the Trentino province in June 2019. We collected demographic data and information on knowledge about vaccines, infectious diseases and attitude in seeking health information. We utilized a descriptive and multivariate analysis to investigate factors associated with vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: We collected 567 questionnaires, 18% of the people interviewed were hesitant toward vaccination and 16% were against mandatory vaccination. In the multivariate analysis a poor level of information, being younger than 60 years and being against compulsory vaccination were associated with vaccine hesitancy. Regarding information about vaccines, 76.5% of the people relied on physicians, and/or 49% navigated the internet, while social media are used by 16% of the study population.

However, there is variation in how hospitals address this challenge, partly driven by each sites level of digital maturity, expertise and resources available. This systematic review investigated approaches to measuring AMU to explore how these structural differences may present barriers to engagement with AMU surveillance. METHODS: We searched four digital databases and the websites of relevant organizations for studies in high-income, inpatient hospital settings that estimated AMU in adults. Excluded studies focused exclusively on antiviral or antifungal therapies. Data were extracted data on 12 fields (study description, data sources, data extraction methods and professionals involved in surveillance). Proportions were estimated with 95% CIs. RESULTS: We identified 145 reports of antimicrobial surveillance from Europe (63), North America (53), Oceania (14), Asia (13) and across more than continent (2) between 1977 and 2018.

It is of importance to reveal if these patients develop an antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 and to define which antibodies confer virus neutralization. We conducted a comprehensive serological survey of 49 patients with a mild course of disease and quantified neutralizing antibody responses against a clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate employing human cells as targets. Four patients (8%), even though symptomatic, did not develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and two other patients (4%) were positive in only one of the six serological assays employed. For the remaining 88%, antibody response against the S protein correlated with serum neutralization whereas antibodies against the nucleocapsid were poor predictors of virus neutralization. None of the sera enhanced infection of human cells with SARS-CoV-2 at any dilution, arguing against antibody-dependent enhancement of infection in our system. Regarding neutralization, only six patients (12%) could be classified as high neutralizers. Furthermore, sera from several individuals with fairly high antibody levels had only poor neutralizing activity. In addition, employing a novel serological Western blot system to characterize antibody responses against seasonal coronaviruses, we found that antibodies against the seasonal coronavirus 229E might contribute to SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Altogether, we show that there is a wide breadth of antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in patients that differentially correlate with virus neutralization. This highlights the difficulty to define reliable surrogate markers for immunity against SARS-CoV-2.IMPORTANCE There is strong interest in the nature of the neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 in infected individuals. For vaccine development, it is especially important which antibodies confer protection against SARS-CoV-2, if there is a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, and if there is cross-protection by antibodies directed against seasonal coronaviruses. We addressed these questions and found in accordance with other studies that neutralization is mediated mainly by antibodies directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in general and the receptor binding site in particular. In our test system, utilizing human cells for infection experiments, we did not detect ADE. However, using a novel diagnostic test we found that antibodies against the coronavirus 229E might be involved in cross-protection to SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Antibody Response against SARS-CoV-2 and Seasonal Coronaviruses in Nonhospitalized COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The goal of this study is to analyze the relationship between COVID-19 vaccinations and public governance performing a global analysis of more than 110 countries worldwide.

Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 800 mg hydroxychloroquine on Day 0 followed by 400 mg per day for 8 days or a placebo. The primary endpoint was a composite of death or tracheal intubation within 14 days following randomization. Secondary endpoints included mortality and clinical evolution at Day 14 and 28, viral shedding at Day 5 and 10. Results The trial was stopped after 250 patients were included due to a slowdown of the pandemic in France. The intention-to-treat population comprised 123 and 124 patients in the placebo and hydroxychloroquine groups, respectively. The median age was 77 years and 151 patients required oxygen therapy. The primary endpoint occurred in nine patients in the hydroxychloroquine group and eight patients in the placebo group (relative risk 1.12; 95% confidence interval 0.45-2.80; P=0.82). No difference was observed between the two groups in any of the secondary endpoints. Conclusion In this trial involving mainly older patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, patients treated with hydroxychloroquine did not experience better clinical or virological outcomes than those receiving the placebo.","output":"A placebo-controlled double blind trial of hydroxychloroquine in mild-to-moderate COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Controversy exists regarding many aspects of decision making pertaining to same-day versus staged bilateral TKA (BTKAs), including patient selection, perioperative management decisions, and other important choices. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES In the absence of suitable randomized trials, we sought to determine areas of consensus among national experts on the following questions: (1) What are the comparative risks of same-day BTKAs compared with unilateral TKA (UTKA) and staged BTKAs? (2) Who should be considered an appropriate candidate for same-day BTKAs? (3) What constitutes appropriate workup and perioperative management for BTKAs? (4) What is the optimal time between procedures if same-day BTKAs are not deemed appropriate? (5) Are there orthopaedic or rehabilitation considerations for BTKAs that might outweigh medical contraindications? METHODS In the setting of a consensus conference of national experts in orthopaedic surgery, anesthesiology, perioperative medicine, and epidemiology, the major questions surrounding same-day BTKAs were addressed by using an extensive literature review and the modified Delphi process. The process concluded with a meeting of participants and formulation of consensus statements. RESULTS Eighty-one percent of participants agreed that BTKAs are more invasive and complex procedures associated with increased risk for perioperative adverse events compared with UTKA in an unselected group of patients. The consensus group agreed that physicians and hospitals should consider using more restrictive patient selection criteria and exclude those with a modified cardiac risk index greater than 3 to mitigate the potentially increased risk. The majority of the group agreed that perioperative assessment and management should reflect the higher level of acuity of same-day BTKAs. Eighty-one percent of participants agreed that if a patient is not deemed a candidate for same-day BTKAs, a second TKA should be scheduled no sooner than 3 months after the first. The entire group agreed that when there is a conflict between the orthopaedic need and the medical adequacy of same-day BTKAs, the medical concern for the patient's safety should prevail over the orthopaedic need. CONCLUSIONS Experts perceived that same-day BTKAs increase medical risk, and thus a systematic approach to the management of patients should be taken to minimize complications.","output":"Consensus statement from the consensus conference on bilateral total knee arthroplasty group."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increasing amount of investment through crowdfunding platforms despite the recent global economic downturn brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic has nurtured the interest in how this form of investment can generate non-monetary value for a company.

This study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 on blood transfusion therapy (BTT) of thalassemia patients and suggest ways to ensure safe and reliable blood supplies amid such health crises. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2019 (before COVID-19) to July 2020 (during COVID-19) based on the data provided by a thalassemia center, named Help International Welfare Trust, Karachi, Pakistan. SPSS version 24.0 was used for the data analysis. Data were described in the form of means and percentages. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in the consumption of PRBCs bags after the emergence of COVID-19 (P=0.002). Moreover, the number of thalassemia patients receiving BTT was dropped by 10.56% during the pandemic. There was a strong negative correlation observed between the rising cases of COVID-19 in Pakistan and the number of patients missing their therapy sessions (r=-0.914, P=0.030). A considerable decline in the reserves of all Rhesus-negative blood groups amid the COVID-19 outbreak was also observed. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the already suboptimal care catered to thalassemia patients in Karachi, Pakistan. The fear of the virus contraction coupled with the lockdown and restricted mobility has disrupted the entire transfusion chain from donor to the recipient.

To reduce mortality, in addiction to mass vaccination, it is necessary to massify and accelerate clinical diagnosis, as well as creating new ways of monitoring patients that can help in the construction of specific treatments for the disease. Objective In this work, we propose rapid protocols for clinical diagnosis of Covid-19 through the automatic analysis of hematological parameters using Evolutionary Computing and Machine Learning. These hematological parameters are obtained from blood tests common in clinical practice. Method We investigated the best classifier architectures. Then, we applied the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) to select the most relevant attributes: serum glucose, troponin, partial thromboplastin time, ferritin, D-dimer, lactic dehydrogenase, and indirect bilirubin. Finally, we used decision trees to build four rapid protocols for Covid-19 clinical diagnosis. Results We developed a web system for Covid-19 diagnosis support. Using a 100-tree Random Forest, we obtained results for accuracy, sensitivity and specificity superior to 99%. Conclusion By using a reduced set of hematological parameters common in clinical practice, it was possible to achieve results of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity comparable to those obtained with RT-PCR. It was also possible to automatically generate clinical decision protocols, allowing relatively accurate clinical diagnosis even without the aid of the web decision support system.","output":"Rapid protocols to support Covid-19 clinical diagnosis based on hematological parameters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is being defined as the worst pandemic disease of modern times. Several professional health organizations have published position papers stating that there is no evidence to change the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in the management of elevated blood pressure in the context of avoiding or treating COVID-19 infection. In this article, we review the evidence on the relationship between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and COVID-19 infection. In agreement with current guidelines, patients with hypertension should continue taking antihypertensive medications as prescribed without interruption. Because ACEIs and ARBs are also used to retard the progression of chronic kidney disease, we suggest that these recommendations also apply to the use of these agents in chronic kidney disease. No differences generally exist between ARBs and ACEIs in terms of efficacy in decreasing blood pressure and improving other outcomes, such as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and end-stage renal disease. The ACEIs are associated with cough secondary to accumulation of bradykinin and angioedema, and withdrawal rates due to adverse events are lower with ARBs. Given their equal efficacy but fewer adverse events, ARBs could potentially be a more favorable treatment option in patients with COVID-19 at higher risk for severe forms of disease.","output":"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 and Antihypertensives (Angiotensin Receptor Blockers and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors) in Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The large reductions in electricity demand caused by the COVID-19 crisis have disrupted electricity systems worldwide This article draws insights from New York","output":"Reaching New Lows?

To meet that need, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), the nation's largest hospital surveillance system, launched a module for collecting hospital coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) data. We present time-series estimates of the critical hospital capacity indicators from April 1 to July 14, 2020. DESIGN: From March 27 to July 14, 2020, the NHSN collected daily data on hospital bed occupancy, number of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and the availability and/or use of mechanical ventilators. Time series were constructed using multiple imputation and survey weighting to allow near-real-time daily national and state estimates to be computed. RESULTS: During the pandemic's April peak in the United States, among an estimated 431,000 total inpatients, 84,000 (19%) had COVID-19. Although the number of inpatients with COVID-19 decreased from April to July, the proportion of occupied inpatient beds increased steadily. COVID-19 hospitalizations increased from mid-June in the South and Southwest regions after stay-at-home restrictions were eased. The proportion of inpatients with COVID-19 on ventilators decreased from April to July. CONCLUSIONS: The NHSN hospital capacity estimates served as important, near-real-time indicators of the pandemic's magnitude, spread, and impact, providing quantitative guidance for the public health response. Use of the estimates detected the rise of hospitalizations in specific geographic regions in June after they declined from a peak in April.

The incubation period is a key parameter for epidemic control and also an important basis for epidemic prediction, but its distribution law remain unclear. Methods: The incubation period T was described by the accelerated failure time models, and the principle of interval-censored data processing and estimation methods were used. Statistical analysis were performed on R-4.0.2 software using coarseDataTools 0.6-5 package to optimize the parameters to be estimated and calculate the confidence interval. The optimization method used when solving the maximum likelihood function is the simplex method. We used bootstrap re-sampling procedures with 1000 iterations to estimate the confidence interval. Results: Here we analyzed the epidemiological information of 787 confirmed non-Wuhan resident cases, and systematically studied the characteristics of the incubation period of COVID-19 based on the interval-censored data estimation method. Through the statistical analysis of the overall and 7 types of sub-group samples, it was concluded that the incubation period of COVID-19 approximately conformed to the Gamma distribution with a mean value of 7.8 (95%CI: 7.4-8.5) days and a median value of 7.0 (95%CI: 6.7-7.3) days. Conclusions: The incubation period was positively correlated with age and negatively correlated with disease severity. Female cases presented a slightly higher incubation period than that of males. The incubation period of cases with travel history to Hubei and multiple exposures was shorter. The proportion of infected persons who developed symptoms within 14 days was 91.6%.

However, the persistent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, an RNA virus, resulted in the appearance of mutations in the original virus. The appearance of more virulent mutations in different regions of the world resulted in an increased number of severe COVID-19 cases. A mathematical model based on the COVID-19 natural history encompassing the mutations was applied to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. The model parameters were fitted against the observed data from S?o Paulo State (Brazil) considering quarantine, relaxation, and mutation. The estimated data from S?o Paulo State showed that the original SARS-CoV-2 transmission better explained the COVID-19 epidemic during the quarantine. However, the increased number of fatalities beyond that predicted by the relaxation indicated the occurrence of mutations. Hence, the relaxation in association with the transmission of a more virulent SARS-CoV-2 better estimated the COVID-19 epidemic from February 26, 2020, to June 15, 2021, in S?o Paulo State.","output":"Evaluating the impacts of relaxation and mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 on the COVID-19 epidemic based on a mathematical model: a case study of S?o Paulo State (Brazil)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hendra virus (HeV) is a zoonotic enveloped member of the family Paramyoxviridae.

One manifestation of the blunt and potentially ageism-promoting use of age in data about the virus is the failure to routinely distinguish the independent role of age alone, separate from its association with comorbidities. A related problem is the use of broad age categories, which can also mask the role of specific comorbidities. To address that gap, this study uses data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of Feb 21, 2021 to calculate age-specific COVID-19 death rates (ASDR) and compare the extent to which comorbid conditions potentially associated with COVID-19 deaths were listed on death certificates. Findings showed that the ASDR was significantly higher for those 85 years and over (2249.96 per 100,000); the rate was 802.66 for 75-84 and 312.78 per 100,000 for 65-74. Death certificate information revealed that influenza and pneumonia was the major contributing comorbidity to COVID-19 deaths across all three age groups; (listed on 49% of the death certificates for those 65-74 who died with COVID-19, 46% of those 75-84, and 38% of those 85 and over). Future studies should be more precise about the use of age/age groups, about the rationale for those designations, and about the impact of age separate from comorbidities.

It has a reported rate of psychosocial precipitating factors ranging 30-65%. The aim of the study was to describe all cases of CP, admitted in our Psychiatry ward, during the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD In this retrospective and observational study, we reported a sample of eight patients who were treated as inpatients in the psychiatric ward of our hospital during the first two months of COVID-19 pandemic (mid-March to mid-May 2020) and compared it with previous years. All our patients fulfilled all four Perris & Brockington criteria for CP. We reported the sociodemographic, clinical and biological parameters. RESULTS In our sample, all of the patients had maladaptive personality traits; the major external stressing factor was COVID-19; all our patients had short prodromal symptomatology, short Duration of Untreated Psychosis (DUP) and high score at the Positive Scale at Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS-P) at hospital admission with the majority showing psychotic symptoms related to the actual COVID-19 pandemic. The predominant treatment during admission was olanzapine and a short time to full remission of psychotic symptoms was observed in all patients.

A systematic literature search in PubMed and EMBASE identified 18 prospective studies applying dynamic coagulation assays in ICU COVID-19 patients. Overall, these studies revealed normal or slightly reduced primary hemostasis, prolonged clot initiation, but increased clot firmness. Thrombin generation assay parameters generally were equivalent to the control groups or within reference range. Fibrinolysis assays showed increased clot resistance. Only six studies related their findings to clinical outcome. We also prospectively included 51 COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. Blood samples were examined on day 1, 3-4, and 7-8 with platelet function tests, rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), in vivo and ex vivo thrombin generation, and clot lysis assay. Data on thrombosis, bleeding, and mortality were recorded during 30 days. Primary hemostasis was comparable to healthy controls, but COVID-19 patients had longer ROTEM-clotting times and higher maximum clot firmness than healthy controls. Ex vivo thrombin generation was similar to that of healthy controls while in vivo thrombin generation markers, thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complex, and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2) were higher in ICU COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls. Impaired fibrinolysis was present at all time points. TAT complex and F1 + 2 levels were significantly higher in patients developing thrombosis (n = 16) than in those without. In conclusion, only few previous studies employed dynamic hemostasis assays in COVID-19 ICU-patients and failed to reveal a clear association with development of thrombosis. In ICU COVID-19 patients, we confirmed normal platelet aggregation, while in vivo thrombin generation was increased and fibrinolysis decreased. Thrombosis may be driven by increased thrombin formation in vivo.","output":"Dynamic Hemostasis and Fibrinolysis Assays in Intensive Care COVID-19 Patients and Association with Thrombosis and Bleeding-A Systematic Review and a Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Palliative care offers children who have life-limiting and life-threatening oncologic illnesses and their families improved quality of life.

It is unclear how these new ways of working were implemented in practice, and how they impacted vulnerable patients. Aim: To assess the impact of TT and RbD on vulnerable patients and identify mitigation strategies. Design and Setting: A mixed methods service evaluation in Lewisham, London, an area of high deprivation. Method: Three parallel datasets were collected and analysed: Semi-structured interviews with stakeholders working with vulnerable groups and qualitative data from forums with black and ethnic minority patients, a survey of General Practitioners exploring implementation of TT and RbD, and a mystery shopper exercise reviewing access and messaging of ten practices. Results: Barriers to access for vulnerable patients included challenges navigating the new model, difficulty engaging with remote consultations and digital exclusion. There was wide variation in messaging regarding changes to services and the practical application of TT and RbD. Potential solutions included clearer practice guidance and patient messaging, more consistent implementation, and identification and recording of patient access needs to enable better tailoring of care provision.

We consider various aspects of barriers and distinguish among: (1) respondents who forewent medical treatment because they were afraid of becoming infected with the Coronavirus; (2) respondents who had pre-scheduled medical appointments postponed by health providers due to the outbreak; and (3) respondents who tried to arrange a medical appointment but were denied one. Limited access to healthcare during the initial outbreak was more common for the occupationally active, women, the more educated and those living in urban areas. A bad economic situation, poor overall health and higher healthcare utilisation were robust predictors of unmet healthcare. People aged 50+ in countries of 'Old' Europe, countries with higher universal health coverage and stricter containment and closure policies were more likely to have medical services postponed. Policymakers should address the healthcare needs of older people with chronic health conditions and a poor socio-economic status who were made more vulnerable by this pandemic.

Automation tools need to be able to work together, to exchange data and results. Therefore, we initiated the International Collaboration for the Automation of Systematic Reviews (ICASR), to successfully put all the parts of automation of systematic review production together.

This use has become widespread and intensified since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite growing evidence that e-learning has positive effects, studies on the effects of ICT use in nursing and midwifery learning in low- and middle-income countries are limited. Objectives This systematic review aims to identify and synthesize the effects of information and communication technologies utilization in nursing and obstetric learning in low- and middle-income countries. Methods A search of articles published from 2016 to 2020 on the effects of ICT use in nursing and obstetric learning was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Epistemonikos and ERIC using free and controlled vocabularies. All original articles meeting the predefined criteria were included. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines, searches were performed among published and unpublished articles. Data were extracted and assessed for quality using the Mixed Methods Analysis Tool (MMAT). Results Of 483 articles identified, eleven were reviewed, and eight were found to be relevant. The included articles were synthesized into a narrative synthesis. The effects of using ICT in learning are related to student motivation, autonomy in learning, meaningful acquisition of knowledge and skills. Furthermore, students have a positive perception of the use of ICT in learning. Conclusion The results of this study on the use of ICTs in nursing and midwifery learning in low- and middle-income countries show that ICTs are used primarily as a medium for distance learning. In addition, it was found that e-learning has several advantages or positive effects. However, many students do not have a personal computer, and they have low or average skills in the use of computer tools, and access to the Internet is low.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-center retrospective study, initial CXR of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were investigated. A commercialized deep learning-based CAD system that can identify various abnormalities on CXR was implemented for the interpretation of CXR in daily practice. The diagnostic performance of radiologists with CAD assistance were evaluated based on two different reference standards: 1) real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) results for COVID-19 and 2) pulmonary abnormality suggesting pneumonia on chest CT. The turnaround times (TATs) of radiology reports for CXR and rRT-PCR results were also evaluated. RESULTS: Among 332 patients (male:female, 173:159; mean age, 57 years) with available rRT-PCR results, 16 patients (4.8%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Using CXR, radiologists with CAD assistance identified rRT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients with sensitivity and specificity of 68.8% and 66.7%, respectively. Among 119 patients (male:female, 75:44; mean age, 69 years) with available chest CTs, radiologists assisted by CAD reported pneumonia on CXR with a sensitivity of 81.5% and a specificity of 72.3%. The TATs of CXR reports were significantly shorter than those of rRT-PCR results (median 51 vs. 507 minutes; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Radiologists with CAD assistance could identify patients with rRT-PCR-positive COVID-19 or pneumonia on CXR with a reasonably acceptable performance.

Clinicians control four settings on the device-systolic and diastolic drive pressures, device pump rate, and systolic time as a percentage of the pump cycle. However, interactions between BH pneumatics and the native circulation remain poorly understood. Thus, establishing appropriate device size and settings can be challenging on a patient-to-patient basis. METHODS: In this study we develop a novel lumped parameter network based on simplified device mechanics. We perform parametric studies to characterize device behavior, study interactions between the left ventricle (LV) and BH across different device settings, and develop patient-specific simulations. We then simulate the impact of changing device parameters for each of three patients. RESULTS: Increasing systolic pressure and systolic time increased device output. We identified previously unobserved cycle-to-cycle variations in LV-BH interactions that may impact patient health. Patient-specific simulations demonstrated the model's ability to replicate BH performance, captured trends in LV behavior after device implantation, and emphasized the importance of device rate and volume in optimizing BH efficiency. CONCLUSION: We present a novel, mechanistic model that can be readily adjusted to study a wide range of device settings and clinical scenarios. Physiologic interactions between the BH and the native LV produced large variability in cardiac loading. Our findings showed that operating the BH at a device rate greater than the patient's native heart decreases variability in physiological interactions between the BH and LV, increasing cardiac offloading while maintaining cardiac output. Device rates that are close to the resting heart rate may result in unfavorable cardiac loading conditions. Our work demonstrates the utility of our model to investigate BH performance for patient-specific physiologies.","output":"A Mechanistic Lumped Parameter Model of the Berlin Heart EXCOR to Analyze Device Performance and Physiologic Interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study reported in this paper aims to show how Croatian lower-secondary mathematics teachers coped with remote education during the lockdown necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic. The research design refers to the case study of six teachers.

The study results showed that social parameters were prominent factors in the decision-making of many teachers regarding teaching remotely. For example, the teachers always put students' needs first: they were accessible almost all day to their students, they tried not to overload students and provided daily feedback on their work. In addition, the teachers in the study raised the issue of academic dishonesty in remote education - the digital environment made cheating easier and meant that the usual assessment formats became unfeasible.

Previous works have found a production benefit for younger and older adults studying written words and for young adults studying written text. The present study aimed to extend these findings by examining the effect of production on text memory in younger and older adults, in the visual, and in the auditory modalities. METHODS A group of young adults (n = 30) and a group of older adults (n = 30) learned informational texts, presented either visually or aurally. In each text, half of the sentences were learned by production (reading aloud or writing) and half by no production (reading silently or listening), followed by fill-in-the-blank tests. RESULTS An overall memory performance was found to be similar for both groups, with an advantage for the auditory modality. For both groups, more test items were filled in correctly when the relevant information appeared in the produced than in nonproduced sentences, showing the learners' ability to use distinctiveness information. The production effects were larger for older than younger adults, in both modalities. DISCUSSION Since older adults are increasingly engage in learning, it is important to develop high-quality structured learning programs for this population. The current results demonstrate the preserved ability of older adults to successfully memorize texts and may guide planning of such programs. Specifically, since learning via the auditory modality yields superior performance for learners across age-groups, it may be recommended for text learning. Because older adults showed larger benefits from active production of the study material, it may be used to better remember educationally relevant material.","output":"Production Improves Visual and Auditory Text Memory in Younger and Older Adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obwohl zur Evolution sexueller Fortpflanzung seit Jahrzehnten intensiv geforscht wird, ist der Prozess der Entstehung und Aufrechterhaltung der Sexualit?t noch ungengend verstanden.

We hypothesize that the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on population health and the economy will last for a very long time and will still be felt in the 22nd century. Our hypothesis is based on evidence from the 1918C1919 influenza pandemic, the Dutch famine during the Second World War, and the 2007C2008 economic crisis, as well as from the rationally predicted impact of COVID-19 on human development. We expect that the COVID-19 pandemic, including the mitigation measures taken against it, will affect childrens development in multiple ways, including obesity, both while in utero and during critical and sensitive windows of development, including the early childhood years and those of puberty and adolescence. The psychosocial and biological impact of this effect will be considerable and unequally distributed. The implications will last at least a lifetime, and, through inter-generational transmission, will likely take us to future generations, into the 22nd century. We argue for the urgent need of designing and initiating comprehensive longitudinal cohort studies to closely monitor the long-term effects of COVID-19 on children conceived, born, and raised during the pandemic. Such an approach requires a close and effective collaboration between scientists, healthcare providers, policymakers, and the younger generations, and it will hopefully uncover evidence necessary to understand and mitigate the impact of the pandemic on peoples lives in the 21st and 22nd centuries.","output":"Could COVID-19s Aftermath on Childrens Health Be Felt into the 22nd Century?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online social media (OSM) has emerged as a prominent platform for debate on a wide range of issues. Even celebrities and public figures often share their opinions on a variety of topics through OSM platforms. One such subject that has gained a lot of coverage on Twitter is the Novel Coronavirus, officially known as COVID-19, which has become a pandemic and has sparked a crisis in human history. In this study, we examine 29 million tweets over three months to study highly influential users, whom we refer to as leaders. We recognize these leaders through social network techniques and analyse their tweets using text analysis. Using a community detection algorithm, we categorize these leaders into four clusters: research, news, health, and politics, with each cluster containing Twitter handles (accounts) of individual users or organizations. e.g., the health cluster includes the World Health Organization (@WHO), the Director-General of WHO (@DrTedros), and so on. The emotion analysis reveals that (i) all clusters show an equal amount of fear in their tweets, (ii) research and news clusters display more sadness than others, and (iii) health and politics clusters are attempting to win public trust. According to the text analysis, the (i) research cluster is more concerned with recognizing symptoms and the development of vaccination; (ii) news and politics clusters are mostly concerned with travel.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can trigger both inflammatory and thrombotic processes, and these complications can lead to a poorer prognosis. This study aimed to evaluate the association and temporal trends of D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels with the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), hospital mortality, and costs among inpatients with COVID-19. METHODS: Data were extracted from electronic patient records and laboratory databases. Crude and adjusted associations for age, sex, number of comorbidities, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at admission, and D-dimer or CRP logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations. RESULTS: Between March and June 2020, COVID-19 was documented in 3,254 inpatients. The D-dimer level 4,000 ng/mL fibrinogen equivalent unit (FEU) mortality odds ratio (OR) was 4.48 (adjusted OR: 1.97). The CRP level 220 mg/dL OR for death was 7.73 (adjusted OR: 3.93). The D-dimer level 4,000 ng/mL FEU VTE OR was 3.96 (adjusted OR: 3.26). The CRP level 220 mg/dL OR for VTE was 2.71 (adjusted OR: 1.92). All these analyses were statistically significant (p<0.001). Stratified hospital costs demonstrated a dose-response pattern. Adjusted D-dimer and CRP levels were associated with higher mortality and doubled hospital costs. In the first week, elevated D-dimer levels predicted VTE occurrence and systemic inflammatory harm, while CRP was a hospital mortality predictor. CONCLUSION: D-dimer and CRP levels were associated with higher hospital mortality and a higher incidence of VTE. D-dimer was more strongly associated with VTE, although its discriminative ability was poor, while CRP was a stronger predictor of hospital mortality. Their use outside the usual indications should not be modified and should be discouraged.","output":"Use and misuse of biomarkers and the role of D-dimer and C-reactive protein in the management of COVID-19: A post-hoc analysis of a prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The key to success in machine learning is the use of effective data representations. The success of deep neural networks (DNNs) is based on their ability to utilize multiple neural network layers, and big data, to learn how to convert simple input representations into richer internal representations that are effective for learning. However, these internal representations are sub-symbolic and difficult to explain. In many scientific problems explainable models are required, and the input data is semantically complex and unsuitable for DNNs. This is true in the fundamental problem of understanding the mechanism of cancer drugs, which requires complex background knowledge about the functions of genes/proteins, their cells, and the molecular structure of the drugs. This background knowledge cannot be compactly expressed propositionally, and requires at least the expressive power of Datalog. Here we demonstrate the use of relational learning to generate new data descriptors in such semantically complex background knowledge. These new descriptors are effective: adding them to standard propositional learning methods significantly improves prediction accuracy. They are also explainable, and add to our understanding of cancer. Our approach can readily be expanded to include other complex forms of background knowledge, and combines the generality of relational learning with the efficiency of standard propositional learning.","output":"Generating Explainable and Effective Data Descriptors Using Relational Learning: Application to Cancer Biology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As lockdown eases, economic activities resume in Pakistan. If the country continues to follow business-as-usual (BAU) then it is anticipated that carbon output could surge past pre-COVID-19 levels - that means more disasters in future. Thus, it is an unprecedented opportunity to shift from BAU and achieve carbon-neutral and nature-positive economic recovery - green economic recovery (GER). To fuel the GER, access to modern, equitable, affordable and sustainable energy is paramount. This study explores waste-to-energy (WtE) as an alternative green fuel for GER. Seven WtE technologies are prioritized based on the concept of energy trilemma - energy security, energy equity, and environmental sustainability. For the evaluation, an energy trilemma based decision support framework is developed using most prominent multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. The fuzzy set theory is integrated with MCDM methods to minimize uncertainty in results. Sixteen experts are engaged to score each WtE technology with respect to every energy trilemma dimension and sub-dimension. Gasification technology is found to be the most feasible option for WtE generation in Pakistan whereas Torrefaction technology is least favorable. It is concluded that the need to shift towards sustainable energy is more than ever to limit the carbon emission and prevent future crisis.","output":"Energy trilemma based prioritization of waste-to-energy technologies: Implications for post-COVID-19 green economic recovery in Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To determine the reason for the different mortality trends of ischemic heart disease (IHD) for China between Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 and GBD2013, and to improve garbage code (GC) redistribution.

Methods: The experimental method was used. Twelve healthy adult New Zealand long-eared rabbits were divided into normal control group and scar group, with 6 rabbits in each group. The hypertrophic scar model of long-eared rabbit was made according to the literature, and the rats in normal control group were subjected to no disposal. At 60 days after modeling, hematoxylin eosin(HE) staining was used to detect the morphology of skin tissue cells in the two groups. The mRNA expressions of miR-296 and transforming growth factor-?1(TGF-?1) were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Human fibroblasts (HFbs) were divided into psiCHECK-WT-TGF-?1+miR-296 negative control group, psiCHECK-WT-TGF-?1+miR-296 mimic group, psiCHECK-MUT-TGF-?1+miR-296 negative control group, and psiCHECK-MUT-TGF-?1+miR-296 mimic group. And the corresponding sequence were transfected respectively. At 48 h after transfection, luciferase reporter gene detection kit was used to detect the luciferase and renal luciferase expression of miR-296 and TGF-?1 in each group, and the ratio was used to reflect the gene expression level. Two batches of HFbs were used and divided into miR-296 negative control group and miR-296 mimic group, transfecting the corresponding sequence. The first batch of cells were used. At 0 (immediately), 12, 24, 36 and 48 h after transfection, the cell proliferation was detected by thiazolyl blue method. The second batch of cells were used. At 24 h after transfection, the expression of TGF-?1 and collagen type I was detected by Western blotting. The number of samples in cell experiment was 3. Data were statistically analyzed with analysis of variance factorial design, one-way analysis of variance, independent-samples t test, LSD-t test and Pearson correlation coefficient regression. Results: At 60 days after modeling, Fbs in scar group were hyperplastic and arranged abnormally; Fbs in normal control group were evenly arranged without morphological abnormality. The mRNA expression of miR-296 in scar group(0.6520.107) was significantly lower than that in normal control group(1.1920.121, t=5.175, P<0.01). The mRNA expression of TGF-?1 in scar group(1.4670.065) was significantly higher than that in normal control group(1.1050.030, t=12.410, P<0.01). Pearson correlation coefficient analysis showed that there was a negative correlation between the mRNA expression of miR-296 and TGF-?1(F=7.278, P<0.05), and the equation was y=-1.151x+2.066, R2=0.421. At 48 h after transfection, the expression of TGF-?1 luciferase / renal luciferase in psiCHECK-WT-TGF-?1+ miR-296 mimic group was significantly lower than that in psiCHECK-WT-TGF-?1 + miR-296 negative control group(t=35.190, P<0.01). At 12, 24, 36 and 48 h after transfection, the HFbs proliferation ability in miR-296 mimic group were significantly lower than that in miR-296 negative control group(t=3.27511.98010.46017.260P<0.05 or P<0.01).

This study examined the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) of Thai adults and assessed the effects of the national curfew policy and health-promotion campaigns on influencing PA during the pandemic. METHODS: Thailand's Surveillance on Physical Activity (SPA) 2019 and 2020 datasets were employed to compare the PA level of Thai adults aged 18-64 years before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Samples of 4460 respondents from SPA 2019 and 4482 respondents from SPA 2020 were included in the analysis. Global Physical Activity Questionnaires, Version 2.0, were used to measure PA in both periods. Sufficient MVPA for adults was defined based on the recommendation of 75 min of vigorous PA or a combination of 150 min of MVPA per week. RESULTS: The proportion of Thai adults who had sufficient MVPA declined from 74.6% before the pandemic to 54.7% during the pandemic, and that decline was accompanied by a reduction in the cumulative minutes of MVPA from 580 to 420. During the COVID-19 pandemic, male and middle-aged individuals were 1.3 and 1.2 times more likely to have sufficient MVPA, respectively. Those who were unemployed, resided in an urban area, and/or had chronic disease(s) were 27%, 13%, and 27% less likely to meet the recommended level of PA during the pandemic, respectively. Those who were exposed to the Fit from Home campaign were 1.5 times more likely to have sufficient MVPA. CONCLUSION: The pandemic measures imposed by the government have reduced the cumulative min of work-related PA, transportation PA, and recreational PA and have slowed Thailand's progress toward its PA goals. Although the Fit from Home campaign has probably contributed to a slight increase in MVPA, it will take some time for Thais to return to the pre-COVID-19 level of PA. Health promotion messages need to be continuously delivered to reduce irrational fear of infection and to boost the PA level of the Thai population as a health-promoting intervention.","output":"The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical activity of the Thai population: Evidence from Thailand's Surveillance on Physical Activity 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose To analyse structural and non-structural modifications of acute stroke care pathways undertaken at healthcare institutions across the regions of Italy due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Findings On 29 February 2020, the Italian Minister of Health issued national guidelines on how to address the COVID-19 emergency. Stroke management was affected and required changes, basically resulting in the need to prioritise the ongoing COVID-19 emergency. In the most affected regions, the closure of departments and hospitals led to a complete reorganisation of previously functioning stroke networks. With the closure of several Stroke Units and Stroke Centres, the transportation time to hospital lengthened significantly, especially for the outlying populations. Discussion The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has been spreading rapidly in Italy and placing an overwhelming burden on healthcare systems. In response to this, political and healthcare decision-makers worked together to develop and implement efforts to sustain the national healthcare system while fighting the pandemic.

Our aim was to profile the transcriptome in leukocytes from critically ill patients positive for COVID19 compared to those negative for COVID19 to better understand the COVID19 associated host response. For these studies, all patients admitted to our tertiary care intensive care unit (ICU) suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, using standardized hospital screening methodologies, had blood samples collected at the time of admission to the ICU. Transcriptome profiling of leukocytes via ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNAseq) was then performed and differentially expressed genes as well as significantly enriched gene sets were identified. Results: : We enrolled seven COVID19+ (PCR positive, 2 SARS-CoV-2 genes) and seven age- and sex-matched COVID19- (PCR negative) control ICU patients. Cohorts were well-balanced with the exception that COVID19- patients had significantly higher total white blood cell counts and circulating neutrophils and COVID19+ patients were more likely to suffer bilateral pneumonia. The mortality rate for this cohort of COVID19+ ICU patients was 29%. As indicated by both single-gene based and gene set (GSEA) approaches, the major disease-specific transcriptional responses of leukocytes in critically ill COVID19+ ICU patients were: (i) a robust overrepresentation of interferon related gene expression;(ii) a marked decrease in the transcriptional level of genes contributing to general protein synthesis and bioenergy metabolism;and (iii) the dysregulated expression of genes associated with coagulation, platelet function, complement activation, and tumour necrosis factor/interleukin 6 signalling.

A number of recognized complications of COVID-19 infection are described in the literature. Common neurological complications include headache and anosmia. Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS) is an uncommon complication described in isolated case reports. However, a causal relationship has yet to be established. This case report adds to the growing body of evidence that GBS is a potential COVID-19 complication. CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old Caucasian woman with recently diagnosed COVID-19 infection presented to the emergency department with 4 days of gradually worsening ascending lower extremity weakness. Exam revealed bilateral lower extremity weakness, mute reflexes, and sensory loss. Soon after starting intravenous administration of immunoglobulin (IVIG), the patient developed respiratory distress, eventually requiring intubation. She remained intubated for the duration of her IVIG treatment. After five rounds of treatment, the patient was successfully extubated and transferred to acute rehab. Following 4 weeks of intense physical therapy, she was able to walk with assistance on room air.

To date, no licensed antiviral drugs or vaccines are available against COVID-19 although several clinical trials are underway to test possible therapies. During this urgency situation, computational drug discovery methods provide an alternative to tiresome high-throughput screening, particularly in the hit-to-lead-optimization stage. Identification of small molecules that specifically target viral replication apparatus has indicated highest potential towards antiviral drug discovery. In this work, we present potential compounds that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 vital proteins, including the main protease, Nsp12 RNA polymerase and Nsp13 helicase. An integrative virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulations approach led to the identification of potential binding modes and favourable molecular interaction profile of corresponding compounds. Moreover, the identification of structurally important binding site residues in conserved motifs located inside the active site highlights relative importance of ligand binding based on residual energy decomposition analysis. Although the current study lacks experimental validation, the structural information obtained from this computational study has paved way for the design of targeted inhibitors to combat COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"Structural elucidation of SARS-CoV-2 vital proteins: Computational methods reveal potential drug candidates against main protease, Nsp12 polymerase and Nsp13 helicase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Forty-two dairy calves remained with their dams for two days after birth, and then were removed to a calf rearing shed.

Methods: A descriptive questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey was used in this study. A structured web-based questionnaire was disseminated to the Jordanian community through social media platforms. Participants were asked a series of questions about socio-demographic characteristics, in addition to the knowledge, attitudes, and commitment toward using various personal precautionary measures (e.g., face mask, hand washing, social distancing) against the COVID-19. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, cross-tabulation, and binary logistic regression through SPSS(?). Results: Responses from 7,746 participants were included in our final analyses. Descriptive statistics showed that most participants (82.6%) believed that face mask protects against COVID-19. Around 69.5% of the participants were completely committed to wearing a face mask, while 65% of the participants were completely committed to hand washing. The results of the regression analysis revealed that female gender (AOR = 1.2; 95% CI: 1.07C1.35; p = 0.002), having a family member infected with COVID-19 (AOR = 8.5; 95% Cl: 7.51C9.70; p = 0.001), having a health-related work or study (AOR = 1.2; 95% Cl: 1.09C1.38; p = 0.001), believing that face masks do not protect against COVID-19 (AOR = 1.3; 95% Cl: 1.12C1.47; p = 0.001), and partial commitment to handwashing (AOR = 1.2; 95% Cl: 1.11C1.75; p = 0.006) were all associated with an increased odds of contracting COVID-19 among the participants. Conclusion: Overall, commitment to non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures, such as wearing a face mask, hand washing, and physical distancing, was not optimal among Jordanians. This might explain the dramatic increase in the infectivity rate of the COVID-19 virus in the past few months in the country.

The rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 highlights an urgent need to develop effective therapeutics for blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection and spread. Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) is a chief element in host antiviral defense pathways. In this study, we examined the impact of the STING signaling pathway on coronavirus infection using the human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) model. We found that HCoV-OC43 infection did not stimulate the STING signaling pathway, but the activation of STING signaling effectively inhibits HCoV-OC43 infection to a much greater extent than that of type I interferons (IFNs). We also discovered that IRF3, the key STING downstream innate immune effector, is essential for this anticoronavirus activity. In addition, we found that the amidobenzimidazole (ABZI)-based human STING agonist diABZI robustly blocks the infection of not only HCoV-OC43 but also SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, our study identifies the STING signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target that could be exploited for developing broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics against multiple coronavirus strains in order to face the challenge of future coronavirus outbreaks.IMPORTANCE The highly infectious and lethal SARS-CoV-2 is posing an unprecedented threat to public health.

To date, several studies revealed the benefic effects of hypoxic preconditioning in ischemia, kidney failure and in pulmonary function recovery of lung surgery patients. HPC increases the expression of factors that promote cell survival and angiogenesis, induces an anti-inflammatory outcome, triggers coordinated hypoxia responses that promote erythropoiesis, and mobilizes the circulating progenitor cells. Futhermore, the mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) exposed to HPC show improvement of their regenerative capacities, and increases the effectiveness of stem cell therapy in different pathologies, including COVID-19. In conclusion, HPC should be considered an approach with beneficial outcomes and without significant side effects when the organism is severely exposed to the same stressor.

Formed close cross-country and inter-sectoral ties contributed the Covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the functioning of global pharmaceutical chains. The effects of Covid-19 were overlapped previously emerging trends towards defragmentation of global pharmaceutical production. The aim of this paper is to identify possible firm strategies and models for restructuring pharmaceutical chains aimed at increasing their resilience in response to the damaging effects of Covid-19. We suppose that the resilience of the chain as a whole depends on the resilience of its separate links, and we show that the restructuring of pharmaceutical chains takes place in the form of the so-called link restructuring (restruc-turing of separate links of the chain). The paper highlights such models of link restructuring of sectoral cross-border chain as zero restructuring (stock creation);localization (includ-ing import substitution);migration (including reshoring and regionalization);globalization, which operate both in the short and long term periods. The multistage nature of global pharmaceutical chains, as well as the dynamic development of pharmaceutical outsourcing processes, have created favorable opportunities for link restructuring. At the same time, the features of restructuring were influenced by various factors, among which the degree of technology intensity of the pharmaceutical chain takes a key place. The paper proposes one of the possible classifications of pharmaceutical chains depending on the technologies used, where the following are distinguished: low-tech and medium-low-tech chains (pro-duction of essential pharmaceutical goods);medium-high-tech chains (production of ge-nerics);high-tech chains (production of patented drugs, production of biopharmaceuticals, production of medical equipment). The main conclusion the author comes is as follows: the higher the technology intensity of the pharmaceutical chain, the less defragmentation of pharmaceutical production will take place. Thus, in the production of high-tech biophar-maceutical goods, the most needed strategies will be regionalization and globalization of the chain links, while in the production of essential pharmaceutical goods, the strategy of localization and import substitution will be very successful (especially in the short term). This is due to the fact that as the technological effectiveness of the pharmaceutical chain increases, investment costs grow, which makes the efficiency of the chains functioning no less important than its resilience. ? 2022, MGIMO Universty Press.

Mail-order prescriptions are popular in the U.S., but the recent mail delays due to operational changes at the United States Postal Services (USPS) may postpone the delivery of vital medications. Despite growing recognition of the health and economic effects of a postal crisis on mail-order pharmacy consumers, little is known about the extent of mail-order prescription use, and C most importantly C the population groups and types of medications that will likely be most affected by these postal delays. METHODS. The prevalence of mail-order prescription use was assessed using a nationally representative repeated cross-sectional survey (the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey) carried out among adults aged 18 and older in each year from 1996 to 2018. We stratified use of mail-order prescription by socio-demographic and health characteristics. Additionally, we calculated which prescription medications were most prevalent among all mailed medications, and for which medications users were most likely to opt for mail-order prescription. FINDINGS. 500,217 adults participated in the survey. Between 1996 and 2018, the prevalence of using at least one mail-order prescription in a year among U.S. adults was 98% (95% CI, 95%-100%). Each user purchased a mean of 19.4 (95% CI, 190-198) mail-order prescriptions annually. The prevalence of use increased from 69% (95% CI, 64%-75%) in 1996 to 103% (95% CI, 97%-109%) in 2018, and the mean annual number of mail-order prescriptions per user increased from 107 (95% CI, 98-117) to 205 (95% CI, 193-217) over the same period. Use of mail-order prescription in 2018 was common among adults aged 65 and older (239% [95% CI, 223%-254%]), non-Hispanic whites (136% [95% CI, 128%-145%]), married adults (127% [95% CI, 118%-136%]), college graduates (122% [95% CI, 113%-131%]), high-income adults (126%, [95% CI, 116%-136%]), disabled adults (193% [95% CI, 179%-207%]), adults with poor health status (156% [95% CI, 116%-196%]), adults with three or more chronic conditions (242% [95% CI, 222%-262%]), Medicare beneficiaries (228% [95% CI, 214%-243%]), and military-insured adults (139% [95% CI, 108%-171%]). Mail-order prescriptions were commonly filled for analgesics, levothyroxine, cardiovascular agents, antibiotics, and diabetes medications. INTERPRETATION. The use of mail-order prescription, including for critical medications such as insulin, is increasingly common among U.S. adults and displays substantial variation between population groups. A national slowdown of mail delivery could have important health consequences for a considerable proportion of the U.S. population, particularly during the current Coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic.","output":"Trends in Mail-Order Prescription Use among U.S. Adults from 1996 to 2018: A Nationally Representative Repeated Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rise of aquaculture has been one of the most profound changes in global food production of the past 100 years. Driven by population growth, rising demand for seafood and a levelling of production from capture fisheries, the practice of farming aquatic animals has expanded rapidly to become a major global industry. Aquaculture is now integral to the economies of many countries. It has provided employment and been a major driver of socio-economic development in poor rural and coastal communities, particularly in Asia, and has relieved pressure on the sustainability of the natural harvest from our rivers, lakes and oceans. However, the rapid growth of aquaculture has also been the source of anthropogenic change on a massive scale. Aquatic animals have been displaced from their natural environment, cultured in high density, exposed to environmental stress, provided artificial or unnatural feeds, and a prolific global trade has developed in both live aquatic animals and their products. At the same time, over-exploitation of fisheries and anthropogenic stress on aquatic ecosystems has placed pressure on wild fish populations. Not surprisingly, the consequence has been the emergence and spread of an increasing array of new diseases. This review examines the rise and characteristics of aquaculture, the major viral pathogens of fish and shrimp and their impacts, and the particular characteristics of disease emergence in an aquatic, rather than terrestrial, context.

Few studies have evaluated how mode of delivery affects clinical professional behavior change and none have assessed the feasibility of such an initiative at a national scale. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the effect of audit and feedback by digital versus postal (letter) mode of delivery on primary care physician behavior. METHODS: This study was developed as part of the Veterans Medicines Advice and Therapeutics Education Services (MATES) program, an intervention funded by the Australian Government Department of Veterans Affairs that provides targeted education and patient-specific audit with feedback to Australian general practitioners, as well as educational material to veterans and other health professionals. We performed a cluster randomized controlled trial of a multifaceted intervention to reduce inappropriate gabapentinoid prescription, comparing digital and postal mode of delivery. All veteran patients targeted also received an educational intervention (postal delivery). Efficacy was measured using a linear mixed-effects model as the average number of gabapentinoid prescriptions standardized by defined daily dose (individual level), and number of veterans visiting a psychologist in the 6 and 12 months following the intervention. RESULTS: The trial involved 2552 general practitioners in Australia and took place in March 2020. Both intervention groups had a significant reduction in total gabapentinoid prescription by the end of the study period (digital: mean reduction of 11.2%, P=.004; postal: mean reduction of 11.2%, P=.001). We found no difference between digital and postal mode of delivery in reduction of gabapentinoid prescriptions at 12 months (digital: C0.058, postal: C0.058, P=.98).

After propensity-score matching for demographics, socio-economic determinants of health, comorbidities and medications, risks for severe clinical outcomes in the Omicron cohort were significantly lower than those in the Delta cohort: ED visits: 18.83% vs. 26.67% (risk ratio or RR: 0.71 [0.66-0.75]); hospitalizations: 1.04% vs. 3.14% (RR: 0.33 [0.26-0.43]); ICU admissions: 0.14% vs. 0.43% (RR: 0.32 [0.16-0.66]); mechanical ventilation: 0.33% vs. 1.15% (RR: 0.29 [0.18-0.46]). Control studies comparing Delta-2 to Delta cohorts show no difference. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: For children under age 5, first time SARS-CoV-2 infections occurring when the Omicron predominated (prevalence >92%) was associated with significantly less severe outcomes than first-time infections in similar children when the Delta variant predominated.","output":"COVID infection severity in children under 5 years old before and after Omicron emergence in the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A trial to assess whether a BCG vaccination could help reduce the impact of COVID-19 is recruiting front-line nurses in the UK","output":"Trial tests BCG vaccine against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Electrocatalytic water splitting is a promising technology for large-scale hydrogen production.

Due to the strong interfacial interaction, the interfacial electrons transfer from Co sites to S sites, which promote the adsorption of oxygen-containing intermediates, water molecules, as well as the dissociation of water molecules. Therefore, the heterostructure catalyst exhibits low overpotentials of 195 mV for OER and 165 mV for HER at 10 mA cm-2, respectively. Moreover, it only needs 1.6 V to realize water splitting at 10 mA cm-2 in a two-electrode cell.

The physical description of RaTG13 is not available and at present only RaTG13 genome is available on the public database. Since RaTG13 is one of the main supports for SARS-COV-2 to have a natural origin, it is of utmost importance to understand the origin of this virus/ the exact sample from which the genome was sequenced. Here we have tried to investigate the origin of the sample from which RaTG13 would have been sequenced and its phylogenetic relationship to the previously described bat corona viruses. The genome of RaTG13 was sequenced from RNA of a bat fecal swab collected in 2013 from Yunnan, China. RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of RaTG13 shows that it is 100% similar to that of bat corona virus BtCoV/4991 also described by Dr. Zhengli Shi and her group in 2016 2. BtCoV/4991 was described to be a SARS-like (SL-) corona virus from bat feces sampled in an abandoned mine from Mojiang. These facts increase the possibility that RaTG13 could be the same as BtCoV/4991, based on the RdRp sequence similarities and similarities in sample collection dates and regions. RaTG13 RNA sample could have originated from the bat feces collected from an abandoned mineshaft in Mojiang. In 2012, this mineshaft reported deaths of three miners due to pneumonia and the exact etiological reason remained unknown. Paramyxoviruses were detected in the rats of this mineshaft and in general, the conditions were filthy with bat feces covered with fungi, etc. Dr. Zhengli Shi and her coworkers studied 276 bats fecal/anal swab samples from which a single SL-corona virus was detected, and this was BtCoV/4991.

(1) Start with a platform based on live viruses that infect bacteria, but not humans (bacteriophages, or phages). (2) Isolate phages (to be called pathogen homologs) that resemble and provide antigenic context for membrane-covered, pathogenic RNA viruses; coronavirus-phage homologs will probably be found if the search is correctly done. (3) Upon isolating a viral pathogen, evolve its phage homolog to bind antibodies neutralizing for the viral pathogen. Vaccinate with the evolved phage homolog by generating a local, non-hazardous infection with the phage host and then curing the infection by propagating the phage in the artificially infecting bacterial host.

METHODS: The TB incidence from January 2006 to December 2017 was obtained, and then the time series was partitioned into training subsamples (from January 2006 to December 2016) and testing subsamples (from January to December 2017). Among them, the training set was used to develop the EEMD-SARIMA-NARNN combined model, whereas the testing set was used to validate the forecasting performance of the model. Whilst the forecasting accuracy level of this novel method was compared with the basic SARIMA model, basic NARNN model, error-trend-seasonal (ETS) model, and traditional SARIMA-NARNN mixture model. RESULTS: By comparing the accuracy level of the forecasting measurements including root-mean-square error, mean absolute deviation, mean error rate, mean absolute percentage error, and root-mean-square percentage error, it was shown that the EEMD-SARIMA-NARNN combined method produced lower error rates than the others. The descriptive statistics suggested that TB was a seasonal disease, peaking in late winter and early spring and a trough in autumn and early winter, and the TB epidemic indicated a drastic increase by a factor of 1.7 from 2006 to 2017 in Tibet, with average annual percentage change of 5.8 (95% confidence intervals: 3.5C8.1). CONCLUSION: This novel data-driven hybrid method can better consider both linear and nonlinear components in the TB incidence than the others used in this study, which is of great help to estimate and forecast the future epidemic trends of TB in Tibet.

Historically, the group of human coronaviruses can also affect the central nervous system leading to neurological symptoms; however, the causative mechanisms of the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 disease are not well known. Seizures have not been directly reported as a part of COVID-19 outside of patients with previously known brain injury or epilepsy. We report two cases of acute symptomatic seizures, in non-epileptic patients, associated with severe COVID-19 disease. CASE PRESENTATIONS: Two advanced-age, non-epileptic, male patients presented to our northeast Ohio-based health system with concern for infection in Mid-March 2020. Both had a history of lung disease and during their hospitalization tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. They developed acute encephalopathy days into their hospitalization with clinical and electrographic seizures. Resolution of seizures was achieved with levetiracetam. DISCUSSION: Patients with COVID-19 disease are at an elevated risk for seizures, and the mechanism of these seizures is likely multifactorial. Clinical (motor) seizures may not be readily detected in this population due to the expansive utilization of sedatives and paralytics for respiratory optimization strategies. Many of these patients are also not electrographically monitored for seizures due to limited resources, multifactorial risk for acute encephalopathy, and the risk of cross-contamination. Previously, several neurological symptoms were seen in patients with more advanced COVID-19 disease, and these were thought to be secondary to multi-system organ failure and/or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy-related brain injury. However, these patients may also have an advanced breakdown of the bloodCbrain barrier precipitated by pro-inflammatory cytokine reactions. The neurotropic effect and neuroinvasiveness of SARS-Coronavirus-2 have not been directly established. CONCLUSIONS: Acute symptomatic seizures are possible in patients with COVID-19 disease. These seizures are likely multifactorial in origin, including cortical irritation due to bloodCbrain barrier breakdown, precipitated by the cytokine reaction as a part of the viral infection. Patients with clinical signs of seizures or otherwise unexplained encephalopathy may benefit from electroencephalography monitoring and/or empiric anti-epileptic therapy. Further studies are needed to elucidate the risk of seizures and benefit of monitoring in this population.","output":"Acute Symptomatic Seizures in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19: Is There an Association?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Messenger RNA (mRNA) based vaccines (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna) are highly effective at providing immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Here we performed a prospective pilot study of 71 previously COVID-19 free subjects upon receiving both doses of either the Pfizer (n = 54) or Moderna (n = 17) mRNA vaccine. Anti-spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG antibodies were measured longitudinally using a qualitative finger stick MidaSpot rapid test at the point-of-care for initial screening and a quantitative dry blood spot-based pGOLD laboratory test over [~] four months post-vaccination. The average anti-RBD IgG antibody levels peaked at [~] two weeks after the second dose of the vaccine and declined thereafter, while antibody avidity increased, suggesting antibody maturation.

However, there are clear variations in uptake and acceptability, and concerns that digital exclusion may exacerbate previous inequalities in accessing good quality care. Greater understanding is needed of how service users experience telemental health, and what determines whether they engage and find it acceptable. Methods We conducted a collaborative framework analysis of data from semi-structured interviews with a sample of people already experiencing mental health problems prior to the pandemic. Data relevant to participants' experiences and views regarding telemental health during the pandemic was identified and extracted. Data collection and analysis used a participatory, coproduction approach where lived experience researchers, clinical and academic researchers contributed to all stages of data collection, analysis and interpretation of findings. Findings Participants' experiences and preferences regarding telemental health care were dynamic and varied across time, settings, and individuals. Participants' preferences were shaped by the reason for contacting providers, their relationship with the care provider, and both parties' access or acceptability to use remote technology. While face-to-face care tended to be the preferred option, participants identified benefits of remote care including making care more accessible for some populations and improved efficiency for functional appointments such as prescription reviews. Participants highlighted important new challenges around safety and privacy in online settings, and gave examples of good remote care strategies, including scheduling regular phone calls and developing guidelines about how to access remote care tools. Discussion Participants in our study and previous literature have highlighted advantages of telemental health care, as well as significant limitations which hinder mental health support and exacerbate inequalities in access to services. Some of these limitations are seen as potentially removable, for example through staff training or better digital access for staff or service users. Others indicate a need to maintain traditional face-to-face contact at least for some appointments. There is a clear need for care to be flexible and individualised to service user circumstances and preferences.

Our state, Bihar reported its first confirmed case of covid on 22nd march 2020 at AIIMS Patna. For safety, Electives surgeries and outpatient department was suspended temporary since 25th March. Standard operating procedure (SOP) was framed for covid suspected, covid positive and negative patients. Neurosurgery department formulated their own strategy for successful and covid free management of neurosurgical patients along with zero transmission rate among doctors and staff. Methods: All Neurosurgical patients who got attended, admitted and operated from 25th March to 30th June 2020 (Period of lockdown) were taken in this study. Categorizations of the patients were done according to the urgency and elective nature of pathology after corona screening and RT-PCR testing of covid-19. A proper training to all neurosurgical staff and residents were given for management of patients (admission to operation to discharge). Results: Total 133 patients were attended and 90 were admitted. We operated 76 cases (major -52, minor - 24) during the lockdown period. Out of this 2 were corona positive (both eventually succumbed) and rest 74 was corona negative. One patient who was operated with corona negative report became positive after 10 days of surgery inward. All the residents, faculty and nursing staff remain asymptomatic throughout the lockdown period with zero infection rate and zero transmission rate . Conclusion: Following a properly made standard operating procedure and strictly implementing it can avoid any type of misadventure in neurosurgery during corona pandemic. Key message: Adequate planning and sufficient training is necessary to avoid any untoward incident of infection.

Methods. Nine hundred eighty-one samples from 196 repeat CCP donors 0-119 days post-initial donation (DPID) were analyzed. Neutralizing capacity was assessed for 50% (PRNT50) and 90% (PRNT90) reduction of infectious virus using the gold standard plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). A subset of 91 donations was evaluated by OVSARS2IgG and compared to PRNT titers for diagnostic accuracy. Results. Of donations, 32.7%/79.5% (PRNT90/PRNT50) met a 1:80 titer initially but only 14.0%/48.8% (PRNT90/PRNT50) met this cutoff &gt;= 85 DPID. Correlation of OVSARS2IgG results to neutralizing capacity allowed extrapolation to CCP therapy results. CCP with OVSARS2IgG ratios equivalent to a therapeutically beneficial group had neutralizing titers of &gt;= 1:640 (PRNT50) and/or &gt;= 1:80 (PRNT90).

The activity was influenced, possibly indirectly, by the length of prior treatment of infected cells with actinomycin D; however, 6 g/ml actinomycin D and 10?5 M -amanitin in the RDRP assay had no effect. The replication complex was membrane-bound and Mg2+ was essential for RDRP activity. Incorporation was more dependent on exogenous UTP and GTP than ATP or CTP. The specific activity was low, and rate of incorporation of GMP decreased as the period of assay was increased; however, incorporation of label lasted for at least 60 min. RNA products were fractionated by LiCl precipitation, and kinetic studies showed that the sequence of accumulation of label was the same as that observed in vivo, viz., RI  RF  44 S RNA; limited reinitiation was also observed. This sequence of labeling also indicated that the in vitro RDRP activity was due to an enzyme capable of elongation, release, and reinitiation of Kunjin RNA synthesis and not merely end labeling or elongating preexisting RNA molecules. No labeled bands in urea-polyacrylamide gels were observed using extracts from mock-infected cells and hence the three RNA products of assays were readily identified in a single gel. The replication complex was still active after treatment with nonionic detergent, but no labeled 44 S RNA was detected in gels, even in the presence of RNasin in the assay which inhibited some nuclease activity. Antibodies to flavivirus-specific nonstructural proteins were preincubated with infected cell extracts in the presence and absence of detergent but no inhibition of RDRP activity was observed.

Yet many epidemiological models currently in use do not include a behavioral component, and do not address the potential consequences of risk misperception. To study the impact of behavioral adaptations to the perceived infection risk, we use a mathematical model that incorporates individuals' behavioral decisions based on a projection of the future system's state over a finite planning horizon. We found that individuals' risk misperception in the presence of asymptomatic individuals may increase or reduce the final epidemic size.

Methods This cohort study included children and adolescents evaluated in a network of clinics in Rhode Island. Participants were age-stratified: 0-4, 5-11, and 12-17 years. We estimated the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of individual symptoms and three symptom combinations: a probable case definition published by the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH), and two novel combinations generated by different statistical approaches to maximize sensitivity and AUC. We evaluated the test characteristics of symptom combinations both with and without consideration of COVID-19 exposure. Results Two-hundred seventeen (39.1%) of 555 participants were SARS-CoV-2-infected. Fever was more common among 0-4 years-olds (p=0.002); older children more frequently reported fatigue (p=0.02) and anosmia or ageusia (p=0.047). In children >5 years old, anosmia or ageusia had 94-98% specificity. In all age groups, exposure history most accurately predicted infection.

However, for the treatment and diagnosis of various lung diseases, such as pneumonia, asthma, cancer, and pulmonary tuberculosis, are becoming increasingly challenging. Currently, several types of treatments and/or diagnostic methods are used to treat lung diseases; however, the occurrence of adverse reactions to chemotherapy, drug-resistant bacteria, side effects that can be significantly toxic, and poor drug delivery necessitates the development of more promising treatments. Nanotechnology, as an emerging technology, has been extensively studied in medicine. Several studies have shown that nano-delivery systems can significantly enhance the targeting of drug delivery. When compared to traditional delivery methods, several nanoparticle delivery strategies are used to improve the detection methods and drug treatment efficacy. Transporting nanoparticles to the lungs, loading appropriate therapeutic drugs, and the incorporation of intelligent functions to overcome various lung barriers have broad prospects as they can aid in locating target tissues and can enhance the therapeutic effect while minimizing systemic side effects. In addition, as a new and highly contagious respiratory infection disease, COVID-19 is spreading worldwide. However, there is no specific drug for COVID-19. Clinical trials are being conducted in several countries to develop antiviral drugs or vaccines. In recent years, nanotechnology has provided a feasible platform for improving the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, nanotechnology-based strategies may have broad prospects in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.

These restrictions hinder the reproducibility of existing results based on private healthcare data and also limit new research. Synthetically-generated healthcare data solve this problem by preserving privacy and enabling researchers and policymakers to drive decisions and methods based on realistic data. Healthcare data can include information about multiple in- and out- patient visits of patients, making it a time-series dataset which is often influenced by protected attributes like age, gender, race etc. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated health inequities, with certain subgroups experiencing poorer outcomes and less access to healthcare. To combat these inequities, synthetic data must fairly represent diverse minority subgroups such that the conclusions drawn on synthetic data are correct and the results can be generalized to real data. In this article, we develop two fairness metrics for synthetic data, and analyze all subgroups defined by protected attributes to analyze the bias in three published synthetic research datasets. These covariate-level disparity metrics revealed that synthetic data may not be representative at the univariate and multivariate subgroup-levels and thus, fairness should be addressed when developing data generation methods.

DESIGN: Prospective randomized study in which each patient served as his/her own control. SETTING: Multidisciplinary neonatal and pediatric ICU. PATIENTS: 8 ventilator dependent premature infants with CLD. INTERVENTIONS: Salbutamol, 10 g/kg was given intravenously, and 10C19 h later, twice 100 g as pressurized aerosol, or vice versa, sequence randomized. The pressurized aerosol was delivered by a metered dose inhaler into a newly developed aerosol holding chamber, integrated into the inspiratory limb of the patient circuit. Respiratory system mechanics were assessed by the single breath occlusion method before and 10 and 60 min after drug administration. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Compliance improved significantly after intravenous injection (0.480.18 to 0.670.16, p<0.01 and 0.590.23 ml/cmH(2)O/kg, NS, (mean1 SD) and after inhalation (0.460.19 to 0.640.32,p<0.01 and 0.560.31 ml/cmH(2)O/kg, NS).

Its purported mode of action is as an immune modulator. Vitamin D, however, also affects the metabolism of phosphate and Mg, which may well play a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 may induce a cytokine storm that drains ATP whose regeneration requires phosphate and Mg. These minerals, however, are often deficient in conditions that predispose people to severe COVID-19, including older age (especially males), diabetes, obesity, and usage of diuretics. Symptoms observed in severe COVID-19 also fit well with those seen in classical hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia, such as thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, dysfunction of liver and kidneys, neurologic disturbances, immunodeficiency, failure of heart and lungs, delayed weaning from a respirator, cardiac arrhythmia, seizures, and, finally, multiorgan failure. Deficiencies of phosphate and Mg can be amplified by kidney problems commonly observed in patients with COVID-19 resulting in their wastage into urine. Available data show that phosphate and Mg are deficient in COVID-19, with phosphate showing a remarkable correlation with its severity. In one experiment, patients with COVID-19 were supplemented with a cocktail of vitamin D3, Mg, and vitamin B12, with very encouraging results. We, thus, argue that patients with COVID-19 should be monitored and treated for phosphate and Mg deficiencies, ideally already in the early phases of infection.

We argue that diversification can involve products, services and markets and it can take place at a geographic level (macro), community level (meso) and enterprise (micro) levels. This hierarchisation provides possibilities for diversification. The outbreak of COVID-19 has encumbered the growth and viability of tourism enterprises but may open new pathways through which firms can respond to its negative effects. Using secondary information available in extant literature, the article unpacks the impact of COVID-19 on four African countries to analyse the impacts and the mitigatory interventions that were implemented. The conducted study found out that Small Micro and Medium Enterprises were hard hit by the Corona virus such that jobs and incomes were lost with the possibility that some may firms may never open again given the inability to trade during lockdowns imposed by governments in response to the pandemic and inability to pay rent and debt.

This article examines how the constitution-making process can become a reconciliatory constitution-making process in two cases: Tunisia and Egypt. These two cases differ in terms of the success of the constitution-making process in solving political disputes. In Tunisia, the constitution-making process contributed to a great extent to the reduction of disputes and conflicts and the achieving reconciliation. However, the constitution-making process in the Egyptian case did not succeed in this matter. It even caused a battle between the different groups regarding the establishment of the new constitution.","output":"Constitution-Making, Political Transition and Reconcilation in Tunisia and Egypt: A Comparative Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Travel interests of tourists during pandemics and outbreaks are reduced due to the prevalence of fear. It induces lifestyle changes, which may hinder efforts to recover the tourism value chain during post-COVID-19 lockdowns. Subscribing to domestic travel and domestic tourism is deemed to mitigate fear and gradually reopen the tourism industry. Although a crucial initiative, evaluating the perceived degree of exposure of tourists to COVID-19 in tourist sites operating under domestic tourism has not been fully explored in the emerging literature, which forms the main departure of this work. Design/methodology/approach The problem domain is addressed by adopting multiple criteria sorting method - the VIKORSORT. To demonstrate such application, with 221 survey participants, 35 tourist sites in a province in the central Philippines struggling to revive the tourism industry are evaluated under six attributes that characterize tourists' exposure to COVID-19. To assess its efficacy, the performance of the VIKORSORT is compared to other distance-based multiple criteria sorting methods (i.e. TOPSIS-Sort and CODAS-SORT). Findings Results show that proximity and volume of tourist arrivals are considered on top of the priority list of attributes. The use of VIKORSORT yields the assignment of 27 sites to the \\"moderate exposure\\" class, and eight under the \\"high exposure\\" class, with no tourist site assigned to the \\"low exposure\\" class. Sorting the tourist sites reveals some observations that tourists prefer sites (1) with open spaces, (2) with activities having limited group dynamics, (3) that are nature-based, and (4) with tourist arrivals that are not relatively high, with enough land area to practice social distancing. In addition, the assignments of the VIKORSORT with TOPSIS-Sort and CODAS-SORT are consistent at least 90% of the time, demonstrating its efficacy in addressing multiple criteria sorting problems. Originality/value This work provides an integrative approach in evaluating tourist sites in view of tourism recovery during pandemics. The findings offer crucial insights for the primary stakeholders (i.e. government, tourist operators, and tourists) in planning, resource allocation decisions, and policy formulation. Policy insights are offered, as well as avenues for future works.","output":"Multiple criteria sorting of tourist sites for perceived COVID-19 exposure: the use of VIKORSORT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection are common opportunistic infections among renal transplantation (RT) recipients, and both can increase the risk of graft loss and patient mortality after RT. However, few studies had evaluated PJP and CMV co-infection, especially among RT patients. Therefore, this study was performed to evaluate the impact of CMV co-infection with PJP among RT recipients. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of patients with confirmed diagnosis of PJP between 2015 and 2021 in our hospital. We divided patients into PJP and PJP+CMV groups according to their CMV infection status, and the clinical severity and outcomes of the two groups were evaluated. Results: A total of 80 patients after RT were diagnosed with PJP. Of these, 37 (46.2%) patients had co-existing CMV viremia. There were no statistically significant intergroup differences in age, sex, diabetes, onset time of PJP after RT and postoperative immunosuppressant. Compared to serum creatinine (Cr) at admission, the serum Cr at discharge in both the PJP and PJP+CMV groups were decreased. The PJP+CMV group had a higher C-reactive protein level, higher procalcitonin level, and lower albumin level than the PJP group. The PJP+CMV group showed a higher PSI score than the PJP group. Moreover, the initial absorption time of the lesion was longer in the PJP+CMV group. However, the duration of hospitalization showed no significant differences between the two groups. The mortality rate was 9.4-times higher in the PJP+CMV group than in the PJP group. The rate of admittance to the intensive care unit was 3.2-times higher in the PJP+CMV group than in the PJP group. Conclusion: CMV co-infection may result in more serious inflammatory response. RT patients with PJP+CMV infection had more severe clinical symptoms, slower recovery from pneumonia, and higher mortality than those with PJP alone. Therefore, when RT patients present with severe PJP, the possibility of CMV co-infection should be considered. Short-term withdrawal of immunosuppressants in case of severe infection is safe for the renal function of RT patients.","output":"Clinical Manifestations and Outcomes of Renal Transplantation Patients With Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia and Cytomegalovirus Co-infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract As the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 caused COVID-19 cases in the United States the initial test was developed and performed at the Center for Disease Control (CDC). As the number of cases increased the demand for tests multiplied, leading the CDC to utilize the Emergency Utilization Authorization to allow clinical and commercial laboratories to develop tests to detect the presence of the virus. Many nucleic acid tests based on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were developed, each with different techniques, specifications and turnaround time. As the illnesses turned into a pandemic, testing became more crucial. The test supply became inadequate to meet the need that it had to be prioritized according to guidance. For surveillance, the need for serologic tests emerged. Here we review the timeline of test development, the turn-around times, the various approved tests and compare them as regards the genes they detect. We concentrate on the point-of-care tests and discuss the basis for new serologic tests. We discuss the testing guidance for prioritization and their application in a hospital setting. As SARS-CoV-2 virus arrived in the USA causing the COVID-19 illness, one of the most talked about issues in the management of the disease and the resulting pandemic has been clinical testing. A unique situation arose of a communicable and highly contagious disease necessitating the rapid diagnosis of patients and the identification of non-symptomatic infected persons. Unfortunately, the USA did not have a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved laboratory test for the illness. The FDA ultimately utilized its Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) on February 4, 2020 to allow for more rapid and widespread development and implementation of in-vitro testing.1 Indeed, companies and organizations utilized the EUA to file applications for new tests based on different methodologies, amounting to 48 applications in the span of 3 months from the beginning of February to the end of April 2020. In addition, multiple other tests were put in place under a separate authorization by a Presidential memorandum in early March allowing laboratories that carry Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) certification to put tests in place without an EUA from the FDA. This created an unprecedented situation where the medical community and the public may not be familiar with the various new tests for COVID-19 that are offered to patients and hospitals. The purpose of this review is to provide information, up-to-date as of the date of submission of the manuscript to the journal, on the various tests that have been developed, their scientific basis and their interpretation. We give a real-world example demonstrating the time lag in the return of test results and review testing prioritization guidance since the supply of tests remains below the perceived need.","output":"Clinical Testing For Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of large-scale circulation on the flow field in a cabin mockup.

Objective To assess the cost-effectiveness of OUD treatments and association of these treatments with outcomes in the US. Design and Setting This model-based cost-effectiveness analysis included a US population with OUD. Interventions Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with buprenorphine, methadone, or injectable extended-release naltrexone; psychotherapy (beyond standard counseling); overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND); and contingency management (CM). Main Outcomes and Measures Fatal and nonfatal overdoses and deaths throughout 5 years, discounted lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs. Results In the base case, in the absence of treatment, 42 717 overdoses (4132 fatal, 38 585 nonfatal) and 12 660 deaths were estimated to occur in a cohort of 100 000 patients over 5 years, and 11.58 discounted lifetime QALYs were estimated to be experienced per person. An estimated reduction in overdoses was associated with MAT with methadone (10.7%), MAT with buprenorphine or naltrexone (22.0%), and when combined with CM and psychotherapy (range, 21.0%-31.4%). Estimated deceased deaths were associated with MAT with methadone (6%), MAT with buprenorphine or naltrexone (13.9%), and when combined with CM, OEND, and psychotherapy (16.9%). MAT yielded discounted gains of 1.02 to 1.07 QALYs per person. Including only health care sector costs, methadone cost $16 000/QALY gained compared with no treatment, followed by methadone with OEND ($22 000/QALY gained), then by buprenorphine with OEND and CM ($42 000/QALY gained), and then by buprenorphine with OEND, CM, and psychotherapy ($250 000/QALY gained). MAT with naltrexone was dominated by other treatment alternatives. When criminal justice costs were included, all forms of MAT (with buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone) were associated with cost savings compared with no treatment, yielding savings of $25 000 to $105 000 in lifetime costs per person. The largest cost savings were associated with methadone plus CM. Results were qualitatively unchanged over a wide range of sensitivity analyses. An analysis using demographic and cost data for Veterans Health Administration patients yielded similar findings. Conclusions and Relevance In this cost-effectiveness analysis, expanded access to MAT, combined with OEND and CM, was associated with cost-saving reductions in morbidity and mortality from OUD. Lack of widespread MAT availability limits access to a cost-saving medical intervention that reduces morbidity and mortality from OUD. Opioid overdoses in the US likely reached a record high in 2020 because of COVID-19 increasing substance use, exacerbating stress and social isolation, and interfering with opioid treatment. It is essential to understand the cost-effectiveness of alternative forms of MAT to treat OUD.","output":"Cost-effectiveness of Treatments for Opioid Use Disorder."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A key challenge for designing hybrid materials is the development of chemical tools to control the organization of inorganic nanoobjects at low scales, from mesoscopic (~m) to nanometric (~nm). So far, the most efficient strategy to align assemblies of nanoparticles consists in a bottom-up approach by decorating block copolymer lamellae with nanoobjects. This well accomplished procedure is nonetheless limited by the thermodynamic constraints that govern copolymer assembly, the entropy of mixing as described by the Flory-Huggins solution theory supplemented by the critical influence of the volume fraction of the block components. Here we show that a completely different approach can lead to tunable 2D lamellar organization of nanoparticles with homopolymers only, on condition that few elementary rules are respected: 1) the polymer spontaneously allows a structural preorganization, 2) the polymer owns functional groups that interact with the nanoparticle surface, 3) the nanoparticles show a surface accessible for coordination.","output":"Bidimensional lamellar assembly by coordination of peptidic homopolymers to platinum nanoparticles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: Smoking electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) is increasing in popularity, but little information is available as to the biologic consequences to the cell populations impacted by the e-cigarette smoke.

Methods: Oral biopsies of n = 23 healthy nonsmoker controls and n= 24 healthy e-cigarette smokers (e-cigarette smokers for an average of 2.01.0 years) matched for age, gender, and ethnicity were compared based on pathology and RNA transcriptome (mRNA and miRNA) using Illumina Hi-Seq 2000 sequencing. The mRNA data were assessed in e-cigarette smokers compared to nonsmokers genome-wide (n = 19,724): genes previously identified as significantly dysregulated in the oral epithelium of e-cigarette smokers vs. nonsmokers (n = 758);genes previously identified as significantly dysregulated in the small airway epithelium of nonsmokers following an acute exposure to e-cigarettes (n = 71);and genes related to the initial steps of COVID-19 infection, including ACE2, the COVID-19 receptor (n = 9). The miRNA of e-cigarette smokers and nonsmokers was compared on a genome-wide basis (n = 1,100 mature and human miRNAs). All comparisons were performed using ANOVA, Benajmini-Hochberg corrected. P value <.05 was considered significant. Results: The morphology of the epithelium and lamina propria in e-cigarette smokers was normal, with no thickening of the epithelium, dysplasia, basilar hyperplasia, dyskeratosis, and no abnormal vascularity or inflammatory infiltration. The basilar layer in e-cigarette smokers appeared normal, with normal mitotic activity and no nuclear pleomorphism. Assessment of the transcriptome, both on mRNA and miRNA levels, based on all gene lists did not identify any genes significantly modified in the oral epithelium of e-cigarette smokers compared to nonsmokers.

NSPs are growing in popularity, however little is known regarding the public health risks. A screening level risk assessment was undertaken as an initial step in assessing the first Canadian public NSP located in Edmonton, Alberta. Risk of enteric pathogens originating from pool bathers was assessed under normal conditions and following accidental faecal release events. The performance of the natural treatment train for health protection was quantified with and without the addition of UV disinfection of naturally-treated water, and compared to the US EPA benchmark to provide a reference point to consider acceptability. Estimated levels of pathogen contamination of the pond was dependent upon the discrete number of shedders present, which in turn depended upon the prevalence of infection in the population. Overall performance of the natural disinfection system was dependent upon the filtration rate of the natural treatment system or turnover time. Addition of UV disinfection reduced the uncertainty around the removal efficacy, and mitigated the impact of larger shedding events, however the impact of UV disinfection on the natural treatment biome is unknown. Further information is needed on the performance of natural barriers for pathogen removal, and therefore challenge studies are recommended. Given the identified risks, the pool is posted that there is risk from accidental faecal releases, as in any natural water body with swimmers.

Standard noninvasive bilevel positive airway pressure devices with spontaneous and timed respirations (bilevel PAP ST) could provide invasive ventilation but evidence on their effectiveness in this capacity is limited. We sought to evaluate the ability of bilevel PAP ST to effect gas exchange via invasive ventilation in a healthy swine model. METHODS: Two single limb respiratory circuits with passive filtered exhalation were constructed and evaluated. Next, two bilevel PAP ST devices, designed for sleep laboratory and home use, were tested on an intubated healthy swine model using these circuits. These devices were compared to an anesthesia ventilator. RESULTS: We evaluated respiratory mechanics, minute ventilation, oxygenation, and presence of rebreathing for all of these devices. Both bilevel PAP ST devices were able to control the measured parameters. There were noted differences in performance between the two devices. Despite these differences, both devices provided effective invasive ventilation by controlling minute ventilation and providing adequate oxygenation in the animal model. CONCLUSIONS: Commercially available bilevel PAP ST can provide invasive ventilation with a single limb respiratory circuit and in-line filters to control oxygenation and ventilation without significant rebreathing in a swine model. Further study is needed to evaluate safety and efficacy in clinical disease models. In the setting of a ventilator shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in other resource-constrained situations, these devices may be considered as an effective alternative means for invasive ventilation.","output":"Invasive mechanical ventilation using a bilevel PAP ST device in a healthy swine model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are concerns regarding the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from mother to child during this COVID pandemic.

In an attempt to understand the demand and main drivers of telemedicine abortion, we analysed the requests that Women on Web (WoW), an online telemedicine abortion service operating worldwide, received from France throughout 2020. Methods: We conducted a parallel convergent mixed-method study among 809 consultations received from France at WoW between 1 January and 31 December 2020. We performed a cross-sectional study of data obtained from the WoW consultation survey and a manifest content analysis of anonymised email correspondence of 140 women consulting with WoW helpdesk from France. Results: We found that women encounter macro-level, individual-level, and provider-level constraints while trying to access abortion in France. The preferences and needs over secrecy (46.2%), privacy (38.3%), and comfort (34.9%) are among the most frequent reasons for women from France to choose telemedicine abortion through WoW. The COVID-19 pandemic seems to be an important driver for resorting to telemedicine (30.6%). The lockdowns seem to have had an impact on the number of consultations received at WoW from France, increasing from 60 in March to 128 in April during the first lockdown and from 54 in October to 80 in November during the second lockdown. Conclusions: The demand for at-home medical abortion via teleconsultation increased in France during the lockdowns. However, drivers of telemedicine abortion are multi-dimensional and go beyond the conditions unique to the pandemic. Given the various constraints women continue to encounter in accessing safe abortion, telemedicine can help meet womens preferences and needs for secrecy, privacy and comfort, while facilitating improved access to and enabling more person-centred abortion care.","output":"Why Women Choose At-Home Abortion via Teleconsultation in France?: A Mixed-Method Study on Drivers of Telemedicine Abortion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Exacerbations of childhood asthma and rhinovirus infections both peak during the spring and fall, suggesting that viral infections are major contributors to seasonal asthma morbidity. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate rhinovirus infections during peak seasons in children with asthma, and to analyze relationships between viral infection and illness severity. METHODS: Fifty-eight children with asthma ages 6-8 years provided 5 consecutive weekly nasal lavage samples during September and April; symptoms, medication use, and peak flow were recorded. Rhinoviruses were identified using multiplex PCR and partial sequencing of viral genomes. RESULTS: Viruses were detected in 36-50% of the specimens, and, 72-99% of the viruses were rhinoviruses. There were 52 different strains (including 16 HRV-C) among the 169 rhinovirus isolates; no strains found in more than two collection periods, and all but two children had a respiratory infection. Virus-positive weeks were associated with greater cold and asthma severity (p<0.0001 and p=0.0002 respectively). Furthermore, virus-positive illnesses had increased duration and severity of cold and asthma symptoms, and more frequent loss of asthma control (47% vs. 22%, p=0.008). While allergen-sensitized vs. non-sensitized children had the same number of viral infections, the former had 47% more symptomatic viral illnesses (1.19 vs. 0.81 per month, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Rhinovirus infections are nearly universal in children with asthma during common cold seasons, likely due to a plethora of new strains appearing each season. Illnesses associated with viruses have greater duration and severity. Finally, atopic asthmatic children experienced more frequent and severe viral-induced illnesses.

In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted by web conference with 13 dyads of adults who were in an ICU for COVID-19 between March and August 2020 and their primary caregiver (n=26). Participants were interviewed about the care recipients hospitalization and recovery journey, supports received, challenges experienced, and gaps in the system of care. Thematic qualitative analysis was conducted utilizing Watkins (2017) rigorous and accelerated data reduction (RADaR) technique. Caregivers played a critical role in patient admission, discharge, and recovery. Themes of caregiving challenges included self-management of COVID-19 infection, knowledge deficits of available resources and post-discharge care needs, post-infection stigma, separation guilt, deprioritized self-care, financial challenges, and lengthy recoveries with some ongoing health needs. While receipt of emotional support was considered an advantage, some caregivers expressed contact fatigue. Understanding how COVID caregivers experience illness management across the recovery journey can aid our understanding of the COVID caregiving process and identify intervention targets to improve overall health and well-being of the care dyad.","output":"Family Caregivers on the Frontline: Challenges of Providing Care to Post-ICU COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused the Academic Leadership Fellows Program to shift to a virtual format for Cohort 17.

Clomiphene is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug that blocks EBOV entry and infection in cells and significantly protects EBOV-challenged mice. As provided, clomiphene is, approximately, a 60:40 mixture of two stereoisomers, enclomiphene and zuclomiphene. The pharmacokinetic properties of the two isomers vary, but both accumulate in the eye and male reproductive tract, tissues in which EBOV can persist. Here we compared the ability of clomiphene and its isomers to inhibit EBOV using viral-like particle (VLP) entry and transcription/replication-competent VLP (trVLP) assays. Clomiphene and its isomers inhibited the entry and infection of VLPs and trVLPs with similar potencies. This was demonstrated with VLPs bearing the glycoproteins from three filoviruses (EBOV Mayinga, EBOV Makona, and Marburg virus) and in two cell lines (293T/17 and Vero E6). Visual problems have been noted in EBOV survivors, and viral RNA has been isolated from semen up to nine months post-infection. Since the clomiphene isomers accumulate in these affected tissues, clomiphene or one of its isomers warrants consideration as an anti-EBOV agent, for example, to potentially help ameliorate symptoms in EBOV survivors.","output":"Clomiphene and Its Isomers Block Ebola Virus Particle Entry and Infection with Similar Potency: Potential Therapeutic Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, digital health literacy (DHL) has become a significant public health concern.

The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the mRNA-1273 vaccine in children 6 to 11 years of age are unknown. METHODS: Part 1 of this ongoing phase 2-3 trial was open label for dose selection; part 2 was an observer-blinded, placebo-controlled expansion evaluation of the selected dose. In part 2, we randomly assigned children (6 to 11 years of age) in a 3:1 ratio to receive two injections of mRNA-1273 (50 g each) or placebo, administered 28 days apart. The primary objectives were evaluation of the safety of the vaccine in children and the noninferiority of the immune response in these children to that in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) in a related phase 3 trial. Secondary objectives included determination of the incidences of confirmed Covid-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, regardless of symptoms. Interim analysis results are reported. RESULTS: In part 1 of the trial, 751 children received 50-g or 100-g injections of the mRNA-1273 vaccine, and on the basis of safety and immunogenicity results, the 50-g dose level was selected for part 2. In part 2 of the trial, 4016 children were randomly assigned to receive two injections of mRNA-1273 (50 g each) or placebo and were followed for a median of 82 days (interquartile range, 14 to 94) after the first injection. This dose level was associated with mainly low-grade, transient adverse events, most commonly injection-site pain, headache, and fatigue. No vaccine-related serious adverse events, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, myocarditis, or pericarditis were reported as of the data-cutoff date. One month after the second injection (day 57), the neutralizing antibody titer in children who received mRNA-1273 at a 50-g level was 1610 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1457 to 1780), as compared with 1300 (95% CI, 1171 to 1443) at the 100-g level in young adults, with serologic responses in at least 99.0% of the participants in both age groups, findings that met the prespecified noninferiority success criterion. Estimated vaccine efficacy was 88.0% (95% CI, 70.0 to 95.8) against Covid-19 occurring 14 days or more after the first injection, at a time when B.1.617.2 (delta) was the dominant circulating variant. CONCLUSIONS: Two 50-g doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine were found to be safe and effective in inducing immune responses and preventing Covid-19 in children 6 to 11 years of age; these responses were noninferior to those in young adults.

Preventing this reaction with steroids may improve outcomes. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the impact of prophylactic steroids on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing perioperative corticosteroid administration with a control group in adults undergoing CPB. Outcomes of interest included mortality, myocardial infarction, and new onset atrial fibrillation. We assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. RESULTS Fifty-six RCTs published between 1977 and 2015 were included in this meta-analysis. Mortality was not significantly different between groups [3.0% (215/7258 patients) in the steroid group and 3.5% (252/7202 patients) in the placebo group; relative risk (RR), 0.85; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.71-1.01; P=0.07; I2 = 0%]. Myocardial injury was more frequent in the steroid group [8.0% (560/6989 patients), compared with 6.9% (476/6929 patients); RR, 1.17, 95% CI, 1.04-1.31; P=0.008; I2=0%].

CONCLUSIONS After randomising 16 013 patients, steroid administration at the time of cardiac surgery had an unclear impact on mortality, increased the risk of myocardial injury, and the impact on atrial fibrillation should be viewed with caution given that large trials showed no effect.","output":"Steroids in cardiac surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent renascence of phenotypic drug discovery (PDD) is catalyzed by its ability to identify first-in-class drugs and deliver results when the exact molecular mechanism is partially obscure. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe, life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate that has increased in frequency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite decades of laboratory and clinical study, no efficient pharmacological therapy for ARDS has been found. An increase in endothelial permeability is the primary event in ARDS onset, causing the development of pulmonary edema that leads to respiratory failure. Currently, the detailed molecular mechanisms regulating endothelial permeability are poorly understood. Therefore, the use of the PDD approach in the search for efficient ARDS treatment can be more productive than classic target-based drug discovery (TDD), but its use requires a new cell-based assay compatible with high-throughput (HTS) and high-content (HCS) screening. Here we report the development of a new plate-based image cytometry method to measure endothelial barrier function. The incorporation of image cytometry in combination with digital image analysis substantially decreases assay variability and increases the signal window. This new method simultaneously allows for rapid measurement of cell monolayer permeability and cytological analysis. The time-course of permeability increase in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) in response to the thrombin and tumor necrosis factor &#945; treatment correlates with previously published data obtained by transendothelial resistance (TER) measurements.

The virus consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.5 kb, with a polyadenylated 3' end. We now report on the cloning and nucleotide sequencing of an overlapping, contiguous set of cDNA clones representing the entire genome of the HEV Burma strain [HEV(B)]. The largest open reading frame extends approximately 5 kb from the Fend and contains the RNA-directed RNA polymerase and nucleoside triphosphate binding motifs. The second major open reading frame (ORF2) begins 37 by downstream of the first and extends approximately 2 kb to the termination codon present 65 by from the 3' terminal stretch of poly(A) residues. ORF2 contains a consensus signal peptide sequence at its amino terminus and a capsid-like region with a high content of basic amino acids similar to that seen with other virus capsid proteins. A third open reading frame partially overlaps the first and second and encompasses only 369 bp. In addition to the 7.5-kb full-length genomic transcript, two subgenomic polyadenylated messages of approximately 3.7 and 2.0 kb were detected in infected liver using a probe from the 3' third of the genome. The genomic organization of the virus is consistent with the Fend encoding nonstructural and the 3' end encoding the viral structural gene(s). The expression strategy of the virus involves the use of three different open reading frames and at least three different transcripts. HEV was previously determined to be a nonenveloped particle with a diameter of 27C34 nm. These findings on the genetic organization and expression strategy of HEV suggest that it is the prototype human pathogen for a new class of RNA virus or perhaps a separate genus within the Caliciviridae family","output":"Hepatitis E virus (HEV): Molecular cloning and sequencing of the full-length viral genome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using monthly all-cause death tolls for Denmark, Sweden and Finland from January 1946 (and Norway from January 2000) to June 2020, I estimate the stock of vulnerable elderly with a high mortality risk C dry tinder C in each country primo each month from January 1960 to April 2020.My calculations show that the stock of dry tinder in Sweden was very large compared to other Nordic countries going into the COVID-19-pandemic early April and large even in a historical perspective.

On the other hand, many viruses encode their own highly specific proteases, responsible for the proteolytic processing of viral proteins, but, at the same time, to cleave host proteins to corrupt antiviral host responses and adjust protein activity to favor viral replication. Traditionally, protease substrate identification has been addressed by means of hypothesis-driven approaches, but recent advances in proteomics have made a toolkit available to uncover the extensive repertoire of host proteins cleaved during infection, either by viral or host proteases.

A multiple mixed-effects logistic regression was then used to estimate the odds of in-hospital death adjusted for patient age, sex, body mass index, and medical history as well as vital signs, use of supplemental oxygen, presence of pulmonary infiltrates at admission, and hospital site. Main Outcomes and Measures: In-hospital death adjusted for exposures for 4 periods in 2020. Results: The registry included 20a?736 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from March through November 2020 (9524 women [45.9%]; mean [SD] age, 61.2 [17.9] years); 3271 patients (15.8%) died in the hospital. Mortality rates were 19.1% in March and April, 11.9% in May and June, 11.0% in July and August, and 10.8% in September through November. Compared with March and April, the adjusted odds ratios for in-hospital death were significantly lower in May and June (odds ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.58-0.76; P < .001), July and August (odds ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.49-0.69; P < .001), and September through November (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.47-0.73). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, high rates of in-hospital COVID-19 mortality among registry patients in March and April 2020 decreased by more than one-third by June and remained near that rate through November. This difference in mortality rates between the months of March and April and later months persisted even after adjusting for age, sex, medical history, and COVID-19 disease severity and did not appear to be associated with changes in the characteristics of patients being admitted.","output":"Trends in Patient Characteristics and COVID-19 In-Hospital Mortality in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the development of new alternatives We introduce two new disposable box-like head-and-face shields constructed using Japanese origami-style folding The design comprises a single sheet of thick paper and a shield made of a thin, transparent plastic sheet The first design, Model 1, is a head-and-face shield designed to cover the wearer's head and neck Model 2 was designed to solve the problem of heat and moisture buildup inside the shield This version can be used as face shields for patients, and it allows clinicians to collect swabs from the nasopharynx for virus detection via polymerase chain reaction through pre-cut incisions near the nasal orifices These two new box-like face shields are excellent alternatives to traditional face shields because of the low cost, compatibility with mass production, lightweight, and disposability","output":"Construction of Two Box-Like Head-and-Face Shields by Japanese Origami Folding for Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A stepped-down program is one in which clients transition from the care of a health professional to self-managed care. Very little is known about the effectiveness of stepped-down physical activity (PA) programs for military service veterans. OBJECTIVE: This study will test Active Choices, a stepped-down behavioral support program designed to help Australian Defence Force veterans and their dependents who are clients of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, transition from treatment by an exercise physiologist or physiotherapist to self-managed PA. METHODS: The study is a parallel-group, randomized trial, with city-based exercise physiology or physiotherapy practices that recruit eligible Department of Veterans' Affairs clients assigned to Active Choices or a comparison program. The study aims to recruit 52 participants (26 in each group). The Active Choices program will consist of 2 face-to-face (Weeks 1, 12) and 2 telephone (Weeks 4 and 8) consultations. During these sessions, the participant and Active Choices consultant will utilize an evidence-based resource booklet to review the key benefits of an active lifestyle, build an action plan for PA preferences, set and review goals, self-monitor progress relative to set goals, and discuss strategies to overcome PA barriers. Linking participants to local PA communities to overcome social isolation will be a program priority. The comparison program will consist of 2 consultations (Weeks 1 and 12) and use fewer behavioral support strategies (education, self-monitoring, and action planning only) than Active Choices. Outcome measures will be administered at baseline, end-intervention (12 weeks), and follow-up (24 weeks) to assess changes in moderate intensity self-managed PA, psychological well-being, and social connectedness. We will also measure health service utilization and costs as well as PA choices across the intervention period. End-intervention interviews will capture participant experiences. RESULTS: Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on human research activities in Australia, participant recruitment will commence when it is safe and feasible to do so. CONCLUSIONS: Findings will provide valuable pilot data to support up-scaling of the program and larger effectiveness trials with regional and rural as well as city-based Australian Defence Force veterans and their dependents.

In order to understand differences in disease caused by variants of concern and to develop variant-specific vaccines, suitable small animal models are required that mimic disease progression in humans at various stages of life. In this study, we compared the dynamics of infection with two SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (Delta and Omicron) in aged (>1 year 3 months old) and young (<5 weeks old) Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). We show that no weight loss occurred in Omicron infected groups regardless of age, while infection with the Delta variant caused weight loss of up to 10% by day 7 post-infection with slower and incomplete recovery in the aged group. Omicron replicated to similar levels as Delta in the lungs, trachea and nasal turbinates, with no significant differences in the tissue viral loads of aged versus young animals for either variant. In contrast to rare necrosis observed in Omicron-infected animals regardless of age, severe necrosis was observed in the olfactory epithelium in Delta-infected animals. Omicron infection also resulted in mild pulmonary disease in both young and aged animals compared to the moderate acute necrotizing bronchointerstitial pneumonia seen in Delta-infected animals. These results suggest that Omicron infection results in an attenuated clinical disease outlook in Syrian hamsters compared to infection with the Delta variant irrespective of age.","output":"Comparative pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron and Delta variants in Syrian hamsters mirrors the attenuated clinical outlook of Omicron in COVID-19 irrespective of age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While player characters (PCs) are the key element in engaging players in narrative games, the experience and relationship of the player with the PC have received scarce attention from the perspective of the subjective player experience.

Zinc supplements have been previously shown to be beneficial in pregnancy and small for gestational age birth outcomes. There is sparse information, however, on the potential benefits of zinc supplementation to prevent or treat serious infections in this age group. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of preventive and therapeutic zinc supplementation in young infant (<4 months) sepsis. METHODS MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and other databases were searched from inception until 18 June 2021. Studies assessing preventive and therapeutic zinc supplementation in young infants in relation to incidence and outcomes of suspected sepsis were included. Meta-analyses of pooled effects were calculated for sepsis-related outcomes. RESULTS Eleven randomized controlled trials involving 2,819 infants were included. Eight studies reported therapeutic efficacy, whereas 3 evaluated preventive benefits of zinc supplementation. Preventive studies suggest a protective effect of zinc supplementation on neonatal mortality rate (NMR) (risk ratio (RR) 0.28; 95% CI 0.12-0.67, LOW certainty), but with no effect on the incidence of sepsis, both in preterm neonates. Among young infants, therapeutic zinc was associated with significant reductions in infant mortality-rate (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.41-0.93, LOW certainty) and treatment failure (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.44-0.85; LOW certainty). Therapeutic zinc supplementation in neonates was associated with significant increase in serum zinc concentrations (mean difference 81.97; 95% CI 34.57-129.37; LOW certainty), but without an effect on hospital stay or NMR. CONCLUSION Zinc supplementation could potentially reduce mortality and treatment failure in young infants but has no noteworthy influence on hospital stay and in the prevention of sepsis. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm the direction and magnitude of effects if any.","output":"Zinc Supplementation and the Prevention and Treatment of Sepsis in Young Infants: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Patients with chronic diseases are believed to be at increased risk of mental health conditions during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. We aimed to assess the incidence of psychological morbidity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, explore for association with risk of severe COVID\\\\19 and other factors, and establish patients' interest in psychological support. METHODS: A survey including the Patient Health Questionnaire\\\\9, General Anxiety Disorder\\\\7, and Perceived Stress Scale tools for depression, anxiety, and stress was administered to IBD patients from a tertiary center in London, United Kingdom, in June 2020. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy\\\\four patients responded to the survey (57% response rate), with 271 (99%) completing it. ModerateCsevere depression was observed in 61 (22.5%), while 49 (18%) had moderateCsevere anxiety; 39 (14%) had both diagnoses. Mean (SD) stress score was 16.2 (7.4). There was no association between degree of severe COVID\\\\19 risk and psychological morbidity. Flare symptoms and fatigue were associated with worse psychological morbidity, while accessibility of information regarding COVID\\\\19 risk and reducing that risk was protective for depression (odds ratio [OR] 0.56 [0.33C0.94], P = 0.03), anxiety (OR 0.62 [0.4C0.96], P = 0.03), and stress (standardized ©\\\\coefficient ?0.15 [?0.28 to ?0.03], P = 0.02).

As the pandemic progressed, larger differences emerged when comparing married and never married respondents probabilities of fair or poor health, depression, and anxiety as never married people had the steepest decline in health, even adjusting for pandemic-related stressors (e.g., food insufficiency). Yet, widowed and divorced/separated respondents greater probabilities of these three health outcomes compared to married respondents narrowed over this same period. During the pandemic, relationship status and self-rated health patterns were similar for men and women, but for mental health there was evidence that the growing advantage of marriage relative to never being married was more pronounced for men, whereas the shrinking advantage of marriage relative to being previously married was more pronounced for women.

However, benchmarks do not exist to claim if a new AI/ML technique is better than the existing ones. The covid-forecast-hub is a collection of more than 30 teams, including us, that submit their forecasts weekly to the CDC. It is not possible to declare whether one method is better than the other using those forecasts because each teams submission may correspond to different techniques over the period and involve human interventions as the teams are continuously changing/tuning their approach. Such forecasts may be considered human-expert forecasts and do not qualify as AI/ML approaches, although they can be used as an indicator of human expert performance. We are interested in supporting AI/ML research in epidemic forecasting which can lead to scalable forecasting without human intervention. Which modeling technique, learning strategy, and data pre-processing technique work well for epidemic forecasting is still an open problem. To help advance the state-of-the-art in AI/ML applied to epidemiology, a benchmark with a collection of performance points is needed and the current state-of-the-art techniques need to be identified.

To better understand sexual ZIKV pathogenesis, we studied the permissiveness of the human female genital tract to infection and the effect of semen on this process. ZIKV replicates in vaginal tissues and primary epithelial cells from the vagina, ectocervix, and endocervix and induces an innate immune response, but also continues to replicate without cytopathic effect. Infection of genital cells and tissues is strongly inhibited by extracellular vesicles (EV) in semen at physiological vesicle-to-virus ratios. Liposomes with the same composition as semen EVs also impair infection, indicating that the EVs lipid fraction, rather than their protein or RNA cargo, is responsible for this anti-viral effect. Thus, EVs in semen potently restrict ZIKV transmission, but the virus propagates well once infection in the recipient mucosa has been established.","output":"Potent Restriction of Sexual Zika Virus Infection by the Lipid Fraction of Extracellular Vesicles in Semen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Trauma places a burden on healthcare services accounting for a large proportion of Emergency Department presentations.

The new virus, SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) - a highly pathogenic strain of coronaviruses - was isolated on 7 January 2020 and identified as the cause of the outbreak. The SARS-CoV-2 virus rapidly spread across China and many other countries and lead to an unprecedented public health crisis worldwide. While 80% of infected individuals remain asymptomatic or develop only mild symptoms, the remaining 20% experience a rapid progression of the disease and severe/critical clinical condition that could lead to death. In patients with severe/critical phase of COVID-19, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been shown to disrupt the normal immune response, leading to dysregulation of the immune system function and development of uncontrolled hyperinflammatory processes. Several studies highlight relevant changes occurring both in innate and adaptive immune system. Recent data indicate that a hyperinflammatory syndrome induced by SARS-CoV-2 contributes to the disease severity and mortality. It was demonstrated that patients with severe/critical phase of COVID-19 exhibit lymphopenia, a decrease in number of NK cells, eosinophils and basophils, an increase in inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils, an impaired interferon- production and activity, no detectable circulating interferon-, and massive production of proinflammatory cytokines, commonly known as cytokine storm. Many reports suggest that acute respiratory depression syndrome, cardiac dysfunction, hepatic impairment, acute kidney injury, coagulopathies, and multi-organ failure, that are characteristic of severe/critical COVID-19, are not due to direct effects of SARS-CoV-2, but result from the exaggerated cytokine release in response to viral infection. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and immune system dysregulation associated with cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe COVID-19 is imperative to identify novel drug targets and to develop effective vaccines and drugs. In addition, the knowledge on the processes induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection opens a door for the development and introduction of predictive diagnostic tests that enable the prognosis of the course and severity of the disease. ? 2021 Polish Pharmaceutical Society.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of this surrogate model on neural architecture performance prediction for structurally unknown architectures (i.e. zero shot prediction) by evaluating the GNN on several experiments on the NAS-Bench-101 dataset.","output":"Neural Architecture Performance Prediction Using Graph Neural Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sexual consent is often conceptualized as an internal willingness to engage in sexual activity, which can be communicated externally to a sexual partner. Internal sexual consent comprises feelings of physical response, safety/comfort, arousal, agreement/want, and readiness; external sexual consent includes communication cues that may be explicit or implicit and verbal or nonverbal. Most previous research on sexual consent has focused on between-person differences; little attention has been devoted to examining the within-person variation of sexual consent across time. We conducted a 28-day experience sampling methodology (ESM) study with a sample of adults (N = 113) to assess fluctuations in internal and external sexual consent across a given person's sexual events. We found that more than 50% and up to 80% of the variance in sexual consent scores could be accounted for by within-person variability. The type of sexual behavior participants engaged in during a sexual event predicted their internal and external consent. Further, internal consent feelings predicted external consent communication. Overall, our findings provided initial evidence regarding the extent that situational contexts are relevant for sexual consent. ESM study designs may be used to further investigate the potential contextual, intrapersonal, and interpersonal factors associated with internal and external sexual consent.","output":"Assessing the Within-Person Variability of Internal and External Sexual Consent."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background:Patients with lupus nephritis (LN) might be more susceptible to COVID-19 due to the underlying disease, co-morbidities and use of immunosuppressants. We hypothesized that telemedicine (TM) could be a well-accepted mode of health-care delivery minimizing the risk of exposure to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), while maintaining disease control in these patients.Objectives:To evaluate the short-term patient satisfaction, compliance, disease control and infection risk of TM compared with standard in-person follow-up (FU) for patients with LN during COVID-19.Methods:This was a single-center randomized-controlled study. Consecutive patients followed at the LN clinic were randomized to either TM (TM group) or standard FU (SF group) in a 1:1 ratio. Patients in the TM group received scheduled follow-ups via videoconferencing. SF group patients continued conventional in-person outpatient care. The 6-month data were compared.Results:From June to December 2020, 122 patients were randomized (TM: 60, SF: 62) and had attended at least 2 FU visits. There were no baseline differences, including SLEDAI-2k and proportion of patients in lupus low disease activity state (LLDAS), between the 2 groups except a higher physician global assessment score (PGA) in the TM group (mean 0.670.69 vs 0.450.60, p=0.003) (Table 1). The mean FU duration was 19.84.5 weeks. When comparing the most recent visit, the mean waiting time between entering the clinic waiting room (virtual or real) and seeing a rheumatologist (virtual or in-person) was significantly shorter in the TM group (22.528.6 vs 68.940.7 minutes, p< 0.001) (Figure 1A). The mean overall patient satisfaction score was higher in the TM group (mean 2.190.61 vs 1.890.78, p=0.042). The results of the post-consultation satisfaction questionnaire are shown in Figure 1B. The number of visits was similar in the two groups (TM: 3.11.3 vs SF: 3.01.2, p=0.981). However, there was a trend suggesting that alternative mode of FU was requested more frequently in the TM group than the SF group (TM: 12/60, 20.0% and SF: 5/62, 8.1%;p=0.057). More patients in the TM group had hospitalization (15/60, 25.0% vs 7/62, 11.3%;p=0.049) within the FU period, which was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for the baseline PGA. The proportions of patients remained in LLDAS were similar in the 2 groups (TM: 75.0% vs SF: 74.2%, p=0.919). None of the patients had COVID-19.Conclusion:TM resulted in better patient satisfaction and could achieve similar disease control in patients with LN in the short-term when compared to standard care.Table 1.Baseline clinical data of the recruited patients and comparison between the telemedicine/standard follow-up groupsOverall (n=122)Telemedicine group (n=60)Standard follow-up group (n=62)P-valueAge in years44.411.544.111.744.711.50.779Gender: Female111 (91.0)55 (91.7)56 (90.3)0.796Disease duration in years15.19.016.28.714.09.10.115Nephritis class III, IV or V108 (88.5)54 (90.0)54 (87.1)0.42724 hour urine proteinuria in gram0.510.630.530.600.500.650.712Current use of prednisolone112 (91.8)57 (95.0)55 (88.7)0.323Daily prednisolone dose in mg5.514.215.694.175.344.290.570Use of immunosuppressant90 (73.8)46 (76.7)44 (71.0)0.474SLEDAI-2K3.652.334.002.343.302.290.097PGA0.560.650.670.690.450.600.003LLDAS78 (63.9)36 (60.0)42(67.7)0.251Remission0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)n/aPresence of comorbidity87 (71.3)40 (66.7)47 (75.8)0.264SDI0.931.151.081.280.780.980.243HAQ-DI0.230.460.250.470.210.440.571HADS: Anxiety scale Depression scale6.074.12 5.724.316.204.19 5.733.935.934.09 5.704.680.720 0.724Data are reported as mean  SD or number (%).

METHODS: This was a multicentre, retrospective, observational cohort study which involved all vascular surgery services in Lombardy, Northern Italy. Data were retrospectively merged into a combined dataset covering the nine weeks of the Italian COVID-19 pandemic phase 1 (8 March 2020 to 3 May 2020). The primary outcome was freedom from in hospital death, secondary outcomes were re-thrombosis rate after peripheral revascularisation, and freedom from post-operative complication. RESULTS: Among 674 patients managed during the outbreak, 659 (97.8%) were included in the final analysis: 121 (18.4%) were CV19-pos. CV19-pos status was associated with a higher rate of complications (OR 4.5; p < .001, 95% CI 2.64 C 7.84), and a higher rate of re-thrombosis after peripheral arterial revascularisation (OR 2.2; p = .004, 95% CI 1.29 C 3.88). In hospital mortality was higher in CV19-pos patients (24.8% vs. 5.6%; OR 5.4, p < .001;95% CI 2.86 C 8.92). Binary logistic regression analysis identified CV19-pos status (OR 7.6; p < .001, 95% CI 3.75 C 15.28) and age > 80 years (OR 3.2; p = .001, 95% CI 1.61 C 6.57) to be predictors of in hospital death. CONCLUSION: In this experience of the vascular surgery group of Lombardy, COVID-19 infection was a marker of poor outcomes in terms of mortality and post-operative complications for patients undergoing vascular surgery treatments.","output":"Regional Survey in Lombardy, Northern Italy, on Vascular Surgery Intervention Outcomes During The COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surging dismissal of plastics into water resources results in the splintered debris generating microscopic particles called microplastics. The reduced size of microplastic makes it easier for intake by aquatic organisms resulting in amassing of noxious wastes, thereby disturbing their physiological functions. Microplastics are abundantly available and exhibit high propensity for interrelating with the ecosystem thereby disrupting the biogenic flora and fauna. About 71% of the earth surface is occupied by oceans, which holds 97% of the earth's water. The remaining 3% is present as water in ponds, streams, glaciers, ice caps, and as water vapor in the atmosphere. Microplastics can accumulate harmful pollutants from the surroundings thereby acting as transport vectors; and simultaneously can leach out chemicals (additives). Plastics in marine undergo splintering and shriveling to form micro/nanoparticles owing to the mechanical and photochemical processes accelerated by waves and sunlight, respectively. Microplastics differ in color and density, considering the type of polymers, and are generally classified according to their origins, i.e., primary and secondary. About 54.5% of microplastics floating in the ocean are polyethylene, and 16.5% are polypropylene, and the rest includes polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, polyester, and polyamides. Polyethylene and polypropylene due to its lower density in comparison with marine water floats and affect the oceanic surfaces while materials having higher density sink affecting seafloor.

These transporters provide fetal protection against circulating xenobiotics and environmental toxins present in maternal blood. We hypothesized that lipopolysaccharide (LPS-bacterial mimic) alters the yolk sac morphology and expression of key ABC transporters in a gestational-age dependent manner. Yolk sac samples from C57BL/6 mice were obtained at gestational ages (GD) 15.5 and GD18.5, 4 or 24 hours after LPS exposure (150ug/kg; n = 8/group). Samples underwent morphometrical, qPCR and immunohistochemistry analysis. The volumetric proportions of the histological components of the yolk sac did not change in response to LPS. LPS increased Abcg2 expression at GD15.5, after 4 h of treatment (p < 0.05). No changes in Abca1, Abcb1a/b, Abcg1, Glut1, Snat1, Il-1, Ccl2 and Mif were observed. Il-6 and Cxcl1 were undetectable in the yolk sac throughout pregnancy. Abca1, breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp, encoded by Abcg2) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ Abcb1a/b) were localized in the endodermal (uterine-facing) epithelium and to a lesser extent in the mesothelium (amnion-facing), whereas Abca1 was also localized to the endothelium of the yolk sac blood vessels. LPS increased the labeling area and intensity of Bcrp in the yolk sac's mesothelial cells at GD15.5 (4 h), whereas at GD18.5, the area of Bcrp labeling in the mesothelium (4 and 24 h) was decreased (p < 0.05). Bacterial infection has the potential to change yolk sac barrier function by affecting Bcrp and Abcg2 expression in a gestational-age dependent-manner.

We analyzed different aspects of productivity, such as developer satisfaction and well-being, activity, communication and collaboration, efficiency and flow based on the archives of commit data, calendar invites, and Slack communication, as well as the internal reports of WFH experiences and 18 interviews. We find that company engineers continue committing code and carry out their daily duties without significant disruptions, while their routines have gradually adjusted to the new norm with new emerging practices and various changes to the old ones. In a way, our message is that there is no news, which is good news.

Given the stressful nature of medical disciplines, considerable attention must be paid to student support systems during pandemics. This study aimed to review the current literature regarding medical student support systems systematically. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of six databases and grey literature sources in addition to a hand search in the references of the articles on April 5, 2021. We included all studies about support for undergraduate medical students delivered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In conducting this review, we used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. RESULTS: A total of 3646 articles were retrieved from the databases, and 16 additional papers were extracted from other sources. After removing duplicates, we screened 2434 titles and abstracts according to our criteria. Among them, 32 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Ultimately, 10 studies were included for review. We identified two major themes: (a) academic support and (b) mental health support. All of the included studies utilized online methods whether for transitioning from previous support systems or developing novel approaches. Students and faculty members seemed to be receptive to these new systems. Despite indicating outstanding program outcomes, most studies merely described the positive effects of the program rather than providing a precise evaluation. CONCLUSION: There are several methods of supporting medical students who are experiencing unprecedented changes in their educational trajectory. Due to substantial differences in undergraduate medical education in different regions of the world, cultural and contextual-oriented support is indispensable for developing a safe learning environment. Future research should investigate the question of the extent to which online support can supersede in-person strategies.

This study aimed to explore factors that contributed to mobilisation of community-led support, activities provided, and how these activities helped to address emerging needs. We also explored how community-led support was integrated with existing services, what worked and did not work well, and how such support could be sustained after the pandemic. Methods We did a qualitative study with a system-lens approach. Data were collected in two communities in South Wales (one urban and one rural) between May 12 and July 7, 2021, using purposive and snowball sampling. We conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews by telephone and over Microsoft Teams with adults aged 18 years and older; each lasting approximately 90 min. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed thematically using CAQDAS software (NVivo12). Ethics approval was received from the University of Bristol ethics committee. Written or verbal consent was obtained from each participant, before the interview started. Findings We completed 51 interviews; participants included recipients of support (n=10), volunteers (n=24), and strategic leads (n=17). Of the 51 interviewees, 31 identified as females and 20 as males. Participants perceived disruption in service provision, emerging local needs, and raised awareness of people left vulnerable by the pandemic as key drivers for community-led action. Further enabling factors included drawing on existing community resources and social capital, alongside characteristics of the volunteers (age, health, time, and skills). Participants highlighted the key role of informal community groups in responding promptly to emerging and exacerbating needs, due to ability to mobilise and adapt quickly to changing context and capacity to harness local knowledge and resources to reach those in need. This ability was crucial, especially at the early stages of the pandemic when statutory services had to restructure. Partnership working between statutory services and community groups was seen as beneficial, enabling greater reach and increased capacity to respond. Recipients of support described heavily relying on local community for help, which included practical as well as emotional support. The need to consider ongoing needs of vulnerable groups as we enter recovery from COVID-19 was highlighted, alongside the need to capture key lessons learned. Interpretation Our findings include perspectives across the system layers on how communities responded to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the importance of community action in supporting the vulnerable.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to quantify any independent association between COVID-19 during pregnancy and preeclampsia and to determine the effect of these variables on maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. STUDY DESIGN: This was a large, longitudinal, prospective, unmatched diagnosed and not-diagnosed observational study assessing the effect of COVID-19 during pregnancy on mothers and neonates. Two consecutive not-diagnosed women were concomitantly enrolled immediately after each diagnosed woman was identified, at any stage during pregnancy or delivery, and at the same level of care to minimize bias. Women and neonates were followed until hospital discharge using the standardized INTERGROWTH-21st protocols and electronic data management system. A total of 43 institutions in 18 countries contributed to the study sample. The independent association between the 2 entities was quantified with the risk factors known to be associated with preeclampsia analyzed in each group. The outcomes were compared among women with COVID-19 alone, preeclampsia alone, both conditions, and those without either of the 2 conditions. RESULTS: We enrolled 2184 pregnant women; of these, 725 (33.2%) were enrolled in the COVID-19 diagnosed and 1459 (66.8%) in the COVID-19 not-diagnosed groups. Of these women, 123 had preeclampsia of which 59 of 725 (8.1%) were in the COVID-19 diagnosed group and 64 of 1459 (4.4%) were in the not-diagnosed group (risk ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-2.61). After adjustment for sociodemographic factors and conditions associated with both COVID-19 and preeclampsia, the risk ratio for preeclampsia remained significant among all women (risk ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-2.52) and nulliparous women specifically (risk ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-3.05). There was a trend but no statistical significance among parous women (risk ratio, 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.99-2.73). The risk ratio for preterm birth for all women diagnosed with COVID-19 and preeclampsia was 4.05 (95% confidence interval, 2.99-5.49) and 6.26 (95% confidence interval, 4.35-9.00) for nulliparous women. Compared with women with neither condition diagnosed, the composite adverse perinatal outcome showed a stepwise increase in the risk ratio for COVID-19 without preeclampsia, preeclampsia without COVID-19, and COVID-19 with preeclampsia (risk ratio, 2.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.63-2.86; risk ratio, 2.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.44-4.45; and risk ratio, 2.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.67-4.82, respectively). Similar findings were found for the composite adverse maternal outcome with risk ratios of 1.76 (95% confidence interval, 1.32-2.35), 2.07 (95% confidence interval, 1.20-3.57), and 2.77 (95% confidence interval, 1.66-4.63). The association between COVID-19 and gestational hypertension and the direction of the effects on preterm birth and adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes, were similar to preeclampsia, but confined to nulliparous women with lower risk ratios. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 during pregnancy is strongly associated with preeclampsia, especially among nulliparous women. This association is independent of any risk factors and preexisting conditions. COVID-19 severity does not seem to be a factor in this association. Both conditions are associated independently of and in an additive fashion with preterm birth, severe perinatal morbidity and mortality, and adverse maternal outcomes. Women with preeclampsia should be considered a particularly vulnerable group with regard to the risks posed by COVID-19.","output":"Preeclampsia and COVID-19: results from the INTERCOVID prospective longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now a global pandemic. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 in pediatric patients and to compare the characteristics of positive and negative patients. This study conducted from March to May 2020 in a tertiary children's hospital. Patients were included if they were under 18 years old and a SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test had been performed. Of the 1,812 patients included in the study, 365 (20.1%) were positive for COVID-19. The median age was 102 months in the positive group, 70 months in the negative group (p < 0.001). The sex distribution was almost equal. Nearly all positive patients had been in close contact with a COVID-19 infected family household member (p < 0.001). The most common symptoms were fever (54.4%) and cough (38.6%). The asymptomatic patient rate was higher in the positive group (p < 0.001). Lymphopenia (<1500/mm(3)) was found in 29.9% of the positive children (p =0.005). When the groups were compared, white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet counts;neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio;and C-reactive protein level were lower in the positive group. Chest radiography was performed in 95.3% of the positive patients, and the results of 29.7% of them were interpreted as pathological (p < 0.001). Most of the pediatric patients had a history of contact with COVID-19 positive individuals, and therefore, the diagnosis is generally suspected from a history of household exposure to COVID-19. Lymphopenia can help predict positivity. Awareness, reinforcing infection control measures, and performing health management within families are important steps to manage these patients.","output":"Evaluation of Suspected COVID-19 Patients in a Pediatric Emergency Department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus named COVID-19 has quickly spread among humans worldwide, and the situation remains hazardous to the health system.

Behavioral performance was measured via accuracy and response time during the MCE task, and ratings of the EA task, while eletrophysiological response was measured via the contingent negative variation (CNV) elicited by completing the MCE task. Decreased response time and emotional intensity ratings were observed for priming emotion regulation idioms compared to priming neutral idioms. Priming emotion regulation idioms attenuated early CNV amplitudes under happiness priming, and attenuated both early and late CNV amplitudes under fear priming.

We described the changes in chest CT to enable better understanding of the progression of COVID-19 during hospitalization. METHODS: Consecutively hospitalized COVID-19 patients admitted from January 11, 2020 to February 16, 2020 and followed until March 26, 2020 at the Third Peoples Hospital of Shenzhen, China were included. Semi- quantitative analysis was used to assess the shape, distribution, and range of lung lesions. For each image, the lungs were divided into six regions. The total CT score was the sum of individual region scores. RESULTS: 305 patients underwent a total of 1442 chest CT scans with a mean interval of 5 days (interquartile range (IQR) = 3?6 days). All patients were discharged after an average hospitalization of 25 days (IQR = 20?33 days). From the onset of initial symptoms, the total CT score peaked at an earlier date in the non-severe than the severe cases (13 days versus 15 days). Typical CT image of non-severe cases mainly presented as ground-glass opacities (GGO), whilst GGO mixed with consolidation was more seen in severe cases. In addition, severe versus non-severe cases had higher prevalence of fibrosis and air bronchogram in CT scans (P from <0.001 to 0.05, P = 0.001, respectively). The proportion of patients with fibrosis and air bronchogram appeared to decrease from the fourth (20 days from onset, IQR = 16C24) and the third pulmonary CT scan (15 days from onset, IQR = 12C19), respectively. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pneumonia demonstrated progressions in early stage, with the greatest pulmonary damage on CT occurred at approximately 13 days after initial onset of symptoms. Worse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates were found in severe cases, indicating continuous health care for pulmonary rehabilitation and consecutive follow-up to monitor irreversible fibrosis and consolidation are necessary.","output":"The time course of chest CT lung changes in COVID-19 patients from onset to discharge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Time-sensitive parcel deliveries, shipments requested for delivery in a day or less, are an increasingly important research subject. It is challenging to deal with these deliveries from a carrier perspective since it entails additional planning constraints, preventing an efficient consolidation of deliveries which is possible when demand is well known in advance. Furthermore, such time-sensitive deliveries are requested to a wider spatial scope than retail centers, including homes and offices. Therefore, an increase in such deliveries is considered to exacerbate negative externalities such as congestion and emissions. One of the solutions is to leverage spare capacity in passenger transport modes. This concept is often denominated as cargo-hitching. While there are various possible system designs, it is crucial that such solution does not deteriorate the quality of service of passenger trips. This research aims to evaluate the use of Mobility-On-Demand services to perform same-day parcel deliveries. For this purpose, we use SimMobility, a high-resolution agent-based simulation platform of passenger and freight flows, applied in Singapore. E-commerce demand carrier data are used to characterize simulated parcel delivery demand. Operational scenarios that aim to minimize the adverse effect of fulfilling deliveries with Mobility-On-Demand vehicles on Mobility-On-Demand passenger flows (fulfillment, wait and travel times) are explored. Results indicate that the Mobility-On-Demand services have potential to fulfill a considerable amount of parcel deliveries and decrease freight vehicle traffic and total vehicle-kilometers-travelled without compromising the quality of Mobility On-Demand for passenger travel.","output":"A simulation-based evaluation of a Cargo-Hitching service for E-commerce using mobility-on-demand vehicles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is a systemic inflammatory disorder that not only affects the skin but is also associated with numerous other disorders There is currently scant literature on the outcomes of COVID19 patients with atopic dermatitis and aim was to examine investigate the impact of AD on COVID complications A retrospective cohort study was done using TriNetX, a national federated real time database of 63 million records COVID patient cohorts were identified by validated ICD-10 and serology codes per CDC guidelines An 1:1 matched propensity score analysis was conducted, adjusting for comorbidities and demographics, to calculate adjusted Risk Ratios (aRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) 45-day COVID complications were examined with severe COVID being defined as a composite of mortality and ventilation Subgroup analyses were also performed for AD patients on systemic immunosuppressants In a matched sample of 2408 patients in each cohort, there was no statistically significant difference between AD-COVID patients and non-AD COVID patients in any of the outcomes examined such as hospitalization (0 89[ 075-1 04]), acute respiratory distress syndrome (1 05[0 55-2 1]), sepsis (0 98[0 66-1 46]), mechanical ventilation (0 73[0 43-1 23]), mortality (1 02[0 62-1 62]), and severe COVID (0 8[0 54-1 19]) Subgroup analysis also revealed that AD-COVID patients with a one-year history of immunosuppressant use had no significant difference in any of the listed outcomes as well compared to AD-COVID patients without history of immunosuppressants AD patients who contract COVID are not at higher risk for more severe COVID outcomes compared to COVID patients without AD Likewise, AD patients with a history of systemic immunosuppressants are also not at a higher risk for COVID complications compared to AD patients without a history of systemic immunosuppressants More research may be needed to visit the longer term impacts of COVID on AD patients","output":"342 Clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with Atopic dermatitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been predominantly a respiratory manifestation.

Its richness in text-based data in the form of posts and comments allows researchers to identify popular topics and assess public sentiment. Nonetheless, the vast majority of topic extraction and sentiment analysis based on social media is performed on the platform or country level and does not account for local culture and policies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to use location-based subreddits on Reddit to study city-level variations in sentiments toward vaccine-related topics. METHODS: Comments on posts providing regular updates on COVID-19 statistics in the Vancouver (r/vancouver, n=49,291), Toronto (r/toronto, n=20,764), and Calgary (r/calgary, n=21,277) subreddits between July 13, 2020, and June 14, 2021, were extracted. Latent Dirichlet allocation was used to identify frequently discussed topics. Sentiment (joy, sadness, fear, and anger) scores were assigned to comments through random forest regression. RESULTS: The number of comments on the 250 posts from the Vancouver subreddit positively correlated with the number of new daily COVID-19 cases in British Columbia (R=0.51, 95% CI for slope 0.18-0.29; P<.001).

Beyond the deaths directly caused by the virus and the suicides related to the psychological response to the dramatic changes as socioeconomic related to the pandemic, there might also be suicides related to the inflammatory responses of the infection. Infection induces inflammation as a cytokine storm, and there is an increasing number of studies that report a relationship between infection and suicide. MATERIALS AND METHODS We searched the World Health Organization status report and the PubMed database for keywords (COVID-19, suicide, infection, inflammation, cytokines), and reviewed five cytokine pathways between suicide and inflammation using two meta-analyses and two observational studies starting from November 31, 2020, focusing on the relationship between suicide and inflammation by infection. First, we discussed existing evidence explaining the relationship between suicidal behaviors and inflammation. Second, we summarized the inflammatory features found in COVID-19 patients. Finally, we highlight the potential for these factors to affect the risk of suicide in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS Patients infected with COVID-19 have high amounts of IL-1, IFN-, IP10, and MCP1, which may lead to Th1 cell response activation. Also, Th2 cytokines (e.g., IL-4 and IL-10) were increased in COVID-19 infection.

With evolution of the virus updated methods for the evaluation of the immune response in infected and vaccinated individuals are required to determine the durability of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 variants. METHODS: We developed a multiplexed surrogate virus neutralization test (plex-sVNT) that simultaneously measures the ability of antibodies in serum to inhibit binding between angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and 7 SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein variants, including wild type, B.1.1.7(), B.1.351(), P.1(), B.1.617.2(), B.1.617.1(), and B.1.429(). The assay was validated against a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). We evaluated 170 samples from 97 COVID-19 patients and 281 samples from 188 individuals that received the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccines. RESULTS: The plex-sVNT demonstrated >96% concordance with PRNT. Antibody neutralization activity was significantly reduced for all SARS-CoV-2 variants compared to wild type in both the infected and vaccinated cohorts. There was a decline in overall antibody neutralization activity, within both cohorts, out to 5 months post infection or vaccination, with the rate of decline being more significant for the vaccinated.

We used qPCR and haemagglutination assays to investigate BFDV prevalence, load and shedding in seven abundant host species in the wild in south-east Australia: Crimson Rosellas (Platycercus elegans), Eastern Rosellas (Platycercus eximius), Galahs (Eolophus roseicapillus), Sulphur-crested Cockatoos (Cacatua galerita), Blue-winged Parrots (Neophema chrysostoma), Rainbow Lorikeets (Trichoglossus moluccanus) and Red-rumped Parrots (Psephotus haematonotus). We found BFDV infection in clinically normal birds in six of the seven species sampled. We focused our analysis on the four most commonly caught species, namely Crimson Rosellas (BFDV prevalence in blood samples: 41.8%), Sulphur-crested Cockatoos (20.0%), Blue-winged Parrots (11.8%) and Galahs (8.8%). Species, but not sex, was a significant predictor for BFDV prevalence and load. 56.1% of BFDV positive individuals were excreting BFDV antigen into their feathers, indicative of active viral replication with shedding. Being BFDV positive in blood samples predicted shedding in Crimson Rosellas. Our study confirms that BFDV is endemic in our study region, and can inform targeted disease management by providing comparative data on interspecies variation in virus prevalence, load and shedding.","output":"Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) prevalence, load and excretion in seven species of wild caught common Australian parrots"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Dental procedures often produce aerosols and spatter, which have the potential to transmit pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The existing literature is limited. METHODS: Aerosols and spatter were generated from an ultrasonic scaling procedure on a dental manikin and characterized via 2 optical imaging methods: digital inline holography and laser sheet imaging. Capture efficiencies of various aerosol mitigation devices were evaluated and compared. RESULTS: The ultrasonic scaling procedure generated a wide size range of aerosols (up to a few hundred m) and occasional large spatter, which emit at low velocity (mostly < 3 m/s). Use of a saliva ejector and high-volume evacuator (HVE) resulted in overall reductions of 63% and 88%, respectively, whereas an extraoral local extractor (ELE) resulted in a reduction of 96% at the nominal design flow setting. CONCLUSIONS: The study results showed that the use of ELE or HVE significantly reduced aerosol and spatter emission. The use of HVE generally requires an additional person to assist a dental hygienist, whereas an ELE can be operated hands free when a dental hygienist is performing ultrasonic scaling and other operations. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: An ELE aids in the reduction of aerosols and spatters during ultrasonic scaling procedures, potentially reducing transmission of oral or respiratory pathogens like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Position and airflow of the device are important to effective aerosol mitigation.","output":"Characterization and mitigation of aerosols and spatters from ultrasonic scalers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma and MYC rearrangement at FISH exhibit poor outcome after R-CHOP. In the last decade, 68 patients with Burkitt lymphoma (BL; n=46) or high-grade B-cell lymphoma (single, double or triple hit; HGBCL; n=22) were treated with a dose-dense, short-term therapy termed \\"CARMEN regimen\\", at five Italian Centers. Forty-six (68%) patients were HIV-positive. CARMEN included a 36-day induction with sequsingle weekly doses of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, rituximab, methotrexate, etoposide, and doxorubicin plus intrathecal chemotherapy, followed by high-dose-cytarabine-based consolidation. Patients who did not achieve complete remission (CR) after induction received BEAM-conditioned ASCT after consolidation. Sixty-one (90%) patients completed induction and 59 (87%) completed consolidation. Seventeen patients received ASCT. Grade-4 hematological toxicity was common but did not cause treatment discontinuation; grade-4 non-hematological toxicity was recorded in 11 (16%) patients, with grade-4 infections in 6 (9%). Six (9%) patients died of toxicity (sepsis in four, COVID-19, ARDS). CR rate after the whole treatment was 73% (95%CI=55-91%) for HGBCL patients and 78% (95%CI=66-90%) for BL patients. At a median follow-up of 65 (IQR 40-109) months, 48 patients remain event-free, with a 5-year PFS of 63% (95%CI=58-68%) for HGBCL and 72% (95%CI=71-73%) for BL, with a 5-year OS of 63% (95%CI=58-68%) and 76% (95%CI=75-77%), respectively.

Most pediatric COVID-19 cases range from asymptomatic to mild-moderate disease. There are no specific clinical signs described for neonatal COVID-19 infections. In children, severe central nervous system compromise has been rarely reported. CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a 17-day-old newborn who acquired a SARS-CoV-2 infection in a family meeting that was admitted for fever, seizures and lethargy and in whom consumption coagulopathy, ischemic lesions in the brain and cardiac involvement were documented. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 neonatal infection can be associated with multi-organic involvement. In our patient, significant central nervous system compromise associated to ischemic lesions and laboratory findings of consumption coagulopathy were found.

METHODS: Literature review (1998C2003). RESULTS: With some minor modification, risk factors and major causes of death and disability have, by and large, remained much the same since 1998. However, promoting health at the beginning of the 21st century is not the same as promoting health five years ago. A number of global events and trends have practical implications for health promotion policy and practice. CONCLUSION: This was not meant to be a comprehensive review, but rather an overview to stimulate debate and discussion. We conclude that since our earlier review of health priorities in 1998, nothing has changed, but everything has changed. In a changing global context, there needs to be: greater emphasis on advocacy to create supportive environments, healthy public policy and legislation; partnerships with sectors outside of health to tackle social determinants of health; and leadership development to facilitate individuals and groups to address these important issues. SO WHAT? There needs to be greater emphasis on building effective partnerships to tackkle social determinants of health, as well as leadership development to facilitate participation by disadvantage groups and advocacy for policy and legislative change.

We sought to evaluate the overall success of this change, and to identify what types of practice settings, provider groups, and patient groups were best served by telepsychiatry and telepsychotherapy utilization. We were particularly interested in how providers of consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) adapted to remote care. METHODS: An anonymous provider survey querying demographics, education, training, technological experience, practice setting, treatment modalities, patient groups, transition process, and outcomes was made openly available via social media and professional listservs. We used multivariable regression modeling to evaluate for predictors of the positive outcomes of overall satisfaction, subjective ability to diagnose and treat patients adequately utilizing exclusively telepsychiatric platforms, and patient satisfaction by proxy. RESULTS: 333 respondents, mostly young (59.4% under 50), female (69.7%), and physicians (67.9%), completed the survey. 197(59.1%) worked in CLP. 85.9% gave affirmative answers to overall satisfaction. Multivariable linear regression models found that satisfaction was predicted by general comfort with technology (p<0.001), but negatively correlated with having technical issues (p<0.001), a priori skepticism (p<0.001), clinician being male (p=0.004), and treating LGBTQ+ patients (p=0.022). Completeness was associated with having training in telehealth (p=0.039) and general comfort with technology (p<0.001) but negatively associated with treating LGBTQ+ patients (p=0.024) or inpatients (p=0.002). Patient satisfaction by proxy was positively associated with general comfort with technology (p<0.001) and the respondent being a non-physician (p=0.004), and negatively associated with encountering a technical issue (p=0.013) or treating inpatients (p=0.045). CLPs had similar results overall, and were more likely to have other staff assist in making televisits effective (mean(SD): -1.25(3.57) versus -2.76(3.27), p<0.001) especially if consultative (mean(SD): -0.87(3.67) versus -2.39(3.01), p=0.010). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests high rates of overall satisfaction in telepsychiatry adoption, even in CLP.

Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles, secreted by all types of cells, and considered as key mediators of intercellular communication and stem-cell paracrine signaling. Herein, we reviewed the most recent literature about the role of exosomes as potential agents for treatment, prevention, diagnosis, and pathogenesis of COVID-19. Several studies and ongoing clinical trials have been investigating the anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and reparative effects of exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem/stromal cells for COVID-19-related acute lung injury. Other studies reported that exosomes play a key role in convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19, and that they could be of use for the treatment of COVID-19 Kawasaki's-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome and as drug delivery nanocarriers for antiviral therapy. Harnessing some advantageous aspects of exosome biology, such as their endogenous origin, capability of crossing biological barriers, high stability in circulation, and low toxicity and immunogenicity, several companies have been testing exosome-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. As they carry cargos that mimic the status of parent cells, exosomes can be isolated from a variety of sources, including plasma, and employed as biomarkers of COVID-19.

In the early 1980s, human insulin was prepared in recombinant bacteria and it is now used by all patients suffering from diabetes. Several other proteins and particularly human growth hormone are also prepared from bacteria. This success was limited by the fact that bacteria cannot synthesize complex proteins such as monoclonal antibodies or coagulation blood factors which must be matured by post-translational modifications to be active or stable in vivo. These modifications include mainly folding, cleavage, subunit association, -carboxylation and glycosylation. They can be fully achieved only in mammalian cells which can be cultured in fermentors at an industrial scale or used in living animals. Several transgenic animal species can produce recombinant proteins but presently two systems started being implemented. The first is milk from farm transgenic mammals which has been studied for 20 years and which allowed a protein, human antithrombin III, to receive the agreement from EMEA (European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products) to be put on the market in 2006. The second system is chicken egg white which recently became more attractive after essential improvement of the methods used to generate transgenic birds. Two monoclonal antibodies and human interferon-1a could be recovered from chicken egg white. A broad variety of recombinant proteins were produced experimentally by these systems and a few others.

RESULTS: Infants of mothers in home confinement had later sleep offset times and longer nighttime sleep durations, compared to infants of mothers who were working as usual. At the end of March, these infants also had earlier bedtimes, more nighttime awakenings, and more parental nighttime visits, but differences were not apparent during April and May. CONCLUSIONS: Living restrictions issued in the United States may have led to longer sleep durations and temporary delays in sleep consolidation for infants of mothers in home confinement.","output":"Infant sleep during COVID-19: Longitudinal analysis of infants of US mothers in home confinement versus working as usual"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has disrupted traditional cardiovascular care pathways leading to significant challenges; with these challenges have also come opportunities to iterate our testing strategies to ensure they are patient centered and also that they are most appropriate and best align with infection protection protocols. ?

A reduction in the quality of life and the presence of prolonged fatigue are some of the most imminent problems that emerge among these professionals. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a holistic intervention (workshop) for health science students aimed at developing skills that will enable them to obtain a better self-assessment of their quality of life, and prolonged fatigue. Methods: Pre- and post-measures of quality of life, and prolonged fatigue were obtained from 130 health science students, including a group of 96 attendees (cases) of a 4-h wellness workshop and 34 students who did not attend (controls). Results: Paired t tests indicated a significant improvement in nearly all dimensions related to quality of life, and prolonged fatigue in the case group who attended the workshop. Conclusions: A comprehensive wellness strategy that utilizes a holistic approach can play an important role in improving and promoting essential skills to improve healthcare provider's self-assessment about the quality of life and reduce their prolonged fatigue.

METHODS: In the randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind KEEPsAKE 1 trial, 964 patients with active PsA were randomised (1:1) to receive risankizumab 150 mg or placebo at weeks 0, 4 and 16. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20) at week 24. Here, we report the results from the 24-week double-blind period; the open-label period with all patients receiving risankizumab is ongoing. RESULTS: At week 24, a significantly greater proportion of patients receiving risankizumab achieved the primary endpoint of ACR20 (57.3% vs placebo, 33.5%; p<0.001). Significant differences were also observed for risankizumab versus placebo for the first eight ranked secondary endpoints, including skin and nail psoriasis endpoints, minimal disease activity and resolution of enthesitis and dactylitis (p<0.001).

METHODS: A total of 183 patients with myopia (183 eyes) aged 8 to 18 years were enrolled in this study. The axial length (AL) of the eyes was measured by an IOL-Master, and corneal curvatures (K-values) and HOAs were measured by a Pentacam anterior segment diagnostic analyzer. RESULTS: Results of this study showed that the anterior, posterior and total corneal horizontal coma Z31 were - 0.1249  0.105 m, 0.0009  0.001 m, and - 0.1331  0.116 m, respectively; the anterior, posterior and total corneal vertical coma Z3- 1 were - 0.0212  0.164 m, 0.0003  0.043 m, and - 0.0216  0.168 m, respectively; and spherical aberration (SA) Z40 values were 0.2244  0.091 m, 0.1437  0.029 um, and 0.1889  0.090 m, respectively. Total corneal Z31 was statistically correlated with posterior corneal astigmatism (K2b - K1b) (p = 0.038). Total corneal Z3- 1 was correlated with anterior corneal astigmatism (K2f - K1f) (p = 0.027). Anterior, posterior, and total corneal Z40 were correlated with anterior and posterior corneal curvature (K1f, K2f, K1b, K2b) (p = 0.001). Posterior corneal Z40b was also significantly correlated with AL. CONCLUSIONS: In adolescents with mild to moderate myopia, the posterior corneal surface shape may play a compensatory role in the balance of corneal aberrations, and the posterior corneal SA tended to become less negative as the AL increased. The corneal coma may also play a compensatory role in posterior corneal surface astigmatism, which was valuable for the treatment for improving visual quality.

Due to the ubiquity of Internet connectivity and smart devices, social sensing is emerging as a dynamic AI-driven sensing paradigm to extract real-time observations from online users. In this paper, we propose CovidSens, a vision of social sensing-based risk alert systems to spontaneously obtain and analyze social data to infer the state of the COVID-19 propagation. CovidSens can actively help to keep the general public informed about the COVID-19 spread and identify risk-prone areas by inferring future propagation patterns. The CovidSens concept is motivated by three observations: (1) people have been actively sharing their state of health and experience of the COVID-19 via online social media, (2) official warning channels and news agencies are relatively slower than people reporting their observations and experiences about COVID-19 on social media, and (3) online users are frequently equipped with substantially capable mobile devices that are able to perform non-trivial on-device computation for data processing and analytics. We envision an unprecedented opportunity to leverage the posts generated by the ordinary people to build a real-time sensing and analytic system for gathering and circulating vital information of the COVID-19 propagation. Specifically, the vision of CovidSens attempts to answer the questions: How to distill reliable information about the COVID-19 with the coexistence of prevailing rumors and misinformation in the social media? How to inform the general public about the latest state of the spread timely and effectively, and alert them to remain prepared? How to leverage the computational power on the edge devices (e.g., smartphones, IoT devices, UAVs) to construct fully integrated edge-based social sensing platforms for rapid detection of the COVID-19 spread? In this vision paper, we discuss the roles of CovidSens and identify the potential challenges in developing reliable social sensing-based risk alert systems. We envision that approaches originating from multiple disciplines (e.g., AI, estimation theory, machine learning, constrained optimization) can be effective in addressing the challenges.

In spite of the number of cases of COVID-19, its rapid spread putting many sanitary systems in the edge of collapse has hindered proper collection and analysis of the data related to COVID-19 clinical aspects. We describe an interdisciplinary initiative that integrates clinical research, with image diagnostics and the use of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and radiomics with the aim of clarifying some of SARS-CoV-2 open questions. The whole initiative addresses 3 main points: 1) collection of standardize data including images, clinical data and analytics;2) COVID-19 screening for its early diagnosis at primary care centers;3) define radiomic signatures of COVID-19 evolution and associated pathologies for the early treatment of complications. In particular, in this paper we present a general overview of the project, the experimental design and first results of X-ray COVID-19 detection using a classic approach based on HoG and feature selection. Our experiments include a comparison to some recent methods for COVID-19 screening in X-Ray and an exploratory analysis of the feasibility of X-Ray COVID-19 screening. Results show that classic approaches can outperform deep-learning methods in this experimental setting, indicate the feasibility of early COVID-19 screening and that non-COVID infiltration is the group of patients most similar to COVID-19 in terms of radiological description of X-ray.

They are among the most important parasitic diseases, affecting millions of people worldwide, being a considerable global challenge. However, there is no human vaccine available against T. cruzi and Leishmania infections, and their control is based mainly on chemotherapy. Treatments for Chagas disease and leishmaniasis have multiple limitations, mainly due to the high toxicity of the available drugs, long-term treatment protocols, and the occurrence of drug-resistant parasite strains. In the case of Chagas disease, there is still the problem of low cure rates in the chronic stage of the disease. Therefore, new therapeutic agents and novel targets for drug development are urgently needed. Antioxidant defence in Trypanosomatidae is a potential target for chemotherapy because the organisms present a unique mechanism for trypanothione-dependent detoxification of peroxides, which differs from that found in vertebrates. Cellular thiol redox homeostasis is maintained by the biosynthesis and reduction of trypanothione, involving different enzymes that act in concert.

We propose a method for enhancing data sets containing faces without masks by creating synthetic masks and overlaying them on faces in the original images. Our method relies on SparkAR Studio, a developer program made by Facebook that is used to create Instagram face filters. In our approach, we use 9 masks of different colors, shapes and fabrics.

We show that our method produces significantly more realistic training examples of masks overlaid on faces by asking volunteers to qualitatively compare it to other methods or data sets designed for the same task. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our method by evaluating state-of-the-art face recognition systems (FaceNet, VGG-face, ArcFace) trained on our enhanced data sets and showing that they outperform equivalent systems trained on original data sets (containing faces without masks) or competing data sets (containing masks generated by related methods), when the test benchmarks contain masked faces.","output":"A realistic approach to generate masked faces applied on two novel masked face recognition data sets (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates empirically how air pollution in earlier periods as measured by three air pollutants, namely NO(2), PM(10), and PM(2.5) may have affected the spread and fatality of COVID-19 in 31 European countries.

METHODS: We report findings in 23 patients who presented with thrombosis and thrombocytopenia 6 to 24 days after receiving the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca). On the basis of their clinical and laboratory features, we identify a novel underlying mechanism and address the therapeutic implications. RESULTS: In the absence of previous prothrombotic medical conditions, 22 patients presented with acute thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, primarily cerebral venous thrombosis, and 1 patient presented with isolated thrombocytopenia and a hemorrhagic phenotype. All the patients had low or normal fibrinogen levels and elevated d-dimer levels at presentation. No evidence of thrombophilia or causative precipitants was identified. Testing for antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4) was positive in 22 patients (with 1 equivocal result) and negative in 1 patient.

Prior to planning a multicenter study, assessment of recruitment, feasibility, and pilot study procedures is needed. In this pilot study, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a large multicenter prospective cohort study. METHODS: This feasibility study recruited adult patients admitted to the ICU with TBI and an abnormal cerebral CT scan. In all patients, we documented Richmond Agitation Sedation Score (RASS) and agitated behaviors every 8-h nursing shift using a dedicated tool documenting 14 behaviors. Our feasibility objectives were to obtain consent from at least 2 patients per month; completion of screening logs for agitated behaviors by bedside nurses for more than 90% of 8-h shifts; completion of data collection in an average of 6 h or less; and obtain 6-month follow-up for surviving patients. The main clinical outcome was the incidence of agitation and individual agitated behaviors. RESULTS: In total, 47 eligible patients were approached for inclusion and 30 (64% consent rate) were recruited over a 10-month period (3 patients/month). In total, 794 out of 827 (96%) possible 8-h periods of agitated behavior logs were completed by bedside nurses, with a median of 24 observations (IQR 28.0) per patient. During the ICU stay, 17 of 30 patients developed agitation (56.7%; 95% CI 0.37C0.75) defined as RASS  2 during at least one observation period and for a median of 4 days (IQR 5.5).

We recruited a national sample of participants (N = 420) who completed an electronic survey including six sections: perceived benefits of MI, perceived barriers to using MI resources, satisfaction with MI resources, perceived importance of different MI resource characteristics, MI resource preferences, and participant demographics, background, and school context. Data analysis consisted of descriptive analyses, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, latent profile analysis, and multinomial regression analysis. Participants mostly agreed about the benefits of MI and were satisfied with the MI resources they were using but had varying perceptions about the presence of barriers to using MI resources. Participants rated the integration of an MI resource with the academic curriculum, the amount of time required for teacher training, the type of training materials provided, and the timing of the training as the most important characteristics they would consider before adopting a resource. Factor analyses supported single factor solutions for perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and satisfaction, and a three-factor solution for perceived importance of different MI resource characteristics (Curriculum Integration, Training Logistics, and Feasibility). Based on these factors, we identified five latent classes of teachers. Regression results showed that desirable latent class membership depended on certain MI preferences and demographic, background, and school context characteristics.

However, little information about feasibility and effectiveness is available yet about distance teaching in anatomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of a histology course previously taught in a classroom setting into an online-only format based on video conference software. METHODS: Our course design included theoretical introductions, an online-adaptation of virtual microscopy used previously in the classroom, and active learning elements such as collaborative learning in breakout rooms, annotation assignments and multiple-choice questions. Two preclinical semester cohorts of around 400 second and third semester students were taught in histology in parallel courses, using the Zoom software platform. We analyzed data about student attendance during the course, summative quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the students and results of a written test required to pass the course. RESULTS: We observed that student attendance was high and stable during the 19 course days for both second and third semester, and only few students reported technical problems. There were no significant differences in examination results of second semester compared to the third semester, an unexpected result as the third semester already participated in the dissection course before. Similarly, no significant gender-related effects on the examination performance could be noted in both semesters. However, the age of students was negatively correlated with test scores in the second and third semester. Importantly, the overall evaluation of the digital version of the histology course was at least as positive as the in-person version over the past years. CONCLUSION: Together, we experienced that the implementation of a curricular histology course in an online-format is technically realizable, effective and well accepted among students. We also observed that availability and prior experience with digitized specimen in virtual microscopy facilitates transition into an online-only setting.

A large share of the job losses in small businesses reflected firms that closed entirely, though many subsequently reopened. Firms that were already unhealthy were more likely to close and less likely to reopen, and disadvantaged workers were more likely to be laid off and less likely to return. Most laid-off workers expected to be recalled, and this was predictive of rehiring. Shelter-in-place orders drove only a small share of job losses. Last, states that received more small business loans from the Paycheck Protection Program and states with more generous unemployment insurance benefits had milder declines and faster recoveries. We find no evidence that high unemployment insurance replacement rates drove job losses or slowed rehiring.","output":"Measuring the Labor Market at the Onset of the COVID-19 Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Self-reported depression has been observed in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients, infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), during discharge from the hospital. However, the cause of this self-reported depression during the convalescent period remains unclear. Here, we report the mental health status of 96 convalescent COVID-19 patients who were surveyed using an online questionnaire at the Shenzhen Samii Medical Center from March 2 to March 12, 2020 in Shenzhen, China. After obtaining their informed consent, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients, including routine blood and biochemical data. The results suggested that patients with self-reported depression exhibited increased immune response, as indicated by increased white blood cell and neutrophil counts, as well as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. However, the mechanism linking self-reported depression to these cellular changes needs further study. In conclusion, self-reported depression occurred at an early stage in convalescent COVID-19 patients, and changes in immune function were apparent during short-term follow-up of these patients after discharge.

Antiviral drugs continue to be an important option for the treatment of influenza disease and will likely be the only option during the early phases of pandemic. However, the limited number of drug classes licensed for treatment of influenza raises several issues, particularly in the face of drug resistance. Two classes of drugs are presently licensed for treatment of influenza, M2 and neuraminidase inhibitors. M2 inhibitors are currently not recommended for treatment of influenza because of widespread resistance and resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has been observed during the past influenza seasonal outbreaks. Additional antiviral drugs with novel mechanisms of action are clearly needed for the treatment of influenza. Fortunately, the landscape of drugs in early and advanced development has dramatically increased over the last 5 years. Drugs targeting viral functions such as attachment, entry/fusion, transcription, and polymerase and drugs targeting host factors affecting viral replication are currently in clinical trials. Examples of these novel antiviral drugs and the challenges for influenza antiviral drug development are discussed in this article.","output":"Antivirals in seasonal and pandemic influenzafuture perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Big events (i.e., unique historical disruptions) like the COVID-19 epidemic and its associated period of social distancing can transform social structures, social interactions, and social norms. Social distancing rules and the fear of infection have greatly reduced face-to-face interactions, increased loneliness, reduced ties to helping institutions, and may also have disrupted the opioid use behaviors of people who use drugs. This research used Reddit to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the social networks and social processes of people who use opioids. METHODS: Data were collected from the social media forum, Reddit.com. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. (March 5, 2020, to May 13, 2020), 2,000 Reddit posts were collected from the two most popular opioid subreddits (r/OpiatesRecovery, r/Opiates). Posts were reviewed for relevance to COVID-19 and opioid use resulting in a final sample of 300. Thematic analysis was guided by the Big Events framework. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic was found to create changes in the social networks and daily lives among persons who use opioids. Adaptions to these changes shifted social networks leading to robust social support and mutual aid on Reddit, including sharing and seeking advice on facing withdrawal, dealing with isolation, managing cravings, and accessing recovery resources. CONCLUSIONS: Reddit provided an important source of social support and mutual aid for persons who use opioids. Findings indicate online social support networks are beneficial to persons who use opioids, particularly during big events where isolation from other social support resources may occur.","output":"Socially-supportive norms and mutual aid of people who use opioids: An analysis of Reddit during the initial COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE This study tests whether patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysm who underwent stent placement benefitted from platelet function monitoring-guided adjustment of antiplatelet therapy. METHODS We conducted a randomized, open-label, parallel group, assessor-blinded trial. Patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysm who underwent stent placement were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either drug adjustment (patients who had high on-treatment platelet reactivity to antiplatelet therapy on the basis of platelet function monitoring [monitoring group]) or conventional therapy (without monitoring and drug adjustment [conventional group]). The second monitoring was performed 14 days after randomization in patients with drug adjustment. The primary outcome was the composite frequency of ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, stent thrombosis, urgent revascularization, and cerebrovascular death within 7 days after stent implantation. The safety outcome was the composite frequency of major, minor, or minimal bleeding within 1 month after stent implantation. RESULTS In total, 314 patients were included (n=157 per group). The primary combined outcome occurred in 19 patients (12.1%) in the conventional group and 8 patients (5.1%) in the monitoring group (hazard ratio, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.17-0.92]; P=0.03). Ischemic stroke occurred at a lower frequency in the monitoring group compared with that in the conventional group (4.5% versus 12.1%; hazard ratio, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.14-0.83]; P=0.01), which drove the overall primary combined outcome. The safety outcome occurred in the monitoring group (7.0%) and in the conventional group (1.9%; hazard ratio, 3.87 [95% CI, 1.06-14.14]; P=0.03). A significant difference was observed in the frequency of minor or minimal bleeding events between the two groups (monitoring group versus conventional group, 6.4% versus 1.3%; P=0.02) but not in the frequency of major bleeding events between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Platelet function monitoring-guided antiplatelet therapy reduces thromboembolic events in patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysm after stent placement, significantly enhancing minor or minimal bleeding events but not major bleeding events.

The interview-based approaches often miss contacts and involve significant delays, while digital solutions can suffer from insufficient adoption rates or inadequate usage patterns. Here we present a novel way of modelling different contact tracing strategies using a generalized multi-site mean-field model, which can naturally assess the impact of both manual and digital approaches. Our methodology can readily be applied to any compartmental formulation, thus enabling the study of several complex pathogens.

It is almost always associated with cirrhosis and it is usually diagnosed in later stages of the disease. Furthermore, recurrence rate following liver transplantation ranges between 15 and 30%. The most important factor determining the recurrence is vascular invasion. METHODS: In this review, the issue of microvascular invasion causing hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence is reviewed. Macroscopic vascular invasion is almost easy to diagnose on radiologic evaluation. However, microscopic vascular invasion is almost always diagnosed with pathologic evaluation. On the other hand, microscopic vascular invasion is associated with early recurrences and reduced disease-free survival. The type of vessel that is invaded determines the nature of the spread of the tumor cells. Invasion of the hepatic venous tributaries leads to systemic metastasis whereas portal venous invasions lead to intrahepatic spread of the tumor. Microscopic vascular invasion should be diagnosed before liver transplantation or liver resection in order to deliver the appropriate therapy to the patients. RESULTS: Yet, there is no ideal marker to suggest microscopic vascular invasion before any intervention. Markers such as alpha-fetoprotein, des carboxy prothrombin, or gamma-glutamyl transferase have been found to be correlated with microscopic vascular invasion. These parameters are not very efficient to be used in routine clinical practice.

By modeling common performance characteristics of available diagnostic and sequencing tests, we developed a model that assesses the sampling required to detect emerging strains when they are less than 1% of all strains in a population. This model demonstrates that 5% sampling of all positive tests allows the detection of emerging strains when they are a prevalence of 0.1% to 1.0%. While each country will determine their risk tolerance for the emergence of novel strains, as vaccines are distributed and we work to end the pandemic and prevent future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, genomic surveillance will be an integral part of success.","output":"Genomic surveillance at scale is required to detect newly emerging strains at an early timepoint"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a clinical diagnosis with proteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia and oedema.

Opioid reduction is inherent in enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols, but little work has evaluated ERAS in these cases. OBJECTIVE To determine if ERAS could reduce postoperative opioid utilization in ambulatory anorectal surgery without sacrificing patient pain or satisfaction. METHODS A randomized controlled trial assigned ambulatory anorectal patients to ERAS (experimental) or routine care (surgeon's choice) for pain management (control) over 30-days postoperatively. Primary outcome was overall days of opioid use. Secondary outcomes included pain and satisfaction scores over multiple time points and new persistent opioid use. The Visual Analog Scale, Functional Pain Scale, and EQ-5D-3L measured patient-reported pain and satisfaction. Univariate analysis compared outcomes overall and at individual time points. Two-way mixed ANOVA evaluated pain and satisfaction measures between groups and over time. RESULTS Thirty-two patients were randomized into each arm (64 total). The control group consumed significantly more opioids after discharge(median 121.3MME vs 23.5MME, P < 0.001). Significantly more control patients requested additional narcotics (P = 0.004), made unplanned calls (P = 0.009), and had unplanned clinic visits (P = 0.003). The control group had significantly more days on opioids (mean 14.4 vs 2.2, P < 0.001). Three control patients (9.4%) versus no experimental patients had new persistent opioid use. The mean global health, EQ5D-3L, Visual Analog Scale, and Functional Pain scores were comparable between groups over time.

The Austrian Competence and Service Agency for Self-help ?KUSS was created as part of the framework of the concept for public promotion of self-help. It developed an advanced training program for the systematic support of nationwide self-help organizations (NSHO). The article describes the conceptual development of an advanced training program and discusses how to deal with ambivalences arising in the process. METHOD: Three training tracks were derived from the objectives of the concept for the public promotion of self-help (promoting the visibility of self-help organizations, strengthening self-help organizations in their activities, and patient participation). To determine the contents, the advanced training needs of NSHO were identified on the basis of process-produced data (including feedback forms), relevant literature, and the results of workshops with self-help representatives. An Internet search was conducted to build on existing offerings. The ?KUSS concept was developed in several workshops with representatives of self-help organizations and its contents and framework conditions were discussed. RESULTS: Training Track 1 \\"Strengthening self-help activities\\" aims to strengthen the self-image of NSHO as a self-help organization and to support the implementation of activities with introductory seminars and additional workshops. Training Track 2 \\"Promoting cooperation\\" supports the meeting and dialogue between NSHO representatives and experts with expert dialogues and annual projects. Training Track 3 \\"Strengthening collective patient participation\\" prepares NSHO representatives for participation in health policy decision-making processes in a modular course. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: During the development process, ambivalences in a social, factual, time and space dimension were dealt with: On the social dimension, the aim was to take decisions regarding the objectives, form and content of the continuing education program as closely as possible to the participants and to offer low-threshold participation. On the factual level, the focus was on the competence of those affected and/or the transfer of competence for implementing activities. In terms of time, a balance had to be struck between the time resources available to the NSHO representatives and the time required to develop competence. In terms of space, on-site events were preferred to online events (before COVID-19). Finally, a different approach was chosen for each training track. For the further development of the advanced training program, a piloting and a participatory development with NSHO representatives is recommended.","output":"[Advanced training program seeking to strengthen nationwide self-help organizations: development of the ?KUSS advanced training concept]./ Bundesweit t?tige Selbsthilfeorganisationen durch Weiterbildung st?rken: Die Entwicklung des ?KUSS-Weiterbildungskonzepts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first case of coronavirus disease19 (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China, as of March 2, 2020, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 was 89,069 cases in 67 countries and regions.

Cryptosporidium species are causative agents for cryptosporidiosis. The presently available chemotherapeutic options are not fully effective in curbing the menace of disease in all patients. The deprived experimental traceability of the pathogen, lack of a suitable in-vivo model are few factors that hindered the development of reliable chemotherapeutic options despite continuous efforts. The underway COVID-19 pandemic widens this gap as most of the scientific resources and researches shifted priority. The genome sequencing of the Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) has discovered many new targets, such as Inosine 5-Monophosphate Dehydrogenase (IMPDH), Lactate Dehydrogenase and many more. The parasite uses the host adenosine pool to synthesize guanine nucleotide in a streamlined pathway, where IMPDH catalyzes the first rate-limiting step. The present study aims to discover new anti-cryptosporidial agents that work against the IMPDH of the parasite. Methodology and results: In this study, The PharmaGist (https://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PharmaGist/) tool was deployed for the pharmacophore model generation employing previously reported Cryptosporidium parvum IMPDH (CpIMPDH) inhibitors having IC50 values ranging from 0.009 M to 0.028 M. The model having the highest scores was used as a 3D query for high throughput screening of the Zinc database via ZINC pharmer (http://zincpharmer.csb.pitt.edu/) tool.

METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of consecutive patients who underwent SMA stenting with EPDs from 2007 to 2016. EPDs were used selectively in patients with occlusions, severe calcification, or acute thrombus. A two-wire technique with SpiderFX 0.014-inch filter wire (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn) combined with a 0.018-inch wire was used to provide support and to facilitate stenting and EPD retrieval. Presence of macroscopic debris in the EPD was recorded and graded as minor (minimal debris) or major (large thrombus or plaque). End points were technical success, presence of EPD debris, embolization, early morbidity, and mortality. RESULTS SMA stenting was performed in 179 patients, of whom 65 (36%) had EPDs. The mean age was 73  11 years, and 49 were female (75%). Clinical presentation was CMI in 48 patients (74%) and AMI or acute-on-CMI in 17 (26%). Indications for EPD were severe calcification in 22 patients (34%), acute thrombus in 18 (28%), and total occlusion in 16 (25%). Bare-metal stents were used in 33 patients, covered stents in 26, and both types in 6. Adjunctive therapy included thrombolysis in seven patients, thrombectomy in four, and atherectomy in three. Technical success was 100%. There were no instances of filter retention or arterial trauma due to filter manipulation. Distal embolization was noted in four patients (6%), of whom two had AMI. All large emboli were retrieved using catheter aspiration devices, but one small distal embolus was left untreated with no clinical consequences. Two patients had vessel spasm treated by nitroglycerin. Macroscopic debris was noted in 43 patients (66%) and was major in 21 (49%) or minor in 22 (51%). Of the patients with AMI, five (29%) required exploratory laparotomy and four (23%) had bowel resection. Eight additional patients (12%) had early complications (five CMI, three AMI), including cardiac complications, brachial hematoma, acute cholecystitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in two patients each. There were no deaths among CMI patients and two early deaths (12%) among those who had AMI. CONCLUSIONS Use of EPDs during SMA stenting is safe and feasible with a two-wire technique. Large macroscopic debris was noted in one-third of the patients when the filter was applied selectively in patients with acute symptoms, occlusions, or severely calcified lesions. Despite the use of EPD, distal embolization occurred in 6% of patients and was successfully treated using catheter aspiration devices.","output":"Superior mesenteric artery stenting using embolic protection device for treatment of acute or chronic mesenteric ischemia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ramucirumab is approved both as monotherapy and in combination with Paclitaxel for advanced gastric cancer in patients with disease progression after chemotherapy.

A synergistic action was also observed in the expression of proteins crucial for cell motility, microtubule organization and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, synergistic inhibition of VEGFR2 expression was obtained by the drug combination. These findings highlighted the importance of the combined treatment to strongly inhibit all the main molecules of both PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK pathways thus preventing possible reactivations due to cross-talk phenomena.

Risk factors for COVID-19 include asthma, elderly age, being pregnant, having any underlying diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and experiencing lifelong systemic racism. Recently, connections to certain genes have also been found, although the susceptibility has not yet been established. We aimed to investigate the available evidence for the genetic susceptibility to COVID-19. METHODS: This study was a systematic review of current evidence to investigate the genetic susceptibility of COVID-19. By systematic search and utilizing the keywords in the online databases including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct, we retrieved all the related papers and reports published in English from December 2019 to September 2020. RESULTS: According to the findings, COVID-19 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for cell entry. Previous studies have shown that people with ACE2 polymorphism who have type 2 transmembrane serine proteases (TMPRSS2) are at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, two studies have shown that males are more likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 than females. Besides, research has also shown that patients possessing HLA-B*15:03 genotype may become immune to the infection. CONCLUSION: Combing through the genome, several genes related to immune system's response were related to the severity and susceptibility to the COVID-19.

The population of E. coli O157:H7 in the faces decreased dramatically in all calves during the first 2 weeks after inoculation. Thereafter, small populations of E. coli O157:H7 persisted in all calves, where they were detected intermittently in the feces and rumen contents. While withholding food increased fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 by 1 to 2 log10/g in three of four calves previously shedding small populations of E. coli O157:H7, the effect of fasting on fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 was variable in calves shedding larger populations.

Introduction and objectives Despite advances in treatment, patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) still exhibit unfavorable short- and long-term prognoses. In addition, there is scant evidence about the clinical outcomes of patients with AMI and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The objective of this study was to describe the clinical presentation, complications, and risk factors for mortality in patients admitted for AMI during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This prospective, multicenter, cohort study included all consecutive patients with AMI who underwent coronary angiography in a 30-day period corresponding chronologically with the COVID-19 outbreak (March 15 to April 15, 2020). Clinical presentations and outcomes were compared between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. The effect of COVID-19 on mortality was assessed by propensity score matching and with a multivariate logistic regression model. Results In total, 187 patients were admitted for AMI, 111 with ST-segment elevation AMI and 76 with non-ST-segment elevation AMI. Of these, 32 (17%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. GRACE score, Killip-Kimball classification, and several inflammatory markers were significantly higher in COVID-19-positive patients. Total and cardiovascular mortality were also significantly higher in COVID-19-positive patients (25% vs 3.8% [P < .001] and 15.2% vs 1.8% [P = .001], respectively).

Outcomes were registered on the day of operation (day 0), on postoperative days 1, 2, 3 and 30, and 12 months after surgery. Blinding of the patients was maintained until day 3. The primary endpoint was pain on movement measured on a visual analogue scale, reported repeatedly by the patient until day 3. RESULTS The intention-to-treat population comprised 59 patients in the SLC and 58 in the MLC group. There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to any of the pain-related outcomes, on-demand administration of opioids or general discomfort. Median duration of surgery was 325 min longer in the SLC group (P < 0001). SLC was associated with a reduced incidence of vomiting on day 0 (7 versus 22 per cent; P = 0019). The incidences of wound-related problems were comparable. One patient in the SLC group experienced a biliary leak requiring endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

METHODS The parent study assessed performance of two methods of external fetal heart rate monitoring (abdominal fetal electrocardiogram and Doppler ultrasound) and of uterine contraction monitoring (electrohystero-graphy and tocodynamometry) compared with internal monitoring with fetal scalp electrode and intrauterine pressure transducer. Reliability of external techniques was assessed by the success rate and positive percent agreement with internal methods. Bland-Altman analysis determined accuracy. We analyzed data from that study according to maternal body mass index. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES We assessed the relationship between body mass index and monitor performance with linear regression, using body mass index as the independent variable and measures of reliability and accuracy as dependent variables. RESULTS There was no significant association between maternal body mass index and any measure of reliability or accuracy for abdominal fetal electrocardiogram.

Our aim is to further explore the relationship between fluid balance and prognosis in patients with sepsis on a daily basis for 5 days. METHODS: Sepsis patients in eICU Collaborative Research Database were divided into the negative balance group (NB/?) and the positive balance group (PB/+) according to daily fluid balance. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Survival differences between the groups were analyzed by using Cox regression. Then dose-response relationship between fluid balance and in-hospital mortality was studied using restricted cubic splines (RCSs). Furthermore, patients with fluid balance data for the previous three consecutive days were selected and divided into eight groups (+/+/+, +/+/?, +/ ?/?, +/ ?/+, ?/ ?/?, ?/ ?/+, ?/+/+, and ?/+/?). KaplanCMeier curves and Cox regression were used to show the survival difference between groups. RESULTS: Our study, which included 19,557 patients in a multicenter database, showed that positive fluid balances on days 1, 2, and 3 after sepsis diagnosis were associated with poor prognosis with the HRs of 1.29 (1.20,1.40), 1.13 (1.01,1.27), and 1.25 (1.08,1.44), respectively, while the fluid balance on days 4 and 5 had no effect on the primary outcome. Then RCSs showed an overall trend that the risk of in-hospital mortality on days 1, 2, and 3 increased with increasing fluid balance. For three consecutive days of fluid balance, we studied 9205 patients and KaplanCMeier curves revealed survival differences among patients in the eight groups. The cox model demonstrated that compared with the +/+/+ group, the +/ ?/?, ?/ ?/?, ?/ ?/+, ?/+/+, and ?/+/? groups had a lower risk of in-hospital mortality, with HRs of 0.65 (0.45,0.93), 0.72 (0.60,0.86), 0.63 (0.43,0.93), 0.69 (0.48,0.98), and 0.63 (0.42,0.96), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with sepsis, positive fluid balance on days 1, 2, and 3 was associated with adverse outcomes.

In particular, dynamic model ensembles pick the most accurate model for each query object, by applying the model that performed best on similar data. Dynamic model ensembles may however suffer, similarly to single machine learning models, from bias, which can eventually lead to unfair treatment of certain groups of a general population. To mitigate unfair classification, recent work has thus proposed fair model ensembles, that instead of focusing (solely) on accuracy also optimize global fairness. While such global fairness globally minimizes bias, imbalances may persist in different regions of the data, e.g., caused by some local bias maxima leading to local unfairness. Therefore, we extend our previous work by including a framework that bridges the gap between dynamic model ensembles and fair model ensembles. More precisely, we investigate the problem of devising locally fair and accurate dynamic model ensembles, which ultimately optimize for equal opportunity of similar subjects.

We aimed to evaluate the impact FIT had on resource allocation and patient diagnoses in the first three months of use. METHOD All colorectal two-week wait patient referrals were posted a pack requesting FIT and notification of telephone consultation. A pre-paid envelope was included for return of samples. At consultation, FIT was incorporated with the presenting symptoms to guide investigation choice and triage urgency. FIT 10 g/g was interpreted as positive. Outcome data was collected prospectively and compared with retrospective audit data from pre-pandemic levels across three months. RESULTS From 26th March 2020 to 2nd July there were 381 referrals who were invited to provide FIT samples and underwent telephone consultations. 358 FIT samples were returned (94%).

The study was stopped early as data revealed a 22% relative reduction in mortality rate when using 6 ml/kg tidal volume. The current generation of critical care ventilators allows the tidal volume to be set during volume-targeted, assist/control (volume A/C); however, some ventilators include options that may prevent the tidal volume from being controlled. The purpose of this bench study was to evaluate the delivered tidal volume, when these options are active, in a spontaneously breathing lung model using an electronic breathing simulator. METHODS Four ventilators were evaluated: CareFusion AVEA (AVEA), Dr?ger Evita? XL (Evita XL), Covidien Puritan Bennett? 840(TM) (PB 840), and Maquet SERVO-i (SERVO-i). Each ventilator was connected to the Hans Rudolph Electronic Breathing Simulator at an amplitude of 0 cm H2O and then 10 cm H2O. All four ventilators were set to deliver volume A/C, tidal volume 400 ml, respiratory rate 20 bpm, positive end-expiratory pressure 5 cm H2O, peak flowrate 60 L/min. The displayed tidal volume was recorded for each ventilator at the above settings with additional options OFF and then ON. RESULTS The AVEA has two options in volume A/C: demand breaths and V-sync. When activated, these options allow the patient to exceed the set tidal volume. When using the Evita XL, the option AutoFlow can be turned ON or OFF, and when this option is ON, the tidal volume may vary. The PB 840 does not have any additional options that affect volume delivery, and it maintains the set tidal volume regardless of patient effort. The SERVO-i's demand valve allows additional flow if the patient's inspiratory flowrate exceeds the set flowrate, increasing the delivered tidal volume; this option can be turned OFF with the latest software upgrade. CONCLUSIONS Modern ventilators have an increasing number of optional settings. These settings may increase the delivered tidal volume and disrupt a low tidal-volume strategy.

These concerns are coupled with the variable levels of preventive, therapeutic, and protective measures, such as the recent imposition of the sanitary pass in some but not all countries. Given the lack of a universal policy in its application, the recently reported short-lived vaccine-induced protective immunity of a few months duration, the consequent growing number of newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases in the most vaccinated countries, the equal spread of the Delta variant among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, the significantly lesser virulence of the Delta variant as reflected by the lower rate of hospitalization and death, and the recent admission by the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention of the poor specificity of the COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction diagnostic panel in detection of SARS-CoV-2, this scientifically unfounded sanitary pass, based on recently emerging data from the most vaccinated countries, not only seems obsolete but can also be regarded as a tool of indirect coercion, forcing vaccination on those who may be vaccine prudent, therefore jeopardizing the essence of an individual's freedom of choice that is guaranteed by all international laws.

ABSTRACT Introduction Rotavirus is the main cause of severe diarrhea in children aged less than 5 years, leading to elevated morbidity and mortality worldwide. The aim of the present study was to determine the etiology of enteric viruses reported to the Catalan Microbiology Notification System (CMNS) (rotavirus and adenovirus 40-41) and to evaluate the importance of these viruses in enteric disease. Material and methods We retrospectively reviewed the notifications made from 1995-2002 by the laboratories of hospitals participating in the CMNS. Cases of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) were diagnosed by antigen detection in stools. The variables analyzed were: age, sex, month, and year of isolation. Statistical analysis was performed using the X2 test and Fisher's test and proportions were compared using the binomial test. The level of statistical significance was set at 0.05. Results Rotavirus was detected in 6708 cases of AGE (94.3%) and adenovirus 40-41 in 409 (5.7%). Viral AGE produced greater morbidity in children aged less than 2 years with 76% of cases caused by rotavi-rus and 68% of those caused by adenovirus 40-41 occurring in this age group. Rotavirus was isolated mainly in winter (68%), while adenovi-rus, although stable throughout the seasons, was more frequent in autumn (35.2%). Of cases of bacterial and viral enteritis detected by the CMNS, rotavirus was the second etiological agent and adenovirus the fourth in children aged less than 5 years after Campylobacter and Salmonella. Conclusions Of the various viruses that can cause AGE, some are highly frequent, such as calcivirus and astrovirus, which are not systematically detected and consequently the frequencies reported in the present study should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, rotavirus is the main cause of viral AGE, affecting small children, especially infants aged 1-11 months, with a clear predominance in winter. Adenovirus 40-41 mainly affects children aged less than 2 years and is more frequent in autumn. Vaccination against rotavirus should be a priority to reduce the high rates of morbidity and mortality caused by this disease.","output":"Rotavirus y adenovirus 40C41 como causantes de gastroenteritis infantil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This Special Issue is associated with the European Conference on Integrated Optics (ECIO) The ECIO 2020 conference was held on June 23C24, 2020, and was initially scheduled in Paris, France Due to the health and safety concerns related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the conference organizing committee has decided to adopt a digital conference format The particularity of ECIO 2020 was to only have live talks in order to favor at maximum the interactions between speakers and attendees This conference, organized by the Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, Paris-Saclay UniversityCNRS, was the 22nd in a series that started in London in 1981 It attracted 640 participants from all over the world, with 103 oral presentations, including 2 plenary talks, 5 keynotes, 14 invited, 45 regular, and 57 poster speakers The conference covered a diverse range of subjects in integrated optics and optoelectronics","output":"Guest Editorial JQE Special Virtual Issue Dedicated to the 22nd European Conference on Integrated Optics (ECIO)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study presents a paradigm shift in the air cargo market based on Korea and Incheon Airport&rsquo;s empirical data The air cargo market has traditionally handled expensive items and has been a supplier-oriented market There has been little room for individual customers in this market However, &ldquo;value&rdquo;gradually replaces &ldquo;price&rdquo;in this market The value depending on consumer preferences significantly impact air cargo demand Consequently, items transported by air cargo are changing, and airlines and other market participants are revising operation policy Economic growth may be losing its dominant power as the main growth engine in the air cargo market This study identifies the weakened link between air cargo increase and economic growth based on the Granger causality test COVID-19 calls for a deeper understanding of the paradigm shift in the market for sustainable air transport because COVID-19 will further stimulate it In this regard, the air cargo business, which maintains a stable trend even during COVID-19, is seen as a new opportunity for the aviation industry Since sustainable air transport requires an accurate understanding of the paradigm shift in the air cargo market, this study enhances our knowledge of the paradigm shift and provides significant implications for sustainable air transport","output":"Investigating Paradigm Shift from Price to Value in the Air Cargo Market"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The oncology field, like many others, is digitalizing rapidly, a phenomenon that may have been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Pus characteristics may be the first step in diagnosing the pathogens. The degree of severity of an infection determines the oral or parenteral route of administration. As a rule, antibiotic therapy has to be checked after 2C3 days. The grouping of the different ENT infections with a similar spectrum of pathogens gives a better view of the therapeutic principles and reduces repetitions.

Public health measures that can reduce the risk of infection and death in addition to quarantines are desperately needed. This article reviews the roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections, knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza and COVID-19, and how vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce risk. Through several mechanisms, vitamin D can reduce risk of infections. Those mechanisms include inducing cathelicidins and defensins that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs, leading to pneumonia, as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not. Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration. To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended that people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D(3) for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d. The goal should be to raise 25(OH)D concentrations above 40C60 ng/mL (100C150 nmol/L). For treatment of people who become infected with COVID-19, higher vitamin D(3) doses might be useful. Randomized controlled trials and large population studies should be conducted to evaluate these recommendations.","output":"Evidence that Vitamin D Supplementation Could Reduce Risk of Influenza and COVID-19 Infections and Deaths"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1301 Table 1PDSA Cycles 1 Launch of Quiz Night.

The data sources included were (i) longitudinal clinical, pharmacokinetic (PK), and virologic data from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who received HCQ with or without azithromycin (n = 116), (ii) in vitro viral replication data and SARS-CoV-2 viral load inhibition by HCQ, (iii) a population PK model of HCQ, and (iv) a model relating chloroquine PKs to corrected QT (QTc) prolongation. A mechanistic PK/virologic/QTc model for HCQ was developed and externally validated to predict SARS-CoV-2 rate of viral decline and QTc prolongation. SARS-CoV-2 viral decline was associated with HCQ PKs (P < 0.001). The extrapolated patient half-maximal effective concentration (EC50 ) was 4.7 M, comparable to the reported in vitro EC50s .

There were 117 patients in the RYGB group and 121 in the SG group; two patients had to be excluded after randomization. Both study groups were comparable regarding age, gender, BMI, and comorbidities. RESULTS There was no 30-day mortality. The median operating time was significantly shorter in the SG group (66 min vs. 94 min, p < 0.001). All complications were recorded thoroughly. There were 7 (5.8 %) major complications following SG and 11 (9.4 %) after RYGB (p = 0.292). Nine (7.4 %) SG patients and 20 (17.1 %) RYGB patients had minor complications (p = 0.023). The overall morbidity was 13.2 % after SG and 26.5 % after RYGB (p = 0.010). There were three (2.5 %) early reoperations after SG and four (3.3 %) after RYGB (p = 0.719). CONCLUSIONS At 30-day analysis SG is associated with a shorter operating time and fewer early minor complications compared to RYGB. There were no significant differences in major complications or early reoperations. Long-term follow-up is required to determine the effect on weight loss, resolution of obesity-related comorbidities, and improvement of quality of life.","output":"SLEEVEPASS: a randomized prospective multicenter study comparing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass in the treatment of morbid obesity: preliminary results."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This technical report describes a dynamic causal model of the spread of coronavirus through a population.

Here we provide key elements towards better quality control of 3D-printed ventilation fittings in a context of sanitary crisis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five 3D-printed designs were assessed for non-intentional (junctional and parietal) and intentional leaks: 4 fittings 3D-printed in-house using FDeposition Modelling (FDM), 1 FDM 3D-printed fitting provided by an independent maker, and 2 fittings 3D-printed in-house using Polyjet technology. Five industrial models were included as controls. Two values of wall thickness and the use of coating were tested for in-house FDM-printed devices. RESULTS: Industrial and Polyjet-printed fittings had no parietal and junctional leaks, and satisfactory intentional leaks. In-house FDM-printed fittings had constant parietal leaks without coating, but this post-treatment method was efficient in controlling parietal sealing, even in devices with thinner walls (0.7 mm vs 2.3 mm). Nevertheless, the use of coating systematically induced absent or insufficient intentional leaks. Junctional leaks were constant with FDM-printed fittings but could be controlled using rubber junctions rather than usual rigid junctions. The properties of Polyjet-printed and FDM-printed fittings were stable over a period of 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: 3D-printing is a valid technology to produce ventilation devices but requires care in the choice of printing methods, raw materials, and post-treatment procedures. Even in a context of sanitary crisis, devices produced outside hospitals should be used only after professional quality control, with precise data available on printing protocols. The mechanical properties of ventilation devices are crucial for efficient ventilation, avoiding rebreathing of CO(2,) and preventing the dispersion of viral particles that can contaminate health professionals.

We present a lateral flow immunoassay kit based on a selenium nanoparticle-modified SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, which detects anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in human serum, and the results can be read by the naked eye in 10 minutes. We expressed and purified the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein in HEK293 cells, with a purity of 98.14% and a concentration of 5 mg mL-1. Selenium nanoparticles were synthesized by l-ascorbic acid reduction of seleninic acid at room temperature. After conjugation with the nucleoprotein, a lateral flow kit was successfully prepared. The IgM and IgG detection limits of the lateral flow kit reached 20 ng mL-1 and 5 ng mL-1, respectively, in human serum. A clinical study sample comprising 90 COVID-19-diagnosed patients and 263 non-infected controls was used to demonstrate a sensitivity and specificity of 93.33% and 97.34%, respectively, based on RT-PCR and clinical results. No cross-reactions with rheumatoid factor and positive serum for anti-nuclear antibodies, influenza A, and influenza B were observed. Moreover, the lateral flow kit remained stable after storage for 30 days at 37 C.

Persistent activation of pDCs has been demonstrated in a number of autoimmune diseases. To evaluate the potential benefit of depleting pDCs in autoimmunity, a monoclonal antibody targeting the pDC-specific marker immunoglobulin-like transcript 7 was generated. This antibody, known as VIB7734, which was engineered for enhanced effector function, mediated rapid and potent depletion of pDCs through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In cynomolgus monkeys, treatment with VIB7734 reduced pDCs in blood below the lower limit of normal by day 1 after the first dose. In two phase 1 studies in patients with autoimmune diseases, VIB7734 demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, comparable to that of placebo. In individuals with cutaneous lupus, VIB7734 profoundly reduced both circulating and tissue-resident pDCs, with a 97.6% median reduction in skin pDCs at study day 85 in VIB7734-treated participants. Reductions in pDCs in the skin correlated with a decrease in local type I IFN activity as well as improvements in clinical disease activity.

With several sectors of the economy adopting digital transformation initiatives to deal with the pandemic, we consider digital resilience in the market for fitness clubs and gyms. The traditional economics of the fitness industry made them less vulnerable to digital disruption, pre pandemic. The pandemic also shifted patterns of human mobility, where gyms operating model was suddenly negatively impacted by digital substitution. We consider how these businesses adapted by being entrepreneurially alert and digitally agile in adopting virtualization and greater social media enabled connections with consumers, and how digitization substitutes for co-presence in the relationship between consumers and fitness centers. We examine these issues using a fairly granular data on foot traffic from Safegraph and combining it with data from Google Places, supplemented with hand collected data from individual websites. The empirical challenge is that of disentangling the impact of digital resilience on economic indicators of the well-being of a business, given that small businesses are prone to failure, and that COVID has been a worldwide shock impacting aggregate economic statistics. The mandated lockdowns and re-openings across states provide us with a natural experiment to examine the impact of digital substitution and digital resilience in the fitness sector. By using hand-collected data from each individual gym, we can uniquely identify whether each gym offers virtual services, and if these services were offered in response to the lockdown. Compared to gyms, dentist establishments offer services that are almost impossible to virtualize and have more of an inelastic demand. We therefore conduct a difference-in-difference analysis to quantify the digital resilience for fitness centers, compared to dental establishments. We find that compared to dental services, gyms with virtual services see about 38% displacement in footfalls post-pandemic. By using another set of hand collected data, we examine whether this observed displacement is robust to alternative explanations such as the ownership structures or franchise arrangements in the fitness sector, the distance traveled by consumers, local political partisanship etc.","output":"No Pain, No Gain: Examining the Digital Resilience of the Fitness Sector During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The early adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and ability to monitor longitudinal outcomes is a major strength of the New Zealand healthcare system Individual-level patient databases spanning an array of hospital investigations are a resource for identifying novel disease phenotypes, cohort studies, treatment-outcome relationships and predictive analytics using machine learning Method: 75,617 patients undergoing echocardiography were identified (2009 and 2018) from an Excelera database and linked with ECG metadata, ICD10 coding, laboratory data, Pyxis prescribing, Paceart Optima data, and genetic data Machine learning (Labs, advanced ECG (A-ECG), echocardiography) was performed to predict heart failure diagnosis and readmission, LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD), mortality and ICD use Multiomics was applied to discrete cohorts identifying novel biomarkers and disease patterns Results: Linking multiple rich datasets was plausible and resulted in broad but sparse data Labs predicted heart failure diagnosis (AUC 0 94, sensitivity 74%, specificity 94%, Phi 0 58) and readmissions (AUC 0 87, sensitivity of 62%, specificity 98%, Phi 0 18) A-ECG predicted LVSD (AUC 0 92, 95% CI 0 86 to 0 96, P&lt;0 0001), mortality and ICD use Deep learning (DL) applied to echo images derived metrics similar to a human reader, at x30 the speed DL discriminated HFpEF from healthy (AUC0 99), and k-means clustering identifed 3 phenogroups within HFpEF that had varying outcomes Metabolomics identified novel biomarkers of heart failure e g breath acetone Conclusion: Existing clinical data is a rich source of information for machine learning and has significant potential for impacting on clinical care More resources should be applied to this area","output":"Multiscale Predictive Modelling in Heart Failure: Machine Learning Applied to Big Data, Imaging and Multiomics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) is the considerable contributor to major complications after pancreatectomy.

Methods In this retrospective study, 263 patients who underwent DP at Ningbo Medical Center Li Huili Hospital between January 2011 and January 2020 were reviewed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Patients' demographics and clinical parameters were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses to identify the risk factors contributing to CR-POPF.

While efforts to quickly identify effective antiviral therapies have focused largely on repurposing existing drugs1-4, the current standard of care, remdesivir, remains the only authorized antiviral intervention of COVID-19 and provides only modest clinical benefits5. Here we show that water-soluble derivatives of -tocopherol have potent antiviral activity and synergize with remdesivir as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Through an artificial-intelligence-driven in silico screen and in vitro viral inhibition assay, we identified D--tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) as an effective antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 and {beta}-coronaviruses more broadly that also displays strong synergy with remdesivir. We subsequently determined that TPGS and other water-soluble derivatives of -tocopherol inhibit the transcriptional activity of purified SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and identified affinity binding sites for these compounds within a conserved, hydrophobic interface between SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 7 and nonstructural protein 8 that is functionally implicated in the assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp6. In summary, we conclude that solubilizing modifications to -tocopherol allow it to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, making it an effective antiviral molecule alone and even more so in combination with remdesivir. These findings are significant given that many tocopherol derivatives, including TPGS, are considered safe for humans, orally bioavailable, and dramatically enhance the activity of the only approved antiviral for SARS-CoV-2 infection7-9.","output":"Water-soluble tocopherol derivatives inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the last decades, Harmful Cyanobacterial Blooms (HCBs) represent one of the most conspicuous hazards to human health in freshwater ecosystems, due to the uses of the water for drinking, recreation and aquaculture.

In England, some individuals received a ChAdOx1-S booster where vaccination with mRNA vaccines was clinically contraindicated. Methods The demographic characteristics of those who received a ChAdOx1-S booster were compared to those who received a BNT162b2 booster. A test-negative case control design was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness of the ChAdOx1-S booster against symptomatic disease and hospitalisation in England. Findings Those who received a ChAdOx1-S booster were more likely to be female (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.67 (1.64-1.71)), in a clinical risk group (adjusted OR 1.58 (1.54-1.63)), in the CEV group (adjusted OR 1.84 (1.79-1.89)) or severely immunosuppressed (adjusted OR 2.05 (1.96-2.13)).

Results: After repeated invitations, the participation rate was 40% (N=794) of SARS-CoV-2 positive, 26% (N=7993) of negative, and 22% (N=4369) of untested randomly selected invitees. All participants completed the baseline questionnaire as a part of inclusion. The follow-up period was 248 days (SD=18) from baseline, and the follow-up questionnaire was completed by 75% of SARS-CoV-2 positive participants, 65% of negative participants, and 73% of untested randomly selected participants. At follow-up, 49 (11.5%) of the SARS-CoV-2 positive participants reported memory problems in contrast to 173 (4.1%) of the SARS-CoV-2 negative participants and 65 (2.4%) of the untested randomly selected participants. In a multivariate model, SARS-CoV-2 positivity remained strongly associated with reporting memory problems at eight months follow-up compared to the SARS-CoV-2 negative group (odds ratio (OR) 4.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.8-5.2) and the untested group (OR 4.9, 95% CI 3.4-7.2). Compared to the other groups, SARS-CoV-2 positive participants also reported more concentration problems and a significant worsening of health compared to one year ago at follow-up. Feeling depressed, less energy, or pain were reported relatively equally by the different groups. Summary: We find that 11.5% of COVID-19 patients experience memory problems eight months after the disease. SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, and the long-term consequences of infections are therefore unknown. Our results show that a relatively high proportion of non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients report memory problems eight months after the disease.","output":"Self-reported Memory Problems Eight Months after Non-Hospitalized COVID-19 in a Large Cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To assess patient needs and concerns after head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treatment and their possible correlations with long-term quality of life (QoL) and to examine the potential impact of psychological distress on these results. METHODS: Alive and disease-free HNSCC patients at least 1 year after treatment were enrolled in this cross-sectional multicentric study and completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 and H&N35 QoL questionnaires, the head and neck cancer-specific patient concerns inventory (PCI-HN) questionnaire and the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS). Correlations between QoL outcomes and patient needs and concerns were investigated using Spearman's correlation tests. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients were enrolled in the study. Fear of cancer recurrence was the main patient concern followed by dental, salivary, fatigue, speech, and eating problems. The leading patient needs in terms of consultation were to be referred to the surgeon, the speech, and swallow therapist and the oral rehabilitation team. The number of patient concerns correlated negatively (r < .40) with functioning scales score and positively (r > .40) with general and head and neck symptoms. Psychological distress was the main determinant of QoL outcomes (p < .0001). We found a significant impact of gender (p = .002) on the number of patient concerns, and of patient age (p = .003) on the number of staff members selected by patients.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the preparedness for COVID-19 by PHCWs in Rivers State, Nigeria. Method: A cross-sectional survey was conducted involving the healthcare workers at the public primary healthcare facilities across the 23 local government areas (LGAs) of Rivers State, Nigeria. The descriptive statistics of mean  standard deviation and percentage were used to present quantitative and categorical variables respectively. The preparedness for COVID-19 was measured by knowledge, attitude and preventive practices (KAP) towards the disease. The association between the KAP and demographic characteristics was tested with the Chi-square test, while the associations existing among the KAP constituents were evaluated with the Pearson correlation coefficient. Statistical significance was evaluated at P<0.05. Results: : Out of 460 questionnaires distributed, 412 respondents participated in the survey, indicating a response rate of 89.6%. The proportion of respondents with good scores in knowledge, attitude, and COVID-19 related practices was 86.4% (10.66  2.40), 85.0% (8.28  1.94), and 97.3% (8.34  1.39) respectively.

The pandemic caused by the novel Corona virus affected the lives of people and economies of almost all nations in a manner no one could have ever fathomed. Unexpected and unprecedented changes have occurred in the way we work, study, interact, travel and many aspects of the way we humans lead our lives.The period of lockdown was a difficult period for everyone, more so for the youth, as they were forced to remain indoors, now no longer being able to physically interact with their friends,go to college, visit malls, socialize, pursue pass-times and hobbies or generally have a life that the younger generation is used to.Academic activities initially came to a standstill before shifting to online mode which was new to both, teachers and students. The objective of the current questionnaire-based study was to find out the perceived stress levels during the COVID-19 lockdown among the students and how capable they think they are to cope with these testing times. This survey was undertaken among the students from first to final year of a dental college in Nasik, Maharashtra in the first phase of lockdown in India from 22 Mar 2020 to 14 April 2020. A pretested self-administered questionnaire using Google forms was used for the data collection after getting approval from the Institutional Ethical Committee. Students from all the four years reported being stressed and academic factors were one of the most important stressors. During the lockdown, portion completion, delay in academic activities, uncertainties of the disease and the impending exams were the main causes of anxiety and stress. Continuous student engagement during the period and the availability of a staff to discuss and talk out a problem helped in a big way.It is suggested that mental health of college students should be monitored during such unusual circumstances as the pandemic. The introduction of stress management education into the curriculum could prove useful to the students to help them deal with any such situation in the future. ? 2021 Oriental Scientific Publishing Company.

Many countries have enforced 2 - 4 weeks' lockdown and are extending the period depending on their current disease scenario. Most probably the 14-day period of estimated communicability of COVID-19 prompted such decision. But the idea that, if the susceptible population drops below certain threshold, the infection would naturally die out in small communities after a fixed time (following the outbreak), unless the disease is reintroduced from outside, was proposed by Bartlett in 1957. This threshold was termed as Critical Community Size (CCS). Methods: We propose an SEIR model that explains COVID-19 disease dynamics. Using our model, we have calculated country-specific expected time to extinction (TTE) and CCS that would essentially determine the ideal number of lockdown days required and size of quarantined population. Findings: With the given country-wise rates of death, recovery and other parameters, we have identified that, if at a place the total number of susceptible population drops below CCS, infection will cease to exist after a period of TTE days, unless it is introduced from outside. But the disease will almost die out much sooner. We have calculated the country-specific estimate of the ideal number of lockdown days. Thus, smaller lockdown phase is sufficient to contain COVID-19. On a cautionary note, our model indicates another rise in infection almost a year later but on a lesser magnitude.","output":"Critical community size for COVID-19 -- a model based approach to provide a rationale behind the lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late March to April 2020 residential aged care facilities (RAC) in Australia were under COVID-19 lockdown This paper explores whether the resultant restrictions on entry and exit and elimination of site group activities within RACs impacted on the total electricity use, peak demand and electrical load profiles Six RACs in four different climate zones are analysed, comparing historical electricity load and demand profiles with the lockdown period The facilities in warm regions showed largest reductions in energy use and peak demands There was a peak demand timing shift in temperate regions and hot regions changes were negligible for energy use or peak demands This study revealed the limitations of using aggregate data as the key performance indicator (KPI) C energy use per bed Also, KPIs in relation to cooling degree days (or total cooling and heating degree days) have been examined and are not recommended for temperate regions or temperate seasons The potential CO2 emission reduction from onsite renewable generation is quantified Further research is to investigate energy use changes at circuit levels under lockdowns, and develop more nuanced KPIs that include the rate of energy use and the timing of that use","output":"Has COVID-19 lockdown impacted on aged care energy use and demand?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid increase in illicit drug use and its adverse health effects and socio-economic consequences have reached alarming proportions in recent years.

SICUs have been extremely stressed during the pandemic, but most data regarding critically ill COVID-19 patients come from intensive care units (ICUs). Studies about COVID-19 patients in SICUs are lacking. Setting and participants: The study included 88 COVID-19 patients admitted to our SICU in Cuneo, Italy, between March and May 2020. Measurements: Clinical and ventilatory data were collected, and patients were divided by outcome. Multivariable logistic regression analysis examined the variables associated with negative outcomes (transfer to the ICU, palliation, or death in a SICU). Results: A total of 60 patients (68%) had a positive outcome, and 28 patients (32%) had a negative outcome;69 patients (78%) underwent continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Pronation (n=37 [42%]) had been more frequently adopted in patients who had a positive outcome vs a negative outcome (n=30 [50%] vs n=7 [25%];P=.048), and the median (interquartile range) Pao2 /Fio2 ratio after 6 hours of prone positioning was lower in patients who had a negative outcome vs a positive outcome (144 [140-168] vs 249 [195268], P=.006).

Studies suggest that there are many differences between men and women in the immune response to CoV-19 infection and inflammatory diseases. Women, compared to men, are less susceptible to viral infections based on a different innate immunity, steroid hormones and factors related to sex chromosomes. The presence of two X chromosomes in women emphasize the immune system even if one is inactive. The immune regulatory genes encoded by X chromosome in female gender causes lower viral load levels, and less inflammation than in man, while CD4+ T cells are higher with better immune response. In addition, women generally produce higher levels of antibodies which remain in the circulation longer. The levels of activation of the immune cells are higher in women than in men, and it is correlated with the trigger of TLR7 and the production of IFN. TLR7 is higher in women than in men and its biallelic expression leads to higher immune responses and increases the resistance to viral infections. TLR7 is expressed in innate immune cells which recognizes single strand RNA virus by promoting the production of antibodies against the virus and the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and IL-1 family members. Moreover, in women the production of inflammatory IL-6 after viral infection is lower than in males and is often correlated with a better longevity. In addition, on the X chromosome there are loci that code for the genes involved in the regulation of immune cells such as FOXP3, and transcription factor for Treg involved in virus pathogenesis. The X chromosome influences the immune system by acting on many other proteins, including TLR8, CD40L and CXCR3 which can be over-expressed in women, and influence the response to viral infections and vaccinations. However, the biallelic expression of the X-linked genes can promote harmful autoimmune and inflammatory responses. Cardiovascular diseases are more frequent in males and subjects without cardiovascular dysfunctions infected by CoV-19 have a better prognosis. ACE2 is a receptor for CoV-19 and protects lung damage. CoV-19 infection and the virus's Spike protein inhibit the expression of ACE2, abolishing its protective function. Inhibitors of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACEI) are used to stem the devastating effects of CoV-19, to increase the number of CD3 and CD8 T cells and to reduce the viral load and IL-6 levels that control CoV-19 replication via NF-?B, but these effects are still under study. It is hoped that certain drugs, such as CoV-19 receptor blockers, anti-inflammatories (against rheumatic diseases), monoclonal antibodies, anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6, the remdesevir drug (analogue adenosine, effective against ebola), hydroxychloroquine (for the treatment of malaria) and vaccines, will open up new strategies and new therapeutic ways to combat this terrible virus.","output":"Coronavirus COV-19/SARS-CoV-2 affects women less than men: clinical response to viral infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report reveals the effects of salt on the photosynthetic electron transport and transcriptome of the glycophyte Setaria viridis (S. viridis) and its salt-tolerant close relative halophyte Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora). S. viridis was unable to survive exposed to sodium chloride (NaCl) levels higher than 100 mM, in contrast, S. alterniflora could tolerate NaCl up to 550 mM, with negligible effect on gas exchange related parameters and conductance of electrons transport chain (gETC). Under salt, the prompt fluorescence (OJIP-curves) exhibits an increase in the O- and J-steps in S. viridis and much less for S. alterniflora. Flowing NaCl stress, a dramatic decline in the photosystem II (PSII) primary photochemistry was observed for S. viridis, as reflected by the drastic drop in Fv/Fm, Fv/Fo and &#934;PSII; however, no substantial change was recorded for these parameters in S. alterniflora. Interestingly, we found an increase in the primary PSII photochemistry (&#934;PSII) for S. alterniflora with increasing either NaCl concentration or NaCl treatment duration. The NPQ magnitude was strongly enhanced for S. viridis even at a low NaCl (50 mM); however, it remains unchangeable or slightly increased for S. alterniflora at NaCl levels above 400 mM. After NaCl treatment, we found an increase in both the proportion of oxidized P700 and the amount of active P700 in S. viridis and almost no change for S. alterniflora. Under salt, the net photosynthetic rate (A) and stomatal conductance (gs) measurements demonstrate that A decreases earlier in S. viridis, even after one week exposure to only 50 mM NaCl; in contrast, in S. alterniflora, the effect of NaCl on A and gs was minor even after exposure for two weeks to high NaCl levels. For S. viridis exposed to 50 mM NaCl for 12 d, carbon dioxide (CO2) at a concentration of 2000a?La?L-1 could not fully restore A to the control (Ctrl) level. Conversely, in S. alterniflora, high CO2 can fully restore A for all NaCl treatments except at 550 mM. RNA-seq data shows a major impact of NaCl on metabolic pathways in S. viridis and we found a number of transcription factors potentially related to NaCl responses. For S. alterniflora, no major changes in the transcriptomic levels were recorded under NaCl stress. To confirm our data analysis of RNA-seq, we performed quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis for randomly selected four genes for each species (8 genes in total) and we found that our results (up- and/or down-regulated genes) are fully consistent and match well our RNA-seq data.

For a heavy cultural question, in Italy there has been a delay in society with respect to the idea of equal opportunities between men and women. Italy remains far from the watchword - mainstreaming - which Europe, on the other hand, has begun to develop and disseminate. And it is a European document that for the first time introduces the theme of the right to the city for women. There is certainly no shortage of innovative cases also promoted by female figures in Italian local administrations. In practice, however, a systematic overview is lacking. Apart from the issue of sustainable mobility, temporal policies are particularly important for a gender sensitive territorial planning. The interesting and innovative aspect is the transversality of the temporal dimension, both in the lives of individuals and in the social organization of urban space. The lockdown canceled the diversification of the times of daily life and the use of urban space: time considered a certain fact, never questioned, has become a precious, quality asset;through new rhythms for a new urban livability and mostly for a better life of women. For this to happen, however, the city must change its skin, it must change its thinking and above all its rhythms.

Mask and gloves are mandatory for patients. A visit is scheduled every 60 minutes to allow the sanitation of the rooms. The day before the visit patients are contacted by telephone for the Covid-19 risk triage. In the presence of symptoms the visit is postponed. In the presence of other risk factors a IgG/IgM Rapid Test for Covid-19 is performed on admission to the clinic. In the presence of fever, if an extraordinary rapid test cannot be performed, the visit must be postponed. Rapid test positive patients cannot be visited: they are placed in solitary confinement at their home waiting for a nasopharyngeal swab for Covid-19. When the rapid test is positive, immediate room sanitation also occurs. The rooms dedicated to the outpatient clinic as well as medical and not medical instruments are disinfected.

The consequences may be fatal, or result in lasting downstream organ damage. Therefore, assessment of endogenous fibrinolytic status in an individual may identify those at risk of occlusive thrombus formation and provide prognostic information. Arterial thrombi are more platelet-rich and more resistant to fibrinolysis than venous thrombi. Several recent studies using global tests of fibrinolysis in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) have shown that despite dual antiplatelet therapy, patients with impaired fibrinolytic status have an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, compared to those with effective fibrinolytic function. Such data add significantly to the predictive value of established cardiovascular risk factors and conventional biomarkers. Most data reported have been obtained with the Global Thrombosis Test and the turbidimetric plasma clot lysis assay. A few small studies in patients with ischaemic stroke suggest a similar predictive role of fibrinolytic status assessment in these patients. Studies reporting an association between impaired fibrinolysis and future venous thrombotic events are limited, and in the form of case-control studies. Viscoelastic assays may have a role in the prediction of venous thromboembolic risk. Assays of fibrinolytic function should be used to obtain a more accurate risk of future thrombotic events, particularly in the setting of ACS. The availability of point-of-care tests helps facilitate this and should encourage future studies to assess personalised antithrombotic treatment combinations to optimise fibrinolytic status and reduce thrombosis risk.","output":"Endogenous fibrinolysis-Relevance to clinical thrombosis risk assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"6 cases of neurovascular treatment with remote assistance are presented. various techniques (zoom, smart glasses and hospital internal system) 2 aneurysm treatments with flow diversion are presented. 1 case with web device. and 3 cases of stroke.All cases occurred during the covid 19 pandemic.Multiple tests were carried out during the simulation courses.

We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on procedural volumes and on the emotional well-being of endoscopy trainees worldwide. METHODS: An international survey was disseminated over a 3-week period in April 2020. The primary outcome was the percentage reduction in monthly procedure volume before and during COVID-19. Secondary outcomes included potential variation of COVID-19 impact between different continents and rates and predictors of anxiety and burnout among trainees. RESULTS: Across 770 trainees from 63 countries, 93.8% reported a reduction in endoscopy case volume. The median percentage reduction in total procedures was 99% (interquartile range, 85%-100%), which varied internationally (P < .001) and was greatest for colonoscopy procedures. Restrictions in case volume and trainee activity were common barriers. A total of 71.9% were concerned that the COVID-19 pandemic could prolonged training. Anxiety was reported in 52.4% of respondents and burnout in 18.8%. Anxiety was independently associated with female gender (odds ratio [OR], 2.15; P < .001), adequacy of personal protective equipment (OR, 1.75; P = .005), lack of institutional support for emotional health (OR, 1.67; P = .008), and concerns regarding prolongation of training (OR, 1.60; P = .013). Modifying existing national guidelines to support adequate endoscopy training during the pandemic was supported by 68.9%.

METHODS Between July 2010 and July 2011, 15 patients (all men; mean age 60.79.1 years) underwent endovascular treatment of 17 infrainguinal CTOs that were resistant to guidewire passage, so the blunt microdissection catheter was employed to recanalize the artery. Fourteen lesions were de novo and 3 were in-stent restenoses. Sixteen lesions were in the superficial femoral artery; 8 of 17 CTOs were TASC II type D. Extensive calcification was present in 12 lesions. Mean lesion length was 182.966.2 mm (range 57-296). RESULTS Procedural success was 100% and successful crossing without the use of a re-entry device (technical success) was achieved in 15 cases. Twelve lesions were stented. Average fluoroscopy time was 36.521.2 minutes (143.876.9 Gy*cm (2) radiaton dose area product), during which a mean 172.162.2 mL of iodinated contrast were used. Two patients had access site hematomas that were treated conservatively, and there was no perforation, distal embolization, amputation, or need for urgent revascularization.

As is known to all, septic heart disease occurs because pathogens invading the blood stimulate the activation of endothelial cells, causing a large number of white blood cells to accumulate and trigger an immune response. However, in severe sepsis, the hematopoietic system is inhibited, and there will also be a decline in white blood cells, at which time the autoimmune system will also be suppressed. During the immune response, a large number of inflammatory factors are released into cells to participate in the inflammatory process, which ultimately damages cardiac myocytes and leads to impaired cardiac function. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a common RNA modification in mRNA and non-coding RNA that affects RNA splicing, translation, stability, and epigenetic effects of some non-coding RNAs. A large number of emerging evidences demonstrated m6A modification had been involved in multiple biological processes, especially for sepsis and immune disorders. Unfortunately, there are limited results provided to analyze the association between m6A modification and sepsis-induced cardiovascular dysfunction (SICD). In this review, we firstly summarized current evidences on how m6A mediates the pathophysiological process in cardiac development and cardiomyopathy to emphasize the importance of RNA methylation in maintaining heart biogenesis and homeostasis. Then, we clarified the participants of m6A modification in extended inflammatory responses and immune system activation, which are the dominant and initial changes secondary to sepsis attack. After that, we deeply analyzed the top causes of SICD and identified the activation of inflammatory cytokines, endothelial cell dysfunction, and mitochondrial failure. Thus, the highlight of this review is that we systematically collected all the related potential mechanisms between m6A modification and SICD causes. Although there is lack of direct evidences on SICD, indirect evidences had been demonstrated case by case on every particular molecular mechanism and signal transduction, which require further explorations into the potential links among the listed mechanisms.

Some cardiac defects may be associated with a poor COVID-19 outcome. Risk estimation in ACHD is currently based on expert opinion. The aim of this study was to collect clinical outcome data and to identify risk factors for a complicated course of COVID-19 in patients with ACHD. METHODS: Twenty-five ACHD centres in nine European countries participated in the study. Consecutive patients with ACHD diagnosed with COVID-19 presenting to one of the participating centres between 27 March and 6 June 2020 were included. A complicated disease course was defined as hospitalisation for COVID-19 requiring non-invasive or invasive ventilation and/or inotropic support, or a fatal outcome. RESULTS: Of 105 patients with a mean age of 3813 years (58% women), 13 had a complicated disease course, of whom 5 died.

BACKGROUND: Clinicians, patients, and researchers depend on valid measurements of medication adherence to inform the delivery of preemptive care when needed. Technology is routinely used for monitoring medication adherence in both clinical practice and research, yet there is a dearth of research comparing novel App based approaches to traditional approaches used for assessing medication adherence. METHODS: Adherence rates were captured on both the EM and the App for 3697 daily observations from 44 participants with acute coronary syndrome over 90 days immediately following discharge from acute care. For EM, adherence was measured using EM equipped pill bottles. For the App, adherence was measured by having participants upload daily photos to the App prior to taking their daily aspirin. Agreement was assessed using a Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: The mean adherence rate was higher on the App, 92%, than the EM, 78% (p < 0.001). The mean difference in adherence rates between these methods was 14% (95% Confidence Interval: -23%, -5%).

Taiwan's success during the COVID-19 outbreak is well known and the use of social media is one of the key contributing factors to that success. OBJECTIVE: This nationwide observational study in Taiwan aimed to explore the use of Facebook by academic medical centers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide observational study of all Facebook fan page posts culled from the official accounts of all medical centers in Taiwan from December 2019 to April 2020. All Facebook posts were categorized into either COVID-19-related posts or non-COVID-19-related posts. COVID-19-related posts were split into 4 categories: policy of Taiwan's Center for Disease Control (TCDC), gratitude notes, news and regulations from hospitals, and education. Data from each post was also recorded as follows: date of post, headline, number of \\"likes,\\" number of messages left, number of shares, video or non-video post, and date of search. RESULTS: The Facebook fan pages of 13 academic medical centers, with a total of 1816 posts, were analyzed. From January 2020, the percentage of COVID-19 posts increased rapidly, from 21% (January 2020) to 56.3% (April 2020). The trends of cumulative COVID-19 posts and reported confirmed cases were significantly related (Pearson correlation coefficient=0.93, P<.001). Pages from private hospitals had more COVID-19 posts (362 versus 289), as well as more video posts (72 posts, 19.9% versus 36 posts, 12.5%, P=.011), when compared to public hospitals. However, Facebook pages from public hospitals had significantly more \\"likes,\\" comments, and shares per post (314, 5, 14, respectively, P<.001). Additionally, medical centers from different regions displayed different strategies for using video posts on Facebook. CONCLUSIONS: Social media has been a useful tool for communication during the COVID-19 pandemic. This nationwide observational study has helped demonstrate the value of Facebook for academic medical centers in Taiwan, along with its engagement efficacy. We believe that the experience of Taiwan and the knowledge it can share will be helpful to health care organizations worldwide during our global battle against COVID-19.","output":"Use of Facebook by Academic Medical Centers in Taiwan During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Dysmenorrhea is one of the most prevalent gynecological disorders, experienced by approximately two third of young women during menstruation. According to literature, nutrition can play a key role in the prevalence and severity of dysmenorrhea. This study aims to investigate the relation between dietary patterns and the risk of dysmenorrhea among university students. METHODS A nested case control study was conducted among 293 students of Urmia University of Medical Sciences who were randomly recruited via a proportional cluster sampling method. From 293 students, 46 students with moderate to severe dysmenorrhea and 54 students without dysmenorrhea were assigned to the case and control groups, respectively. The major dietary patterns of students were identified by factor analysis and the association between dietary patterns and risk of dysmenorrhea was investigated using logistic regression analysis in SPSS 20. RESULTS Three major dietary patterns were found and nominated as \\"Lacto-vegetarian\\", \\"Snacks\\" and \\"Mixed food items\\" patterns. After controlling for family history of dysmenorrhea, subjects in the second and third tertiles of \\"snacks\\" pattern had a 4.23 (95% CI = 1.32-13.58, P = 0.01) and 3.41 (95% CI = 1.10-10.50, P = 0.03) times, respectively, higher chance to experience moderate to severe dysmenorrhea in comparison with subjects in the first tertile.

Affinity purification of these complexes, often using antibodies, followed by mass spectrometry (MS) has revolutionized our ability to identify the composition of MCs. However, conventional immunoprecipitations suffer from contaminating antibody/serum-derived peptides that limit the sensitivity of detection for low-abundant interacting partners using MS. Here, we present AptA-MS (aptamer affinity-mass spectrometry), a robust strategy primarily using a specific, high-affinity RNA aptamer against Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) to identify interactors of a GFP-tagged protein of interest by high-resolution MS. Utilizing this approach, we have identified the known molecular chaperones that interact with human Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1), and observed an increased association with several proteins upon heat shock, including translation elongation factors and histones. HSF1 is known to be regulated by multiple post-translational modifications (PTMs), and we observe both known and new sites of modifications on HSF1. We show that AptA-MS provides a dramatic target enrichment and detection sensitivity in evolutionarily diverse organisms and allows identification of PTMs without the need for modification-specific enrichments. In combination with the expanding libraries of GFP-tagged cell lines, this strategy offers a general, inexpensive, and high-resolution alternative to conventional approaches for studying MCs.","output":"RNA aptamer capture of macromolecular complexes for mass spectrometry analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The public health response to COVID-19 in many countries has involved strict restrictions on movement and economic activity which threaten the livelihoods of economically vulnerable households In response, governments are adopting emergency economic measures to provide households with some safety net We provide an overview of the policies that could form a comprehensive social protection strategy in low-income and middle-income countries, with examples of specific policies that have been adopted Our core argument is that these countries can cast an emergency safety net with extensive coverage if they use a broader patchwork of solutions than higher-income countries These strategies could include expanding their social insurance system, building on existing social assistance programmes, and involving local governments and non-state institutions to identify and assist vulnerable groups who are otherwise harder to reach","output":"Social protection response to the COVID-19 crisis: options for developing countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) glycoprotein neutralization site 1 (also referred as G(1) protein), is a critical protein responsible for virus infectivity and eliciting immune-protection, however, binding peptides of BEFV G(1) protein are still unclear. Thus, the aim of the present study was to screen specific polypeptides, which bind BEFV G(1) protein with high-affinity and inhibit BEFV replication. METHODS: The purified BEFV G(1) was coated and then reacted with the M13-based Ph.D.-7 phage random display library. The peptides for target binding were automated sequenced after four rounds of enrichment biopanning. The amino acid sequences of polypeptide displayed on positive clones were deduced and the affinity of positive polypeptides with BEFV G(1) was assayed by ELISA. Then the roles of specific G(1)-binding peptides in the context of BEFV infection were analyzed. RESULTS: The results showed that 27 specific peptide ligands displaying 11 different amino acid sequences were obtained, and the T18 and T25 clone had a higher affinity to G(1) protein than the other clones. Then their antiviral roles of two phage clones (T25 and T18) showed that both phage polypeptide T25 and T18 exerted inhibition on BEFV replication compared to control group. Moreover, synthetic peptide based on T18 (HSIRYDF) and T25 (YSLRSDY) alone or combined use on BEFV replication showed that the synthetic peptides could effectively inhibit the formation of cytopathic plaque and significantly inhibit BEFV RNA replication in a dose-dependent manner.

JHMV has a markedly greater neurotropism for weanling BALB/c mice than does A59V. Both viruses display one-hit kinetics when grown in vitro in 17CL-16 cells, a clone of BALB/c3T3 cells. Virus-specific intranuclear, cytoplasmic, and surface antigens have been observed for both viruses by immunofluorescence. The intranuclear antigen appears first at about 2 hr after infection (hpi) followed by the development of the cytoplasmic and surface antigens at 3 hpi at 38.5. Most, if not all cells that develop the intranuclear antigen, produce cytoplasmic antigen and presumably progeny virus. Progeny virus production is independent of cell fusion and formation of syncytia. Virus-specific ribonucleoprotein is synthesized in the presence of 1 g/ml actinomycin D, a concentration sufficient to inhibit the synthesis of cellular ribonucleoprotein species that have sedimentation properties similar to the virus-specific species. The virus-specific ribonucleoprotein species that is resistant to 10 mM EDTA, presumptive virion ribonucleoprotein, has a sedimentation value in sucrose of about 230 S for JHMV and 200 S for A59V. The species of virus-specific ribonucleoprotein that are sensitive to 10 mM EDTA presumptive messenger ribonucleoprotein, are about 40C100 S in sucrose for both viruses. The purified presumptive virion RNA is about 50 S in sucrose for both viruses. The major species of presumptive mRNA of both viruses is about 18 S with secondary species of about 28 S in sucrose.

The role of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in exacerbations of asthma or the influence of preexisting viral or allergic airway inflammation on the development of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is largely unknown. To address this, we compared molecular mechanisms of HDM, RV and SARS-CoV-2 interactions in experimental RV infection in patients with asthma and healthy individuals. RV infection was sensed via retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) helicase, but not via NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), which led to subsequent apoptosis-associated speck like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) recruitment, oligomerization and RIG-I inflammasome activation. This phenomenon was augmented in bronchial epithelium in patients with asthma, especially upon pre-exposure to HDM, which itself induced a priming step, pro-IL-1{beta} release and early inhibition of RIG-I/TANK binding kinase 1/I{kappa}B kinase{varepsilon} /type I/III interferons (RIG-I/TBK1/IKK{varepsilon}/IFN-I/III) responses. Excessive activation of RIG-I inflammasomes was partially responsible for the alteration and persistence of type I/III IFN responses, prolonged viral clearance and unresolved inflammation in asthma. RV/HDM-induced sustained IFN I/III responses initially restricted SARS- CoV-2 replication in epithelium of patients with asthma, but even this limited infection with SARS-CoV-2 augmented RIG-I inflammasome activation. Timely inhibition of the epithelial RIG-I inflammasome and reduction of IL-1{beta} signaling may lead to more efficient viral clearance and lower the burden of RV and SARS- CoV-2 infection.","output":"Epithelial RIG-I inflammasome activation suppresses antiviral immunity and promotes inflammatory responses in virus-induced asthma exacerbations and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using recent data from voluntary mass testing, I provide credible bounds on prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 for Austrian counties in early December 2020.

This is particularly relevant for mass SARS-CoV-2 testing as these are conducted with rapid Antigen tests, which are known to be somewhat imprecise. Using insights from the literature on partial identification, I propose a framework addressing both issues at once. I use the framework to study differing selection assumptions for the Austrian data.

The situation is very complex as the COVID-19 test kits are limited, therefore, more diagnostic methods must be developed urgently. A significant initial step towards the successful diagnosis of the COVID-19 is the chest X-ray or Computed Tomography (CT), where any chest anomalies (e.g., lung inflammation) can be easily identified. Most hospitals possess X-ray or CT imaging equipments that can be used for early detection of COVID-19. Motivated by this, various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been developed to identify COVID-19 positive patients using the chest X-ray or CT images. However, the advance of these AI-based systems and their highly tailored results are strongly bonded to high-end GPUs, which is not widely available in several countries.

The proposed deep learning model is built carefully and fine-tuned by removing all unnecessary parameters and layers to achieve the light-weight attribute that could run smoothly on a normal CPU (0.54% of AlexNet parameters). This model is highly beneficial for countries where high-end GPUs are luxuries.

OBJECTIVES To explore the perspectives of a group of final-year nursing students who were hired on the basis of a relief contract for health professionals during the first COVID-19 outbreak, regarding their learning process and their mixed role as students and novice nurses. DESIGN A qualitative exploratory study was conducted. SETTINGS The Nursing Department of the European University of Madrid, and the Red Cross College of Nursing. PARTICIPANTS Eighteen nursing students were recruited, aged between 18 and 65 years old, enrolled in the fourth year of Nursing Studies and who were hired under a relief contract for health professionals during the pandemic. METHODS Purposive sampling was used. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were carried out using a question guide. Interviews were conducted in a private video chat room platform. Also, a thematic, inductive analysis was performed. This study was conducted according to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research and the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research. RESULTS Four specific themes emerged: a) The students' role during the relief contract; b) The learning process during the pandemic; c) Barriers to learning; and d) A unique learning opportunity. The students had an undefined mixed role, which hindered their skills and activities. Learning was self-directed, sometimes through trial and error, and through experiencing critical events. Time constraints and having to learn under pressure were experienced as difficulties for learning. Nevertheless, this was a unique professional learning opportunity. The students learned to be organized and effective, acknowledge their limitations, gain confidence, face their fears, and mature.

Carotid CTA is a routine acute stroke investigation and includes the lung apices. We evaluated CTA as a potential COVID-19 diagnostic imaging biomarker. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a multicenter, retrospective study (n = 225) including CTAs of patients with suspected acute stroke from 3 hyperacute stroke units (March-April 2020). We evaluated the reliability and accuracy of candidate diagnostic imaging biomarkers. Demographics, clinical features, and risk factors for COVID-19 and stroke were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistics. RESULTS Apical ground-glass opacification was present in 22.2% (50/225) of patients. Ground-glass opacification had high interrater reliability (Fleiss  = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.95) and, compared with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, had good diagnostic performance (sensitivity, 75% [95% CI, 56-87]; specificity, 81% [95% CI, 71-88]; OR = 11.65 [95% CI, 4.14-32.78]; P < .001) on multivariate analysis. In contrast, all other contemporaneous demographic, clinical, and imaging features available at CTA were not diagnostic for COVID-19. The presence of apical ground-glass opacification was an independent predictor of increased 30-day mortality (18.0% versus 5.7%, P = .017; hazard ratio = 3.51; 95% CI, 1.42-8.66; P = .006). CONCLUSIONS We identified a simple, reliable, and accurate COVID-19 diagnostic and prognostic imaging biomarker obtained from CTA lung apices: the presence or absence of ground-glass opacification.

DESIGN: Secondary analysis of intervention studies. SETTING: Internet-based guided tinnitus intervention provided in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 228 individuals who underwent ICBT. INTERVENTIONS: ICBT. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The key predictor variables included demographic, tinnitus, hearing-related and treatment-related variables as well as clinical factors (eg, anxiety, depression, insomnia), which can have an impact on the treatment outcome. A 13-point reduction in Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) scores has been defined as a successful outcome. RESULTS: Of the 228 subjects who were included in the study, 65% had a successful ICBT outcome. As per the univariate analysis, participants with a masters degree or above had the highest odds of having a larger reduction in tinnitus severity (OR 3.47; 95% CI 1.32 to 12.51), compared with the participants who had education only up to high school or less. Additionally, the baseline tinnitus severity was found to be a significant variable (OR 2.65; 95% CI 1.50 to 4.67) contributing to a successful outcome with the intervention. Both linear and logistic regression models have identified education level and baseline tinnitus severity to be significant predictor variables contributing to a reduction in tinnitus severity post-ICBT. As per the linear regression model, participants who had received disability allowance had shown a 25.3-point lower TFI reduction compared with those who did not experience a decrease in their workload due to tinnitus after adjusting for baseline tinnitus severity and their education level.

In particular, two classification systems have been proposed: clinical classification, comprising primary (P-CIS), concomitant (C-CIS), and secondary (S-CIS) disease, and pathological classification, comprising P-CIS, cTa-CIS, and cT1-CIS. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of both classifications on BCG response, recurrence-free survival (RFS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS). PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of 386 patients with bladder CIS, with or without associated cTa/cT1 disease, treated with BCG instillations between 2008 and 2015. Patients were stratified according to the two classification systems. Cox multivariate regression models were used to assess the impact of these subtypes on BCG response, RFS, PFS, OS, and CSS. We also performed a cumulative meta-analysis according to PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS The median follow-up was 70.5 months. According to the clinical classification, 34 (8.8%) patients had P-CIS, 81 (21%) S-CIS, and 271 (70.2%) C-CIS. The pathological classification showed 34 (8.8%) patients to have P-CIS, 190 (49.2%) cTa-CIS, and 162 (42%) cT1-CIS. In the overall cohort, BCG response was reported in 296 (76.7%); 159 (41.2%) had recurrence, 55 (14.2%) had progression, and 67 (17.4%) underwent radical cystectomy. Death from any cause was recorded in 135 (35%) and death from urothelial carcinoma in 38 (9.9%). Cox multivariate regression analysis showed that neither clinical classification nor pathological classification is an independent predictive factor for BCG response, RFS, PFS, OS, or CSS after adjusting for confounders. In the pooled meta-analysis, two studies and the present series were included for evidence synthesis, recruiting a total of 941 patients. We found no statistically significant difference across the groups for both classifications with respect to BCG response, RFS, PFS, and CSS.

At present, single-image super-resolution (SISR) models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) generally have problems such as the loss of high-frequency information and the large size of the model due to the deep network structure. METHODS: In this work, we propose an optimization model based on multi-window back-projection residual network (MWSR), which outperforms most of the state-of-the-art methods. Firstly, we use multi-window to refine the same feature map at the same time to obtain richer high/low frequency information, and fuse and filter out the features needed by the deep network. Then, we develop a back-projection network based on the dilated convolution, using up-projection and down-projection modules to extract image features. Finally, we merge several repeated and continuous residual modules with global features, merge the information flow through the network, and input them to the reconstruction module. RESULTS: The proposed method shows the superiority over the state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark dataset, and generates clear COVID-19 CT super-resolution images. CONCLUSION: Both subjective visual effects and objective evaluation indicators are improved, and the model specifications are optimized. Therefore, the MWSR method can improve the clarity of CT images of COVID-19 and effectively assist the diagnosis and quantitative assessment of COVID-19.","output":"Multi-window back-projection residual networks for reconstructing COVID-19 CT super-resolution images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic of Covid-19 since its emergence in December 2019.

Using these models, we validated the early tropism of the virus in the lung and demonstrated that SARS-CoV2 can infect brainstem and cerebellum, mainly by targeting granular neurons. Viral infection induced specific interferon and innate immune responses with patterns specific to each organ along with apoptotic, necroptotic, and pyroptotic cell death.

This study aimed to identify and explore the challenges and burdens of frontline healthcare workers during the current pandemic, and to help prepare workforce support plans for them now and in the future. METHODS: A qualitative systematic review method involving thematic synthesis without meta-analysis was used to analyze relevant studies from five databases from November 2020 to February 2021: MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL Complete, Embase through Ovid, Scopus, and Web of Science. The quality of the studies was evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program Qualitative Research Checklist appraisal tools. This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA statement. The informants are healthcare workers working at the frontlines and providing care to COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Ten studies revealed the burden of healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic, with having the related challenges experienced by 498 participants (doctors, nurses, pediatric nurses, paramedical staff, support staff, and physiotherapists). Our findings fell into four main themes as follows: inadequate preparedness; emotional challenges; insufficient equipment and information; and work burnout. CONCLUSION: The study results demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on all aspects of life, especially for healthcare providers, who work on the frontlines. The pandemic has affected the frontline workers physical and psychological health, causing them to experience emotional distress such as fear, anxiety, depression, and stress.

METHODS: Data were collected through an online survey of 327 Muslim men across the Aceh Province, Indonesia, from April 21, 2020, to May 2, 2020. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the paired t-test were employed to compare the uptake of protective behaviors in public and mosques. RESULTS: The adoption of protective behaviors was higher in public rather than in mosques. It further revealed that the understanding of Islamic teachings during the pandemic has influenced perceived risk and the way Muslim men comply with the protective guidelines. Those who have complete, incomplete, or no compliance of precautionary behaviors have their own interpretation of Islamic teachings that inform their individual actions to manage the risk.

We performed hierarchical regressions, entering sociodemographic characteristics in a first block and coparenting dimensions in a second block. Results showed that (i) a higher number of children and having younger children are linked to higher burnout; (ii) coparenting exposure to conflict is related to higher burnout, whereas endorsement of the partner's parenting is related to lower burnout; and (iii) no interaction effect occurs between sociodemographic characteristics and coparenting variables. Coparenting thus significantly contributes to the occurrence of burnout syndrome. Working on the coparental relationship preventively in parental educational programs or at a relational systemic level in therapy may help prevent burnout. Treating one parent only may not be sufficient to alleviate burnout, as negative coparenting could counter the effect of individual therapy.","output":"When not teaming up puts parents at risk: Coparenting and parental burnout in dual-parent heterosexual families in Switzerland."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time. To date, there is no curative treatment for COVID-19, and with vaccines only recently being rolled out predominantly in wealthy countries, prevention still remains the main strategy.

As is the case in many other countries, the Ethiopian government has declared a state of emergency and taken several measures to impose social distancing. The level of compliance with social distancing measures in Ethiopia is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the compliance, barriers, and facilitators to social distancing measures for the prevention of COVID-19 in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional survey using telephone interview triangulated by a qualitative study was conducted over a period of one month from April 20th to May 20th, 2020 at the University of Gondar Hospital in Gondar, Ethiopia. A total of 401 randomly selected participants, and 12 key representative informants selected by convenience were included for the quantitative and qualitative studies, respectively. Information on socio-demographic factors, knowledge about COVID-19, and practices concerning preventive measures--particularly social distancing--was collected. Respondents were asked what they thought were the barriers and facilitators of social distancing during in-depth face-to-face interviews. Data were entered and analyzed using Epi-data and Stata software, respectively. Frequencies and odds ratios were analyzed. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant, and a confidence level of 95% strength of association was used. Results: A total of 425 study subjects were approached and 401 responded positively (response rate of 94.4%). Of the 401 study participants, 55.4% (95% CI 50.4, 60.2) reported poor compliance with social distancing measures. The mean age of the participants was 36.4 years (SD  11.8). The majority of participants (63.84%) reported that they went to crowded places without putting on a face mask. Of the participants, 243 (60.6%) and 306 (76.3%) had good knowledge on COVID-19 transmission and prevention, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that only age (AOR= 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00-1.04) was significantly associated with social distancing measures, with older persons more likely than younger to comply with social distancing guidelines. Conclusion: The majority of the study's participants reported poor compliance with social distancing measures set by the government and health authorities.

Objective: There is early evidence about Valproic acid (VPA) antiviral effect. Our aim was to investigate the incidence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in VPA users as compared with the general population. Material and Methods: A case-control study nested within a cohort, carried out between March 1 and December 17, 2020. Retrospectively, we identified confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection patients exposed to VPA in our health department (defined as case). We ascertained VPA regimen (all the time (AT)(292 days) or at least 20% of the study period (notAT)(58 days) and if VPA levels were in therapeutic range (ATR) (50-100 mcg/mL) in the last 24 months. We calculated the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospital admission in the cases, comparing it with the general unexposed VPA population (controls). Results: During the study period, 6183 PCR+ were detected among 281035 inhabitants, of these, 746 were hospitalized. 691 patients were on VPA notAT and 628 (90.1%) AT.

Sooty mangabeys (SMs), a reservoir host for SIV, do not develop disease following SIV infection, unlike nonnatural HIV-infected human or SIV-infected rhesus macaque (RM) hosts. SIV infections of SMs are characterized by an absence of chronic immune activation, in association with significantly reduced IFN- production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) following exposure to SIV or other defined TLR7 or TLR9 ligands. In this study, we demonstrate that SM pDCs produce significantly less IFN- following ex vivo exposure to the live attenuated yellow fever virus 17D strain vaccine, a virus that we show is also recognized by TLR7, than do RM or human pDCs. Furthermore, in contrast to RMs, SMs mount limited activation of innate immune responses and adaptive T cell proliferative responses, along with only transient antiviral Ab responses, following infection with yellow fever vaccine 17D strain. However, SMs do raise significant and durable cellular and humoral immune responses comparable to those seen in RMs when infected with modified vaccinia Ankara, a virus whose immunogenicity does not require TLR7/9 recognition. Hence, differences in the pattern of TLR7 signaling and type I IFN production by pDCs between primate species play an important role in determining their ability to mount and maintain innate and adaptive immune responses to specific viruses, and they may also contribute to determining whether disease follows infection.","output":"Distinctive TLR7 signaling, type I IFN production, and attenuated innate and adaptive immune responses to yellow fever virus in a primate reservoir host."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In dementia research and in clinical practice, the COVID-19 pandemic represents an important challenge, not only for neurological staff and researchers, but above all for patients and their caregivers.

We enriched clinical mutation data by systematically mining 2,472,725 scientific articles from PubMed Central in order to gather information about the HBV mutational landscape. By performing this analysis, we were able to identify mutational hotspots for each HBV genotype (A-E) and gene (C, X, P, S), as well as the location of disulfide bonds associated with these mutations. Through a modelling study, we also identified a mutational position common in both the clinical data and the literature that is located at the binding pocket for a known anti-HBV drug, namely entecavir. The results of this novel approach shows the potential of integrated analyses to assist in the development of new drugs for viral diseases that are more robust to resistance.

This study explores the acceptability and psychometric properties of a co-developed tool, Me and My Baby (MaMB). STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional design was applied. The MaMB was administered universally (in two sites) with mothers during routine 6C8-week Health Visitor contacts. The sample comprised 467 mothers (434 MaMB completers and 33 non-completers). Dimensionality of instrument responses were evaluated via exploratory and confirmatory ordinal factor analyses. Item response modeling was conducted via a Rasch calibration to evaluate how the tool conformed to principles of fundamental measurement. Tool acceptability was evaluated via completion rates and comparing completers and non-completers demographic differences on age, parity, ethnicity, and English as an additional language. Free-text comments were summarized. Data sharing agreements and data management were compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation, and University of York data management policies. RESULTS: High completion rates suggested the MaMB was acceptable. Psychometric analyses showed the response data to be an excellent fit to a unidimensional confirmatory factor analytic model. All items loaded statistically significantly and substantially (>0.4) on a single underlying factor (latent variable). The item response modeling showed that most MaMB items fitted the Rasch model. (Rasch) item reliability was high (0.94) yet the test yielded little information on each respondent, as highlighted by the relatively low person separation index of 0.1. CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS: MaMB reliably measures a single construct, likely to be infant bonding. However, further validation work is needed, preferably with enriched population samples to include higher-need/risk families. The MaMB tool may benefit from reduced response categories (from four to three) and some modest item wording amendments.

BACKGROUND. An increase in frequency of acute ischemic strokes has been observed among patients presenting with acute neurologic symptoms during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 and stroke subtypes in patients presenting with acute neurologic symptoms. METHODS. This retrospective case-control study included patients for whom a code for stroke was activated from March 16 to April 30, 2020, at any of six New York City hospitals that are part of a single health system. Demographic data (age, sex, and race or ethnicity), COVID-19 status, stroke-related risk factors, and clinical and imaging findings pertaining to stroke were collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between COVID-19 and stroke subtypes. RESULTS. The study sample consisted of 329 patients for whom a code for stroke was activated (175 [53.2%] men, 154 [46.8%] women; mean age, 66.9  14.9 [SD] years). Among the 329 patients, 35.3% (116) had acute ischemic stroke confirmed with imaging; 21.6% (71) had large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke; and 14.6% (48) had small vessel occlusion (SVO) stroke. Among LVO strokes, the most common location was middle cerebral artery segments M1 and M2 (62.0% [44/71]). Multifocal LVOs were present in 9.9% (7/71) of LVO strokes. COVID-19 was present in 38.3% (126/329) of the patients. The 61.7% (203/329) of patients without COVID-19 formed the negative control group. Among individual stroke-related risk factors, only Hispanic ethnicity was significantly associated with COVID-19 (38.1% of patients with COVID-19 vs 20.7% of patients without COVID-19; p = 0.001). LVO was present in 31.7% of patients with COVID-19 compared with 15.3% of patients without COVID-19 (p = 0.001). SVO was present in 15.9% of patients with COVID-19 and 13.8% of patients without COVID-19 (p = 0.632). In multivariate analysis controlled for race and ethnicity, presence of COVID-19 had a significant independent association with LVO stroke (odds ratio, 2.4) compared with absence of COVID-19 (p = 0.011). CONCLUSION. COVID-19 is associated with LVO strokes but not with SVO strokes. CLINICAL IMPACT. Patients with COVID-19 presenting with acute neurologic symptoms warrant a lower threshold for suspicion of large vessel stroke, and prompt workup for large vessel stroke is recommended.","output":"Association of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) With Large Vessel Occlusion Strokes: A Case-Control Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The liver has a crucial role in sepsis and is also a target for sepsis-related injury. Macrophage polarization between the M1 and M2 types is involved in the progression and resolution of both inflammation and liver injury. Iron oxide-based synthetic nanoparticles (SPIONs) can be used as antibacterial agents to regulate the inflammatory response. Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) have been widely used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, sepsis, and other diseases. However, to date, both the effects of SPIONs on MSCs and the fate of SPION-labelled MSCs in sepsis and other diseases are still unclear. METHODS: Mice were subjected to caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction to develop sepsis models. The CLP or LPS models were treated with MSCs or SPION-labelled/pretreated MSCs (SPION-MSCs). Bone marrow (BM)-derived macrophages and RAW 264.7 cells were cocultured with MSCs or SPION-MSCs under different conditions. Flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy, western blotting, quantitative real-time PCR, and immunohistochemical analysis were performed. RESULTS: We found that SPIONs did not affect the basic characteristics of MSCs. SPIONs promoted the survival of MSCs by upregulating HO-1 expression under inflammatory conditions. SPION-MSCs enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of liver injury in both the CLP- and LPS-induced mouse models of sepsis. Moreover, the protective effect of SPION-MSCs against sepsis-induced liver injury was related to macrophages. Systemic depletion of macrophages reduced the efficacy of SPION-MSC therapy. Furthermore, SPION-MSCs promoted macrophages to polarize towards the M2 phenotype under sepsis-induced liver injury in mice. The enhanced polarization towards M2 macrophages was attributed to their phagocytosis of SPION-MSCs. SPION-MSC-expressed TRAF1 was critical for promotion of macrophage polarization and alleviation of sepsis in mice. CONCLUSION: MSCs labelled/pretreated with SPIONs may be a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent or treat sepsis and sepsis-induced liver injury. HIGHLIGHTS: 1. SPIONs enhance the viability of MSCs by promoting HO-1 expression. 2. SPION-labelled/pretreated MSCs effectively improve sepsis by regulating macrophage polarization to M2 macrophages. 3. SPION-labelled/pretreated MSCs regulate macrophage polarization in a manner dependent on MSC-expressed TRAF1 protein.

However, concerns regarding safety in the setting of previous malignancy or the use of allogeneic cells have been raised. We therefore aimed to systematically review all clinical studies using adipose-derived cell therapy to identify reported adverse events with a special focus on risk of thromboembolic, immunological, and oncological safety concerns. Our systematic search resulted in 70 included studies involving more than 1,400 patients that were treated with adipose-derived cell therapy. Safety assessment method was not described in 32 of the included studies. For studies involving systemic or cardiac administration, one case of pulmonary thromboembolism and cases of both myocardial and cerebral infarctions were described. In the setting of allogeneic cell therapy studies, where the production of specific antibodies toward donor cells was examined, it was noted that 19%-34% of patients develop antibodies, but the consequence of this is unknown. With regard to oncological safety, only one case of breast cancer recurrence was identified out of 121 patients. Adipose-derived cell therapy has so far shown a favorable safety profile, but safety assessment description has, in general, been of poor quality, and only adverse events that are looked for will be found. We encourage future studies to maintain a strong focus on the safety profile of cell therapy, so its safeness can be confirmed.

There is some evidence that high-velocity, low-amplitude (HVLA) controlled vertebral thrusts have the potential to modulate immune mediators. However, the mechanisms of the link between HVLA controlled vertebral thrusts and neuroimmune function and the associated potential clinical implications are less clear. This review aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms that can explain the HVLA controlled vertebral thrust--neuroimmune link and discuss what this link implies for clinical practice and future research needs. A search for relevant articles published up until April 2021 was undertaken. Twenty-three published papers were found that explored the impact of HVLA controlled vertebral thrusts on neuroimmune markers, of which eighteen found a significant effect. These basic science studies show that HVLA controlled vertebral thrust influence the levels of immune mediators in the body, including neuropeptides, inflammatory markers, and endocrine markers. This narravtive review discusses the most likely mechanisms for how HVLA controlled vertebral thrusts could impact these immune markers. The mechanisms are most likely due to the known changes in proprioceptive processing that occur within the central nervous system (CNS), in particular within the prefrontal cortex, following HVLA spinal thrusts. The prefrontal cortex is involved in the regulation of the autonomic nervous system, the hypothalamicCpituitaryCadrenal axis and the immune system. Bi-directional neuro-immune interactions are affected by emotional or pain-related stress. Stress-induced sympathetic nervous system activity also alters vertebral motor control. Therefore, there are biologically plausible direct and indirect mechanisms that link HVLA controlled vertebral thrusts to the immune system, suggesting HVLA controlled vertebral thrusts have the potential to modulate immune function. However, it is not yet known whether HVLA controlled vertebral thrusts have a clinically relevant impact on immunity. Further research is needed to explore the clinical impact of HVLA controlled vertebral thrusts on immune function.","output":"The Potential Mechanisms of High-Velocity, Low-Amplitude, Controlled Vertebral Thrusts on Neuroimmune Function: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evidence for effective government policies to reduce exposure to alcohols carcinogenic and hepatoxic effects has strengthened in recent decades. Policies with the strongest evidence involve reducing the affordability, availability and cultural acceptability of alcohol. However, policies that reduce population consumption compete with powerful commercial vested interests. This paper draws on the Canadian Alcohol Policy Evaluation (CAPE), a formal assessment of effective government action on alcohol across Canadian jurisdictions. It also draws on alcohol policy case studies elsewhere involving attempts to introduce minimum unit pricing and cancer warning labels on alcohol containers. Canadian governments collectively received a failing grade (F) for alcohol policy implementation during the most recent CAPE assessment in 2017. However, had the best practices observed in any one jurisdiction been implemented consistently, Canada would have received an A grade. Resistance to effective alcohol policies is due to (1) lack of public awareness of both need and effectiveness, (2) a lack of government regulatory mechanisms to implement effective policies, (3) alcohol industry lobbying, and (4) a failure from the public health community to promote specific and feasible actions as opposed to general principles, e.g., increased prices or reduced affordability. There is enormous untapped potential in most countries for the implementation of proven strategies to reduce alcohol-related harm. While alcohol policies have weakened in many countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, societies may now also be more accepting of public health-inspired policies with proven effectiveness and potential economic benefits.","output":"Government Options to Reduce the Impact of Alcohol on Human Health: Obstacles to Effective Policy Implementation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With an ongoing move towards more management of patients within the community setting, demand for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasing and commonly used in lower back conditions. There is well recorded overuse of MRI in this scenario which goes against evidence-based practice and adds to rising healthcare costs. METHODS: The study was a retrospective review of lumbar spine MRI scans performed within a community-based setting over an 18-month period. The review took a randomised purposive sample of patients (n = 450); looking at adherence to, and relevance of, guidelines in managing lower back conditions. Data extracted provided information on demographics and prevalence of clinical presentation and report observations. RESULTS: There is variation in practice and utlisation of MRI with this patient group which warrants further exploration. Results support inappropriate use, lacking adherence to guidelines and pathways, leading to unnecessary imaging. 46% of referrals were considered clinically justified with 38% of report findings considered abnormal and of clinical relevance. Chi-square and binomial logistic regression were used to assess the significance and relationship of any factors on referral justification and report outcome. No difference was found between type of referrer, with patient age and leg symptoms being significant factors. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the opportunity to integrate better referral criteria to improve referral quality, its suitability and the relevance of final reports. In the current climate this would help manage appropriate use of imaging resources during the post COVID-19 pandemic recovery phase, as well as support recommendations regarding diagnostic reform and a move towards more community-based diagnostics.","output":"An evaluation of MRI lumbar spine scans within a community-based diagnostic setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected healthcare services around Asia. The Asian National Cancer Centres Alliance and the Asia-Pacific Organisation for Cancer Prevention collaborated to assess the mid- and long- term impact of COVID-19 to cancer care in Asia. METHODS: The two entities organised a combined symposium and post-meeting interactions among representatives of major cancer centres from seventeen Asian countries to outlining major challenges and countermeasures. RESULTS: Participating stakeholders distilled five big questions. 1) \\"Will there be an explosion of late-stage cancers after the pandemic?\\" To address and recover from perceived delayed prevention, screening, treatment and care challenges, collaboration of key stakeholders in the region and alignment in cancer care management, policy intervention and cancer registry initiatives would be of essential value. 2) \\"Operations and Finance\\" The pandemic has resulted in significant material and financial casualties. Flagged acute challenges (shortages of supplies, imposition of lockdown) as well as longer-standing reduction of financial revenue, manpower, international collaboration, and training should also be addressed. 3) \\"Will telemedicine and technological innovations revolutionize cancer care?\\" Deploying and implementing telemedicine such as teleconsultation and virtual tumour boards were considered invaluable. These innovations could become a new regular practice, leading to expansion of tele-collaboration through collaboration of institutions in the region. 4) \\"Will virtual conferences continue after the pandemic?\\" Virtual conferences during the pandemic have opened new doors for knowledge sharing, especially for representatives of low- and middle-income countries in the region, while saving time and costs of travel. 5) \\"How do we prepare for the next pandemic or international emergency?\\" Roadmaps for action to improve access to appropriate patient care and research were identified and scrutinised. CONCLUSION: Through addressing these five big questions, focused collaboration among members and with international organisations such as City Cancer Challenge will allow enhanced preparedness for future international emergencies.<br />.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on Cancer Care in the Post Pandemic World: Five Major Lessons Learnt from Challenges and Countermeasures of Major Asian Cancer Centres"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to adapt COVID-19 Related Psychological Distress Scale (CORPD) into Turkish and evaluate its psychometric properties.

Optimal thromboprophylaxis is unclear. Objectives We aimed to analyze the characteristics of patients with a confirmed thrombotic event including inflammatory and hemostatic parameters, compare patients affected by arterial vs venous events and examine differences between survivors and non-survivors. We reviewed compliance with thromboprophylaxis and explored how the implementation of a severity-adjusted protocol could have influenced outcome. Methods Single-cohort retrospective study of COVID-19 patients admitted, from March 3 to May 3, to the Infanta Leonor University Hospital in Madrid, epicenter of the Spanish outbreak. Results Among 1,127 patients, 80 thrombotic events were diagnosed in 69 patients (6.1% of the entire cohort). 43 patients (62%) suffered venous thromboembolism, 18 (26%) arterial events and 6 (9%) concurrent venous and arterial thrombosis. Most patients (90%) with a confirmed thrombotic event where under low-molecular-weight heparin treatment. Overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was rare. Initial ISTH DIC score and pre-event CRP were significantly higher among non-survivors. In multivariate analysis, arterial localization was an independent predictor of mortality (OR=18, 95% CI: 2.4-142, p<.05). Conclusions Despite quasi-universal thromboprophylaxis, COVID-19 lead to a myriad of arterial and venous thrombotic events. Considering the subgroup of patients with thrombotic episodes, arterial events conferred very poor prognosis and an ISTH DIC score 3 at presentation was identified as a potential predictor of mortality. Severity-adjusted thromboprophylaxis seemed to decrease the number of events and could have influenced mortality.

METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted over a 3-year period. The recurrence rate; pain scores at 24 h, 1 week, and 4 weeks; hospital stay; days to resumption of normal activities; seroma formation; and urinary retention rates were noted. RESULTS Of 937 patients, 52 underwent recurrent and 885 underwent primary hernia repair. The follow-up period was 12 to 40 months (median, 25 months). The mean operating time was longer in the recurrent group (32.7 +/- 6.3 min) than in the primary group (30.1 +/- 6.1 min; p = 0.015). The mean pain scores at 24 h were similar in the two groups (2.28 +/- 0.5 for the recurrent group vs. 2.20 +/- 0.4 for the primary group; nonsignificant difference). However the pain scores at 1 week were significantly higher in the recurrent group (1.35 +/- 0.5) than in the primary group (1.20 +/- 0.4; p = 0.017). The hospital stay (1.19 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.07 +/- 0.3 days; p = 0.002) and the time to resumption of normal activities (8.62 +/- 2.6 vs. 7.67 +/- 1.4 days; p < 0.0001) were significantly longer in the recurrent group than in the primary group. The urinary retention (9.6% vs. 5.4%; nonsignificant difference) and seroma formation (3.8% vs. 3.5%; p = 0.5) were similar in the recurrent and the primary groups, respectively. There were two recurrences and two conversions to open procedure in the primary group and none in the recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic TEP repair of recurrent inguinal hernia is safe and effective, with recurrence and conversion rates similar to those for primary hernia repair.

The most serious Zika-associated inflammatory eye disease is uveitis, which is commonly anterior in type, affecting both eyes and responding to corticosteroid eye drops. Mechanisms of Zika-associated anterior uveitis are unknown, but ZIKV has been identified in the aqueous humor of affected individuals. The iris pigment epithelium is a target cell population in viral anterior uveitis, and it acts to maintain immune privilege within the anterior eye. Interactions between ZIKV and human iris pigment epithelial cells were investigated with infectivity assays and RNA-sequencing. Primary cell isolates were prepared from eyes of 20 cadaveric donors, and infected for 24 hours with PRVABC59 strain ZIKV or incubated uninfected as control. Cytoimmunofluorescence, RT-qPCR on total cellular RNA, and focus-forming assays of culture supernatant showed cell isolates were permissive to infection, and supported replication and release of infectious ZIKV. To explore molecular responses of cell isolates to ZIKV infection at the whole transcriptome level, RNA was sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform, and results were aligned to the human GRCh38 genome. Multidimensional scaling showed clear separation between transcriptomes of infected and uninfected cell isolates. Differential expression analysis indicated a vigorous molecular response of the cell to ZIKV: 7,935 genes were differentially expressed between ZIKV-infected and uninfected cells (FDR < 0.05), and 99% of 613 genes that changed at least two-fold were up-regulated. Reactome and KEGG pathway and Gene Ontology enrichment analyses indicated strong activation of viral recognition and defense, in addition to biosynthesis processes. A CHAT network included 6275 molecular nodes and 24 contextual hubs in the cell response to ZIKV infection. Receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase 1 (RIPK1) was the most significantly connected contextual hub. Correlation of gene expression with read counts assigned to the ZIKV genome identified a negative correlation between interferon signaling and viral load across isolates. This work represents the first investigation of mechanisms of Zika-associated anterior uveitis using an in vitro human cell model.

We performed an infodemiology study of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Twitter conversation related to anesthesiology to describe how Twitter has been used during the pandemic and ways to optimize Twitter use by anesthesiologists. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of tweets related to the specialty of anesthesiology and COVID-19 tweeted between January 21 and October 13, 2020. A publicly available COVID-19 Twitter dataset was filtered for tweets meeting inclusion criteria (tweets including anesthesiology keywords). Using descriptive statistics, tweets were reviewed for tweet and account characteristics. Tweets were filtered for specific topics of interest likely to be impactful or informative to anesthesiologists of COVID-19 practice (airway management, personal protective equipment, ventilators, COVID testing, and pain management). Tweet activity was also summarized descriptively to show temporal profiles over the pandemic. RESULTS: 23,270 of 241,732,881 tweets (0.01%) met inclusion criteria between January 21 to October 13, 2020 and were generated by 15,770 accounts. The majority (51.9%) of accounts were from the United States (US). 749 (4.8%) of all users self-reported as anesthesiologists. 33.8% of all tweets included at least one hashtag, with the most frequently used anesthesia hashtag being #anesthesia. 52.2% of all tweets included at least one hyperlink, and the most frequently linked websites were other social media, news organizations, medical organizations, or scientific publications.

As such, the East Campus of Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital actively adopted the Symptoms Checklist 90 (SCL-90) to evaluate the mental health of hospital staff before and after the psychological intervention from the Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Methods: Medical workers from the East Campus of Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital were recruited for this study. Psychological evaluations were conducted using the SCL-90, with a score of >160 regarded as a positive result, or in other words, an indication of abnormal psychological symptoms. The EAP adopted different forms of psychological interventions for healthcare professionals, and participation in these measures was entirely voluntary. Medical workers completed the SCL-90 again after participating in the psychological intervention, and we analyzed the changes between their two assessments. Results: Of the 1,198 total medical staff present at the hospital, 844 participated in the initial survey, while only 652 completed the survey a second time (i.e., post-psychological intervention). Multivariate logistic regression analysis found that the psychological status of hospital staff was correlated with gender, education background, and fertility status (P < 0.05). The results showed that, compared with women, men's mental health status was better, with an OR value of 0.598 (0.372C0.962). Groups with high school, junior high school, and below education levels were at higher risk of psychological problems, with OR values of 23.655 (2.815C198.784) and 9.09 (2.601C31.801), respectively. Administrative occupations and having two or more children were protective factors for mental health, and the OR values were 0.400 (0.175C0.912) and 0.327 (0.152C0.703), respectively. Following the psychological intervention, we found that the mental health of hospital workers improved, as indicated by their second SCL-90 evaluations, although the proportion of medical staff willing to participate in the second evaluation was lower than the initial assessment. There were differences in the SCL-90 scores among different occupations, and there were also differences in the scores of employees of different occupations who had participated in the two evaluations. The employees of different positions who participated in the two evaluations were matched and analyzed and found that the depression and anxiety of the doctor group were significantly reduced. In the nursing group, the total score, somatization, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, and anxiety were significantly reduced. In the medical technician group, depression, anxiety, and paranoia were reduced considerably. Among office staff, no significant differences were found. Among workers, the total score, depression, and anxiety were significantly reduced. Conclusion: Hospitals have the potential to alleviate and reduce the psychological pressure placed on medical staff members through the EAP, which can actively adopt intervention and guidance measures.

Eligible participants will be SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort participants without a positive COVID-19 test, with at least mild anxiety (PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 T-score  55), not working from home, and not receiving current counselling or psychotherapy. We will randomly assign 162 participants to intervention groups of 7 to 10 participants each or waitlist control. We will use a partially nested RCT design to reflect dependence between individuals in training groups but not in the waitlist control. The SPIN-CHAT Program includes activity engagement, education on strategies to support mental health, and mutual participant support. Intervention participants will receive the 4-week (3 sessions per week) SPIN-CHAT Program via videoconference. The primary outcome is PROMIS Anxiety 4a score immediately post-intervention. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The SPIN-CHAT Trial will test whether a brief videoconference-based intervention will improve mental health outcomes among at-risk individuals during contagious disease outbreak.","output":"Protocol for a partially nested randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the scleroderma patient-centered intervention network COVID-19 home-isolation activities together (SPIN-CHAT) program to reduce anxiety among at-risk scleroderma patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Salmonella enterica can survive in surface waters (SuWa), and the role of nonhost environments in its transmission has acquired increasing relevance. In this study, we conducted comparative genomic analyses of 172 S. enterica isolates collected from SuWa across 3 months in six states of central Mexico during 2019. S. enterica transmission dynamics were assessed using 87 experimental and 112 public isolates from Mexico collected during 2002 through 2019. We also studied genetic relatedness between SuWa isolates and human clinical strains collected in North America during 2005 through 2020. Among experimental isolates, we identified 41 S. enterica serovars and 56 multilocus sequence types (STs). Predominant serovars were Senftenberg (n = 13), Meleagridis, Agona, and Newport (n = 12 each), Give (n = 10), Anatum (n = 8), Adelaide (n = 7), and Infantis, Mbandaka, Ohio, and Typhimurium (n = 6 each). We observed a high genetic diversity in the sample under study, as well as clonal dissemination of strains across distant regions. Some of these strains are epidemiologically important (ST14, ST45, ST118, ST132, ST198, and ST213) and were genotypically close to those involved in clinical cases in North America. Transmission network analysis suggests that SuWa are a relevant source of S. enterica (0.7 source/hub ratio) and contribute to its dissemination as isolates from varied sources and clinical cases have SuWa isolates as common ancestors. Overall, the study shows that SuWa act as reservoirs of various S. enterica serovars of public health significance. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms involved in SuWa contamination by S. enterica, as well as to develop interventions to contain its dissemination in food production settings. IMPORTANCE Surface waters are heavily used in food production worldwide. Several human pathogens can survive in these waters for long periods and disseminate to food production environments, contaminating our food supply. One of these pathogens is Salmonella enterica, a leading cause of foodborne infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in many countries. This research demonstrates the role of surface waters as a vehicle for the transmission of Salmonella along food production chains. It also shows that some strains circulating in surface waters are very similar to those implicated in human infections and harbor genes that confer resistance to multiple antibiotics, posing a risk to public health. This study contributes to expand our current knowledge on the ecology and epidemiology of Salmonella in surface waters.","output":"Genomic Epidemiology of Salmonella enterica Circulating in Surface Waters Used in Agriculture and Aquaculture in Central Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Premalignant lesions of the foregut (esophagus and stomach) are common entities usually incidentally identified on either endoscopic or radiographic imaging studies.

OBJECTIVES: We assessed of the risk of illness due to airborne SARS-CoV-2 particles from breathing, speaking, singing, coughing, and sneezing in indoor environments. METHODS: A risk assessment model, AirCoV2, for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 particles in aerosol droplets was developed. Previously published data on droplets expelled by breathing, speaking, singing, coughing, and sneezing by an infected person were used as inputs. Scenarios encompassed virus concentration, exposure time, and ventilation. Newly collected data of virus RNA copies in mucus from patients are presented. RESULTS: The expelled volume of aerosols was highest for a sneeze, followed by a cough, singing, speaking, and breathing. After 20 min of exposure, at 107 RNA copies/mL in mucus, all mean illness risks were largely estimated to be below 0.001, except for the \\"high\\" sneeze scenario. At virus concentrations above 108 RNA copies/mL, and after 2 h of exposure, in the high and \\"low\\" sneeze scenarios, the high cough scenario and the singing scenario, risks exceeded 0.01 and may become very high, whereas the low coughing scenario, the high and low speaking scenarios and the breathing scenario remained below 0.1. After 2 h of exposure, singing became the second highest risk scenario. One air exchange per hour reduced risk of illness by about a factor of 2. Six air exchanges per hour reduced risks of illness by a factor of 8-13 for the sneeze and cough scenarios and by a factor of 4-9 for the other scenarios. DISCUSSION: The large variation in the volume of expelled aerosols is discussed. The model calculations indicated that SARS-CoV-2 transmission via aerosols outside of the 1.5-m social distancing norm can occur. Virus concentrations in aerosols and/or the amount of expelled aerosol droplets need to be high for substantial transmission via this route.

METHODS: Retrospective case series of COVID-19 patients from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan and Xishui Hospital, Hubei Province, China, up to February 10, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data were collected. The clinical course of survivors and non-survivors were compared. Risk factors for death were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 107 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The clinical course of COVID-19 presented as a tri-phasic pattern. Week 1 after illness onset was characterized by fever, cough, dyspnea, lymphopenia, and radiological multi-lobar pulmonary infiltrates. In severe cases, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, acute myocardial injury, and adult respiratory distress syndrome were observed. During week 2, in mild cases, fever, cough, and systemic symptoms began to resolve and platelet count rose to normal range, but lymphopenia persisted. In severe cases, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and deteriorating multi-organ dysfunction were dominant. By week 3, mild cases had clinically resolved except for lymphopenia. However, severe cases showed persistent lymphopenia, severe acute respiratory dyspnea syndrome, refractory shock, anuric acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and death. Older age and male sex were independent risk factors for poor outcome of the illness. CONCLUSIONS: A period of 7-13 days after illness onset is the critical stage in the COVID-19 course.

Several prior studies have calculated excess deaths in the United States but were limited to the national or state level, precluding an examination of area-level variation in excess mortality and excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19. In this study, we take advantage of county-level variation in COVID-19 mortality to estimate excess deaths associated with the pandemic and examine how the extent of excess mortality not assigned to COVID-19 varies across subsets of counties defined by sociodemographic and health characteristics. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this ecological, cross-sectional study, we made use of provisional National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) data on direct COVID-19 and all-cause mortality occurring in US counties from January 1 to December 31, 2020 and reported before March 12, 2021. We used data with a 10-week time lag between the final day that deaths occurred and the last day that deaths could be reported to improve the completeness of data. Our sample included 2,096 counties with 20 or more COVID-19 deaths. The total number of residents living in these counties was 319.1 million. On average, the counties were 18.7% Hispanic, 12.7% non-Hispanic Black, and 59.6% non-Hispanic White. A total of 15.9% of the population was older than 65 years. We first modeled the relationship between 2020 all-cause mortality and COVID-19 mortality across all counties and then produced fully stratified models to explore differences in this relationship among strata of sociodemographic and health factors. Overall, we found that for every 100 deaths assigned to COVID-19, 120 all-cause deaths occurred (95% CI, 116 to 124), implying that 17% (95% CI, 14% to 19%) of excess deaths were ascribed to causes of death other than COVID-19 itself. Our stratified models revealed that the percentage of excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 was substantially higher among counties with lower median household incomes and less formal education, counties with poorer health and more diabetes, and counties in the South and West. Counties with more non-Hispanic Black residents, who were already at high risk of COVID-19 death based on direct counts, also reported higher percentages of excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19. Study limitations include the use of provisional data that may be incomplete and the lack of disaggregated data on county-level mortality by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and sociodemographic and health characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that direct COVID-19 death counts in the US in 2020 substantially underestimated total excess mortality attributable to COVID-19. Racial and socioeconomic inequities in COVID-19 mortality also increased when excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 were considered.

Then we cultured the ts mutant Wu-ts18(cd) at non-permissive temperature 39.5C, which forced the ts recombinant virus to use second-site mutation to revert from a ts to a non-ts phenotype. Sequence analysis showed most of the revertants had the same single amino acid mutation at Nsp16 position 43. The single amino acid mutation at Nsp16 position 76 or position 130 could also revert the ts mutant Wu-ts18 (cd) to non-ts phenotype, an additional independent mutation in Nsp13 position 115 played an important role on plaque size. The results provided us with genetic information on the functional determinants of Nsp16.

Sociodemographic and COVID-19-related data, health anxiety, PTSS, fear of becoming infected, social support, sleep problems and past/current psychological/psychiatric history were assessed. The mediating effect of HA when predicting PTSS was explored with mediational analyses. Moderated mediational analyses were also performed to test if receiving psychological treatment during pandemic changes the mediating effect of HA. RESULTS: Prevalence of PTSS was higher in high-scorers in HA (p<.01). High HA was also more likely to be reported by women, individuals with sleep problems, frequently fear of getting infected, and those who have previously received psychological treatment (p<.01). HA mediates the relationship between PTSS and the following predictors of PTSS: sleep problems, psychiatric history and fear of getting infected. Being under psychological treatment did not moderate the mediating effect of health anxiety. LIMITATIONS: Further longitudinal studies with bigger sample sizes are needed to examine the causal relationship between HA and PTSS after COVID-19 pandemic.

The study of its proteome organization could illustrate the proteins which act as the key molecular players in the infection cycle of the virus. These proteins can also act as important drug targets in combating COVID-19 infection. Majority of the drugs have been formulated in order to act as agonist to spike proteins inhibiting infection by binding to ACE2 receptors. Proteome analysis has also revealed the critical mutated proteins that are responsible for COVID-19 pathogenesis and virulence. mRNA based vaccines (mRNA-1273, BNT162) also targets these spike proteins. Although DNA vaccine has also been attempted using RDT, but the high rate of mutation associated with COVID-19 have made such vaccines ineffective even before use. Thus evolutionarily conserved proteins have been the best candidature for vaccine development. Similarly phylogenetic analysis of its proteins could help us to understand the evolutionary pattern of COVID-19.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A library of 57 aromatic pharmacophore phytochemical ligands was prepared from where the top five ligands depending on Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)-based pharmacokinetic properties were considered. The selected ligands were optimized for commencing molecular docking and dynamic simulation as a complex with the ACE2 receptor to compare their blocking efficacy with the control drug. The ligandCreceptor complexes accuracy in preventing the Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 penetration inside the host cells has been analyzed through hydrogenChydrophobic bond interactions, principal component analysis (PCA), root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and B-Factor.

METHODS: We performed a randomized clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine vs. azithromycin among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Treatment was 5 days of study medication.

The trial was stopped early after enrollment of 85 patients when a separate clinical trial concluded that a clinically important effect of hydroxychloroquine over placebo was definitively excluded. Comparisons were made a priori using a proportional odds model from a Bayesian perspective. RESULTS: We enrolled 85 patients at 13 hospitals over 11 weeks. Adherence to study medication was high. The estimated odds ratio for less favorable status on the ordinal scale for hydroxychloroquine vs. azithromycin from the primary analysis was 1.07, with a 95% credible interval from 0.63 to 1.83 with a posterior probability of 60% that hydroxychloroquine was worse than azithryomycin. Secondary outcomes displayed a similar, slight preference for azithromycin over hydroxychloroquine. QTc prolongation was rare and did not differ between groups. The twenty safety outcomes were similar between arms with the possible exception of post-randomization onset acute kidney injury, which was more common with hydroxychloroquine (15% vs. 0%). Patients in the hydroxychloroquine arm received remdesivir more often than in the azithromycin arm (19% vs. 2%). There was no apparent association between remdesivir use and acute kidney injury. CONCLUSIONS: While early termination limits the precision of our results, we found no suggestion of substantial efficacy for hydroxychloroquine over azithromycin. Acute kidney injury may be more common with hydroxychloroquine than azithromycin, although this may be due to the play of chance. Differential use of remdesivir may have biased our results in favor of hydroxychloroquine. Our results are consistent with conclusions from other trials that hydroxychloroquine cannot be recommended for inpatients with COVID-19; azithromycin may merit additional investigation. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was prospectively registered (NCT04329832) before enrollment of the first patient.","output":"Hydroxychloroquine vs. Azithromycin for Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 (HAHPS): Results of a Randomized, Active Comparator Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected more than 92 million people worldwide resulting in the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

OBJECTIVE To determine whether the relationship between surgeon volume and outcomes is an artifact of case mix using a prospective sample of carotid endarterectomy cases. DESIGN Observational cohort study from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2010, with preoperative, immediate postoperative, and 30-day postoperative assessments acquired by independent monitors. SETTING Urban, tertiary academic medical center. PATIENTS All 841 patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy performed by a vascular surgeon or cerebrovascular neurosurgeon at the institution. INTERVENTION Carotid endarterectomy without another concurrent surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Stroke, death, and other surgical complications occurring within 30 days of surgery along with other case data. A low-volume surgeon performed 40 or fewer cases per year. Variables used in a comparison administrative database study, as well as variables identified by our univariate analysis, were used for adjusted analyses to assess for an association between low-volume surgeons and the rate of stroke and death as well as other complications. RESULTS The rate of stroke and death was 6.9% for low-volume surgeons and 2.0% for high-volume surgeons (P = .001). Complications were similarly higher (13.4% vs 7.2%, P = .008). Low-volume surgeons performed more nonelective cases. Low-volume surgeons were significantly associated with stroke and death in the unadjusted analysis as well as after adjustment with variables used in the administrative database study (odds ratio, 3.61; 95% CI, 1.70-7.67, and odds ratio, 3.68; 95% CI, 1.72-7.89, respectively). However, adjusting for the significant disparity of American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status classification in case mix eliminated the effect of surgeon volume on the rate of stroke and death (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% CI, 0.59-4.64) and other complications. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Variables selected for risk adjustment in studies using administrative databases appear to be inadequate to control for case mix bias between low-volume and high-volume surgeons. Risk adjustment should empirically analyze for case mix imbalances between surgeons to identify meaningful risk modifiers in clinical practice such as the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status classification.

METHODS: We assembled a cohort 12C39 year\\\\old patients, insured by Kaiser Permanente Northwest, who received at least one dose of an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer\\\\BioNTech or Moderna) between December 2020 and October 2021. We followed them for up to 30 days after their second dose of an mRNA vaccine to identify encounters for myocarditis, pericarditis or myopericarditis. We compared two identification methods: A method that searched all encounter diagnoses using a brief text description (e.g., ICD\\\\10\\\\CM code I40.9 is defined as acute myocarditis, unspecified). We searched the text description of all inpatient or outpatient encounter diagnoses (in any position) for myocarditis or pericarditis. The other method was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), which searched for emergency department visits or hospitalizations with a select set of discharge ICD\\\\10\\\\CM diagnosis codes. For both methods, two physicians independently reviewed the identified patient records and classified them as confirmed, probable or not cases using the CDC's case definition. RESULTS: The encounter methodology identified 14 distinct patients who met the confirmed or probable CDC case definition for acute myocarditis or pericarditis with an onset within 21 days of receipt of COVID\\\\19 vaccination. When we extended the search for relevant diagnoses to 30 days since vaccination, we identified two additional patients (for a total of 16 patients) who met the case definition for acute myocarditis or pericarditis, but those patients had been misdiagnosed at the time of their original presentation. Three of these patients had an ICD\\\\10\\\\CM code of I51.4 Myocarditis, Unspecified; that code was omitted by the VSD algorithm (in the late fall of 2021). The VSD methodology identified 11 patients who met the CDC case definition for acute myocarditis or pericarditis. Seven (64%) of the 11 patients had initial care for myopericarditis outside of a KPNW facility and their diagnosis could not be ascertained by the VSD methodology until claims were submitted (median delay of 33 days; range of 12C195 days). Among those who received a second dose of vaccine (n = 146 785), we estimated a risk as 95.4 cases of myopericarditis per million second doses administered (95% CI, 52.1C160.0). CONCLUSION: We identified additional valid cases of myopericarditis following an mRNA vaccination that would be missed by the VSD's search algorithm, which depends on select hospital discharge diagnosis codes. The true incidence of myopericarditis is markedly higher than the incidence reported to US advisory committees in the fall of 2021.

The selective blockade of Cx43 hemichannels by microinfusion of TAT-Cx43L2 peptide into the BLA induced memory deficits 1 and 24 h after training, without affecting learning. The memory impairments were prevented by the co-injection of glutamate and D-serine, but not by the injection of either alone, suggesting a role for NMDA receptors (NMDAR). The incubation with TAT-Cx43L2 decreased NMDAR-mediated currents in BLA slices, effect that was also prevented by the addition of glutamate and D-serine. NMDARs in primary neuronal cultures were unaffected by TAT-Cx43L2, ruling out direct effects of the peptide on NMDARs. Finally, we show that D-serine permeates through purified Cx43 hemichannels reconstituted in liposomes.

METHODS: Hospitalization data (2017C2020) were extracted from the French National Discharge database (all public and private hospitals). We included all patients older than 18 years hospitalized during the 3 years and extracted PE status and COVID-19 status (from March 2020). Age, sex and risk factors for PE (such as obesity, cancer) were identified. We also extracted transfer to an intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital death. The number of PE and the frequency of death in patients in 2019 and 2020 were described by month and by COVID-19 status. Logistic regressions were performed to identify the role of COVID-19 among other risk factors for PE in hospitalized patients. RESULTS: The overall number of patients hospitalized with PE increased by about 16% in 2020 compared with 2019, and mortality also increased to 10.3% (+ 1.2%). These increases were mostly linked to COVID-19 waves, which were associated with PE hospitalization in COVID-19 patients (PE frequency was 3.7%; 2.8% in non-ICU and 8.8% in ICU). The final PE odds ratio for COVID-19 hospitalized patients was 4 compared with other hospitalized patients in 2020.

METHODS: This study used data collected between 2001 and 2003 from 2914 participants in the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication, a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults (mean age = 44.9 years; 53.4% female). Twelve-month food insecurity was assessed with a modified version of the Short Form U.S. Household Food Security Scale. Twelve-month DSM-IV diagnoses of mental disorders were based on the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Modified Poisson regression models were conducted, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and income-to-poverty ratio. RESULTS: Food insecurity was experienced by 11.1% of participants. Food insecurity was associated with greater prevalence of bulimic-spectrum eating disorders (prevalence ratio [PR] = 3.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.26C6.42), mood disorders (PR = 2.53; 95% CI 1.96C3.29), and anxiety disorders (PR = 1.69; 95% CI 1.39C2.07). CONCLUSION: Results indicate that food insecurity is associated with a range of internalizing mental disorders, though these findings should be confirmed with contemporary data to reflect DSM-5 diagnostic updates and the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from this study emphasize the need to expand food insecurity interventions and improve access to mental health services for food-insecure populations.

Through participation of the target group in research, it is possible to generate real-world and practice-oriented results and to foster health-related changes. This can also serve to improve the participation and health of persons with disabilities. However, the participation levels in many existing PHR projects is low. OBJECTIVES: We discuss challenges and opportunities in PHR with persons with disabilities. This article intends to provide an orientation for achieving high participation levels in health research. METHODS: To develop and implement health-promoting activities in workshops for persons with disabilities, a pilot project was conducted. The aim was to attain high participation levels through PHR with persons with disabilities. The process was evaluated using interviews and questionnaires. RESULTS: The diversity of the people who are working in the named workshops and especially of the persons with disability was identified as a challenge for PHR. Further challenges are the complex structures and communication lines of those workshops as well as the availability of staff, time and financial resources. Facilitating factors were the inclusion of all stakeholders of this living context, the use of known communication tools and frequent exchange. Appreciation towards the persons with disabilities seems to be one of the most important factors for their motivation and the permanent adoption of health-promoting activities. CONCLUSIONS: If the challenges of PHR are overcome, this enables diverse insights into the lives of persons with disabilities. It facilitates the implementation of health-promoting activities according to the needs of the target group and fosters the motivation of participants.","output":"Partizipative Forschung mit Menschen mit Behinderungen: Ein Beispiel fr die Umsetzung partizipativer Gesundheitsforschung in Werkst?tten fr behinderte Menschen (WfbM)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus has become the paramount subject in peoples lives, affecting and disrupting virtually every aspect of society, as the pandemic casts a shadow over the world.

To explore the relationships between previous exposure to particulate matter < 10 m (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), the clinical outcome following hospital admittance, and lymphocyte subsets in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia. In 147 geocoded patients, we assessed the individual exposure to PM10 and NO2 in the 2 weeks before hospital admittance. We divided subjects according to the clinical outcome (i.e., discharge at home vs in-hospital death), and explored the lymphocyte-related immune function as an index possibly affecting individual vulnerability to the infection. As compared with discharged subjects, patients who underwent in-hospital death presented neutrophilia, lymphopenia, lower number of T CD45, CD3, CD4, CD16/56 + CD3 + , and B CD19 + cells, and higher previous exposure to NO2, but not PM10. Age and previous NO2 exposure were independent predictors for mortality. NO2 concentrations were also negatively related with the number of CD45, CD3, and CD4 cells. Previous NO2 exposure is a co-factor independently affecting the mortality risk in infected individuals, through negative immune effects. Lymphopenia and altered lymphocyte subsets might precede viral infection due to nonmodifiable (i.e., age) and external (i.e., air pollution) factors. Thus, decreasing the burden of air pollutants should be a valuable primary prevention measure to reduce individual susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality.","output":"Nitrogen dioxide pollution increases vulnerability to COVID-19 through altered immune function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a lecturer at a higher education institution in South Africa, the author is conscious of an emphasis placed on multimodal resources as part of the globally experienced shift to teach remotely due to the COVID-19 epidemic.

We aimed to evaluate the relationship between social distancing, stroke admissions and stroke mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic, while accounting for the rate of COVID-19 admissions. Methods. We performed a longitudinal analysis of a multicenter, prospective, hospital-based registry of intensive care units from 19 hospitals from Brazil, comprising a 14-month period of the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated whether the daily rate of admissions (DRA(stroke)) and daily mortality rate for stroke were associated with the social distancing index (SDI), taking into account the daily rate of admissions for COVID-19 (DRA(COVID)) in univariate and multivariate regression models. We also compared the clinical characteristics of patients with stroke admitted before and during the pandemic. Results. We found that DRA(stroke) decreased significantly in association with a strong rise in the SDI during the early months of the pandemic. However, in the latter period of the pandemic, only minor changes were observed in the SDI, and still, DRA(stroke) was inversely associated with the DRA(COVID). Throughout the pandemic, higher SDI and DRA(COVID) were associated with higher in-hospital mortality for stroke. Conclusions. The severity of surges of the COVID-19 pandemic were independently and persistently associated with declines in stroke admissions, even during periods when social distancing policies were not intensified.","output":"Social distancing, stroke admissions and stroke mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic: a multicenter, longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunodeficiency and hyperinflammation are responsible for the most frequent and life-threatening forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

However, there is one shortcoming of LSG in the long-term follow-up, and this is the onset of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) and erosive esophagitis (EE). Conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is considered an option in patients unresponsive to medical therapy. Currently, there is no evidence of EE improvement or resolution after conversion surgery. In this study, we objectively evaluate the effectiveness of RYGB in management of EE with upper endoscopy (EGD) to identify the significant variables in patients with GERD symptoms post LSG refractory to medical therapy and require conversion surgery. METHODS: Over a period of 11 years (2008C2019) at Singapore General Hospital, we retrospectively reviewed a prospectively collected database of a cohort of patients whom had conversion surgery to RYGB for refractory GERD and EE after LSG. Patients endoscopic findings and demographic and anthropometric data were analyzed. RESULTS: We identified a total of 14 patients who underwent LSG to RYGB conversions for endoscopic proven erosive esophagitis in our unit during the study period. Eight patients (57.1%) had concurrent hiatal hernia repaired. Nine (64.3%) patients were females. The median age of patients in this cohort was 44 (range 30C61) years. Mean weight and BMI were 87.7 kg ( 19.2) and 32.8 ( 3.09) kg/m2, respectively, on the day of conversion surgery. The median time between LSG and revision to RYGB was 36 (range 6C68) months. Seven patients (50%) had complete resolution of GERD symptoms after conversion, and 6 patients (42.9%) had partial resolution. Six out of 7 patients had complete resolution of EE. There were 4 anastomotic strictures (28.6%). Older patients, Indian ethnicity, present of hiatal hernia and lower weight loss after initial LSG were more likely to undergo conversion surgery. CONCLUSION: Conversion to RYGB after LSG is clinically relevant and may be a feasible solution if patients have ongoing GERD refractory to medical therapy. Ninety-three percent of our patients achieved complete resolution of their GERD symptoms and significant improvement of erosive esophagitis with significant weight loss after conversion. This study has important implications as LSG is increasingly being performed and a proportion of these will need revision surgery for various reasons, particularly GERD which is extremely prevalent.","output":"Resolution of Erosive Esophagitis After Conversion from Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy to Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) surveillance study was performed in March-April 2020 among asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) at a specialist infectious diseases hospital in Naples, Italy.

This exposed patient barriers to telehealth access and created care disparities in the absence of specific access assistance which have been little studied. A better understanding of these telehealth access barriers will help direct assistance resources to improve access in radiation oncology patients in the future. MATERIALS/METHODS Data for all unique patient visits at a large academic medical center between 4/1/2020 and 6/30/2020 were generated, including visit type (in person, video, audio only), age, race, ethnicity, rural/urban home address (zip code assessment by Federal Office of Rural Health Policy), and Digital Divide Index (DDI; incorporates metrics of technology and internet access, age, disability, and educational attainment in a geographic area). A multivariable logistic regression model evaluated the association of these variables with successful video visit completion. RESULTS A total of 1990 visits by patients seen in radiation oncology for 1698 unique individuals were assessed. The median age was 66 (IQR: 14); patients were 38.1% female and 89.4% Caucasian. The median age of those completing at least one video visit was 64 (IQR: 15) vs. 68 (IQR: 14) for those who completed audio visits only (P < 0.001). Among African American patients, 22.7% completed at least one video visit, while 36.7% of Caucasian patients completed at least one video visit (P = 0.003). In multivariable analyses, patient age (OR: 0.965; 95% CI 0.956-0.973; P < 0.001), DDI (OR: 0.986; 95% CI 0.976-0.996; P = 0.006), and race (OR: 0.472; 0.294-0.756; P = 0.039) predicted completion of at least one video visit. Those who were older, had higher DDI (greater digital divide), or African American race were less likely to complete a video visit. Gender, ethnicity, and rural/urban home address were not significantly associated with video visit completion. CONCLUSION This work is to our knowledge the first characterization of telehealth usage in radiation oncology patients and demonstrates associations between patient characteristics and video visit completion that have implications for clinical practice and future research. First, older patients, those with minority backgrounds, and those from areas with less access to technology (high digital divide) are less likely to be able to access care through video visits. Second, audio visits were a significant proportion of visits early in the pandemic, and subsequent data should be analyzed to determine their importance as a means to continue providing virtual care to prevent further care disparities. Third, future research is needed to address barriers to care experienced by elderly and minority patients as well as those from communities with high DDI. Fourth, researchers should explore markers of access barriers such as DDI and other potential pre-visit screening metrics for use in directing resources to those in need.","output":"Age, Race, and Digital Divide Index are Associated With Video Visit Completion for Patients Seen in Radiation Oncology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thermoelectrics are suited to converting dissipated heat into electricity for operating electronics, but the small voltage (~0.1 mV K-1) from the Seebeck effect has been one of the major hurdles in practical implementation.

In this work, we applied selected deep learning models including multilayer perceptron, random forest, and different versions of long short-term memory (LSTM), using three data sources to train the models, including COVID-19 occurrences, basic information like coded country names, and detailed information like population, and area of different countries. The main goal is to forecast the outbreak in nine countries (Iran, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, Spain, China, and the USA). The performances of the models are measured using four metrics, including mean average percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), normalized RMSE (NRMSE), and R(2). The best performance was found for a modified version of LSTM, called M-LSTM (winner model), to forecast the future trajectory of the pandemic in the mentioned countries. For this purpose, we collected the data from January 22 till July 30, 2020, for training, and from 1 August 2020 to 31 August 2020, for the testing phase. Through experimental results, the winner model achieved reasonably accurate predictions (MAPE, RMSE, NRMSE, and R(2) are 0.509, 458.12, 0.001624, and 0.99997, respectively).

While data regarding nutrition in coronavirus infection (COVID-19) are not available, in this review, we aimed to evaluated evidence from previous clinical trials that evaluated nutrition-based interventions for viral diseases (with special emphasis on respiratory infections), and summaries our observations. Methods A systematic search strategy was employed using keywords to search the literature in 3 key medical databases: PubMed?, Web of Science? and SciVerse Scopus?. Studies were considered eligible if they were controlled trials in humans, measuring immunological parameters, on viral and respiratory infections. Clinical trials on vitamins, minerals, nutraceuticals and probiotics were included. Results total of 640 records were identified initially and 22 studies were included from other sources. After excluding duplicates and articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 43 studies were obtained (vitamins: 13; minerals: 8; nutraceuticals: 18 and probiotics: 4). Among vitamins, A and D showed a potential benefit, especially in deficient populations. Among trace elements, selenium and zinc have also shown favourable immune-modulatory effects in viral respiratory infections. Several nutraceuticals and probiotics may have some role in enhancing immune functions. Micronutrients may be beneficial in nutritionally depleted elderly population.

This is an observational study for which we obtained daily county level COVID-19 cases and deaths from January 22, 2020 through the phased removal of social distancing protections. A stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial (SW-CRT) analytical approach is used, leveraging the phased implementation of policies. Data include 3142 counties from all 50 US states and the District of Columbia. Exposures. County-level NPIs were obtained from online county and state policy databases, then classified into four intervention levels: Level 1 (low), declaration of a State of Emergency; Level 2 (moderate), school closures, restricting nursing home access, or closing restaurants and bars; Level 3 (high), non-essential business closures, suspending non-violent arrests, suspending elective medical procedures, suspending evictions, or restricting mass gatherings of at least 10 people; and Level 4 (aggressive). sheltering in place / stay-at-home, public mask requirements, or travel restrictions. Additional county-level data were obtained to record racial (Black, Hispanic), economic (educational level, poverty), demographic (rural/urban) and climate factors (temperature, specific humidity, solar radiation). Main Outcomes. The primary outcomes are rates of COVID-19 cases, deaths and case doubling times. NPI effects are measured separately for nine US Census Region (Pacific, Mountain, West North Central, East North Central, West South Central, East South Central, South Atlantic, Middle Atlantic, New England). Results. Aggressive NPIs (level 4) significantly reduced COVID-19 case and death rates in all US Census Regions, with effect sizes ranging from 4.1% to 25.7% and 5.5% to 25.5%, respectively, for each day they were active. No other intervention level achieved significance across all US Regions. Intervention levels 3 and 4 both increased COVID-19 doubling times, with effects peaking at 25 and 40 days after initiation of each policy, respectively. The effectiveness of level 3 NPIs varied, reducing case rates in all regions except North Central states, but associated with significantly higher death rates in all regions except Pacific states. Intervention levels 1 and 2 did not indicate any effect on COVID-19 propagation and, in some regions, these interventions were associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. Heterogeneity of NPI effects are associated with racial composition, poverty, urban-rural environment, and climate factors. Conclusion. Aggressive NPIs are effective tools to reduce COVID-19 propagation and mortality.

AIMS To determine if there was a significant reduction in stroke admissions, delivery of acute reperfusion therapies, or increased delays to presentation during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A multicentre, retrospective, observational cohort study was performed across three tertiary hospitals in Brisbane, Australia. Cases were identified using ICD-10 codes and then individually reviewed for eligibility using prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. All metrics were compared over three months from March 1 to May 31, 2020 with two corresponding 3-month periods in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS There was a mean of 2.15 (95% CI 1.87-2.48) stroke admissions per day in the examined pandemic months compared to 2.13 (95% CI 1.85-2.45) and 2.26 (95% CI 1.97-2.59) in March to May 2018 and 2019 respectively, with no significant difference found (p = 0.81). There was also no difference in rates of intravenous thrombolysis (p = 0.82), endovascular thrombectomy (p = 0.93) and time from last known well to presentation (p = 0.54). Conversely, daily emergency department presentations (including non-stroke presentations) significantly reduced (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic there was no significant reduction in stroke presentations, use of acute reperfusion therapies or delays to presentation, despite a reduction in ED presentations for any cause.

The COVID-19 emergency, its related global mobility restrictions and fear of hospitalization further highlighted the need of a comprehensive solution. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to design and test a pragmatic e-Health system based on multiparametric telemonitoring to support of TIA/stroke patients in sub-acute phase during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We proposed a telemonitoring system and protocol for TIA/minor stroke patients during COVID-19 pandemic for patients at risk of stroke recurrence. This system involves the use of portable devices for BP/HR/SpO(2)/temperature sensing, panic-button, gateway, and a dedicated ICT platform. The protocol is a 14-day multiparametric telemonitoring, therapy, and emergency intervention based on vital sign alteration notifications. We conducted a proof-of-concept validation test on 8 TIA/minor stroke patients in the early post-acute phase (< 14 days from ischemic event). RESULTS: The proposed solution allowed to promptly and remotely identify vital sign alterations at home during the early post-acute phase, allowing therapy and behavioral intervention adjustments. Also, we observed a significant improvement of quality of life, as well as a significant reduction of anxiety and depression status. TUQ showed ease of use, good interface quality and high user satisfaction of the proposed solution. The 3-month follow-up showed total adherence of prescribed therapy and no stroke/TIA recurrence or other emergency department admissions.

This is especially of interest in the aerospace and automobile industries. Additive manufacturing allows for creating parts with computer aided design (CAD) modeled lattice structures that offer lightweight parts. However, there is a need for porous structures at the micron scale (<50 m) which cannot be achieved in a controlled manner using traditional powder-bed based metal additive manufacturing processes. Electrochemical Additive Manufacturing (ECAM) is a novel non-thermal metal additive manufacturing process capable of producing metal 3D parts with engineered porosity at the micron scale. There is a lack of understanding of the cause of porosity and controlling the porosity generated in the parts created using this process. In this paper, the effects of the electrical parameters of deposition, such as the pulse duty cycle and pulse frequency during electrodeposition, on the porosity of the manufactured parts were mathematically modeled. The model predicts that higher frequency electrodeposition leads to more porous structures. The model developed in this study can be used to predict the process parameters needed to deposit nickel microstructures with desired levels of porosity between 20 and 55 %. These model predictions were also validated by experiments. Two mechanisms for the cause of porosity in the deposits were identified. The diffusion-limited deposition phenomenon causing a lack of availability of cations results in larger sized pores and hollow structures to form on the part. The crystal growth and the nucleation process cause micron-scale pores.","output":"A mathematical model to predict the porosity of nickel pillars manufactured by localized electrochemical deposition under pulsed voltage conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigated the dependence of Covid-19 attack rates on demographic and socioeconomic factors for the communities in Suffolk County (Long Island, New York State), presently the 5th most-affected county in the United States.

Traditional treatments, including chemotherapy, surgery, mastectomy, and radiotherapy, are commonly used. Because of the limitation of the aforementioned methods, novel treatment strategies are needed. Methotrexate is a chemotherapeutic drug, which is commonly used to treat breast cancer. Because of the side effects of the free drug, the liposomal form of the drug is suggested. Methods: Liposomal methotrexate was prepared and the encapsulation efficiency was measured. Moreover, the particle size and the zeta potential were measured. The liposome morphology was confirmed using transmission electron microscopy. The MTT assay was done to examine the cytotoxicity of free and encapsulated methotrexate on BT-474 cell line. The Annexin-V/PI dual staining assay was performed to assess the apoptosis in BT-474 breast cancer cells via the flow cytometry method. Results: The transmission electron microscopy results confirmed the integrated and spherical structure of the nanoparticles. The results of drug release showed that in acidic pH (5.4), more than 90% of the drug was released after 24 hours, which was higher than 2 other pHs. Furthermore, the IC50 value of liposomal methotrexate was determined as 2.15 and 0.82 mg/mL for 24 and 48 hours. The flow cytometry results confirmed that liposomal methotrexate had a greater cytotoxic effect on cancer cells compared with free methotrexate.

Model 1 included demographic data and patient history; model 2 consisted of model 1, plus vital signs and pulse oximetry measurements at hospital admission; and model 3 included model 2, laboratory test results at hospital admission. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were reported for each predictor in the different models. Moreover, to examine the discriminatory powers of the models, a corrected area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated. Results Among 560 patients with diabetes (men = 291) who were hospitalised for COVID-19, the mean age of the study population was 61.8 (standard deviation [SD] 13.4) years. During a median length of hospitalisation of 6 days, 165 deaths (men = 93) were recorded. In model 1, age and a history of cognitive impairment were associated with higher mortality; however, taking statins, oral anti-diabetes drugs and beta-blockers were associated with a lower risk of mortality (AUC = 0.76). In model 2, adding the data for respiratory rate (OR 1.07 [95% CI 1.00C1.14]) and oxygen saturation (OR 0.95 [95% CI 0.92C0.98]) slightly increased the AUC to 0.80.

The human DEAD-box protein 1 (DDX1) plays an important role in tRNA and mRNA processing, is involved in tumor progression and is also hijacked by several virus families such as HIV-1 for replication and nuclear export. Although important in many cellular processes, the mechanism of DDX1s enzymatic function is unknown. We have performed equilibrium titrations and transient kinetics to determine affinities for nucleotides and RNA. We find an exceptional tight binding of DDX1 to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), one of the strongest affinities observed for DEAD-box helicases. ADP binds tighter by three orders of magnitude when compared to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), arresting the enzyme in a potential dead-end ADP conformation under physiological conditions. We thus suggest that a nucleotide exchange factor leads to DDX1 recycling. Furthermore, we find a strong cooperativity in binding of RNA and ATP to DDX1 that is also reflected in ATP hydrolysis. We present a model in which either ATP or RNA binding alone can partially shift the equilibrium from an open to a closed-state; this shift appears to be not further pronounced substantially even in the presence of both RNA and ATP as the low rate of ATP hydrolysis does not change.","output":"Synergistic effects of ATP and RNA binding to human DEAD-box protein DDX1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examined disparities in cumulative incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by race/ethnicity, age, and sex in the United States during January 1-October 1, 2020.

Interim estimates of R were above 2 in the South East, East of England, London and South West, but with wide confidence intervals. Nationally, prevalence increased across all age groups with the greatest increase in those aged 55-64 at 1.20% (0.99%, 1.46%), up 3-fold from 0.37% (0.30%, 0.46%). In those aged over 65, prevalence was 0.81% (0.58%, 0.96%) up 2-fold from 0.35% (0.28%, 0.43%). Prevalence remained highest in 18 to 24-year olds at 2.25% (1.47%, 3.42%). Conclusion The co-occurrence of high prevalence and rapid growth means that the second wave of the epidemic in England has now reached a critical stage. Whether via regional or national measures, it is now time-critical to control the virus and turn R below one if further hospital admissions and deaths from COVID-19 are to be avoided.","output":"High prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 swab positivity and increasing R number in England during October 2020: REACT-1 round 6 interim report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Doublet chemotherapy in combination with a biologic agent has been a standard of care in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer for over a decade. The evidence for a lighter treatment approach is limited to mono-chemotherapy plus bevacizumab in the RAS unselected population. Anti-EGFR antibodies have activity as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy in RAS wildtype metastatic colorectal cancer; however their role in first-line treatment in combination with 5-fluorouracil monotherapy or when given alone has not been well studied. MONARCC aims to investigate this approach in an elderly population. METHODS/DESIGN: MONARCC is a prospective, open-label, multicentre, non-comparative randomised phase II trial. Eligible patients aged 70 with unresectable metastatic, untreated, RAS/BRAF wildtype metastatic colorectal cancer will be randomised 1:1 to receive panitumumab alone or panitumumab plus infusional 5-fluorouracil. RAS and BRAF analyses will be performed in local laboratories. Comprehensive Health Assessment and Limited Health Assessments will be performed at baseline and at 16 weeks, respectively, to assess frailty. The Patient Symptom Questionnaire and Overall Treatment Utility are to be undertaken at different timepoints to assess the impact of treatment-related toxicities and quality of life. Treatment will be delivered every 2 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity (as determined by treating clinician or patient), delay of treatment of more than 6 weeks, or withdrawal of consent. The primary end point is 6-month progression-free survival in both arms. Secondary end points include overall survival, time to treatment failure, objective tumour response rate as defined by RECIST v1.1 and safety (adverse events). Tertiary and correlative endpoints include the feasibility and utility of a comprehensive geriatric assessment, quality of life and biological substudies. DISCUSSION: MONARCC investigates the activity and tolerability of first-line panitumumab-based treatments with a view to expand on current treatment options while maximising progression-free and overall survival and quality of life in molecularly selected elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

COVID-19 severity and mortality are strongly associated with interleukin (IL)-6 levels. High IL-6 levels are also observed in idiopathic Multicentric Castleman Disease (iMCD). Previously, we developed the first anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatments and showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) production could be fully controlled by IL-6 in humans. Using mathematical modeling, with CRP as an IL-6 surrogate marker, we predicted the ability of an anti-IL-6 mAb to block plasma IL-6 activity and showed IL-6 inhibition was dependent on the extent of whole-body IL-6 production. We postulate that in patients (pts) in whom IL-6 concentration at the site of inflammation is higher than in the plasma, full blockade of plasma IL-6 activity, shown by complete CRP inhibition, is the minimum requirement to achieve clinical efficacy. CRP inhibition with tocilizumab (TCZ) in pts with COVID-19. We identified 35 published studies evaluating the efficacy or potential role of anti-IL-6 therapy in pts with severe COVID-19. Surprisingly, only one (Luo et al. J Med Virol 2020;92:814) reported dynamics of CRP reduction for individual patients throughout treatment. We fitted a hypothetical curve of CRP reduction required to completely block IL-6, based on the half-life of CRP, and added data points of CRP serum levels from pts treated with anti-IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) therapy, TCZ, in this study. Complete reduction of CRP was not achieved in all patients: 3 pts who died had CRP levels 12.8 mg/l. Of 2 pts whose disease worsened, CRP levels were 93.5 mg/l and 6.3 mg/l. However, pts whose condition stabilized (n=9), or whose symptoms improved (n=1), had CRP levels close to the theoretical curve that is likely required to fully block IL-6 (CRP levels 5.0 mg/l). Half of these pts had been given repeated doses of TCZ. Siltuximab (SIL) treatment (NCT01024036 trial) for pts with iMCD. To assess the impact of baseline CRP levels on response to anti-IL-6 therapy, SIL, patients were divided into low and high CRP groups based on a baseline CRP level threshold of 40 mg/l (corresponding to ~40 pg/ml of IL-6; Fig 1). In patients with low baseline CRP levels (<40 mg/l; n=35), CRP levels were significantly reduced with SIL treatment on day 8 (n=26; P=0.0003) and day 15 (n=22; P=0.0043) post-dosing. In patients with high baseline CRP levels (>40 mg/l; n=17), CRP levels were significantly reduced on day 8 (n=17; P<0.0001) and day 15 (n=15; P<0.0001) post-dosing (Fig 1). A significant increase in CRP levels from day 8 to day 15 was observed in these patients (P=0.0120); this increase was not observed in patients with low baseline CRP levels (P=0.243; Fig 1). There was a negative correlation between maximum CRP and hemoglobin change (P<0.001). Inhibition of IL-6 activity by anti-IL-6 (SIL 700 mg) and anti-IL-6R (TCZ 800 mg) as monotherapy, intensified, or combined therapy. To evaluate the effect of therapy on IL-6 activity, our algorithm modeled inhibition of IL-6-(IL-6R/soluble IL-6R)-gp130 transducer complexes. This serves as a proxy for IL-6 bioactivity and accounts for the buffering capacity of gp130, which can be overwhelmed in inflammatory situations with high IL-6 concentrations. Due to uncertainty over the concentration of mAbs in alveoli relative to plasma, we modeled the effects of SIL and TCZ at local concentrations of 100%, 10%, and 1% (Fig 2) of those in plasma. Our model demonstrated that anti-IL-6 was associated with stronger inhibition of CRP than anti-IL-6R. However, only the association of both anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-6R mAbs was associated with a total blockade of CRP, which is probably necessary when IL-6 levels are associated with high risk to the patient. Different administration schedules to intensify anti-IL-6 therapy were modeled, including the repeated or combined use of anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-6R mAbs. The results form a basis to optimize treatment strategies to avoid the cytokine storm in several diseases, including cancer, iMCD, and autoimmune disorders. The feasibility of the theoretically defined approaches needs to be evaluated, particularly the potential side-effect profile for a combined treatment approach. In conclusion, in clinical practice, IL-6 inhibition should be individualized based on pathophysiology and regular CRP monitoring.

During the early phase, little was known about public awareness relating to Coronavirus disease. This study was designed to determine knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) among the Iranian public towards COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was carried out in Iran from 2 March to 8 April 2020 using a self-administered questionnaire on 1,480 people. COVID-19-related KAP questions were adapted from other internationally validated questionnaires specific to infectious diseases. Results: All participants were aware of COVID-19. When asked unprompted, 80% of respondents could correctly cite fever, difficulty breathing and cough as signs/symptoms of COVID-19. Most of our sample population knew that by staying at home and staying isolated (95.3%, 95 % CI: 94.2-96.3) as well as constant hand washing and using disinfectants (92.5%, 95 % CI: 91.1-93.8) could prevent COVID-19. However, there was also widespread misconceptions such as the belief that COVID-19 can be transmitted by wild animals (58%, 95 % CI: 55.5-60.5) and by air (48.3%, 95 % CI: 45.7-50.8). Unprompted, self-reported actions taken to avoid COVID-19 infection included hand washing with soap and water (95.4%, 95 % CI: 94.3-96.4), avoiding crowded places (93%, 95 % CI: 91.7-94.3), cleaning hands with other disinfectants (80.9 %, 95 % CI: 78.9- 82.9), and covering mouths and noses when coughing and sneezing (76.1 %, 95 % CI: 73.9-78.2). The internet and social media (94.5%, 95 % CI: 93.3-95.6) were the main Coronavirus information sources.

However, the long-term success of these medicines is highly dependent on maintaining consistency in quality, safety and efficacy while minimizing any risk of divergence during life-cycle management. In recognition of this need and demand from global manufacturers, the World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Committee on Biological standardization established the WHO 1(st) International standard (IS) for Adalimumab (coded 17/236) in October 2019 with a defined unitage ascribed to each of the individual bioactivities evaluated in the study namely, TNF- binding, TNF- neutralization, complement dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. For development of the IS, two candidate standards were manufactured as per WHO recommendations. Analysis of extensive datasets generated by testing of a common set of samples including the candidate standards by multiple stakeholders including regulatory agencies using their own qualified assays in a large international collaborative study showed comparable biological activity for the tested candidates for the different activities. Use of a common standard significantly decreased the variability of bioassays and improved agreement in potency estimates. Data from this study clearly supports the utility of the IS as an important tool for assuring analytical assay performance, for bioassay calibration and validation, for identifying and controlling changes in bioactivity during life-cycle management and for global harmonization of adalimumab products. In addition, in a separate multi-center study which included involvement of hospital and clinical diagnostic laboratories, the suitability of the adalimumab IS for therapeutic drug monitoring assays was examined by analysis of data from testing of a common blind coded panel of adalimumab spiked serum samples representative of the clinical scenario along with the IS and in-house standards in diverse immunoassays/platforms. Both commercially available and in-house assays that are routinely used for assessing adalimumab trough levels were included.

OSCs use algorithms such as machine learning to facilitate self-diagnosis and triage based on symptoms input by healthcare consumers. However, intelligent systems' lack of transparency and comprehensibility could lead to unintended consequences such as misleading users, especially in high-stakes areas such as healthcare. In this paper, we attempt to enhance diagnostic transparency by augmenting OSCs with explanations. We first conducted an interview study (N=25) to specify user needs for explanations from users of existing OSCs. Then, we designed a COVID-19 OSC that was enhanced with three types of explanations. Our lab-controlled user study (N=20) found that explanations can significantly improve user experience in multiple aspects.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the influence of metabolic health on clinical features in a cross-sectional study in Mexican subjects with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-severe stages after a rigorous classification of obese and non-obese subjects who were metabolically healthy and unhealthy. Four groups were formed: 1) metabolically healthy with normal BMI (MHN); 2) metabolically unhealthy with normal BMI (MUN); 3) metabolically healthy obese (MHO); 4) metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO). Serum proinflammatory (TNF-, MCP-1, IL-1, and IL-6) and anti-inflammatory (TGF-, IL-1Ra, IL-4, and IL-10) cytokines, hematological parameters, coagulation, and acute phase components were evaluated. Our results showed that MHO people live with inflammaging. Meanwhile, MUN and MUO subjects develop metaflammation. Both inflammaging and metaflammation cause imperceptible modifications on hematological parameters, mainly in leukocyte populations and platelets, as well as acute phase and coagulation components. The statistical analysis revealed that many clinical features are dependent on metabolic health. In conclusion, MHO subjects seem to be transitioning from metabolically healthy to unhealthy, which is accelerated in acute processes, such as SARS-CoV-2 infection. Meanwhile, metabolically unhealthy subjects independently of BMI have a deteriorating immunometabolic status associated with a hyperinflammatory state leading to multi-organ dysfunction, treatment complications, and severe COVID-19 disease.","output":"Clinical monitored in subjects metabolically healthy and unhealthy before and during a SARS-CoV-2 infectionC A cross-sectional study in Mexican population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the perinatal and maternal outcomes of pregnancies in women infected with SARS-CoV-2, comparing spontaneous and in vitro fertilization (IVF) pregnancies (with either own or donor oocytes). DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective, observational study. SETTING: 78 centers participating in the Spanish COVID19 Registry. PATIENT(S): 1,347 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 positive results registered consecutively between February 26 and November 5, 2020. INTERVENTION(S): The patients' information was collected from their medical records, and multivariable regression analyses were performed, controlling for maternal age and the clinical presentation of the infection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Obstetrics and neonatal outcomes, pregnancy comorbidities, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation need, and medical conditions. RESULT(S): The IVF group included 74 (5.5%) women whereas the spontaneous pregnancy group included 1,275 (94.5%) women. The operative delivery rate was high in all patients, especially in the IVF group, where cesarean section became the most frequent method of delivery (55.4%, compared with 26.1% of the spontaneous pregnancy group). The reason for cesarean section was induction failure in 56.1% of the IVF patients. IVF women had more gestational hypertensive disorders (16.2% vs. 4.5% among spontaneous pregnancy women, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 5.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.45-10.93) irrespective of oocyte origin. The higher rate of intensive care unit admittance observed in the IVF group (8.1% vs. 2.4% in the spontaneous pregnancy group) was attributed to preeclampsia (aOR 11.82, 95% CI 5.25-25.87), not to the type of conception.

There is no clear consistent evidence of the changes in the immune status of pregnant women after recovery from COVID-19. In this study, we use multiparameter flow cytometry and Luminex assay to determine the immune cell subsets and cytokines, respectively, in the peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood from pregnant women recovering from COVID-19 about 3 months (n=5). Our results showed decreased percentages of Tc2, Tfh17, memory B cells, virus-specific NK cells, and increased percentages of naive B cells in the peripheral blood. Serum levels of IL-1ra and MCP-1 showed a decreased tendency in late recovery stage (LRS) patients. Meanwhile, there was no significant difference in immune cell subsets in the umbilical cord blood. The placentas from LRS patients showed increased CD68+ macrophages infiltration and mild hypoxic features. The inflammatory damage of the placenta may be related to the antiviral response. Since the receptors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, utilized by SARS-CoV-2 are not co-expressed in the placenta, so it is extremely rare for SARS-CoV-2 to cause infection through this route and the impact on the fetus is negligible.","output":"An Immunological Perspective: What Happened to Pregnant Women After Recovering From COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We made the first ever successful effort in India to detect the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 viruses to understand the capability and application of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) surveillance in India.

To date, there are no clinically effective small-molecule drugs for postexposure therapies to treat filoviral infections. EBOV cellular entry and infection involve uptake via macropinocytosis, navigation through the endocytic pathway, and pH-dependent escape into the cytoplasm. We report the inhibition of EBOV cell entry via selective inhibition of vacuolar (V)-ATPase by a new series of phenol-substituted derivatives of the natural product scaffold diphyllin. In cells challenged with Ebola virus, the diphyllin derivatives inhibit viral entry dependent upon structural variations to low nanomolar potencies. Mechanistically, the diphyllin derivatives had no effect on uptake and colocalization of viral particles with endocytic marker LAMP1 but directly modulated endosomal pH. The most potent effects were reversible exhibiting higher selectivity than bafilomycin or the parent diphyllin. Unlike general lysosomotrophic agents, the diphyllin derivatives showed no major disruptions of endocytic populations or morphology when examined with Rab5 and LAMP1 markers. The dilated vacuole phenotype induced by apilimod treatment or in constitutively active Rab5 mutant Q79L-expressing cells was both blocked and reversed by the diphyllin derivatives. The results are consistent with the action of the diphyllin scaffold as a selective pH-dependent viral entry block in late endosomes. Overall, the compounds show improved selectivity and minimal cytotoxicity relative to classical endosomal acidification blocking agents.","output":"Evaluation of Phenol-Substituted Diphyllin Derivatives as Selective Antagonists for Ebola Virus Entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The emerging and evolving situation of Coronavirus disaese-2019 (COVID-19) threatens the health of all human beings.

For example, we, as opposed to many other mentioned readers, consider a symbiont as an organism living in an association with another regardless of whether it causes a pathologic response or not, but from our title, the reader may incorrectly infer that we consider a parasite to be different from a symbiont. A symbiont is an organism that uses another organism as a habitat. This chapter discusses the primary associations and associated conflicts involving the terminology. It also provides both differentiation between and conflicting views regarding the interpretation of the terms infect and infest, infection and disease, and other terms. Many seemingly harmless symbionts of a wide array of taxonomic groups are triggered to become pathogenic or virulent, and we provide several examples of the provoking (stimulating) triggers, with the understanding that in most cases, the conditions for the triggered activities are much more complex and complicated than presented. Examples of triggers follow: environmental ones like temperature, toxic chemicals (dose), chemotherapeutics, dietary changes, and geographic habits; internal ones like host site, host resistance or susceptibility, and host modifications; and combinations of these and other conditions. We provide examples involving multiple triggers for organisms associated with termites, for an endemic virus being affected by multiple factors and having multiple effects on its commercial penaeid shrimp hosts, and for contrasting variables associated with two exotic viruses in wild and cultured commercial penaeid shrimps with an emphasis on hypothesizing how the pathogenicity developed in these two viruses.

A standardised proforma was used to gather information from medical records of all CYP aged >12 years admitted to paediatric wards. Pooled data were analysed using Microsoft Excel.Results231 patients were included. The median age was 14 years old (range 12C17 years). 163(71%) were female. 202(87%) had no known communication difficulties. 53(23%) were known to CAMHS and 43(19%) to social care. 78/231(34%) were admitted with mental health as the presenting complaint.35/231(15%) were documented to be given the opportunity to be spoken to alone;29(82%) accepted.No department had a psychosocial screening tool embedded in the admission document.158/231(69%) had less than half of the eight domains completed. The median was 1.5 (range 0C8). Home and education/employment were most frequently asked (37C42%). Eating/exercise, drugs, safety, sexual activity and other activities were the least frequently asked (14C27%). The proportion of those with a concern identified when asked ranged from 18%-39%.However, in self-harm, depression and suicide, only 85/231(37%) were asked, with concern identified in 87%.78 patients were admitted for mental health;28(39%) had less than half the domains completed (median 5, range 0C8).

For the last decades, the NMR methods have been used to determine the physical and chemical properties of paramagnetic Ln compounds. The studies concerning paramagnetic NMR lanthanide-induced shifts (LISs) in dissolved Ln complexes, as well as the analysis of band shape as a function of temperature make it possible to obtain valuable information on the structure, intra- and intermolecular dynamics and paramagnetic properties thereof. This review is devoted solely to the following features: firstly, the processes of intramolecular dynamics of lanthanide complexes with polyamino-polycarboxylate ligands such as DOTA, EDTA and DTPA and their derivatives studied by NMR; secondly, the LISs of lanthanide complexes with EDTA, DOTA, DTPA and some of their derivatives depending on temperature and pH. Moreover, in this review, for the first time, the dependence of the activation energy of molecular dynamics in complexes with polydentate ligands on the atomic number of the lanthanide cation is analyzed and a monotonic change in energy is detected, which is due to the effect of lanthanide contraction. It should be noted that this phenomenon is quite general and may also appear in the future in many other series of lanthanide complexes with both other multidentate ligands and with bidentate and monodentate ligands.

The study showed that the viruses were present in 7 air (among them 71.4% were BLV-positive and 28.6% were BAdV-positive), 14 surface (among them 85.7% were BLV-positive and 14.3% were BAdV-positive), and 34 milk (all were BLV-positive only) samples.

PPIs reduce reflux acidity, but only transiently inactivate gastric enzymes. Nonacid reflux, specifically nonacid pepsin, contributes to carcinogenesis in the larynx. Given the carcinogenic potential of pepsin and inefficacy of PPIs to prevent EAC, the presence and effect of pepsin in the esophagus should be investigated. METHODS Normal and Barrett's biopsies from 8 Barrett's esophagus patients were collected for pepsin analysis via Western blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Human esophageal cells cultured from healthy patients were treated with pepsin (0.01-1 mg/mL; 1-20 hours), acid (pH 4)pepsin (5 minutes); real-time RT-PCR, ELISA, and cell migration were assayed. RESULTS Pepsin was detected in all 8 Barrett's and 4 of 8 adjacent normal specimens. Pepsinogen mRNA was observed in 22 Barrett's, but not in normal adjacent samples. Pepsin induced PTSG2 (COX-2) and IL-1 expression and cell migration in vitro. CONCLUSIONS Pepsin is synthesized by metaplastic, Barrett's esophageal mucosa.

Second, it led to a supply shock as the pandemic resulted in an oil trade war between the major oil-producing nations (Saudi Arabia and Russia).

We calculated the percent drop in average daily cases from before and after March 18,2020. We then examined variation across states in arthroplasty case volumes as it related to reported COVID-19 cases, the impact of COVID-19 on length of stay (LOS) and percentage of patients discharged home. Finally, we calculated the revenue impact on hospitals and surgeons. RESULTS: There was a steep decline in TKA and THA volumes in mid-March of 94% and 92% respectively. There was a significant variation for arthroplasty case volumes across states. We found minimal change in LOS except for primary THAs with fracture going from 5+ days to 4 days. We saw an increasing trend in discharge to home with the greatest effect in primary THAs with fracture.

These public collections included the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), and the European Bank for induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (EBiSC). Over 300 cell lines were reviewed in this study. Although all cells were obtained from human donors, none of the collections were determined to meet fully verifiable xenofree criteria. A large numbers of cell lines were generated with one or more known xenogenic components (e.g., fetal bovine serum, Matrigel).

It is anticipated that further innovative works on the structural and compositional design of functional 1D nanostructured electrodes for energy storage applications can be stimulated.","output":"Rational Design and Engineering of One-Dimensional Hollow Nanostructures for Efficient Electrochemical Energy Storage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is disproportionately burdening racial and ethnic minority groups in the US. Higher risks of infection and mortality among racialized minorities are a consequence of structural racism, reflected in specific policies that date back centuries and persist today. Yet, our surveillance activities do not reflect what we know about how racism structures risk. When measuring racial and ethnic disparities in deaths due to COVID-19, the CDC statistically accounts for the geographic distribution of deaths throughout the US to reflect the fact that deaths are concentrated in areas with different racial and ethnic distributions than that of the larger US. In this commentary, we argue that such an approach misses an important driver of disparities in COVID-19 mortality, namely the historical forces that determine where individuals live, work, and play, and consequently determine their risk of dying from COVID-19. We explain why controlling for geography downplays the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 on racialized minority groups in the US. Finally, we offer recommendations for the analysis of surveillance data to estimate racial disparities, including shifting from distribution-based to risk-based measures, to help inform a more effective and equitable public health response to the pandemic.","output":"A Geography of Risk: Structural Racism and COVID-19 Mortality in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mental health care is shifting towards more person-centered and community-based health care. Although integrating eHealth within a transforming healthcare setting may help accomplishing the shift, research studying this is lacking. This study aims to improve our understanding of the value of eHealth within a transforming mental healthcare setting and to define the challenges and prerequisites for implementing eHealth in particular within this transforming context. In this article, we present the results of 29 interviews with clients, social network members, and professionals of an ambulatory team in transition within a Dutch mental health care institute. The main finding is that eHealth can support a transforming practice shifting towards more recovery-oriented, person-centered, and community-based service in which shared-decision making is self-evident. The main challenge revealed is how to deal with clients voices, when professionals see the value of eHealth but clients do not want to start using eHealth. The shift towards client-centered and network-oriented care models and towards blended care models are both high-impact changes in themselves. Acknowledging the complexity of combining these high-impact changes might be the first step towards creating blended client-centered and network-oriented care. Future research should examine whether and how these substantial shifts could be mutually supportive.","output":"Integrating eHealth within a Transforming Mental Healthcare Setting: A Qualitative Study into Values, Challenges, and Prerequisites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the beginning of the autumn-winter season, Italy experienced an increase of SARS-CoV-2 cases, requiring the Government to adopt new restrictive measures.

OBJECTIVE: Assess the tolerability of a ketogenic diet (KD) in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) and define the impact on laboratory and clinical outcome metrics. METHODS: Sixty-five subjects with relapsing MS enrolled into a 6-month prospective, intention-to-treat KD intervention. Adherence was monitored with daily urine ketone testing. At baseline, fatigue, depression and quality of life (QoL) scores were obtained in addition to fasting adipokines and MS-related clinical outcome metrics. Baseline metrics were repeated at 3 and/or 6 months on-diet. RESULTS: Eighty-three percent of participants adhered to the KD for the study duration. Subjects exhibited significant reductions in fat mass and showed a nearly 50% decline in self-reported fatigue and depression scores. MS QoL physical health (6716 vs 7912, p<0.001) and mental health (7117 vs 8211, p<0.001) composite scores increased on-diet. Significant improvements were noted in Expanded Disability Status Scale scores (2.30.9 vs 1.91.1, p<0.001), 6-minute walk (1631302 vs 1733330 ft, p<0.001) and Nine-Hole Peg Test (21.53.6 vs 20.33.7 s, p<0.001).

Dysbiosis of the oral microbiome is the initiating factor that leads to oral infectious diseases. Infection is a sophisticated biological process involving interplay between the pathogen and the host, which often leads to activation of programmed cell death. Studies suggest that pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis are involved in multiple oral infectious diseases. Further understanding of crosstalk between cell death pathways has led to pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis being integrated into a single term: PANoptosis. PANoptosis is a multifaceted agent of the immune response that has important pathophysiological relevance to infectious diseases, autoimmunity, and cancer. As such, it plays an important role in innate immune cells that detect and eliminate intracellular pathogens. In addition to the classical model of influenza virus-infected and Yersinia-infected macrophages, other studies have expanded the scope of PANoptosis to include other microorganisms, as well as potential roles in cell types other than macrophages. In this review, we will summarize the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying inflammation and tissue destruction caused by oral pathogens. We present an overview of different pathogens that may induce activation of PANoptosis, along with the functional consequences of PANoptosis in the context of oral infectious diseases. To advance our understanding of immunology, we also explore the strategies used by microbes that enable immune evasion and replication within host cells. Improved understanding of the interplay between the host and pathogen through PANoptosis will direct development of therapeutic strategies that target oral infectious diseases.","output":"PANoptosis: A New Insight Into Oral Infectious Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of the applied whole-body vibration training (WBV) as additional training to standard rehabilitation programme on exercise tolerance, evaluated through an exercise test, blood lipid profile, and the changes in selected echocardiographic parameters of patients after myocardial infarction.

Botulinum toxin is the currently recommended first line treatment for such blepharospasm. This study aims to find out the outcome of injection Botulinum toxin Type A in Blepharospasm. MATERIALS AND METHODS It was a hospital based, prospective, interventional study conducted on patients diagnosed as Benign essential blepharospasm (BEB), Meige syndrome (MS) and Hemifacial spasm (HFS) by oculoplastic surgeon at Oculoplasty department OPD, Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology, from December 2018 to November 2019. After taking all standard precautions for botulinum toxin injections, 6 to 8 sites for injecting 2.5 to 5 IU of the toxin were given. All the patients were evaluated before and after injections according to Jankovic spasm grading and improvement in functional impairment scale and followed on one week, one month, three month and when the symptoms reappeared. RESULTS A total of 43 cases which included 32 cases of Benign essential Blepharospasm, 9 Hemifacial spasm and 2 Meige syndrome. The mean Jankovic severity score was 3.51  0.51 (range 3-4). The mean improvement in functional score was 2.60  0.54 (range 1-3), was statistically significant (p-value <0.001).The effective period of injection was 130  20.82 (93 - 189) days.38 patients had repeated injections after reappearance of symptoms. 4 patients had side effects of redness and hematoma at one site. CONCLUSION This study concludes that Botulinum toxin type A is effective in the management of Benign essential blepharospasm, Hemifacial spasm and Meige syndrome. This along with a good safety profile justifies its role as a first line treatment therapy in blepharospasm.

One Health calls upon the human, animal and environmental health sectors to cross professional, disciplinary and institutional boundaries, and to work in a more integrated fashion. At the global level, this paper argues that this vision is hindered by dysfunctions characterising current forms of global health governance (GHG), namely institutional proliferation, fragmentation, competition for scarce resources, lack of an overarching authority, and donor-driven vertical programmes. This has contributed, in part, to shortcomings in how One Health has been articulated to date. An agreed operational definition of One Health among key global institutions, efforts to build One Health institutions from the ground up, comparative case studies of what works or does not work institutionally, and high-level global support for research, training and career opportunities would all help to enable One Health to help remedy, and not be subsumed by, existing dysfunctions in GHG.","output":"Operationalizing the One Health approach: the global governance challenges."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there are many ways to communicate hygiene measures, such as memes and stickers that are widely used on social networks.

They often have a mild course, are self-limiting and do not need any specific treatment. However, in some cases, the disease can be severe and lead to permanent disabilities. A variety of antiviral drugs are available for the treatments of certain infectious agents: for instance, acyclovir is used to treat herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Recommendations for flu treatment may change according to the current epidemiological surveillance data, on the basis of which antiviral sensibility can be forecast: recommended drugs for the 2020-21 flu season are oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir and baloxavir. Some drugs are used to treat congenital infections, such as valganciclovir and ganciclovir in congenital cytomegalovirus infection. Antiretroviral prophylaxis in newborns from HIV-1 infected mothers must be initiated as soon as possible, with one or more drugs according to therapeutic regimens based on the baby's risk category. According to the most recent guidelines, antiretroviral therapy must be started at diagnosis. Several antiretroviral drugs are available today and approved for use in children, so several combinations can be made. However, out of the 29 antiretroviral drugs approved for adults, only 38% (11/29) are approved for children under the age of two and about 60% (18/29) for children under the age of twelve. Treatment with direct antiviral agents against hepatitis C virus is approved for children over the age of three; it consists in different therapeutic regimens chosen on the basis of the viral genotype (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for genotypes 1, 4, 5 and 6, sofosbuvir/ribavirin for genotypes 2 and 3, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for all genotypes) and it has dramatically changed the course of the illness.

Reopening guidance emphasized PCR or antigen testing for residential students and social distancing measures to reduce the frequency of close interpersonal contact. Connecticut colleges and universities employed a variety of approaches to reopening campuses to residential students. MethodsWe used data on testing, cases, and social contact in 18 residential college and university campuses in Connecticut to characterize institutional reopening strategies and COVID-19 outcomes. We compared institutions fall 2020 COVID-19 plans, submitted to the Connecticut Department of Public Health, and analyzed contact rates and COVID-19 outcomes throughout the academic year. ResultsIn census block groups containing residence halls, fall student move-in resulted in a 475% (95% CI 373%-606%) increase in average contact, and spring move-in resulted in a 561% (441%-713%) increase in average contact. The relationship between test frequency and case rate per residential student was complex: institutions that tested students infrequently detected few cases but failed to blunt transmission, while institutions that tested students more frequently detected more cases and prevented further spread. In fall 2020, each additional test per student per week was associated with a reduction of 0.0014 cases per student per week (95% CI: -0.0028, -0.000012). Residential student case rates were associated with higher case rates in the town where the school was located, but it is not possible to determine whether on-campus infections were transmitted to the broader community or vice versa.

Results: COVID-19 and the necessity of physical distancing have significantly changed the practice in the oncology field. The use of telehealth is widely adopted, physicians are recommended to consider other forms of treatment, and decisions on immediate cancer treatment depend on the level of risk of progression with cancer care delay. Cancer treatment delay is causing the highest mortality rate for patients who are suffering from cancer of the bladder, lungs, ovary, stomach, and esophagus. COVID-19 has shifted the focus of healthcare professionals away from other life-threatening diseases, like cancer. In the United Kingdom, it has been projected that there is at least a 20% increase in the expected cancer-related mortality rate. This is due to abrupt changes in diagnosing and treating cancer patients, physical distancing protocols, economic downfall, as well as the public's behavior in opting for medical assistance.

We report the temporal-spatial spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) among inpatients in a hospital ward during a major nosocomial outbreak and discuss possible mechanisms for the outbreak. Methods. All inpatients who had stayed in the same ward as the initial index case patient for any duration before isolation were recruited into a cohort and followed up to document the occurrence of SARS. The normalized concentration of virus-laden aerosols at different locations of the ward was estimated by use of computational fluid dynamics modeling. The attack rates in the various subgroups stratified by bed location were calculated. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to document important risk factors. Results. The overall attack rate of SARS was 41% (30 of 74 subjects). It was 65%, 52%, and 18% in the same bay, adjacent bay, and distant bays, respectively (P = .001). Computation fluid dynamics modeling indicated that the normalized concentration of virus-laden aerosols was highest in the same bay and lowest in the distant bays. Cox regression indicated that staying in the ward on 6 or 10 March entailed higher risk, as well as staying in the same or adjacent bays. The epidemic curve showed 2 peaks, and stratified analyses by bed location suggested >1 generation of spread. Conclusions.

OBJECTIVES Our study evaluated the change in participants' self-assessed preparedness for serious illness communication before and after the virtual course and satisfaction with the course, and compared these findings to responses from a prior in-person Geritalk course. METHODS Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine fellows at three urban academic medical centers completed surveys, which employed 5-point Likert scales, before and after the virtual course to assess satisfaction with the course and preparedness for serious illness communication. RESULTS Of the 20 virtual Geritalk participants, 17 (85%) completed the pre-course assessment, and 14 (70%) completed the post-course assessment.

However, the Covid-19 pandemic imposed on them the necessity to move from auditoriums to e-learning immediately without any preparation. This paper aims to investigate the Albanian learners attitudes and perceptions of synchronous e-learning during the second semester of the 2019 C 2020 academic year. A survey consisting of 15 questions was distributed to a total of 168 undergraduate and graduate learners in 2 public universities in Albania. Results from the study showed that the learners preferred face-to-face learning over synchronous learning. The lack of motivation, low level of interaction with their instructors and peers, and the feeling of isolation were their main concerns. Meanwhile, the learners appreciated the fact that e-learning helped them to improve their computer and internet skills.

This paper aims to analyze popular diabetes mobile applications in Russia and the possibilities of their use to monitor and support the drug adherence of patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus. Materials and methods. The object of the study was 25 diabetes apps. The survey involved 985 mobile application users from 32 regions of Russia. All respondents were divided into two target segments. The first segment (S1) included 572 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, while the second target segment (S2) consisted of 413 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Field research was carried out by the method of oral survey (12.6%) and web survey (87.4%) using a structured questionnaire. Positioning was carried out using a qualitative method with a two-dimensional map of perception. Competitiveness was assessed by 28 experts using the quantitative method of individual scores with the calculation of integral indicators. Results and discussion. It was found that only about 50% of respondents in the target segment S2 and more than 70% in segment S1 had a high degree of drug adherence. The main barriers to the use of diabetes mobile applications were the insufficient formation of the support system for drug administration regimens (76.6%, S1 and 84.3%, S2) and technical difficulties (51.6%, S1 and 48.7%, S2). A comparative analysis of the results of positioning and assessment of competitiveness showed that some diabetes apps had a higher competitive advantage with an emphasis on supporting drug adherence compared to consumer preferences for their use. A strategic mechanism has been proposed to increase the importance of mobile applications to support drug administration, dosing, and control regimens in patients with diabetes mellitus to satisfy consumer preferences better. Conclusion. The results obtained provide a basis for the development of a set of measures for the further development of the basic segment of the diabetes mobile applications market for monitoring and supporting drug adherence and increasing the competitive advantages of mobile applications, which will contribute to the effective treatment and prevention of diabetes mellitus in Russia and globally.","output":"Popular Diabetes Mobile Applications for Medication Intake Monitoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To describe the longitudinal changes in liver function tests, and their association with illness severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19.

We aimed to quantify the impact of several public health measures including non-medical mask-wearing, shelter-in-place, and detection of silent infections to help inform COVID-19 mitigation strategies. METHODS: We extended a previously established agent-based disease transmission model and parameterized it with estimates of COVID-19 characteristics and US population demographics. We implemented non-medical mask-wearing, shelter-in-place, and case isolation as control measures, and quantified their impact on reducing the attack rate and adverse clinical outcomes. RESULTS: We found that non-medical mask-wearing by 75% of the population reduced infections, hospitalizations, and deaths by 37.7% (interquartile range (IQR): 36.1-39.4%), 44.2% (IQR: 42.9-45.8%), and 47.2% (IQR: 45.5-48.7%), respectively, in the absence of a shelter-in-place strategy. Sheltering individuals aged 50 to 64 years of age was the most efficient strategy, decreasing attack rate, hospitalizations, and deaths by over 82% when combined with mask-wearing. Outbreak control was achieved in the simulated scenarios and the attack rate was reduced to below 1% when at least 33% of silent pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infections were identified and isolated.

The fluid dynamics of this process is difficult to predict because the rupture involved complex liquid-gas transition. Equation of state (EOS) plays a key role in the thermodynamic process of liquid-gas transition. Here, we propose an EOS-based multiphase lattice Boltzmann model, in which the nonideal force is directly evaluated by EOSs. This multiphase model is used to model the pulmonary airway reopening and study aerosol formation during exhalation. The numerical model is first validated with the simulations of Fujioka et al.(2008). and the result is in reasonable agreement with their study. Furthermore, two rupture cases with and without aerosol formation are contrasted and analyzed. It is found that the injury on the epithelium in the case with aerosol formation is essentially the same that of without aerosol formation even while the pressure drop in airway increases by about 67%. Then extensive simulations are performed to investigate the effects of pressure drop, thickness of liquid plug and film on aerosol size and the mechanical stresses. The results show that aerosol size and the mechanical stresses increase as the pressure drop enlarges and thickness of liquid plug become thicken, while aerosol size and the mechanical stresses decrease as thickness of liquid film is thicken.

To prevent thromboembolic complications, it is necessary to develop a method for early thrombus detection. We developed a novel method for detailed real-time observation of thrombi formed in oxygenators using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging. The purpose of this study was to verify the efficacy of this novel method through animal experiments. The experiments were performed three times using three pigs equipped with veno-arterial ECMO comprising a centrifugal pump (CAPIOX SL) and an oxygenator (QUADROX). To create thrombogenic conditions, the pump flow rate was set at 1 L/min without anticoagulation. Diluted ICG was intravenously administered, and the oxygenator was observed with both an optical detector (PDE-neo) and the naked eye every hour until 8 h after measurement initiation. Under ICG fluorescence imaging, the inside of the oxygenator was observed as a white area. A black dot-like area suspected to be the thrombus appeared 6-8 h after measurement initiation. The thrombus could not be recognized in detail with the naked eye observation until the oxygenator was rinsed with physiological saline. The thrombus and the black area on ICG fluorescence imaging were finely matched in terms of morphology. Thus, we succeeded in real-time thrombus detection in an oxygenator using ICG fluorescence imaging. The combined use of ICG imaging and conventional routine screening tests could compensate for each other's weaknesses and significantly improve the safety of ECMO.","output":"Novel application of indocyanine green fluorescence imaging for real-time detection of thrombus in a membrane oxygenator"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) is uncontrollably spread all over the world.

The release of national COVID-19 death data by racial/ethnic group now permits analysis of age-specific mortality rates for these groups and the non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander (NHAPI) population. Our objectives were to examine variation in age-specific COVID-19 mortality rates by racial/ethnicity and to calculate the impact of this mortality using years of potential life lost (YPLL). METHODS AND FINDINGS: This cross-sectional study used the recently publicly available data on US COVID-19 deaths with reported race/ethnicity, for the time period February 1, 2020, to July 22, 2020. Population data were drawn from the US Census. As of July 22, 2020, the number of COVID-19 deaths equaled 68,377 for NHW, 29,476 for NHB, 23,256 for Hispanic, 1,143 for NHAIAN, and 6,468 for NHAPI populations; the corresponding population sizes were 186.4 million, 40.6 million, 2.6 million, 19.5 million, and 57.7 million. Age-standardized rate ratios relative to NHW were 3.6 (95% CI 3.5, 3.8; p < 0.001) for NHB, 2.8 (95% CI 2.7, 3.0; p < 0.001) for Hispanic, 2.2 (95% CI 1.8, 2.6; p < 0.001) for NHAIAN, and 1.6 (95% CI 1.4, 1.7; p < 0.001) for NHAP populations. By contrast, NHB rate ratios relative to NHW were 7.1 (95% CI 5.8, 8.7; p < 0.001) for persons aged 25C34 years, 9.0 (95% CI 7.9, 10.2; p < 0.001) for persons aged 35C44 years, and 7.4 (95% CI 6.9, 7.9; p < 0.001) for persons aged 45C54 years. Even at older ages, NHB rate ratios were between 2.0 and 5.7. Similarly, rate ratios for the Hispanic versus NHW population were 7.0 (95% CI 5.8, 8.7; p < 0.001), 8.8 (95% CI 7.8, 9.9; p < 0.001), and 7.0 (95% CI 6.6, 7.5; p < 0.001) for the corresponding age strata above, with remaining rate ratios ranging from 1.4 to 5.0. Rate ratios for NHAIAN were similarly high through age 74 years. Among NHAPI persons, rate ratios ranged from 2.0 to 2.8 for persons aged 25C74 years and were 1.6 and 1.2 for persons aged 75C84 and 85+ years, respectively. As a consequence, more YPLL before age 65 were experienced by the NHB and Hispanic populations than the NHW populationdespite the fact that the NHW population is largerwith a ratio of 4.6:1 and 3.2:1, respectively, for NHB and Hispanic persons. Study limitations include likely lag time in receipt of completed death certificates received by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for transmission to NCHS, with consequent lag in capturing the total number of deaths compared to data reported on state dashboards. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed racial variation in age-specific mortality rates not fully captured with examination of age-standardized rates alone. These findings suggest the importance of examining age-specific mortality rates and underscores how age standardization can obscure extreme variations within age strata. To avoid overlooking such variation, data that permit age-specific analyses should be routinely publicly available.","output":"Variation in racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 mortality by age in the United States: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Reports have suggested a reduction in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, particularly hospital admissions for severe exacerbations. However, the magnitude of this reduction varies between studies. Method Electronic databases were searched from January 2020 to May 2021. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts and, when necessary, full text to determine if studies met inclusion criteria. A modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess study quality. A narrative summary of eligible studies was synthesised, and meta-analysis was conducted using a random effect model to pool the rate ratio and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for hospital admissions. Exacerbation reduction was compared against the COVID-19 Containment and Health Index. Results A total of 13 of 745 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review, with data from nine countries. Seven studies could be included in the meta-analysis. The pooled rate ratio of hospital admissions for COPD exacerbations during the pandemic period was 0.50 (95% CI 0.42-0.58). Findings on the rate of community-treated exacerbations were inconclusive. Three studies reported a significant decrease in the incidence of respiratory viral infections compared with the pre-pandemic period.

Underpinning that response has been a highly effective virus containment strategy which relies on identification, isolation, and contact tracing of cases. The dramatic emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic rendered traditional paper-based systems for managing contact tracing no longer fit for purpose. A rapid digital transformation of the public health contact tracing system occurred to support this effort. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the digital transformation were to shift legacy systems (paper or standalone electronic systems) to a digitally enabled public health system, where data are centered around the consumer rather than isolated databases. The objective of this paper is to outline this case study and detail the lessons learnt to inform and give confidence to others contemplating digitization of public health systems in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This case study is set in Queensland, Australia. Universal health care is available. A multidisciplinary team was established consisting of clinical informaticians, developers, data strategists, and health information managers. An agile \\"pair-programming\\" approach was undertaken to application development and extensive change efforts were made to maximize adoption of the new digital workflows. Data governance and flows were changed to support rapid management of the pandemic. RESULTS: The digital coronavirus application (DCOVA) is a web-based application that securely captures information about people required to quarantine and creates a multiagency secure database to support a successful containment strategy. CONCLUSION: Most of the literature surrounding digital transformation allows time for significant consultation, which was simply not possible under crisis conditions. Our observation is that staff was willing to adopt new digital systems because the reason for change (the COVID-19 pandemic) was clearly pressing.

Second, we aim to demonstrate that early participation leads to improvements in dyspnea, anxiety and depression as supported by the UCSD SOBQ, GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores respectively. Through chart review, we collected data from 24 patients enrolled in a post-COVID recovery program centered around pulmonary rehabilitation at an academic medical center in Texas. We administered: (1) pulmonary function test (PFT);(2) University of California - San Diego (UCSD) Dyspnea Questionnaire;and (3) six-minute walk (6MW) tests when a patient entered and completed the program. We used this data to assess for subjective and objective changes in respiratory function postrehabilitation. To analyze the indirect benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation on mental health effects of COVID-19, we used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) questionnaires to evaluate a patients' anxiety and depression respectively at the same time points. Our results showed that it took patients an average 67.8 days to initiate rehabilitation after initial diagnosis. 13 of 24 patients began rehab earlier than the average and had an average decrease in UCSD SOBQ score of 35.6 and 6MW increase of 64.5 m compared to the group averages of 17.8 and 74.7 m respectively. The average initial GAD7 and PHQ9 scores were 6.7 and 8.7, with an average decrease of 1.5 and 2.2 respectively. Through our study, we highlight the benefit of early initiation of pulmonary rehabilitation in the post-COVID 19 recovery period. Through both subjective and objective measurements of patient respiratory function and mental health, our study supports inclusion and standardization of early pulmonary rehabilitation as a component of COVID-19 recovery.","output":"Pulmonary Rehabilitation and Its Role in Long-Term COVID-19 Recovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization declared on March 11, 2020, that the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) has escalated from epidemic into pandemic.

In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity of these new Omicron subvariants (BA.2.11, BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5) to eight therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (bamlanivimab, bebtelovimab, casirivimab, cilgavimab, etesevimab, imdevimab, sotrovimab and tixagevimab). Notably, we showed that although cilgavimab is antiviral against BA.2, BA.4/5 exhibits higher resistance to this antibody compared to BA.2. Since mutations are accumulated in the spike proteins of newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, we suggest the importance of rapid evaluation of the efficiency of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against novel SARS-CoV-2 variants.","output":"Sensitivity of novel SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants, BA.2.11, BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 to therapeutic monoclonal antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\19 has hit the world by surprise, causing substantial mortality and morbidity since 2020. This narrative review aims to provide an overview of the epidemiology, induced impact, viral kinetics and clinical spectrum of COVID\\\\19 in the Asia\\\\Pacific Region, focusing on regions previously exposed to outbreaks of coronavirus. COVID\\\\19 progressed differently by regions, with some (such as China and Taiwan) featured by one to two epidemic waves and some (such as Hong Kong and South Korea) featured by multiple waves. There has been no consensus on the estimates of important epidemiological time intervals or proportions, such that using them for making inferences should be done with caution.

With the increasing number of patients in prone position, both spontaneously breathing and mechanically ventilated, cardiac arrest in this position is more likely to occur. This scoping review aimed to summarize the available evidence on cardiopulmonary resuscitation in prone position (reverse CPR) and knowledge or research gaps to be further evaluated. The protocol of this scoping review was prospectively registered on 10th May 2020 in Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/nfuh9). METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE and pre-print repositories (bioRxiv and medRxiv) for simulation, pre-clinical and clinical studies on reverse CPR until 31st May 2020. RESULTS: We included 1 study on manikins, 31 case reports (29 during surgery requiring prone position) and 2 nonrandomized studies describing reverse CPR. No studies were found regarding reverse CPR in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Even if the algorithms provided by the guidelines on basic and advanced life support remain valid in cardiac arrest in prone position, differences exist in the methods of performing CPR. There is no clear evidence of superiority in terms of effectiveness of reverse compared to supine CPR in patients with cardiac arrest occurring in prone position. The quality of evidence is low and knowledge gaps (e.g. protocols, training of healthcare personnel, devices for skill acquisition) should be fulfilled by further research. Meanwhile, a case-by-case evaluation of patient and setting characteristics should guide the decision on how to start CPR in such cases.","output":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation in prone position: A scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human leukocyte antigen system (HLA) is a cluster of highly polymorphic genes essential for the proper function of the immune system, and it has been associated with a wide range of diseases. HLA class I molecules present intracellular host- and pathogen-derived peptides to effector cells of the immune system, inducing immune tolerance in healthy conditions or triggering effective immune responses in pathological situations. HLA-C is the most recently evolved HLA class I molecule, only present in humans and great apes. Differentiating from its older siblings, HLA-A and HLA-B, HLA-C exhibits distinctive features in its expression and interaction partners. HLA-C serves as a natural ligand for multiple members of the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) family, which are predominately expressed by natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells are crucial for the early control of viral infections and accumulating evidence indicates that interactions between HLA-C and its respective KIR receptors determine the outcome and progression of viral infections. In this review, we focus on the unique role of HLA-C in regulating NK cell functions and its consequences in the setting of viral infections.","output":"The New Kid on the Block: HLA-C, a Key Regulator of Natural Killer Cells in Viral Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: During the winter, many patients present with suspected infection that could be a viral or a bacterial (co)infection. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the optimal use of procalcitonin (PCT) is different in patients with and without proven viral infections for the purpose of excluding bacteremia. We hypothesize that when a viral infection is confirmed, this lowers the probability of bacteremia and, therefore, influences the appropriate cutoff of procalcitonin. METHODS: This study was conducted in the emergency department of an academic medical center in The Netherlands in the winter seasons of 2019 and 2020. Adults (>18 years) with suspected infection, in whom a blood culture and a rapid polymerase chain reaction test for influenza was performed were included. RESULTS: A total of 546 patients were included of whom 47 (8.6%) had a positive blood culture. PCT had an area under the curve of 0.85, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.80C0.91, for prediction of bacteremia. In patients with a proven viral infection (N = 212) PCT < 0.5 g/L had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 63.1C100) and specificity of 81.2% (95% CI 75.1C86.3) to exclude bacteremia. In patients without a viral infection, the procalcitonin cutoff point of < 0.25 g/L showed a sensitivity of 87.2% (95% CI 72.6C95.7) and specificity of 64.1 % (95% CI 58.3C69.6). CONCLUSION: In patients with a viral infection, our findings suggest that a PCT concentration of <0.50 g/L makes bacteremia unlikely. However, this finding needs to be confirmed in a larger population of patients with viral infections, especially because the rate of coinfection in our cohort was low.","output":"Optimal use of procalcitonin to rule out bacteremia in patients with possible viral infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Opioid analgesics are effective for postsurgical pain but are associated with opioid-related adverse events, creating a significant clinical and economic burden. Gastrointestinal surgery patients are at high risk for opioid-related adverse events. We conducted a study to assess the impact of an opioid-sparing multimodal analgesia regimen with liposome bupivacaine, compared with the standard of care (intravenous [IV] opioid-based, patient-controlled analgesia [PCA]) on postsurgical opioid use and health economic outcomes in patients undergoing ileostomy reversal. METHODS In this open-label, multicenter study, sequential cohorts of patients undergoing ileostomy reversal received IV opioid PCA (first cohort); or multimodal analgesia including a single intraoperative administration of liposome bupivacaine (second cohort). Rescue analgesia was available to all patients. Primary outcome measures were postsurgical opioid use, hospital length of stay, and hospitalization costs. Incidence of opioid-related adverse events was also assessed. RESULTS Twenty-seven patients were enrolled, underwent the planned surgery, and did not meet any intraoperative exclusion criteria; 16 received liposome bupivacaine-based multimodal analgesia and eleven received the standard IV opioid PCA regimen. The multimodal regimen was associated with significant reductions in opioid use compared with the IV opioid PCA regimen (mean, 20 mg versus 112 mg; median, 6 mg versus 48 mg, respectively; P < 0.01), postsurgical length of stay (median, 3.0 days versus 5.1 days, respectively; P < 0.001), and hospitalization costs (geometric mean, $6482 versus $9282, respectively; P = 0.01). CONCLUSION A liposome bupivacaine-based multimodal analgesic regimen resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in opioid consumption, shorter length of stay, and lower inpatient costs than an IV opioid-based analgesic regimen.","output":"An extended paIn relief trial utilizing the infiltration of a long-acting Multivesicular liPosome foRmulation Of bupiVacaine, EXPAREL (IMPROVE): a Phase IV health economic trial in adult patients undergoing ileostomy reversal."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nature Biotechnology's readers select some of biotech's most remarkable and influential personalities from the past 10 years.","output":"Who's who in biotech"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"JobKeeper is a short-time work subsidy implemented between March 2020 and March 2021 in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic to reinforce the resilience of the labour market. As a job retention (JR) program, JobKeeper supports businesses, protects jobs and employment relationships and secures income of Australian workers. Drawing on microeconomic and macroeconomic evaluations of the JR programs published in other countries in a pre-pandemic period, this paper studies how the generosity, responsiveness, governance and eligibility criteria of JobKeeper may shape its efficiency and equity. We show that expected benefits of JobKeeper may be limited by some negative economic effects of short-time work subsidies. Locking employees in their current position potentially crowds out more efficient matches on the labour market. These displacement effects may slow down economic recovery. As a wage subsidy, JobKeeper distorts the relative wage and employment prospects between eligible and non-eligible workers. These substitution effects can increase the dualization of the Australian labour market and institutionalise lay-offs inequities for workers holding a temporary visa.

Remarkable advances have been made in cancer therapy and the 5-year survival has increased for most patients affected by malignancy. There are growing numbers of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) and up to 20% of all patients admitted to an ICU carry a diagnosis of malignancy. Respiratory failure remains the most common reason for ICU admission and remains the leading causes of death in oncology patients. There are many causes of respiratory failure in this population. Pneumonia is the most common cause of respiratory failure, yet there are many causes of respiratory insufficiency unique to the cancer patient. These causes are often a result of immunosuppression, chemotherapy, radiation treatment, or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). Treatment is focused on supportive care and specific therapy for the underlying cause of respiratory failure. Noninvasive modalities of respiratory support are available; however, careful patient selection is paramount as indiscriminate use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is associated with a higher mortality if mechanical ventilation is later required.

Behavioral tests, visceral sensitivity, immune responses, and fecal bacteria in the colon were evaluated in 5 weeks after SDS exposure.

The alterations in fecal pellet output, bead expulsion time, plasma corticosterone concentration, and colonic 5-HT content in response to restraint stress were exacerbated in the juvenile SDS group compared with the control group. The combination of juvenile SDS and restraint stress increased the noradrenaline metabolite 3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) content and MHPG/noradrenaline ratio in the amygdala when compared with restraint stress in control mice.

Due to the limitations to implementing mass RT-PCR testing for health workers, high-performing and cost-effective methodologies must be developed to help identify COVID-19 positive health workers and protect the spearhead of the battle against the pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the application of machine learning classifiers to predict the risk of COVID-19 positivity (by RT-PCR) using data obtained from a survey specific to health workers. Machine learning tools can enhance COVID-19 screening capacity in high-risk populations such as health workers in environments where cost is a barrier to accessibility of adequate testing and screening supplies. We built two sets of COVID-19 Likelihood Meter (CLM) models: one trained on data from a broad population of health workers in Jakarta and Semarang (full model) and tested on the same, and one trained on health workers from Jakarta only (Jakarta model) and tested on an independent population of Semarang health workers. The area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), average precision (AP), and the Brier score (BS) were used to assess model performance. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) were used to analyze feature importance. The final dataset for the study included 3979 health workers. For the full model, the random forest was selected as the algorithm of choice. It achieved cross-validation mean AUC of 0.818 {+/-} 0.022 and AP of 0.449 {+/-} 0.028 and was high performing during testing with AUC and AP of 0.831 and 0.428 respectively. The random forest model was well-calibrated with a low mean brier score of 0.122 {+/-} 0.004.

In this context, the objectives of the current work were to 1) measure the ability of a triage-based management strategy to limit patient admission and 2) evaluate the success rate of both on-site and remote emergency management regarding symptom relief and pain control over a 1-mo period. We included all patients contacting the dental medicine department for an emergency consultation during the lockdown, between April 1 and April 30, 2020 (N = 570). Following a telephone consultation and based on preestablished admission guidelines, a decision was made at baseline (T0) to either admit the patient for treatment or perform remote management by providing advice and/or drug prescription. Patients were then followed up systematically at 1 wk and 1 mo. Management failure was defined as the need for emergency admission for patients managed remotely since T0 and for new emergency admission for those admitted at T0. The global follow-up rate of patients with a complete data set was 91.4% (N = 521). Of included patients, 49.3% could be managed without admission for emergency reasons for 1 mo. The proportion of successful management was 71.8% and 90.2% at 1 mo for remote and on-site management, respectively. To conclude, the proposed triage-based emergency management strategy with systematic follow-up was a good compromise between limiting patient admission and ensuring effective symptom relief and pain control.

Methods We conducted a retrospective study of LTR who were diagnosed with either influenza or COVID-19 from January 2011-May 2021. Infection definitions and CLAD stage were defined according the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines. Results Fifty-seven LTR with influenza and 33 with COVID-19 were identified. Eleven (19%) of the LTR with influenza developed SBI and seven (21%) with COVID-19 developed SBI (p=0.83). Among patients who developed SBI, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common isolated pathogen (44%). Five (9%) and 7 (21%) LTR developed SFI within 90 days post Influenza and COVID-19 infection, respectively (p = 0.09). Among patients with fungal infection, Aspergillus species were the most common pathogen (75%). At 180 days post RVI, all-cause mortality was higher in LTR with SBI (17%) compared to those without (3%), p=0.02. Mortality was similarly higher in LTR with SFI (33%), compared to those without (1.3%), p<0.0001. At 180 days post RVI, LTR with SBI had progression of CLAD stage 43% vs 11%, p=0.004. Based on univariable logistic regression, LTR who had augmented corticosteroids at time of RVI, and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) had higher risk of SFI (odds ratio (OR) of 6.57 (1.8, 23.9), p=0.002 and 12.5 (2.53, 61.7), p=0.004, respectively).

Moreover, the impact of fluid administration as drug diluent or to preserve catheter patency, i.e., fluid creep, should also be considered. As for antibiotics, intravenous fluid administration should follow the four Ds: drug, dosing, duration, de-escalation. Among crystalloids, balanced solutions limit acidCbase alterations and chloride load and should be preferred, as this likely prevents renal dysfunction. Among colloids, albumin, the only available natural colloid, may have beneficial effects. The last decade has seen growing interest in the potential harms related to fluid overloading. In the perioperative setting, appropriate fluid management that maintains adequate organ perfusion while limiting fluid administration should represent the standard of care. Protocols including a restrictive continuous fluid administration alongside bolus administration to achieve hemodynamic targets have been proposed. A similar approach should be considered also for critically ill patients, in whom increased endothelial permeability makes this strategy more relevant. Active de-escalation protocols may be necessary in a later phase.

A new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was associated with a newly identified respiratory syndrome, COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, in early December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread across the globe resulting in 117 million cases and 2.59 million deaths by March 2021. Rapidly increased numbers of COVID-19 cases overwhelmed public health systems across the world, imposing increased working hours and workloads for health care workers. Here, we have evaluated the prevalence of health outcomes and associated factors of interns and resident physicians in Panama. Methods. A cross-sectional study was undertaken during July 23, 2020, to August 13, 2020, to evaluate the prevalence of health outcomes and associated factors in interns and residents across Panama. Snowball sampling was used to recruit participants. Then an electronic questionnaire with scales to evaluate anxiety disorders (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9) and post-traumatic stress (IES-R) was evaluated. In addition, socio-demographic variables, clinical history of mental disorders and COVID-19 exposure were evaluated. Independent analyses for each mental health outcome were undertaken using a logistic regression analysis. Results. A total of 517/1205 (42.9%) interns and residents were nationwide recruited. Of these 274 (53.0%) were interns and 243 (47.0%) residents. The overall prevalence of depression symptoms was 25.3%, 13.7% anxiety and 12.2% post-traumatic stress.

This complex pathway is only poorly understood in context of immune regulation but critical to control infection. This study examines SARS-CoV-2-infection and epithelial mechanisms of the kinin-kallikrein-system at the kinin B(2) receptor level in SARS-CoV-2-infection that is of direct translational relevance. From acute SARS-CoV-2-positive study participants and -negative controls, transcriptomes of nasal curettages were analyzed. Primary airway epithelial cells (NHBEs) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with the approved B(2)R-antagonist icatibant. SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-qPCR, cytotoxicity assays, plaque assays, and transcriptome analyses were performed. The treatment effect was further studied in a murine airway inflammation model in vivo. Here, we report a broad and strong upregulation of kallikreins and the kinin B(2) receptor (B(2)R) in the nasal mucosa of acutely symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive study participants. A B(2)R-antagonist impeded SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread in NHBEs, as determined in plaque assays on Vero-E6 cells. B(2)R-antagonism reduced the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2, G proteinCcoupled receptor signaling, and ion transport in vitro and in a murine airway inflammation in vivo model. In summary, this study provides evidence that treatment with B(2)R-antagonists protects airway epithelial cells from SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting its replication and spread, through the reduction of ACE2 levels and the interference with several cellular signaling processes. Future clinical studies need to shed light on the airway protection potential of approved B(2)R-antagonists, like icatibant, in the treatment of early-stage COVID-19.

The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting lockdown led to an emphasis on outpatient care, fewer presentations to hospital for non-COVID-19-related illnesses, changes in work practices and a reduction in air pollution. Our aim was to determine the impact of these changes on hospital admissions with acute IBD flares. METHODS: The hospital in-patient enquiry (HIPE) department provided records of all patients admitted with acute IBD flares during the first Irish lockdown from March to May 2020 and for the corresponding period in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Electronic patient records were used to assess patient demographics, biochemical markers, imaging, medication use and outcome. RESULTS: 101 patients were admitted with an acute IBD flare. This was a marked reduction when compared to the corresponding period in the previous three years (p<0.0001). Despite the rates of admission decreasing in this period, rates of colectomy were significantly increased (p<0.0001). (Table 1). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated a significant decrease in hospital admissions for acute IBD flares during the first wave of the pandemic. We postulate that changes in environmental triggers of IBD such as working from home and reduced stress levels in addition to reduced air pollution may account for this reduction. The increased rate of colectomy likely reflects a more severe presentation of IBD and patients reluctance to attend the hospital at an early stage in their disease flare as well as non-adherence to prescribed IBD therapies due to a perceived COVID-19-related risk.","output":"P258 Rates of admission of acute IBD flares during the COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary healthcare setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To evaluate the impact of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in the emergency department (ED). METHODS Computerised records of all ED visits in January and May 2003 were analysed and compared, representing before and during the SARS epidemic respectively. Data were grouped into two categories. Group 1 was the indicators of impact on patients, including visitor's condition classification, number of patients that died on arrival (DOA), received cardiopulmonary resuscitation, underwent endotracheal intubation, needed mechanical ventilation, discharged against medical advice (AAD), died in the ED, and the admission rate to wards. Group 2 was the indicators of impact on the quality of medical care, including number of visits that returned within 72 hours (early returns), underwent chest radiography, upper abdomen sonography or computed tomography, and the length of stay. RESULTS There were 6650 and 3901 consecutive encounters in January and May 2003 respectively. There were significant differences on condition classifications (p = 0.000), increased rate of patients that underwent endotracheal intubation (p = 0.003), needed mechanical ventilation (p = 0.020), and admission (p = 0.000). The rate of AAD decreased significantly (p = 0.024). There was no significant difference on early returns, although the length of stay in the ED increased (p = 0.043). The number of visits that underwent chest radiological examination increased (p = 0.000) and upper abdomen sonography (p = 0.007) decreased significantly in May. CONCLUSIONS SARS had an impact on the medical service system and decreased visits by 40% in the ED. Patients visiting the ED had more severe conditions than before.

In particular, large decreases were found in nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions (>50%) from transportation. However, O3 increased in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), which cannot be fully explained by changes in NOx and volatile organic compound (VOCs) emissions. In this study, the Community Multi-scale Air Quality model was used to investigate O3 increase in the YRD. Our results show a significant increase of atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC) indicated by enhanced oxidants levels (up to +25%) especially in southern Jiangsu, Shanghai and northern Zhejiang, inducing the elevated O3 during lockdown. Moreover, net P(HOx) of 0.4 to 1.6 ppb h?1 during lockdown (Case 2) was larger than the case without lockdown (Case 1), mainly resulting in the enhanced AOC and higher O3 production rate (+12%).

Throughout the world with a large number of people being affected by covid 19, the need for the ventilators has risen. However, there is disproportionate ratio of demand versus supply of ventilators due to the menace caused by Covid 19 which has become unmanageable. This paper describes the design of the low cost portable mechanical bag valve mask compressor which could serve as a preliminary ventilator for the patients needing ventilator support in COVID 19. This prototype ventilator delivers breaths by compressing a conventional bag-valve mask (BVM) with a motor, eliminating the need for a human operator for the BVM. It is driven by a wind shield wiper electric motor powered by a 12 V battery. Additionally it can be used to deliver oxygen through either Laryngeal mask or compact face masks or nasopharyngeal airways where intubation is awaited in early breathlessness. Future additions for our prototype ventilator will include a controllable inspiration to expiration time ratio, a pressure relief valve, PEEP capabilities and an LCD screen. With a prototyping cost of only $150, the concept of BVM compressor is a low-cost, low-power portable ventilator technology that will provide essential ventilator features at a fraction of the cost of existing technology.","output":"Concept and Prelimnary Design of an Economical Bag Valve Mask Compressor as a Prototype for Simple Ventilator During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Fetal ear length measurement has been associated with some clinical values: sonographic marker for chromosomal aneuploidy and for biometric estimation of fetal gestational age.

The type and estimated reporting rate (RR) of serious AEs of interest, including infection, gastrointestinal, vascular, respiratory, neoplasm and cardiac events, were reviewed. Patient-years of exposure (PY) was estimated based on worldwide sales data and the calculated daily regimens of tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg twice daily, immediate- or extended-release formulations. RESULTS During the 27-month reporting period, worldwide post-marketing exposure to tofacitinib was 8916 PY. Overall, 4226 case reports were received and included 12 103 AEs, of which 1839 were serious AEs (SAEs). Among the cases reported, 1141 (27.0%) included an SAE and 18 (0.4%) were fatal.

Knowledge of coronavirus-related risk factors can help countries build more systematic and successful responses to COVID-19 disease outbreak. Here we used Supervised Machine Learning and Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK) techniques to reveal correlates and patterns of COVID-19 Disease outbreak in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Methods: We analyzed time series aggregate data compiled by Johns Hopkins University on the outbreak of COVID-19 disease across SSA. COVID-19 data was merged with additional data on socio-demographic and health indicator survey data for 39 of SSA 48 countries that reported confirmed cases and deaths from coronavirus between February 28, 2020 through March 26, 2020. We used supervised machine learning algorithm, Lasso for variable selection and statistical inference. EBK was used to also create a raster estimating the spatial distribution of COVID-19 disease outbreak. Results: The lasso Cross-fit partialing out predictive model ascertained seven variables significantly associated with the risk of coronavirus infection (i.e. new HIV infections among pediatric, adolescent, and middle-aged adult PLHIV, time (days), pneumococcal conjugate-based vaccine, incidence of malaria and diarrhea treatment). Our study indicates, the doubling time in new coronavirus cases was 3 days. The steady three-day decrease in coronavirus outbreak rate of change (ROC) from 37% on March 23, 2020 to 23% on March 26, 2020 indicates the positive impact of countries' steps to stymie the outbreak. The interpolated maps show that coronavirus is rising every day and appears to be severely confined in South Africa. In the West African region (i.e. Burkina Faso, Ghana, Senegal, CotedIviore, Cameroon, and Nigeria), we predict that new cases and deaths from the virus are most likely to increase. Interpretation: Integrated and efficiently delivered interventions to reduce HIV, pneumonia, malaria and diarrhea, are essential to accelerating global health efforts.

The effectiveness of policies that prescribe closures of schools and workplaces is declining with population density, country surface area, employment rate and proportion of elderly in the population; and increasing with GDP per capita and health expenditure. Cross-country human mobility data reinforce some of these results. We argue that the findings can be explained by behavioural response to risk perceptions and resource constraints.

Method: A large sample of adults who had sustained mild, moderate or severe TBIs seven months prior (N = 165) and a control group (N = 106) underwent DTI and cognitive testing. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were calculated for 5 regions (corpus callosum: genu, body, splenium; fornix; superior longitudinal fasciculus) that recent meta-analyses identified as being affected by TBI and related to cognition following TBI. Memory, attention and executive functioning, which are often affected by TBI, were assessed. Results: Overall, mild TBI did not show significant WM or cognitive changes, relative to controls, but moderate to severe TBI was associated with large WM alterations (all regions) and poorer cognitive performance. No significant correlations were found between DTI findings and cognition in the moderate to severe group. Conclusions: The findings have shown that moderate to severe TBI leads to considerable WM and cognitive changes.

This concept paper adopts an exploratory and qualitative literature review to provide managerial insights for the supply chain participants. Due to implementation delay and strategic interdependency, the supply chain management strategies need to be systematically integrated. A viable way to integrate strategies is based on the disaster management cycle: mitigation, preparation, response, and recovery phases. Our model integrates innovative and successful but overlooked supply chain management strategies.

The views of supporters and opponents of vaccinations clash, which is particularly visible on the Internet and social media. Clearly, the discussions are particularly lively at this time due to the challenge facing countries around the world to immunise large numbers of people with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in order to contain the raging pandemic. Although the dispute over vaccination undoubtedly contributes to an increase in public awareness of this issue, it also brings a large dose of chaos and disinformation. The discussion about vaccinations is often accompanied by a lack of substantive content and presentation of scientifically verified arguments, while mutual hostility, threats and dissemination of untrue information dominate. This situation negatively affects parents who, as a consequence, have a problem with making an informed decision about their childs vaccination. It is also a source of high stress: on the one hand, there is the obligation to vaccinate, while on the other hand, there is a fear of adverse reactions to vaccines, which is framed in psychology as the so-called approachCavoidance conflict and the phenomenon of cognitive dissonance. Many parents deal with this conflict by looking for information, e.g. by asking their paediatrician. However, they do not always find understanding with them either, which deepens their anxiety and frustration. The aim of the article is to draw attention to the above problem, to characterise the social discussion on vaccination, to emphasise the special role of the doctor and doctorCpatient communication in this regard, and to provide recommendations on how to effectively conduct this kind of communication. ?

Mobile Edge Caching (MEC) in the 6G networks has been evolved as an efficient solution to meet the phenomenal growth of the global mobile data traffic by bringing multimedia content closer to the users. Although massive connectivity enabled by MEC networks will significantly increase the quality of communications, there are several key challenges ahead. The limited storage of edge nodes, the large size of multimedia content, and the time-variant users' preferences make it critical to efficiently and dynamically predict the popularity of content to store the most upcoming requested ones before being requested. Recent advancements in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have drawn much research attention to predict the content popularity in proactive caching schemes. Existing DNN models in this context, however, suffer from longterm dependencies, computational complexity, and unsuitability for parallel computing. To tackle these challenges, we propose an edge caching framework incorporated with the attention-based Vision Transformer (ViT) neural network, referred to as the Transformer-based Edge (TEDGE) caching, which to the best of our knowledge, is being studied for the first time.

The first nontravel-related U.S. case was confirmed on February 26 in a California resident who had become ill on February 13 (3). Two days later, on February 28, a second nontravel-related case was confirmed in the state of Washington (4,5). Examination of four lines of evidence provides insight into the timing of introduction and early transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, into the United States before the detection of these two cases. First, syndromic surveillance based on emergency department records from counties affected early by the pandemic did not show an increase in visits for COVID-19-like illness before February 28. Second, retrospective SARS-CoV-2 testing of approximately 11,000 respiratory specimens from several U.S. locations beginning January 1 identified no positive results before February 20. Third, analysis of viral RNA sequences from early cases suggested that a single lineage of virus imported directly or indirectly from China began circulating in the United States between January 18 and February 9, followed by several SARS-CoV-2 importations from Europe. Finally, the occurrence of three cases, one in a California resident who died on February 6, a second in another resident of the same county who died February 17, and a third in an unidentified passenger or crew member aboard a Pacific cruise ship that left San Francisco on February 11, confirms cryptic circulation of the virus by early February. These data indicate that sustained, community transmission had begun before detection of the first two nontravel-related U.S. cases, likely resulting from the importation of a single lineage of virus from China in late January or early February, followed by several importations from Europe.

The British Nuclear Medicine Society (BNMS) COVID-19 survey assessed the impact of the first wave of pandemic on NM services in the UK. With COVID-19 resurge compounded by seasonal winter pressures, we reflect and share lessons learnt from the first wave of pandemic to guide future strategy. METHODS: A questionnaire consisting of 34 questions was sent out to all BNMS members over 2 weeks in May 2020, to evaluate the impact of 'lockdown'. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-eight members (92 sites) from a multidisciplinary background responded. There was a 65% reduction across all services; 97.6% of respondents reported some reduction in diagnostic procedures and 71.3% reduction in therapies; 85% worked with a reduced workforce. The North East of England, Greater London and South East and Wessex were most affected by staff absences. The North East reported the highest number of COVID-19 positive staff; London reported the greatest lack of testing. The reported time required to clear the backlog was 1-12 months. Seventy-one percent of participants used BNMS COVID-19 guidance. CONCLUSION: The first wave caused a major disruption of NM service delivery and impacted on the workforce. The departmental strategies should tailor services to evolving local and regional differences in prevalence of COVID-19.

Improving ELISAs is crucial for detecting biomolecules relates to health disorders and facilitating diagnosis at the early diseases stages. Several methods have been developed to improve the ELISA sensitivity through immobilization of antibodies on the microtiter plates. We have developed a highly sensitive ELISA strategy based on the preparation of acetylated chitosan surfaces in order to improve the antibodies orientation. RESULTS Chitin surfaces were obtained by mixing small quantities of chitosan and acetic anhydride in each well of a microtiter plate. Anti-c-myc 9E10 low affinity antibody fused to ChBD was cloned and expressed in CHO cells obtaining the anti-c-myc-ChBD antibody. We found that anti c-myc-ChBD binds specifically to the chitin surfaces in comparison with anti-c-myc 9E10, which did not. Chitin surface was used to develop a sandwich ELISA to detect the chimeric human protein c-myc-GST-IL8 cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The ELISA assays developed on chitin surfaces were 6-fold more sensitive than those performed on standard surface with significant differences (p<0,0001).

For improvements to occur, it is necessary to be able to estimate the vulnerability of pharmaceutical supply chains.

Key metrics include expected drug shortages, average time-to-shortage, and average time-to-recovery. We parametrize the model using data from major drug shortage databases and a case example of a generic injectable oncology drug. With a lean supply chain configuration, we observe that expected shortages at status quo conditions are 10%. By either doubling the speed of recovery or halving the disruption rate, expected shortages could drop to 5%. The most influential single change would be to add a back-up supplier to a lean configuration, leading to expected shortages of 4%.

This imposes a treatment burden on both patients and clinicians and, most importantly of all, can be sight threatening. Changing treatment to an intravitreal corticosteroid implant at the appropriate time may help optimise patient outcomes and reduce injection frequency, thereby reducing treatment burden. Eight retina specialists convened to discuss how to ensure eyes with CI-DMO receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy are evaluated for a potential change to intravitreal corticosteroid therapy at the most effective time in their treatment journey. They concluded that clear criteria on when to consider changing treatment would be helpful and so developed a consensus guideline covering key decision points such as when and how to assess response to anti-VEGF therapy, when to consider a change to corticosteroid therapy and when and how to assess the response to corticosteroid therapy. The guideline was developed before the COVID-19 pandemic but, with the additional challenges arising from this including even greater pressure on clinic capacity, it is more important than ever to reconsider current working practices and adopt changes to improve patient care while also easing pressure on clinic capacity, reducing hospital visits and maintaining patient safety. This publication therefore also includes suggestions for adapting the guidelines in the COVID-19 era. ?","output":"Treatment choices for diabetic macular oedema: A guideline for when to consider an intravitreal corticosteroid, including adaptations for the COVID-19 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread rapidly worldwide. Neutralizing antibodies are a potential treatment for COVID-19. Objective: To determine the effect of bamlanivimab monotherapy and combination therapy with bamlanivimab and etesevimab on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load in mild to moderate COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: The BLAZE-1 study is a randomized phase 2/3 trial at 49 US centers including ambulatory patients (N = 613) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and had 1 or more mild to moderate symptoms. Patients who received bamlanivimab monotherapy or placebo were enrolled first (June 17-August 21, 2020) followed by patients who received bamlanivimab and etesevimab or placebo (August 22-September 3). These are the final analyses and represent findings through October 6, 2020. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive a single infusion of bamlanivimab (700 mg [n = 101], 2800 mg [n = 107], or 7000 mg [n = 101]), the combination treatment (2800 mg of bamlanivimab and 2800 mg of etesevimab [n = 112]), or placebo (n = 156). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was change in SARS-CoV-2 log viral load at day 11 (4 days). Nine prespecified secondary outcome measures were evaluated with comparisons between each treatment group and placebo, and included 3 other measures of viral load, 5 on symptoms, and 1 measure of clinical outcome (the proportion of patients with a COVID-19-related hospitalization, an emergency department [ED] visit, or death at day 29). Results: Among the 577 patients who were randomized and received an infusion (mean age, 44.7 [SD, 15.7] years; 315 [54.6%] women), 533 (92.4%) completed the efficacy evaluation period (day 29). The change in log viral load from baseline at day 11 was -3.72 for 700 mg, -4.08 for 2800 mg, -3.49 for 7000 mg, -4.37 for combination treatment, and -3.80 for placebo. Compared with placebo, the differences in the change in log viral load at day 11 were 0.09 (95% CI, -0.35 to 0.52; P = .69) for 700 mg, -0.27 (95% CI, -0.71 to 0.16; P = .21) for 2800 mg, 0.31 (95% CI, -0.13 to 0.76; P = .16) for 7000 mg, and -0.57 (95% CI, -1.00 to -0.14; P = .01) for combination treatment. Among the secondary outcome measures, differences between each treatment group vs the placebo group were statistically significant for 10 of 84 end points. The proportion of patients with COVID-19-related hospitalizations or ED visits was 5.8% (9 events) for placebo, 1.0% (1 event) for 700 mg, 1.9% (2 events) for 2800 mg, 2.0% (2 events) for 7000 mg, and 0.9% (1 event) for combination treatment. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 9 patients (6 bamlanivimab, 2 combination treatment, and 1 placebo). No deaths occurred during the study treatment. Conclusions and Relevance: Among nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness, treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab, compared with placebo, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load at day 11; no significant difference in viral load reduction was observed for bamlanivimab monotherapy. Further ongoing clinical trials will focus on assessing the clinical benefit of antispike neutralizing antibodies in patients with COVID-19 as a primary end point.

Nrf2 is a transcription actor that helps maintain metabolic balance by providing redox-sensitive expression of numerous genes controlling normal day-to-day metabolic pathways. When ordinary metabolism is upset by extraordinary events such as injury, pathogenic infection, air or water pollution, ingestion of toxins, or simply by the slow but incessant changes brought about by aging and genetic variations, Nrf2 may also be called into action by the redox changes resulting from these events, whether acute or chronic. A complicating factor in all of this is that Nrf2 levels decline with aging, leaving the elderly less able to maintain proper redox balance. The dysregulated gene expression that results can cause or exacerbate a wide variety of pathological conditions, including susceptibility to viral infections. This review examines the characteristics desirable in Nrf2 activators that have therapeutic potential, as well as some of the patterns of dysregulated gene expression commonly observed during pulmonary infections and the normalizing effects possible by judicious use of phytochemicals to increase the activation level of available Nrf2.","output":"Nrf2 Activator PB125? as a Carnosic Acid-Based Therapeutic Agent against Respiratory Viral Diseases, including COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Small mammals such as bats and rodents have been increasingly recognized as reservoirs of novel potentially zoonotic pathogens. However, few in vitro model systems to date allow assessment of zoonotic viruses in a relevant host context. The cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) is a New World rodent species that has a long-standing history as an experimental animal model due to its unique susceptibility to human viruses. Furthermore, wild cotton rats are associated with a large variety of known or potentially zoonotic pathogens. METHODS: A method for the isolation and culture of airway epithelial cell lines recently developed for bats was applied for the generation of rodent airway and renal epithelial cell lines from the cotton rat. Continuous cell lines were characterized for their epithelial properties as well as for their interferon competence. Susceptibility to members of zoonotic Bunya-, Rhabdo-, and Flaviviridae, in particular Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), West Nile virus (WNV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) was tested. Furthermore, novel arthropod-derived viruses belonging to the families Bunya-, Rhabdo-, and Mesoniviridae were tested. RESULTS: We successfully established airway and kidney epithelial cell lines from the cotton rat, and characterized their epithelial properties. Cells were shown to be interferon-competent. Viral infection assays showed high-titre viral replication of RVFV, VSV, WNV, and TBEV, as well as production of infectious virus particles. No viral replication was observed for novel arthropod-derived members of the Bunya-, Rhabdo-, and Mesoniviridae families in these cell lines. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we showed that newly established cell lines from the cotton rat can serve as host-specific in vitro models for viral infection experiments. These cell lines may also serve as novel tools for virus isolation, as well as for the investigation of virus-host interactions in a relevant host species.","output":"Epithelial cell lines of the cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) are highly susceptible in vitro models to zoonotic Bunya-, Rhabdo-, and Flaviviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Early reports have shown that critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a high prevalence of nosocomial pneumonia, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). METHOD: In the present study, we determined the bacterial agents isolated in endotracheal aspirate (ETA) cultures of Covid-19 general intensive care patients and evaluated the antibiotic resistance profiles of common bacterial agents compared to the pre-pandemic period. RESULTS: While a total of 119 significant growths with polymicrobial growths were detected in the ETA cultures of 73 (7.5%) of 971 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit before the pandemic, 87 significant growths were detected in the ETA cultures of 67 (11.1%) of 602 patients hospitalized in the Covid-19 intensive care unit (ICU) after the pandemic. While 61 (83.6%) of patients in the ICU died before the pandemic, 63 (94.0%) of patients in the Covid-19 ICU died after the pandemic. In terms of age, gender, and mortality, there was no significant difference between the two ICUs (p > 0.05). Before the pandemic, the mean length of stay in the ICU was 33.59  32.89 days, and after the pandemic, it was 13.49  8.03 days. This was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05). Acinetobacter baumannii (28.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (22.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.7%), Escherichia coli (7.5%), Candida spp. (5.0%) were the most prevalent causal bacteria discovered in pre-pandemic ICU ETA samples, whereas A. baumannii (54.0%), K. pneumoniae (10.3%), P. aeruginosa (6.8%), E. faecium (8%), and Candida spp.(13.7%) were the most common causative microorganisms detected in Covid-19 ICU ETA samples. Except for tigecycline, antibiotic resistance rates in A. baumannii strains increased following the pandemic. Only tobramycin showed a significant difference in the increase of resistance among these antibiotics (p = 0.037). The rate of tigecycline resistance, on the other hand, was 17.6% before the pandemic and 2.2% afterward (p < 0.05). After the pandemic, increased resistance of K. pneumoniae strains to colistin, meropenem, ertapenem, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin-tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, tigecycline, and cefepime antibiotics was observed. However, these increases were not statistically significant. Except for imipenem, antibiotic resistance rates in P. aeruginosa strains increased following the pandemic. The resistance rise of the antibiotics ceftazidime and levofloxacin was shown to be significantly different (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: As a result, the Covid-19 pandemic requires intensive care follow-ups at an earlier age and with a more mortal course. Although the length of stay in the intensive care unit has been shortened, it is observed that this situation is observed due to early mortality. In P. aeruginosa strains, a significant difference was detected in the resistance increase of the ceftazidime and levofloxacin (p < 0.05) and with the exception of tigecycline, antibiotic resistance rates in A. baumannii strains increased following the pandemic. Only tobramycin showed a significant difference in the increase of resistance among these antibiotics (p = 0.037).

We evaluated 358 SARS-CoV-2 patients and 314 healthy Sardinian controls. One hundred and twenty patients were asymptomatic, 90 were pauci-symptomatic, 108 presented a moderate disease course and 40 were severely ill. All patients were analyzed for the Neanderthal-derived genetic variants reported as being protective (rs1156361) or causative (rs35044562) for severe illness.

The flow-diverting device is an innovative and effective technique to allow securing of large, giant, and wide-neck aneurysms. In numerous studies, the flow-diverting device has shown better outcomes than coil embolization.

Potential pathogens in the nasopharynx of hospitalised children with pneumonia have not been studied previously in DR Congo. Here we compare clinical characteristics, risk factors and nasopharyngeal occurrence of bacteria and viruses between children with severe and non-severe pneumonia. METHODS: Between June 2015 and June 2017, 116 children aged from 2 to 59 months hospitalised due to radiologically confirmed pneumonia at Panzi referral university hospital, Bukavu, Eastern DR Congo were included in the study and sampled from nasopharynx. A multiplex real-time PCR assay for detection of 15 different viruses and 5 bacterial species was performed and another multiplex PCR assay was used for pneumococcal serotype/serogroup determination. RESULTS: During the study period 85 (73%) of the children with radiologically confirmed pneumonia met the WHO classification criteria of severe pneumonia and 31 (27%) had non-severe pneumonia. The fatality rate was 9.5%. Almost all (87%) children were treated with antibiotics before they were hospitalised, in most cases with amoxicillin (58%) or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (20%). The frequency of potential pathogens in the nasopharynx of the children was high, and any viral or bacterial nucleic acids present at high levels, irrespective of species or type, were significantly associated with severe pneumonia as compared with non-severe cases (52% versus 29%, p = 0.032).

We found 3 patients (7%) with bilateral conjunctivitis in whom PCR analysis on conjunctival swabs provided negative results for SARS-CoV-2. No alterations in corneal sensitivity were found. We demonstrated the absence of retinal involvement in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients. Ophthalmologic evaluation in COVID-19, particularly in patients hospitalized in an ICU setting, may be useful to reveal systemic co-infections by opportunistic pathogens.","output":"Retinal involvement and ocular findings in COVID-19 pneumonia patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an unprecedented worldwide public health crisis that requires new management approaches. COVIDApp is a mobile app that was adapted for the management of institutionalized individuals in long-term care facilities. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to report the implementation of this innovative tool for the management of long-term care facility residents as a high-risk population, specifically for early identification and self-isolation of suspected cases, remote monitoring of mild cases, and real-time monitoring of the progression of the infection. METHODS: COVIDApp was implemented in 196 care centers in collaboration with 64 primary care teams. The following parameters of COVID-19 were reported daily: signs/symptoms; diagnosis by reverse transcriptaseCpolymerase chain reaction; absence of symptoms for 14 days; total deaths; and number of health care workers isolated with suspected COVID-19. The number of at-risk centers was also described. RESULTS: Data were recorded from 10,347 institutionalized individuals and up to 4000 health care workers between April 1 and 30, 2020. A rapid increase in suspected cases was seen until day 6 but decreased during the last two weeks (from 1084 to 282 cases). The number of confirmed cases increased from 419 (day 6) to 1293 (day 22) and remained stable during the last week. Of the 10,347 institutionalized individuals, 5,090 (49,2%) remained asymptomatic for 14 days. A total of 854/10,347 deaths (8.3%) were reported; 383 of these deaths (44.8%) were suspected/confirmed cases. The number of isolated health care workers remained high over the 30 days, while the number of suspected cases decreased during the last 2 weeks. The number of high-risk long-term care facilities decreased from 19/196 (9.5%) to 3/196 (1.5%). CONCLUSIONS: COVIDApp can help clinicians rapidly detect and remotely monitor suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 among institutionalized individuals, thus limiting the risk of spreading the virus. The platform shows the progression of infection in real time and can aid in designing new monitoring strategies.","output":"COVIDApp as an Innovative Strategy for the Management and Follow-Up of COVID-19 Cases in Long-Term Care Facilities in Catalonia: Implementation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Although cardiovascular comorbidities seem to be strongly associated with worse outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), data regarding patients with pre-existing heart failure are limited. Aims: To investigate the incidence, characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 with a history of heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction. Methods: We performed an observational multicentre study including all patients hospitalized for COVID-19 across 24 centres in France from 26 February to 20 April 2020. The primary endpoint was a composite of in-hospital death or need for orotracheal intubation. Results: Overall, 2809 patients (mean age 66.4  16.9 years) were included. Three hundred and seventeen patients (11.2%) had a history of heart failure; among them, 49.2% had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and 50.8% had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. COVID-19 severity at admission, defined by a quick sequential organ failure assessment score > 1, was similar in patients with versus without a history of heart failure. Before and after adjustment for age, male sex, cardiovascular comorbidities and quick sequential organ failure assessment score, history of heart failure was associated with the primary endpoint (hazard ratio [HR] 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06C1.90; P = 0.02). This result seemed to be mainly driven by a history of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.13C2.27; P = 0.01) rather than heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.79C1.81; P = 0.41). Conclusions: History of heart failure in patients with COVID-19 was associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death or orotracheal intubation. These findings suggest that patients with a history of heart failure, particularly heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, should be considered at high risk of clinical deterioration.","output":"History of heart failure in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: Insights from a French registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has forced governments to implement restrictions on mobility and social interaction and, in some cases, even confine populations to their homes, affecting their daily habits.

Such variants have been reported from the UK (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351) and, Brazil (P.1/B.1.1.28). We performed this study to track the importation, spread, and emergence of variants locally. Methods: We sequenced whole genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from international travellers (n=75) entering Karnataka, South India, between Dec 22, 2020 and Jan 31, 2021, and from positive cases in the city of Bengaluru (n=108), between Nov 22, 2020- Jan 22, 2021, as well as a local outbreak. We present the lineage distribution and analysis of these sequences. Results: Genomes from the study group into 34 lineages. Variant B.1.1.7 was introduced by international travel (24/73, 32.9%). Lineage B.1.36 and B.1 formed a major fraction of both imported (B.1.36: 20/73, 27.4%; B.1: 14/73, 19.2%), and circulating viruses (B.1.36: 45/103; 43.7%,. B.1: 26/103; 25.2%). The lineage B.1.36 was also associated with a local outbreak. We detected nine amino acid changes, previously associated with immune escape, spread across multiple lineages. The N440K change was detected in 45/162 (27.7%) of the sequences, 37 of these were in the B.1.36 lineage (37/65, 56.92%) Conclusions: Our data support the idea that variants of concern spread by travel. Viruses with amino acid replacements associated with immune escape are already circulating.

The disease is known for almost 100 years, an effective vaccine or treatment is still unavailable, only proper biosecurity measures, including disinfection, are being applied, in order to prevent disease outbreaks. Eight active substances, i.e., formaldehyde, sodium hypochlorite, caustic soda, glutaraldehyde, phenol, benzalkonium chloride, potassium peroxymonosulfate and acetic acid, were tested, in order to confirm their effectiveness against African swine fever virus (ASFV). This specific selection was done based on the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)s recommendation and previous disinfectant studies on surfaces. The result of our study shows that most of them inactivate the virus, in recommended concentrations. In order to reduce the cytotoxicity of the four substances, Microspin S-400 HR columns were applied, therefore making it possible to demonstrate four logarithms virus titer reduction. Sodium hypochlorite, glutaraldehyde, caustic soda and potassium peroxymonosulfate showed the best ASFV inactivation rates, achieving titer reductions over 5 logs. Despite microfiltration, the virucidal activity of formaldehyde was not assessable, due to its high cytotoxicity.

Similarly, the U.S. also experienced a shortage of healthcare resources, which led to a reduction in the efficiency of the whole healthcare system. In order to evaluate this from a transportation perspective, it is critical to understand the extent to which healthcare facilities with intensive care unit (ICU) beds are available in both urban and rural areas. As such, this study aims to assess the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 patients to healthcare facilities in the State of Florida. For this purpose, two methods were used: the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) and the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA). These methods were applied to identify the high and low access areas in the entire state. Furthermore, a metric, namely the Accessibility Ratio Difference (ARD), was developed to evaluate the spatial access difference between the models. Results revealed that many areas in the northwest and southern Florida have lower access compared to other locations. The residents in central Florida (e.g., Tampa and Orlando cities) had the highest level of accessibility given their higher access ratios. We also observed that the 2SFCA method overestimates the accessibility in the areas with a lower number of ICU beds due to the equal access assumption of the population within the catchment area.

The primary outcome was clinical improvements defined as a decrease of 2 categories and above on a 7-category ordinal scale within 14 days following bronchoscopy. Sixty-seven patients were included. Multivariable permutational multivariate analysis of variance found that positive bacteria lab test results had the strongest independent association with lung microbiota (R(2) = 0.033; P = 0.018), followed by acute kidney injury (AKI; R(2) = 0.032; P = 0.011) and plasma MIP-1 level (R(2) = 0.027; P = 0.044).

Multivariable Cox regression showed that the increase in -diversity and the abundance of the families Prevotellaceae and Actinomycetaceae were associated with clinical improvements. The positive bacteria lab test results, AKI, and plasma MIP-1 level were associated with patients lung microbiota composition on ICU admission.

We find that weekly property crime and drug offense rates, averaged across the cities, fell during the pandemic. An exception is motor vehicle theft, which trended upward after pandemic\\\\related population restrictions were instituted in March 2020. Robbery rates also declined immediately after the pandemic began. Average weekly homicide, aggravated assault, and gun assault rates did not exhibit statistically significant increases after March. Beginning in June 2020, however, significant increases in these offenses were detected, followed by declines in the late summer and fall. Fixed\\\\effects regression analyses disclose significant decreases in aggravated assault, robbery, and larceny rates associated with reduced residential mobility during the pandemic. These results support the routine activity hypothesis that the dispersion of activity away from households increases crime rates. The results for the other offenses are less supportive.

The study aims to evaluate the psychological and financial distress reported by people stranded abroad due to international travel restrictions introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsBetween July and September 2021, we implemented a cross-sectional online survey targeting individuals stranded abroad due to international travel restrictions. The survey collected data about COVID-19 travel restriction-related travel impacts; personal stress, anxiety, and depression (using the validated DASS-21tool); as well as impacts on housing and financial security; and demographic data. FindingsWe had 1054 participants complete the survey; most were trying to return to the Oceania region (75.4%), with 45% stranded in Europe. Overall, 64.2% reported financial distress while stranded abroad. 64.4% ([x] =9.43, SD=5.81) reported either a moderate or severe (based on the DASS-21 classification) level of depression, 41.7% for anxiety ([x] =5.46, SD=4.74), and 58.1% for stress ([x] =10.64, SD=5.26).

Attracted by its fast-developing economy, the population of Shenzhen has reached 14 million and has become one of the top five largest cities by population size in China. The incidence of pertussis here was about 2.02/100,000, far exceeding that of the whole province and the whole country (both < 1/100,000). There are increasing numbers of reports demonstrating variation in Bordetella pertussis antigens and genes, which may be associated with the increased incidence. Fifty strains of Bordetella pertussis isolated from 387 suspected cases were collected in Shenzhen in 2018 for genotypic and molecular epidemiological analysis. METHODS: There were 387 suspected cases of pertussis enrolled at surveillance sites in Shenzhen from June to August 2018. Nasopharyngeal swabs from suspected pertussis cases were collected for bacterial culture and the identity of putative Bordetella pertussis isolates was confirmed by real-time PCR. The immunization history of each patient was taken. The acellular pertussis vaccine (APV) antigen genes for pertussis toxin (ptxA, ptxC), pertactin (prn) and fimbriae (fim2 and fim3) together with the pertussis toxin promoter region (ptxP) were analyzed by second-generation sequencing. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis was performed using sequences publicly available from GenBank, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/ ). The antimicrobial susceptibility was test by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion. RESULTS: Fifty strains of Bordetella pertussis were successfully isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs of 387 suspected cases, with a positivity rate of 16.79%, including 28 males and 22 females, accounting for 56.0% and 44.0% respectively. Thirty-eight of the 50 (76%) patients were found to be positive for B. pertussis by culture. Among the positive cases with a history of vaccination, 30 of 42 (71.4%) cases had an incomplete pertussis vaccination history according to the national recommendation. Three phylogenetic groups (PG1-PG3) were identified each containing a predominant genotype. The two vaccines strains, CS and Tohama I, were distantly related to these three groups. Thirty-one out of fifty (62%) isolates belonged to genotype PG1, with the allelic profile prn2/ptxC2/ptxP3/ptxA1/fim3-1/fim2-1. Eighteen out of fifty (36%) isolates contained the A2047G mutation and were highly resistant to erythromycin, and all belonged to genotype PG3 (prn1/ptxA1/ptxP1/ptxC1/fim3-1/fim2-1), which is closely related to the recent epidemic strains found in northern China. CONCLUSIONS: The positive rate of cases under one-year-old was significantly higher than that of other age groups and should be monitored. The dominant antigen genotypes of 50 Shenzhen isolates are closely related to the epidemic strains in the United States, Australia and many countries in Europe. Despite high rates of immunization with APV, epidemics of pertussis have recently occurred in these countries. Therefore, genomic analysis of circulating isolates of B. pertussis should be continued, for it will benefit the control of whooping cough and development of improved vaccines and therapeutic strategies.","output":"Molecular epidemiology of Bordetella pertussis and analysis of vaccine antigen genes from clinical isolates from Shenzhen, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quality of life is important for the development and evaluation of interventions for autistic people. It is a multidimensional concept, anchored in a sociocultural context and based on a persons subjective assessment of their life. The aim of this study is to examine whether the determinants of perceived quality of life vary by country (or culture) by comparing two groups of French-speaking autistic adults (n = 430), one in France and the other in Qubec (Canada). A cross-sectional survey was conducted to provide information on the quality of life (Autism Quality of Life MeasureASQoL), diagnosis and health conditions, self-evaluation of autistic traits (Autism-Spectrum QuotientAQ10), and sociodemographic characteristics of these two samples. The results of our comparison of French-speaking autistic adults in France and Qubec suggest that sociocultural context has an impact on autistic peoples quality of life (r(2) = 0.280). The Qubec group reported a superior quality of life. The social experience of autism-related stigmatization emerges as a strong predictor of lower quality of life in both groups. However, the two groups differ with other predictors. This study demonstrates the importance of considering sociocultural context in measuring quality of life in autistic adults. It emphasizes the need for awareness programs and public campaigns aimed at identifying and countering stigmatization processes. LAY ABSTRACT: What is already known about the topic? Quality of life refers to how people perceive aspects of their life such as physical health, material security, and interpersonal relationships. Studies have reported lower quality of life among autistic individuals than in the general population. What does this article contribute? This article contributes to a better understanding of quality of life and its measures from the point of view of autistic adults. By comparing two groups of French-speaking autistic adults from two different places (France and QubecCanada), this research shows that the perception of quality of life and its determining factors differ for autistic adults living in each country. The Qubec group reported a superior quality of life, and some quality of life predictors were different in each group. The social experience of autism-related stigmatization, however, was a powerful predictor of quality of life for all. Implications for practice, research, and policy To promote a higher quality of life for autistic people, it is important to consider the sociocultural context and implement awareness programs and public campaigns aimed at identifying and countering stigmatization processes.","output":"Sociocultural context and autistics quality of life: A comparison between Qubec and France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 14-3-3 proteins constitute a family of regulatory adapter proteins with many binding partnersand biological functions, and are considered promising drug targets in cancer and neuropsychiatry.By screening 1280 small-molecule drugs using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), we found 15 compounds that decreased the thermal stability of 14-3-3. Among these compounds, ebselen was identified as a covalent, destabilizing ligand of 14-3-3 isoforms , ?, ?3 and ?. Ebselen bonding decreased 14-3-3 binding to its partner Ser19-phosphorylated tyrosine hydroxylase. Characterization of site-directed mutants at cysteine residues in 14-3-3 (C25, C94, and C189) by DSF and mass spectroscopy revealed covalent modification by ebselen of all cysteines. C25 was identified as the preferential site of ebselen interaction in vitro, whereas modification of C94 was mainly responsible for the protein destabilization. At therapeutic relevant concentrations ebselen caused a decrease of 14-3-3 levels in both SHSY5Y cells and zebrafish brain, accompanied with an increased degradation by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. Moreover, ebselen-treated zebrafish displayed a freezing phenotype and reduced mobility, resembling the effects of lithium, in line with the proposed action of ebselen as a potentially safer lithium-mimetic drug. Ebselen has recently emerged as a promising drug candidate in several medical areas, including cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders and infectious diseases, including Covid-19. Its pleiotropic actions are attributed to antioxidant effects, and the formation of selenosulfides with critical cysteine residues in proteins. Our work indicates that a destabilization of 14-3-3 may affect the protein interaction networks of this protein family, contributing to the therapeutic potential of ebselen. Significance Statement There is currently great interest in the repurposing of established drugs for new indications and therapeutic targets. This study shows that ebselen, which is a promising drug candidate against cancer, bipolar disorder and the virus infection Covid-19, covalently bonds to cysteine residues in 14-3-3 adaptor proteins, triggering 14-3-3 destabilization and degradation in cells and intact brain tissue when used in therapeutic concentrations, potentially explaining the behavioral and anti-neoplastic effects of this drug.","output":"Cysteine modification by ebselen reduces the stability and cellular levels of 14-3-3 proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Data on complications in children with seasonal influenza virus infection are limited. We initiated a nation-wide three-year surveillance of children who were admitted to a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with severe seasonal influenza. METHODS: From October 2005 to July 2008, active surveillance was performed using an established reporting system for rare diseases (ESPED) including all paediatric hospitals in Germany. Cases to be reported were hospitalized children < 17 years of age with laboratory-confirmed influenza treated in a PICU or dying in hospital. RESULTS: Twenty severe influenza-associated cases were reported from 14 PICUs during three pre-pandemic influenza seasons (2005-2008). The median age of the patients (12 males/8 females) was 7.5 years (range 0.1-15 years). None had received vaccination against influenza. In 14 (70%) patients, the infection had been caused by influenza A and in five (25%) by influenza B; in one child (5%) the influenza type was not reported. Patients spent a median of 19 (IQR 12-38) days in the hospital and a median of 11 days (IQR 6-18 days) in the PICU; 10 (50%) needed mechanical ventilation. Most frequent diagnoses were influenza-associated pneumonia (60%), bronchitis/bronchiolitis (30%), encephalitis/encephalopathy (25%), secondary bacterial pneumonia (25%), and ARDS (25%). Eleven (55%) children had chronic underlying medical conditions, including 8 (40%) with chronic pulmonary diseases. Two influenza A- associated deaths were reported: i) an 8-year old boy with pneumococcal encephalopathy following influenza infection died from cerebral edema, ii) a 14-year-old boy with asthma bronchiale, cardiac malformation and Addison's disease died from cardiac and respiratory failure. For nine (45%) patients, possibly permanent sequelae were reported (3 neurological, 3 pulmonary, 3 other sequelae). CONCLUSIONS: Influenza-associated pneumonia and secondary bacterial infections are relevant complications of seasonal influenza in Germany. The incidence of severe influenza cases in PICUs was relatively low. This may be either due to the weak to moderate seasonal influenza activity during the years 2005 to 2008 or due to under-diagnosis of influenza by physicians. Fifty% of the observed severe cases might have been prevented by following the recommendations for vaccination of risk groups in Germany.","output":"Severe influenza cases in paediatric intensive care units in Germany during the pre-pandemic seasons 2005 to 2008"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this article is to study individual aspects of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental state of PLHIV.

Nevertheless, approximately 20-30% of cases progress to tumors or erythroderma, resulting in poor outcome. At present, factors contributing to this switch from indolent to aggressive disease are only insufficiently understood. METHODS In patients with advanced-stage MF, we compared patches with longstanding history to newly developed plaques and tumors by using single-cell RNA sequencing, and compared results with early-stage MF as well as nonlesional MF and healthy control skin. RESULTS Despite considerable inter-individual variability, lesion progression was uniformly associated with downregulation of the tissue residency markers CXCR4 and CD69, the heat shock protein HSPA1A, the tumor suppressors and immunoregulatory mediators ZFP36 and TXNIP, and the interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R) within the malignant clone, but not in benign T cells. This phenomenon was not only found in conventional TCR- MF, but also in a case of TCR-æ MF, suggesting a common mechanism across MF subtypes. Conversely, malignant cells in clinically unaffected skin from MF patients showed upregulation of these markers. CONCLUSIONS Our data reveal a specific panel of biomarkers that might be used for monitoring MF disease progression.

This study aims to regularly synthesise evidence on long COVID characteristics, to help inform clinical management, rehabilitation strategies and interventional studies to improve long-term outcomes. METHODS: A living systematic review. Medline, CINAHL (EBSCO), Global Health (Ovid), WHO Global Research on COVID-19 database, LitCovid and Google Scholar were searched till 17 March 2021. Studies including at least 100 people with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19 at 12 weeks or more post onset were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the tool produced by Hoy et al. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics and meta-analyses to estimate prevalence. RESULTS: A total of 39 studies were included: 32 cohort, 6 cross-sectional and 1 caseCcontrol. Most showed high or moderate risk of bias. None were set in low-income countries and few included children. Studies reported on 10 951 people (48% female) in 12 countries. Most included previously hospitalised people (78%, 8520/10 951). The longest mean follow-up time was 221.7 (SD: 10.9) days post COVID-19 onset. Over 60 physical and psychological signs and symptoms with wide prevalence were reported, most commonly weakness (41%; 95% CI 25% to 59%), general malaise (33%; 95% CI 15% to 57%), fatigue (31%; 95% CI 24% to 39%), concentration impairment (26%; 95% CI 21% to 32%) and breathlessness (25%; 95% CI 18% to 34%). 37% (95% CI 18% to 60%) of patients reported reduced quality of life; 26% (10/39) of studies presented evidence of reduced pulmonary function. CONCLUSION: Long COVID is a complex condition with prolonged heterogeneous symptoms. The nature of studies precludes a precise case definition or risk evaluation.

Clinical teams at Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH) needed resources for identifying and assimilating the medical literature regarding COVID-19, which was expanding and evolving daily. HMH leaders reached out to HMSOM leaders for assistance. The HMSOM leadership and faculty quickly organized a literature review elective. APPROACH Eight second-year medical students participated in a literature review elective course to research and synthesize the COVID-19 clinical literature to provide synopses of best practices for various clinical teams. By March 23, students were searching the literature and writing reports independently, mentored by a senior dean (an infectious diseases specialist) and supported by the associate dean of libraries and library team. The library team updated and categorized student reports daily on a website dedicated to the elective. OUTCOMES During the 6-week elective, 8 students produced 70 reports synthesizing the emerging COVID-19 literature to help answer practitioners' clinical questions in real time. One student report was posted on the American Academy of Ophthalmology website. All 70 were published online in Elsevier's health education faculty hub. On course evaluations, students expressed regret about not being directly involved in patient care, but articulated their gratitude to be able to contribute to the clinical teams. NEXT STEPS In June 2020, the students returned to their clinical clerkships as COVID-19 clinical volumes declined and PPE became more available. Students continued to be available to the clinical teams to assist with COVID-19 questions.

Among members aged 12 years of a large integrated health care delivery system in Oregon and Washington, incidence of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, emergency department (ED) visits, and hospitalizations were calculated by COVID-19 vaccination status, vaccine product, age, race, and ethnicity. Infection after full vaccination was defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test result 14 days after completion of an authorized COVID-19 vaccination series.* During the July-September 2021 surveillance period, SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred among 4,146 of 137,616 unvaccinated persons (30.1 per 1,000 persons) and 3,009 of 344,848 fully vaccinated persons (8.7 per 1,000).

Methods Retrospective study of patients operated on in the previous month and during the peak of the pandemic. We analysed the COVID-19 infection rate, the severity of respiratory infection according to the Brescia respiratory COVID-19 severity scale, the adopted therapeutic measures and the overall postoperative complications. Results From 17th February to 31st March 2020, there was a progressive decrease in surgical activity, with only 213 patients operated on. This comprised 59 (27.8%) elective operations for oncological diseases, 97 (45.5%) elective operations for benign diseases and 57 (26.7%) as urgent procedures. There was a progressive increase in the rate of infection by COVID-19, with a total of 15 cases (7%). This included 10 patients (16.9%) in the elective group for oncological disease, 1 (1%) in the elective surgery group for benign disease and 4 (7%) in the urgent surgery group (P <.001). Five patients presented with a severe respiratory infection, of which 4 were affected by oncological disease. There were 3 deaths (1.4%), which were all due to the worsening of a respiratory infection. Conclusions The patients undergoing the surgical procedures showed high rates of COVID-19 infection and postoperative complications, especially the patients with oncological diseases.

As a result of hospital and state mandates, our radiology residency program quickly transitioned to a virtual learning platform to continue dissemination of knowledge, maintain resident engagement, and ensure professional development. The goal of this study is to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the virtual learning platform at our institution using resident ratings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: : This institutional IRB-exempt study involved a survey of 17 questions which was electronically distributed to 45 radiology residents using SurveyMonkey. Questions encompassed resident satisfaction with teaching and professional development, scheduling changes, and engagement with the virtual platform. Answers to most questions were submitted on a Likert scale. RESULTS: : A total of 31/45 respondents completed the survey (response rate = 69%). Most residents were satisfied with the virtual platform with teaching activities identified as a strength and the incorporation of professional development as a weakness. The most frequent barriers to attending the virtual curriculum were technical difficulties (43%) and childcare (36%). Residents who reported experiencing barriers were less likely to adhere to the virtual curriculum (p = 0.004). Most respondents (81%) reported a desire to maintain elements of the virtual learning practice post-pandemic.

The pandemic marked a departure from who is considered worthy,of admission to Canada. In fact, the border through restricted and securitized,measures has filtered desirable versus non-desirable migrants, creating a hierarchy,among migrants within Canadas immigration system by categorizing groups into,those deserving versus non-deserving of admission.

The American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) has created the COVID-ASIPP Risk Mitigation & Stratification (COVID-ARMS) Return to Practice Task Force in order to provide guidance for safe and strategic reopening. OBJECTIVES The aims are to provide education and guidance for interventional pain specialists and their patients during the COVID-19 pandemic that minimizes COVID-related morbidity while allowing a return to interventional pain care. METHODS The methodology utilized included the development of objectives and key questions with utilization of trustworthy standards, appropriate disclosures of conflicts of interest, as well as a panel of experts from various regions, specialities, and groups. The literature pertaining to all aspects of COVID-19, specifically related to epidemiology, risk factors, complications, morbidity and mortality, and literature related to risk mitigation and stratification were reviewed. The principles of best evidence synthesis of available literature and grading for recommendations as described by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) typically utilized in ASIPP guideline preparation was not utilized in these guidelines due to limitations because of their lack of available literature on COVID-19, risk mitigation and stratification. These guidelines are considered evidence -- informed with incorporation of best available research and practice knowledge. Consequently, these guidelines are considered evidence-informed with incorporation of best available research and practice knowledge. RESULTS Numerous risk factors have emerged that predispose patients to contracting COVID-19 and/or having a more severe course of the infection. COVID-19 may have mild symptoms, even be asymptomatic, or may be severe and life threatening. Older age and certain comorbidities, such as underlying pulmonary or cardiovascular disease, have been associated with worse outcomes. In pain care, COVID-19 patients are a heterogeneous group with some individuals relatively healthy and having only a short course of manageable symptoms while others become critically ill. It is necessary to assess patients on a case-by-case basis and craft individualized care recommendations. A COVID-ARMS risk stratification tool was created to quickly and objectively assess patients. Interventional pain specialists and their patients may derive important benefits from evidence-informed risk stratification, protective strategies to prevent infection, and the gradual resumption of treatments and procedures to manage pain. LIMITATIONS COVID-19 was an ongoing pandemic at the time during which these recommendations were developed. The pandemic has created a fluid situation in terms of evidence-informed guidance. As more and better evidence is gathered, these recommendations may be modified. CONCLUSIONS Chronic pain patients require continuity of care but during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, steps must be taken to stratify risks and protect patients from possible infection to safeguard them from COVID-19-related illness and transmitting the disease to others. Pain specialists should optimize telemedicine encounters with their pain patients, be cognizant of risks of COVID-19 morbidity, and take steps to evaluate risk-benefit on a case-by-case basis.

The second aim was to investigate the validity of the RQA method compared to the GE method in thresholds detection. The two metabolic thresholds were estimated in thirty young individuals during Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing on a cycle-ergometer and HR, VO2 and Workload were measured by the two different methods (RQA and GE methods). RM ANOVA was used to assess main effects of methods and methods-by-groups interaction effects for HR, VO2 and Workload at the aerobic (AerT) and the anaerobic (AnT) thresholds. Validity of the RQA at both thresholds was assessed for HR, VO2 and Workload by Ordinary Least Products (OLP) regression analysis, Typical Percentage Errors (TE), Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) and the Bland Altman plots. No methods-by-groups interaction effects were detected for HR, VO2 and Workload at the AerT and the AnT. The OLP regression analysis showed that at both thresholds RQA and GE methods had very strong correlations (r >0.8) in all variables (HR, VO2 and Workload). Slope and intercept values always included the 1 and the 0, respectively. At the AerT the TE ranged from 4.02% to 10.47% (HR and Workload, respectively) and in all variables ICC values were excellent (0.85). At the AnT the TE ranged from 2.61% to 6.64% (HR and Workload, respectively) and in all variables ICC values were excellent (0.89).

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine that mediates diverse immune responses, and the serum level of MIF positively correlates with disease severity in patients with dengue. MIF is involved in DENV replication and many pathological changes, such as vascular leakage, during DENV infection. In this paper, the pathogenic roles of MIF and the regulation of MIF secretion during DENV infection are reviewed.

Case Presentation This case study describes our transition from a low-threshold community-based in-person MAT clinic to an audio-only telehealth model. We extracted data from electronic health records to describe patient characteristics and to calculate treatment retention rates. We measure the success of our intervention relative to published retention rates, both overall as well as for in-person and telehealth care. Conclusions: Low-threshold medication-assisted treatment in the care of people with opioid use disorder is essential to increasing treatment access and continuity. We found that an audio-only telehealth model was viable. Although we had decreased retention rates following the transition to an audio-only telehealth model, our rates remained excellent compared to published values for in-person MAT care.

It is estimated that in the United States approximately $ 652 million per year is spent on medical costs for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) related disease alone (Paramore et al., 2004). Viruses cause a variety of respiratory diseases in children from the common cold to life-threatening pneumonia and bronchiolitis. The host reacts to a viral infection with a combination of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms, usually resulting in the clearance of the virus and clinical recovery. However, there is an accumulating evidence for a number of viral infections that the host immune response actually enhances disease in the course of clearing virus from the infected organs. Interestingly, the effectiveness of the immune response seems to be dependent on the age and probably genetic background of the child.

METHODS: We developed a novel research instrument to assess public sector ECC capacity and service readiness in LICs. From January 20th to February 18th, 2020 we administered the instrument at all four central hospitals and a simple random sample of nine of 24 district hospitals in Malawi, a landlocked and predominantly rural LIC of 191 million people in Southern Africa. The instrument contained questions on the availability of key resources across three domains and was administered to hospital administrators and clinicians from outpatient departments, emergency departments, and inpatient units. Results were used to generate an ECC Readiness Score, with a possible range of 0 to 1, for each facility. FINDINGS: A total of 114 staff members across 13 hospitals completed interviews for this study. Three (33%) district hospitals and all four central hospitals had ECC Readiness Scores above 05 (p-value 0070). Absent equipment was identified as the most common barrier to ECC Readiness. Central hospitals had higher median ECC Readiness Scores with less variability 082 (interquartile range: 080C089) than district hospitals (033, 023 to 050, p-value 0021). INTERPRETATION: This is the first study to employ a systematic approach to assessing ECC capacity and service readiness at both district and central hospitals in Malawi and provides a framework for measuring ECC capacity in other LICs. Prior ECC assessments potentially overestimated equipment availability and our methodology may provide a more accurate approach. There is an urgent need for investments in ECC services, particularly at district hospitals which are more accessible to Malawi's predominantly rural population. These findings highlight the need for long-term investments in health systems strengthening and underscore the importance of understanding capacity in LIC settings to inform these efforts.

The system has proven to be effective in full-thickness porcine small-bowel anastomoses. The aim of this study was to show the feasibility of the MAGNAMOSIS system in hybrid endoscopic colorectal surgery and to compare magnetic and conventional stapled anastomoses. METHODS A total of 16 swine weighing 35 - 50 kg were used following animal ethical committee approval. The first animal was an acute model to establish the feasibility of the procedure. The subsequent 15 animals were survival models, 10 of which underwent side-to-side anastomoses (SSA) and 5 of which underwent end-to-side (ESA) procedures. Time to patency, surveillance endoscopy, burst pressure, compression force, and histology were assessed. Histology was compared with conventional stapled anastomoses. Magnetic compression forces were measured in various anastomosis configurations. RESULTS Colorectal anastomoses were performed in all cases using a hybrid NOTES technique. The mean operating time was 71 minutes. Mean time to completion of the anastomosis was similar between the SSA and ESA groups. Burst pressure at 10 days was greater than 95 mmHg in both groups. One complication occurred in the ESA group. Compression force among various configurations of the magnetic rings was significantly different (P < 0.05). Inflammation and fibrosis were similar between magnetic SSA and conventional stapled anastomoses. CONCLUSION MAGNAMOSIS was feasible in performing a hybrid NOTES colorectal anastomosis. It has the advantage over circular staplers of precise endoscopic delivery throughout the entire colon. SSA was reliable and effective. A minimum initial compression force of 4 N appears to be required for reliable magnetic anastomoses.","output":"MAGNAMOSIS IV: magnetic compression anastomosis for minimally invasive colorectal surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study was to investigate the work experience of newly recruited male nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: With a phenomenological approach, this qualitative study was adopted semi-structured interviews by phone or video calls. A total of 9 male nurses newly recruited for the COVID-19 wards in Chinese hospitals were interviewed for this study. And Colaizzi's method was applied for evaluation in the data analysis. RESULTS: Based on our findings, three themes were extracted. Firstly, the newly recruited male nurses showed negative emotions at the beginning of COVID-19 epidemic, which was caused by changesin working conditions and content, but also prompted the nurses to change the way of coping with the crisis. Secondly, they gradually mastered the working skills and psychological training tocope with COVID-19, and developed a positive attitude towards life and a high sense of professional responsibility. Finally, we learned about their needs to respond to public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is a disaster for all of humanity. The newly recruited male nurses are an important force in emergency rescue. Although they suffered from short-term negative emotions, they quickly adapted to the crisis.

The ongoing pandemic demonstrates the importance of having an emergency response plan that accounts for the safety of frontline healthcare workers, including those working in critical care settings. Objectives To explore Australian critical care nurses knowledge, preparedness and experiences of managing patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Methods An exploratory cross-sectional study of Australian critical care nurses was conducted between June and September 2020. An anonymous online survey was sent to Australian College of Critical Care Nurses (ACCCN) members to collect information about their knowledge, preparedness and experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise and report data. Results A total of 157 critical care nurses participated, with 138 fully complete surveys analysed. Most respondents reported good to very good level of knowledge about COVID-19, and obtained up-to-date COVID-19 information from international and local sources. To manage patients with COVID-19, 82.3% felt sufficiently prepared at the time of data collection, and 93.4% had received specific education, training or instruction. Most participants were involved in assessing (89.3%) and treating (92.4%) COVID-19 patients. Varying levels of concerns about contracting SARS-CoV-2 were expressed by respondents, and 55.7% thought the pandemic had increased their workload. The most frequent concerns expressed by participants were a lack of appropriate PPE and fear of the PPE shortage. Conclusions While most nurses expressed sufficient preparedness for managing COVID-19 patients, specific education had been undertaken and experiential learning was evident. Fears of insufficient or appropriate PPE made the response more difficult for nurses and the community. Preparedness and responsiveness are critical to successful management of the COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases.","output":"Australian critical care nurses knowledge, preparedness and experiences of managing SARS-COV-2 and COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an important cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide.

COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a single-stranded RNA beta-coronavirus, which causes a systemic inflammatory response, multi-organ damage, and respiratory failure requiring intubation in serious cases. SARS-CoV-2 can also trigger neurological conditions and syndromes, which can be long-lasting and potentially irreversible. Since COVID-19 infections continue to mount, the burden of SARS-CoV-2-induced neurologic sequalae will rise in parallel. Therefore, understanding the spectrum of neurological clinical presentations in SARS-CoV-2 is needed to manage COVID-19 patients, facilitate diagnosis, and expedite earlier treatment to improve outcomes. Furthermore, a deeper knowledge of the neurological SARS-CoV-2 pathomechanisms could uncover potential therapeutic targets to prevent or mitigate neurologic damage secondary to COVID-19 infection. Evidence indicates a multifaceted pathology involving viral neurotropism and direct neuroinvasion along with cytokine storm and neuroinflammation leading to nerve injury. Importantly, pathological processes in neural tissue are non-cell autonomous and occur through a concerted breakdown in neuron-glia homeostasis, spanning neuron axonal damage, astrogliosis, microgliosis, and impaired neuron-glia communication.

ESKAPE bacteria which includes Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae are considered the most important, because of their close relationship with the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The aim of this work was to identify and characterize ESKAPE bacteria and to detect their possible clonal spread in medical devices, patients, and medical personnel of the ICU for COVID-19 patients of the Hospital Juarez de Mexico. METHODOLOGY: Genetic identification of ESKAPE bacteria was performed by analyzing the 16S rRNA gene. Resistance assays were performed according to the CLSI guidelines. Assembly of AdeABCRS operon and inhibition assays of pumps efflux in Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were performed. Associated gene involved in biofilm formation (icaA) was performed in isolates belonging to the Staphylococcus genus. Finally, typing by ERIC-PCR and characterization of mobile genetic element SCCmec were done. RESULTS: Heterogeneous distribution of ESKAPE and non-ESKAPE bacteria was detected in various medical devices, patients, and medical personnel. Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus were the predominant ESKAPE members. The analysis of intergenic regions revealed an important clonal distribution of A. baumannii (AdeABCRS+). Genotyping of SCCmec mobile genetic elements and the icaA gene showed that there is no clonal distribution of S. aureus.

The aim of this study was to identify viruses in children hospitalized for ALRIs and to demonstrate epidemiologic and clinical characteristics in Japan. METHODS: During a 2-year period from February 2013 to January 2015, we collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens from almost all hospitalized children with ALRIs in Nagasaki, a regional city of Japan, and its environs. Viruses were detected by multiplex polymerase chain reaction from these samples. RESULTS: We detected one or more viruses from 259 (69%) of 374 patients, 227 of whom were infected with a single virus, 30 with 2, and 2 with 3 viruses. Detected viruses in this study were rhinovirus (46.4%), respiratory syncytial virus (29.7%), human metapneumovirus (6.8%), parainfluenza virus (5.5%), enterovirus D68 (3.4%), influenza virus (2.7%), adenovirus (2.4%), bocavirus (2.0%) and Coxsackie virus (1.0%).

As the IL-22/IL-22R1 axis was reported to be involved in inflammation during viral infections, we characterized the expression of IL-22 receptor1, IL-22 and IL-22 binding protein in COVID-19 patients. Blood samples were collected from 19 non-severe and 14 severe patients on the day they presented (D0), at D14, and six months later, and from 6 non-infected controls. The IL-22R1 expression was characterized by flow cytometry. Results were related to HLA-DR expression of myeloid cells, to plasma concentrations of different cytokines and chemokines and NK cells and T lymphocytes functions characterized by their IFN-, IL-22, IL-17A, granzyme B and perforin content. The numbers of IL-22R1(+) classical, intermediate, and non-classical monocytes and the proportions of IL-22R1(+) plasmacytoid DC (pDC), myeloid DC1 and DC2 (mDC1, mDC2) were higher in patients than controls at D0. The proportions of IL-22R1(+) classical and intermediate monocytes, and pDC and mDC2 remained high for six months. High proportions of IL-22R1(+) non-classical monocytes and mDC2 displayed HLA-DR(high) expression and were thus activated. Multivariate analysis for all IL-22R1(+) myeloid cells discriminated the severity of the disease (AUC=0.9023). However, correlation analysis between IL-22R1(+) cell subsets and plasma chemokine concentrations suggested pro-inflammatory effects of some subsets and protective effects of others. The numbers of IL-22R1(+) classical monocytes and pDC were positively correlated with pro-inflammatory chemokines MCP-1 and IP-10 in severe infections, whereas IL-22R1(+) intermediate monocytes were negatively correlated with IL-6, IFN- and CRP in non-severe infections. Moreover, in the absence of in vitro stimulation, NK and CD4(+) T cells produced IFN- and IL-22, and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells produced IL-17A. CD4(+) T lymphocytes also expressed IL-22R1, the density of its expression defining two different functional subsets. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by an abnormal expression of IL22R1 on blood myeloid cells and CD4(+) T lymphocytes. Our results suggest that the involvement of the IL-22R1/IL-22 axis could be protective at the beginning of SARS-CoV-2 infection but could shift to a detrimental response over time.","output":"Distinct Expression Patterns of Interleukin-22 Receptor 1 on Blood Hematopoietic Cells in SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A sign\\\\on letter spearheaded by the National Alliance for Medication Assisted Recovery (NAMA), and harm reduction groups, including the Urban Survivors Union (USU) and the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA) is calling for reducing restrictions on methadone and opioid treatment programs (OTPs), so that patients don't have to go to the clinics so often.

We used the Mendelian randomization principle to examine whether genetically low MBL is a risk factor for developing infections in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS Serum MBL (n = 7305) and MBL genotype (n = 3043) were determined in a nationwide cohort of patients with new type 2 diabetes and up to 8 years follow-up for hospital-treated infections and community-based antimicrobial prescriptions. The associations were examined in spline and Cox regression analyses. RESULTS 1140 patients (16%) were hospitalized with an infection and 5077 patients (70%) redeemed an antimicrobial prescription. For low (100 g/L) versus intermediate (101-1000 g/L) serum MBL concentration, the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were 1.13(95% confidence interval, 0.96-1.33) for any hospital-treated infections and 1.19(1.01-1.41) for bacterial infections. Low MBL expression genotype was not associated with risk of any hospital-treated infections except for diarrheal diseases (aHR 2.23[1.04-4.80]). Low MBL expression genotype, but not low serum MBL, was associated with increased risk for antimicrobial prescriptions (aHR 1.18[1.04-2.34] and antibacterial prescriptions 1.20[1.05-1.36]).

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cost analysis from January to December 2020 in the largest public hospital in Singapore. Costs were estimated from the hospital perspective. We examined financial expenditures made in direct response to COVID-19; hospital admissions data related to COVID-19 inpatients; and the number of outpatient and emergency department visits, non-emergency surgeries, inpatient days in 2020, compared to preceding years of 2018 and 2019. Bayesian time-series was used to estimate the magnitude of displaced services. RESULTS: USD$41.96 million was incurred in the hospital for COVID-19 related expenses. Facilities setup and capital assets counted for 51.6% of the expenditure; patient-care supplies comprised 35.1%. Out of the 19,611 inpatients tested for COVID-19 in 2020, 727 (3.7%) had COVID-19.

In Japan, primary care is the frontline against emerging infectious diseases in communities. Although the importance of pandemic preparedness in primary care has been highlighted previously, few studies have thus far investigated the preparedness among primary care practices (PCPs) or differences in the preparedness of different institutional settings. We examined PCP preparedness and response to the 2009 influenza pandemic in Japan, and explored the role of a pandemic preparedness plan during the pandemic. METHODS: We used a survey questionnaire to assess how well individual PCPs in Okinawa, Japan, were prepared for the 2009 influenza pandemic. The questionnaire was mailed to all eligible PCPs (N = 465) in Okinawa, regardless of their institutional setting. In addition, we assessed the differences in the preparedness of clinics and hospitals and determined whether the national preparedness plan affected individual preparedness and response. Data were analyzed using descriptive and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 174 (37.4%) PCPs responded to our survey. In general, high-level personal protective equipment (PPE) such as N95 masks (45.4%), gowns (30.5%), and eye protection (21.3%) was stocked at a low rate. Clinic-based PCPs were significantly less prepared than hospital-based PCPs to provide N95 masks (OR 0.34), gowns (OR 0.15), and eye protection (OR 0.18). In addition, only 32.8% of PCPs adopted an adequate business continuity plan (BCP). After controlling for institutional setting, reading the national preparedness plan was significantly associated with establishment of a BCP (OR 5.86), and with knowledge of how to transfer a swab specimen to a local medical laboratory (OR 5.60). CONCLUSIONS: With regard to PPE availability, PCPs (especially clinic-based PCPs) were not adequately prepared for the influenza pandemic.

Therefore, the current study aimed to create a psychological profile of sambo athletes participating in the Sambo World Championship and living in this condition. Methods: One-hundred-fifteen participants took part in the study, completing the Profile of Mood Scale (POMS), the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. A mediation model with Fear of COVID-19 predicting both stress level directly and stress level through mood disturbance was hypothesized. Gender differences were evaluated through t-test. Results: The results showed that the sample presented higher levels of stress but no problems in sleeping. In particular, data analysis confirmed an indirect effect of Fear of COVID on Perceived stress through mood disturbance (beta = 0.14, Z = 2.80, and p = 0.005), but did not have a significant impact on the direct effect (beta = -0.04, Z = -0.48, and p = 0.63).

Endothelial 3D podosomes (3DPs) are a type of F-actin-rich membrane microdomain, predominantly found in endothelial tip cells controlled by VEGF signaling during sprouting angiogenesis, such as occurs in retinal vasculature development. The molecular mechanisms governing 3DP formation have not been completely elucidated. Approach and Results: By using in vitro cell models and in vivo mouse models, we study the role of TM (thrombomodulin) in VEGF-induced endothelial 3DPs. Here, we report that VEGF can induce the expression of TM via ROCK2 (Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 2). Furthermore, ROCK2 can catalyze the phosphorylated activation of ezrin to promote the association of the cytoplasmic domain of TM with F-actin in 3DPs and thereby promote the formation of 3DPs. We used endothelial cells transfected with different TM mutants as models to verify the role of TM domains in 3DPs and angiogenic activity. TM expression in endothelial cells augments angiogenic activity, a response that is dependent on the interaction of the cytoplasmic tail of TM with ezrin, and the integrity of the lectin-like domain of TM. Thus, as compared with wild-type counterparts, mice lacking the lectin-like domain of TM exhibit reduced neovascularization of granulation tissues during cutaneous wound healing and less retinal neovascularization in a model of oxygen-induced retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS VEGF-ROCK2-ezrin-TM-F-actin axis promotes the formation of the lipid raft membrane-associated complex configuration, 3DP, which plays a critical role in mediating tube formation and cell migration of endothelial cells in sprouting angiogenesis.","output":"VEGF-Induced Endothelial Podosomes via ROCK2-Dependent Thrombomodulin Expression Initiate Sprouting Angiogenesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coexistence of coronary artery-to-left ventricle fistula (CALVF) and noncompaction cardiomyopathy (NCC) is rare in patients with severe multiple coronary stenosis.

By combining electrophysiological methods, this study aimed to provide new insights on the mechanisms involved in LV post-effect in SOL spinal excitability after prolonged LV. We reported that prolonged vibration induces a decrease in motoneuron excitability rather than an increase in presynaptic mechanisms (as commonly hypothesized in the current literature) The present results may help to design appropriate clinical intervention and could reinforce the interest of vibration as a treatment in spastic patients who are characterized by spinal hyper-excitability responsible for spasms and long-lasting reflexes. ABSTRACT The mechanisms that can explain the decreased spinal loop excitability in response to prolonged local vibration (LV), as assessed by the H-reflex, remain to be precisely determined. This study provides new insights on how prolonged Achilles tendon LV (30 min, 100 Hz) acutely interacts with the spinal circuitry. The roles of presynaptic inhibition exerted on Ia afferents (Experiment A, n = 15), neurotransmitter release at the synapse level (Experiment B, n = 11) and motoneuron excitability (Experiment C, n = 11) were investigated in soleus (SOL). Modulation of presynaptic inhibition was assessed by conditioning the SOL H-reflex (tibial nerve electrical stimulation) with fibular nerve (D1 inhibition) and femoral nerve (heteronymous facilitation, HF) electrical stimulations. Potential vibration-induced changes in neurotransmitter depletion at the Ia afferent terminals was assessed through paired stimulations applied over the tibial nerve (HD). Intrinsic motoneuron excitability was assessed with thoracic motor evoked potentials (TMEPs) in response to electrical stimulation over the thoracic spine. Non-conditioned H-reflex was depressed by 60% after LV (p < 0.001), while D1 and HF H-reflexes increased by 75% after LV (p = 0.03 and 0.06, respectively).

Here, we examined participants mind-wandering, either intentional or unintentional, while performing vigilance tasks that tap different components of vigilance. Intentional mind-wandering is expected mainly when the arousal component is involved, whereas unintentional mind-wandering is expected mainly in tasks involving the executive component. The Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) assessed the arousal component, whereas the Sustained Attention to Response task (SART) assessed the executive component of vigilance. The two types of mind-wandering were probed throughout task execution. The results showed that the overall rate of mind-wandering was higher in the PVT than in the SART. Intentional mind-wandering was higher with the PVT than with the SART, whereas unintentional mind-wandering was higher with the SART than with the PVT. Regarding mind-wandering as a function of vigilance decrement with time-on-task, unintentional mind-wandering in the PVT increased between blocks 1 and 2 and then stabilized, whereas a progressive increase was observed in the SART. Regarding intentional mind-wandering, a progressive increase was only observed in the SART. The differential patterns of intentional and unintentional mind-wandering in both tasks suggest that, intentional mind wandering occurs mainly in arousal tasks in which propensity to mind-wander has little impact on task performance. However, unintentional mind-wandering occurs mainly in executive tasks as a result of a failure of cognitive control, which promotes attentional resources to be diverted toward mind-wandering. These results are discussed in the context of the resource-control model of mind-wandering.","output":"Propensity to intentional and unintentional mind-wandering differs in arousal and executive vigilance tasks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La seguridad de las personas con COVID19 debe ser un objetivo prioritario como parte de la calidad de la atencin en la prestacin de servicios de salud Al momento casi 200 opciones teraputicas o combinaciones estn siendo investigadas en ms de 1 700 ensayos clnicos incluyendo la evaluacin en profilaxis y slo remdesivir ha demostrado algn beneficio, acotado a pacientes hospitalizados con ciertas caractersticas","output":"Seguridad de los pacientes con COVID-19 en relacin con el uso de medicamentos sin evidencia cientfica sobre su beneficio"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine hesitancy is an important feature of every vaccination and COVID-19 vaccination is not an exception. During the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine hesitancy has exhibited different phases and has shown both temporal and spatial variation in these phases. This has likely arisen due to varied socio-behavioural characteristics of humans and their response towards COVID 19 pandemic and its vaccination strategies. This commentary highlights that there are multiple phases of vaccine hesitancy: Vaccine Eagerness, Vaccine Ignorance, Vaccine Resistance, Vaccine Confidence, Vaccine Complacency and Vaccine Apathy. Though the phases seem to be sequential, they may co-exist at the same time in different regions and at different times in the same region. This may be attributed to several factors influencing the phases of vaccine hesitancy. The complexities of the societal reactions need to be understood in full to be addressed better. There is a dire need of different strategies of communication to deal with the various nuances of all of the phases.

However, only a few studies have examined their impact on the dispersion of droplets and aerosols, which are both thought to be significant contributors to the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: Two commonly used barrier devices, an intubation box and a clear plastic intubation sheet, were evaluated using a physiologically accurate cough simulator. Aerosols were modeled using a commercially available fog machine and droplets were modeled with fluorescein dye. Both particles were propelled by the cough simulator in a simulated intubation environment. Data was captured by high-speed flash photography and aerosol and droplet dispersion were assessed qualitatively with and without a barrier in place. RESULTS: Droplet contamination after a simulated cough was seemingly contained by both barrier devices. Simulated aerosol escaped the barriers and flowed towards the head of the bed. During barrier removal, simulated aerosol trapped underneath was released and propelled towards the HCW at the head of the bed. Usage of the intubation sheet concentrated droplets onto a smaller area. If no barrier was used, positioning the patient in slight reverse Trendelenburg directed aerosols away from the healthcare worker located at the head of the bed. CONCLUSION: Our observations imply that intubation boxes and sheets may reduce HCW exposure to droplets, but they both may merely redirect aerosolized particles, potentially resulting in increased exposure to aerosols in certain circumstances. Aerosols may remain within the barrier device after a cough and manipulation of the box may release them. Patients should be positioned to facilitate intubation, but slight reverse Trendelenburg may direct infectious aerosols away from the HCW. Novel barrier devices should be used with caution and further validation studies are necessary.","output":"Barrier Devices, Intubation, and Aerosol Mitigation Strategies: PPE in the Time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the first semester of 2021, all of Brazil has suffered an intense wave of COVID-19 associated with the Gamma variant.

After the introduction of Delta, it has initially spread mostly in the homonymous city of Rio de Janeiro, the most populous of the state. In a second stage, dispersal occurred to mid- and long-range cities, which acted as new close-range hubs for spread. We observed that the substitution of Gamma by Delta was possibly caused by its higher viral load, a proxy for transmissibility. This variant turnover prompted a new surge in cases, but with lower lethality than was observed during the peak caused by Gamma.

A total of 517 valid data were collected, including 222 (42.9%) were male students and 295 (57.1%) were female students. The collected questionnaires were analyzed for reliability and validity after removing incomplete data, followed by structural equation modeling for model verification. The findings showed that: (1) short video flow experience had a positive effect on short video addiction; (2) short video addiction had a negative effect on intrinsic and extrinsic learning motivation; (3) intrinsic and extrinsic learning motivation had a positive effect on learning well-being; (4) short video flow experience had an indirect negative effect on intrinsic and extrinsic learning motivation; (5) short video flow and short video addiction had indirect negative effects on learning well-being. According to the results, it is clear that addiction to short videos has a negative impact on learners' learning motivation and positive psychology of learning, so parents and teachers should effectively guide students to use short video apps in a self-controlled way.","output":"Effects of Short Video Addiction on the Motivation and Well-Being of Chinese Vocational College Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 11th March 2020, the UK government announced plans for the scaling of COVID-19 testing, and on 27th March 2020 it was announced that a new alliance of private sector and academic collaborative laboratories were being created to generate the testing capacity required. The Cambridge COVID-19 Testing Centre (CCTC) was established during April 2020 through collaboration between AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, and the University of Cambridge, with Charles River Laboratories joining the collaboration at the end of July 2020. The CCTC lab operation focussed on the optimised use of automation, introduction of novel technologies and process modelling to enable a testing capacity of 22,000 tests per day. Here we describe the optimisation of the laboratory process through the continued exploitation of internal performance metrics, while introducing new technologies including the Heat Inactivation of clinical samples upon receipt into the laboratory and a Direct to PCR protocol that removed the requirement for the RNA extraction step.

Thus it is crucial for the healthcare managers to make an effective assignment plan for the patients and telemedical doctors when providing telemedicine services in a highly uncertain environment. In this regard, this paper presents the first comprehensive study of a two-stage robust optimization telemedicine assignment problem when different sources of uncertainty are incorporated in practice, including uncertain service duration, no-show behaviours of both patients and telemedical doctors. To overcome the difficulty of resolution for such a model with a max-min based mixed-integer linear programming recourse problem, from the algorithmic viewpoint we propose an efficient nested column-and-constraint generation (CCG) solution scheme that decomposes the model into the outer level problem and inner level problem, which both can be solved by CCG algorithm. Our computational results show that our method can solve the problems of realistic sizes within a reasonable time (e.g., up to 100 patients, 10 telemedical doctors, and 200 empirical scenarios within one and a half hours). On the empirical side, this paper has also demonstrated how to choose the optimal hyper-parameters to make an optimal trade-off between cost management and the coverage level of the served patients in the presence of different sources of uncertainty, and what's the added value of our robust policy when compared with its two-stage stochastic programming counterpart model.","output":"Two-Stage Robust Telemedicine Assignment Problem with Uncertain Service Duration and No-Show Behaviours"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Three seminal reports, the 2001 Institute of Medicine's Crossing the Quality Chasm, the 2003 report Unequal Treatment,1 and the 2020 National Academy of Medicine's (formerly Institute of Medicine) Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare2 represented inflection points in highlighting the substantial disparities in access, clinical care, and outcomes, and recommended that equity in health care and health technology must be achieved to deliver quality care.3 Though Crossing the Quality Chasm set up the STEEEP framework, which explicitly called out equity as one of six health care quality domains (alongside safety, timeliness, effectiveness, efficiency, and patient-centered care) the issue of inequities in health care delivery was truly laid bare in Unequal Treatment, which also called upon health care institutions and providers to develop strategies to confront disparities in care.4 Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare introduced the \\"Quintiple Aim\\" where \\"Equity and Inclusion\\" was added to the \\"Quadruple Aim.

A cohort of 84 Tunisian patients hospitalized at the emergency room for AECOPD was investigated prospectively for the semi-quantitative detection of bacteria by conventional culture (the threshold of positivity was of 107 CFU/ml) and for the detection of viral genome and DNA of atypical bacteria by quantitative PCR using two commercial multiplex respiratory kits (Seegene and Fast-track). The two kits exhibited very similar performances although the Seegene assay was a bit more sensitive. A large number and variety of pathogens were recovered from the sputum samples of these 84 patients, including 15 conventional bacteria, one Chlamydia pneumoniae and 63 respiratory viruses, the most prevalent being rhinoviruses (n = 33) and influenza viruses (n = 13). From complete results available for 74 patients, the presence of bacteria was significantly associated with risk of recurrence at 6 and 12 months post-infection. The combination of these different markers appears useful for delineating correctly the antimicrobial treatment and for initiating a long-term surveillance in those patients with high risk of recurrent exacerbation episodes.

We sought to evaluate the frequency and etiology of abnormal movements among hospitalized Covid-19 patients undergoing neurologic consultation. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the first 50 consecutive patients with confirmed Covid-19 hospitalized at our tertiary medical care center who underwent acute inpatient neurology consultation from March 2020 through May 2020. Indication for neurologic consultation and diagnostic studies performed were identified by electronic medical record review. RESULTS: Of the 50 initial consultation requests, 11 (22.0%) patients were evaluated for abnormal movements (nine male and two female). Myoclonus was diagnosed in 6/11 (54.5%) patients. Additionally, two patients were diagnosed with seizures (confirmed on EEG in one), while two additional patients were diagnosed with tremor (physiologic and probable functional). A single case of serotonin syndrome was also identified. CONCLUSION: Abnormal movements observed in hospitalized Covid-19 patients can have a wide range of etiologies and were a frequent initial indication for neurologic consultation.

However, they are associated with pressure-related nasal injury, which causes pain and discomfort. Nasal injury may necessitate a change in interface and occasionally damage is severe enough to require surgical repair. We aim to determine the incidence and risk factors for nasal injury in preterm infants, and to provide clinicians with strategies to effectively prevent and treat it. DESIGN We conducted a systematic search of databases including MEDLINE (PubMed including the Cochrane Library), EMBASE, CINAHL and Scopus. Included studies enrolled human preterm infants and were published prior to 20 February 2017. RESULTS Forty-five studies were identified, including 14 ra ndomised controlled trials, 10 observational studies, two cohort studies, eight case reports and 11 reviews. The incidence of nasal injury in preterm infants ranged from 20-100%. Infants born <30 weeks' gestation are at highest risk. Strategies shown to reduce nasal injury included: nasal barrier dressings (2 studies, n=244, risk ratio (RD) -0.12, 95%, CI - 0.20 to -0.04), nasal high flow therapy as an alternative to binasal prong CPAP (7 studies, n=1570, risk difference (RD) -0.14, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.10), and nasal masks rather than binasal prongs (5 studies, n=544, RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.00).

This study recruited a cohort of 57 patients with either general (n = 20), severe (n = 19), or critical (n = 18) disease. The objective of this study was to investigate changes in the abundance of ten predominant intestinal bacterial groups in COVID-19 patients using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR), and to establish a correlation between these bacterial groups and clinical indicators of pneumonia in these patients. The results indicated that dysbiosis occurred in COVID-19 patients and changes in the gut microbial community were associated with disease severity and hematological parameters. The abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium leptum, and Eubacterium rectale, decreased significantly, and this shift in bacterial community may help discriminate critical patients from general and severe patients. Moreover, the number of common opportunistic pathogens Enterococcus (Ec) and Enterobacteriaceae (E) increased, especially in critically ill patients with poor prognosis.

The aim of this paper is to disclose problems and policies related to moderating consumption to more sustainable levels. The scope of the article tackles three fields: urban re-branding, fast fashion, and overtourism. Each problem area is analysed against the background of digital surveillance in the attention economy with the aid of a conceptual model. Accordingly, the principal objectives of this paper are to analyse key sustainability problem sources, evolutionary processes, and policy responses. The paper's originality and value lie in its recognition of tractable problem engagement through conceptual and practicable methods. This contribution also explores other consumption modes that tourists appreciate, namely, retail activity and its unsustainable 'fast fashion';obsession. Finally, the paper analyses urban soft branding, the third tourism attractor within the niche touristic activity of the creative-cultural and gastronomic kind, which also features impulses that affect the perpetuation of unsustainable touristic practices. Thus, this contribution also assesses various studies on tourism futures that exploit digital media to assist in conserving both natural and cultural environments. Accordingly, we first narrate the soft re-branding of an 'Art City';as a 'Fashion City';and consider the example of green-digital innovation in the cultural milieu of Florence, Italy, in light of criticism of the unsustainability of 'fast fashion';.

Their purpose is to deliver a number of policy goals set out in The NHS Long Term Plan. Clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) have a role in their establishment, support, and oversight. AIM: To explore commissioners perspectives on the early development of PCNs. DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative study of CCG staff using telephone interviews. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 37 CCG employees involved in PCN establishment. Interviewees were asked about local PCNs characteristics, factors shaping development and form, activities to date, challenges and benefits, and their CCGs relationship with PCNs. Interviewee responses were summarised within a matrix and analysed thematically. RESULTS: Three meta-themes were identified: the multifaceted role of the commissioner, tensions between PCN policy and locally commissioned services, and engaging the broader system. Interviewees reported that the policy potentially favours those PCNs working from a blank slate and does not sufficiently account for the fact some GP practices and wider system organisations have been doing similar work already. The prescriptive, contractual nature of the policy has led to local challenges, trying to ensure that local good practices are not lost during implementation. Interviewees also considered an important part of their work to be protecting PCNs from the weight of expectations placed on them. CONCLUSION: CCGs are well placed to understand the complexities of local systems and to facilitate PCNs and working practices between wider system partners.

We fill this gap by establishing their greater efficiency for comparing the relative efficacy of multiple interventions over using several separate, two-arm trials, where the relative efficacy of an arbitrary pair of interventions is evaluated by contrasting their relative risks as compared to control. In theoretical and numerical studies, we demonstrate that the inference of such a contrast using data from a platform trial enjoys identical or better precision than using data from separate trials, even when the former enrolls substantially fewer participants. This benefit is attributed to the sharing of controls among interventions under contemporaneous randomization, which is a key feature of platform trials.

The analyses of the changes in smoking behaviors because of coronaphobia demonstrated that people with coronaphobia exhibited a significantly higher decrease or cessation of smoking as compared to no change in smoking behavior or increase in the number of cigarettes (p: .006). CONCLUSIONS: Success in smoking cessation can be increased with the accurate analyses of the anxiety effects caused by coronaphobia after COVID-19 outbreak on the desire of smoking cessation. This resolution depends on the solution-oriented strategies that will increase the awareness of physicians and patients, a close follow-up of patients with tools such as telemedicine, and a quick determination of their needs.","output":"Effect of coronaphobia on smoking habits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Evening chronotype (i.e., night owl preference) is associated with worse insomnia and depressive symptoms, and poorer health behaviors. The aim of this study was to examine the association between chronotype and these symptoms and health behaviors during COVID-19 pandemic quarantine. METHODS: An online survey, distributed internationally via social media from 5/21/2020C7/1/2020, asked adults to report sociodemographic/economic information, changes in sleep (midpoint, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, time-in-bed), and health behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary screen time, and outdoor light exposure patterns) from prior to during the pandemic, chronotype preference (definitely morning [DM], rather more morning [RM], rather more evening [RE], or definitely evening [DE]), and complete the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D-10). Multinomial logistic regression and ANCOVA models, adjusting for age and sex, examined associations of chronotype with COVID-19 pandemic related impacts on sleep, depressive symptoms, and health behaviors. RESULTS: A subsample of 579 participants (M age: 39y, range: 18C80; 73.6% female), currently under quarantine and neither pregnant nor performing shift work, represented each chronotype evenly (~25%). Participants delayed their sleep midpoint by 72.0min (SD=111.5) during the pandemic. DE chronotypes had a greater delay than morning types (MSD DE: 91.09.0 vs. RM: 55.99.2 & DM: 66.19.3; p=0.046) with no significant change in other sleep patterns relative to other chronotypes. However, DE and RE chronotypes had greater odds of reporting that their new sleep/wake schedule was still not consistent with their body clock preference relative to morning types (2[15]=54.8, p<0.001), reported greater ISI (F[3,503]=5.3, p=.001) and CES-D-10 scores (F[3,492]=7.9, p<.001), and had greater odds for increased or consistently moderate-to-high sedentary screen time (2[12]=22.7, p=0.03) and decreased physical activity (2[12]=22.5, p=0.03) than DM chronotype. There was no significant difference in change in outdoor light exposure by chronotype (2[12]=12.1, p=0.43). CONCLUSION: In an international online sample of adults under COVID-19 pandemic quarantine, evening chronotypes, despite taking the opportunity to delay sleep to match biological clock preference, reported their sleep/wake schedules were still inconsistent with personal preference, and reported greater insomnia and depressive symptoms, and odds of engaging in poorer health behaviors than morning chronotypes.

The adsorption behaviors of different species of lead (Pb, PbO, PbCl and PbCl2) on the Al2O3 surfaces were explored based on density functional theory. The results show that the chemisorption mechanism is responsible for the adsorption of lead species on the Al2O3 surface. The high reactivity of Pb adsorption on the &#945;-Al2O3 (110) surface is mainly attributed to the existence of unsaturated Al atoms. The Al hollow sites are identified as the effectively active sites for Pb adsorption on the (110) surface. The adsorption energies of different species of lead on the Al-terminated (110) surface are in the range of - 4.20 to - 6.30 eV. PbO adsorption at the Al hollow site of the Al-terminated (110) surface shows the highest adsorption energy (- 6.30 eV), suggesting that Al2O3 prefers to capture PbO among different species of lead. The strong interactions of PbO, PbCl and PbCl2 molecules with the unsaturated Al atoms of the &#945;-Al2O3 (110) surface are responsible for PbO, PbCl and PbCl2 capture by Al2O3.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to the restructuration of traditional clinical activity, by adopting telemedicine. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate patients' satisfaction with Headache teleconsultation by telephone during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and assess patients' preferred model of appointment (face-to-face, teleconsultation by telephone, or both). METHODS: Patients with a previous diagnosis of primary headache or neuropathies and facial pain disorders, and at least one telephone headache visit during the first wave of COVID-19, filled out an online questionnaire regarding socio-demographic parameters, satisfaction with teleconsultation, and preferred model of appointment. RESULTS: We included 83 patients (valid response rate of 64.3%); most had migraine (83.1%). Regarding teleconsultation, 81.9% considered this model adequate for follow-up, 88.0% were satisfied with the information provided about the disease/treatment, and 73.5% with the medication modification. Ninety percent would agree with a new tele-evaluation if stable after the pandemic. The mixed model was the preferred medical consultation type for the post-pandemic period (43.4%), followed by face-to-face visits (33.7%). CONCLUSION: Patients were satisfied with the headache teleconsultation during the COVID-19 era. However, an exclusive model of telemedicine does not seem suitable for monitoring all patients.

The objective of this study was to investigate anxiety symptoms and use of preventive measures against COVID-19. The study also compared the association between preventive measures and anxiety symptoms during the week immediately preceding the study and those symptoms and measures at the beginning of the outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional population survey using an online questionnaire commenced on 14 February 2020. The study participants were residents of Taiwan ages 20 to 70 years. The 6-item state version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6) was used to assess anxiety symptoms. The questions about preventive measures asked participants about their personal protection, cough etiquette, contact precautions, voluntary quarantine, and prompt reporting. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the factors influencing an increase in the preventive measures scores. RESULTS: Of a total of 3555 completed responses, a total of 52.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 50.4-53.7) of the respondents reported moderate to severe levels of anxiety symptoms in the past week, whereas 48.8% (95%CI 47.2-50.5) reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms at the beginning of the outbreak. With a higher score indicating greater anxiety, the median scores for anxiety symptoms in the past week and at the beginning of the outbreak were 46.7 (IQR [interquartile range] 36.7-53.3) and 43.3 (IQR 36.7-53.3), respectively. The median scores for the preventive measures taken in the past week and at the beginning of the outbreak were 26.0 (IQR 21.0-30.0) and 24.0 (IQR 19.0-28.0), respectively, out of a maximum score of 36. In the multivariable analysis, an increased anxiety symptom score from the beginning of the outbreak to the past week (adjusted OR = 7.38, 95%CI 6.28-8.66) was a strongly significant determinant of an increased preventive measures score in the past week compared with the score at the beginning of the outbreak.

However, when the number of cases is huge and there are individual differences in the virus itself, the probability of false-negative results increases. With the advancement in research on the new coronavirus, new detection technologies that use serum-specific antibodies as detection targets have been developed. These detection technologies have high efficiency and shorter turnaround time, which ultimately shortens the time required for diagnosis. This article summarizes the methods that have been reported to date for the detection of the new coronavirus and discusses their principles and technical characteristics. AIMS: Compare the advantages and disadvantages of various SARS-CoV-2 detection methods and analyze their principles. METHODS: Searched reports on SARS-CoV-2 detection methods published so far, extracted the data and analyzed them. Use the primer blast function of NCBI to analyze the primers used in qRT-PCR detection. RESULTS: The detection sensitivity was the highest when nucleocapsid protein gene was used as the target, reaching 96.6%. The detection efficiency of the remaining targets ranged from 66.7% to 96.0%. Various new detection methods, like Serum specific antibody detection, can speed up the test time. However, due to the complexity of the method and higher testing requirements, it seems that it cannot be used as a complete replacement for qRT-PRC testing.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented unique challenges to the rheumatology community. It is known that many individuals with rheumatic disease are at increased risk of severe disease from other infections, sparking a similar fear for COVID-19. In addition, medications routinely used in rheumatology practice are being trialled as treatments, with the potential for drug shortages for rheumatology patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Underlying comorbidities and active disease are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes in patients with rheumatic disease. Tocilizumab and hydroxychloroquine have not proven to be effective treatments in the management of COVID-19. Telehealth has become an essential tool for the rheumatology community to monitor patients during the pandemic. SUMMARY: In this article, we summarise the available COVID-19 evidence that is of relevance to the rheumatology community. We discuss the risk of contracting COVID-19 in individuals with rheumatic disease, along with presenting features and clinical outcomes. We provide an overview of the treatments for COVID-19 which have significance for rheumatology. We highlight published recommendations which can guide our management of rheumatic disease populations during this pandemic. Finally, we discuss the challenges in delivering effective care virtually and present methods and tools which could be adapted for use.","output":"COVID-19: What Do Rheumatologists Need to Know?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The importation of SARS-CoV-2 through air travel poses substantial risks to generate new COVID-19 outbreaks. Timely contact tracing is particularly crucial to limit onwards transmission in settings without established community transmission. METHODS: We conducted an in-depth analysis of the response to a big flight-associated COVID-19 outbreak in Vietnam in March 2020 that involved contact tracing, systematic testing and strict quarantine up to third generation contacts. RESULTS: 183 primary contacts from the flight as well as 1000 secondary and 311 third generation contacts were traced, tested, and quarantined across 15 provinces across Vietnam. The protracted confirmation of the index case at 3 days and 19 h after arrival resulted in isolation/quarantine delays of 6.8 days (IQR 6.3-6.8) and 5.8 days (IQR 5.8-7.0) for primary and secondary cases, respectively, which generated 84.0 and 26.4 person-days of community exposure from primary and secondary cases, respectively. Nevertheless, only 5 secondary cases occurred. CONCLUSIONS: A large flight-related COVID-19 cluster was successfully contained through timely, systematic and comprehensive public health responses despite delayed index case identification.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether using resource groups (RGs) within flexible assertive community treatment (FACT) has favorable effects on empowerment and recovery-related outcomes in people with SMI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This assessor-blind, multisite randomized clinical trial was conducted from September 1, 2017, to September 30, 2020, with follow-up at 9 and 18 months. A total of 158 participants aged 18 to 65 years meeting the criteria for SMI were randomly allocated to FACT plus RG vs FACT as usual (1:1) in 20 FACT teams throughout the Netherlands. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2020, to January 31, 2021. The study was prespecified in the trial protocol and data from the intent-to-treat population were analyzed. INTERVENTIONS: In the FACT plus RG condition, patients chose members from their informal and formal networks to form an RG that meets quarterly to discuss self-formulated recovery goals. The RG was integrated into the multidisciplinary support provided by the FACT team. In the FACT as-usual condition, empowerment (defined as overcoming powerlessness and gaining control of ones life) and involvement of significant others was also part of the provided care, but without the structure of the RG. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was self-reported empowerment, measured with the Netherlands Empowerment List. RESULTS: A total of 158 participants with SMI (median age, 38 [median absolute deviation, 13] years; 93 men [58.9%]) were randomized to FACT plus RG (n = 80) or FACT as usual (n = 78) care. Intention-to-treat analyses showed that randomization to the RG condition was associated with a clinically significant increase in empowerment (Cohen d, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.21-0.86) and improved outcomes with small to medium effect sizes in terms of quality of life (Cohen d, 0.25; 95% CI, ?0.07 to 0.56), personal recovery (Cohen d, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.06-0.69), quality of social contact (Cohen d, 0.24; 95% CI, ?0.07 to 0.56), disability (Cohen d, 0.29; 95% CI, ?0.03 to 0.60), general functioning (Cohen d, 0.30; 95% CI, ?0.01 to 0.62), and social functioning (Cohen d, 0.28; 95% CI, ?0.04 to 0.59). No differences between conditions were found regarding psychopathological symptoms, attachment, frequency of social contact, and employment. Compared with FACT as usual, participants who stayed with the assigned treatment in the RG condition were more satisfied with treatment at 9 (Cohen d = 0.45; t(135) = ?2.62; P = .009) and 18 (Cohen d = 0.41; t(116) = ?2.22; P = .02) months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings show that working with RGs improves empowerment and other mental health outcomes in people with SMI who receive community-based mental health services. This method of network-oriented care empowers people with SMI within their own environment.

Their cultivation using agro-industrial wastes and wastewater (WaW) is of particular interest in the context of a circular economy, not only for recycling valuable nutrients but also for reducing the requirements for fresh water for the production of biomass. Recovery and recycling of nutrients is an unavoidable long-term approach for securing future food and feed production. Agro-industrial WaW are rich in nutrients and have been widely considered as a potential nutrient source for the cultivation of microalgae/duckweed. However, they commonly contain various hazardous contaminants, which could potentially taint the produced biomass, raising various concerns about the safety of their consumption. Herein, an overview of the most important contaminants, including heavy metals and metalloids, pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites etc.), and xenobiotics (hormones, antibiotics, parasiticides etc.) is given. It is concluded that pretreatment and processing of WaW is a requisite step for the removal of several contaminants. Among the various technologies, anaerobic digestion (AD) is widely used in practice and offers a technologically mature approach for WaW treatment. During AD, various organic and biological contaminants are significantly removed. Further removal of contaminants could be achieved by post-treatment and processing of digestates (solid/liquid separation, dilution etc.) to further decrease the concentration of contaminants. Moreover, during cultivation an additional removal may occur through various mechanisms, such as precipitation, degradation, and biotransformation. Since many jurisdictions regulate the presence of various contaminants in feed or food setting strict safety monitoring processes, it would be of particular interest to initiate a multi-disciplinary discussion whether agro-industrial WaW ought to be used to cultivate microalgae/duckweed for feed or food production and identify most feasible options for doing this safely. Based on the current body of knowledge it is estimated that AD and post-treatment of WaW can lower significantly the risks associated with heavy metals and pathogens, but it is yet unclear to what extent this is the case for certain persistent xenobiotics.","output":"Using agro-industrial wastes for the cultivation of microalgae and duckweeds: Contamination risks and biomass safety concerns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the normal values for non-activated thromboelastometry parameters among pregnant women.

MEASUREMENTS: Reference ranges were derived by calculating 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles for the following parameters: clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), amplitude at 10 (A10) and 20 min (A20), alpha angle, maximum clot firmness (MCF), and lysis index at 30 (LI30) and 60 min (LI60). The NATEM/NaHEPTEM CT ratio was calculated to determine the baseline ratio in term pregnant women. MAIN RESULTS: 146 women were screened and 120 were enrolled. The median age was 34 years [31-36], median gestational age was 39.1 weeks [38.3-39.3], and median parity was 1 [0-2]. Median pre-delivery platelet and hematocrit levels were within the normal ranges.

The TSH fraction was the most effective against HSV-1 replication (SI = 15.33), whereas compounds 1 (SI = 2.46) and 2 (SI = 1.95) were less active. The most active fraction and these compounds were also assayed to determine the viral multiplication step(s) upon which they act as well as their potential synergistic effects.

We examined the characteristics of the study sample by race (Hispanic vs non-Hispanic) and its association with healthcare utilization, measured by discounted hospital charges and length of stay. Multivariate survey regression models were used to identify predictors by racial groups. Results: Among 702,878 lung cancer patients, 5.1% were Hispanic.

The virus seems to be associated with a wide range of placental lesions, none of them specific. METHOD: We collected cases of Covid-19 maternal infection during pregnancy associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, for which we received the placenta. We studied clinical data and described pathological findings of placenta and post-mortem examination of fetuses. We performed an immunohistochemical study and RT-PCR of SARS-Cov-2 on placenta samples. RESULTS: We report 5 cases of poor fetal outcome, 3 fetal deaths and 2 extreme premature neonates, one with growth restriction, without clinical and biological sign of SARS-Cov-2 infection. All placenta presented massive perivillous fibrin deposition and large intervillous thrombi associated with strong SARS-Cov-2 expression in trophoblast and SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity in amniotic fluid or on placenta samples. Chronic histiocytic intervillositis was present in 4/5 cases. Placental ultrasound was abnormal and the sFLT1-PIGF ratio was increased in one case. Timing between mothers infection and the poor fetal outcome was 10 days in 4 cases. The massive placental damage are directly induced by the virus whose receptors are expressed on trophoblast, leading to trophoblast necrosis and massive inflammation in villous chamber, in a similar way it occurs in diffuse alveolar damage in adults infected by SARS-Cov-2. DISCUSSION: SARS-Cov-2 can be associated to a rare set of placental lesions which can lead to fetal demise, preterm birth, or growth restriction. Stronger surveillance of mothers infected by SARS-Cov-2 is required.","output":"Placental lesions and SARS-Cov-2 infection: Diffuse placenta damage associated to poor fetal outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The huge body of publicly available RNA-seq libraries is a treasure of functional information allowing to quantify the expression of known or novel transcripts in tissues. However, transcript quantification commonly relies on alignment methods requiring a lot of computational resources and processing time, which does not scale easily to large datasets.

We present the Kmerator Suite, a set of three tools designed to extract specific k-mer signatures, quantify these k-mers into RNA-seq datasets and quickly visualize large datasets characteristics. The core tool, Kmerator, produces specific k-mers for 97% of human genes, enabling the measure of gene expression with high accuracy in simulated datasets. KmerExploR, a direct application of Kmerator, uses a set of predictor genes specific k-mers to infer metadata including library protocol, sample features or contaminations from RNA-seq datasets. KmerExploR results are visualised through a user-friendly interface. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Kmerator Suite can be used for advanced queries targeting known or new biomarkers such as mutations, gene fusions or long non coding-RNAs for human health applications.","output":"Kmerator Suite: design of specific k-mer signatures and automatic metadata discovery in large RNA-Seq datasets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to COVID-19, many U.S. states implemented stay-at-home orders to mitigate disease spread, causing radical changes across all facets of consumer behavior.

We illustrate this using a mathematical model that segments the vulnerable population and their closest contacts, the 'shielders'. Effects of extending the duration of lockdown and faster or slower transition to post-lockdown conditions and, most importantly, the trade-off between increased protection of the vulnerable segment and fewer restrictions on the general population are explored. Our study shows that the most important determinants of outcome are: (i) post-lockdown transmission rates within the general and between the general and vulnerable segments; (ii) fractions of the population in the vulnerable and shielder segments; (iii) adherence to protective measures; and (iv) build-up of population immunity. Additionally, we found that effective measures in the shielder segment, e.g. intensive routine screening, allow further relaxations in the general population. We find that the outcome of any future policy is strongly influenced by the contact matrix between segments and the relationships between physical distancing measures and transmission rates. This strategy has potential applications for any infectious disease for which there are defined proportions of the population who cannot be treated or who are at risk of severe outcomes.

Unsurprisingly, deception and fraud in such platforms have also increased, but have not been thoroughly studied to understand what characteristics can expose such behavior and allow its automatic detection and blocking. Indeed, crowdfunding platforms are the only ones typically performing oversight for the campaigns launched in each service. However, they are not properly incentivized to combat fraud among users and the campaigns they launch: on the one hand, a platform's revenue is directly proportional to the number of transactions performed (since the platform charges a fixed amount per donation); on the other hand, if a platform is transparent with respect to how much fraud it has, it may discourage potential donors from participating. In this paper, we take the first step in studying fraud in crowdfunding campaigns. We analyze data collected from different crowdfunding platforms, and annotate 700 campaigns as fraud or not. We compute various textual and image-based features and study their distributions and how they associate with campaign fraud. Using these attributes, we build machine learning classifiers, and show that it is possible to automatically classify such fraudulent behavior with up to 90.14% accuracy and 96.01% AUC, only using features available from the campaign's description at the moment of publication (i.e., with no user or money activity), making our method applicable for real-time operation on a user browser.","output":"I call BS: Fraud Detection in Crowdfunding Campaigns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new decade of the 21(st) century (2020) started with the emergence of a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 that caused an epidemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China.

Understanding the association between loneliness and mortality is therefore critically important. We examined whether combinations of loneliness and social isolation, using a metric named social asymmetry, was associated with increased mortality risk. METHODS: The sample was derived from participants in The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling older adults aged &#8805;50. Survey data were linked to official death registration records. Cox proportional hazards regressions and competing risk survival analyses were used to examine the association between social asymmetry and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. RESULTS: Of four social asymmetry groups, concordant low lonely (low loneliness, low isolation) included 35.5% of participants; 26.4% were concordant high lonely (high loneliness, high isolation); 19.2% were discordant robust (low loneliness, high isolation) and 18.9% discordant susceptible (high loneliness, low isolation). The concordant high lonely (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-1.87) and discordant robust (HR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.04-1.81) groups had an increased mortality risk compared to those in the concordant low lonely group. The concordant high lonely group had an increased risk of mortality due to diseases of the circulatory system (sub-distribution hazard ratio = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.03-2.25). CONCLUSION: We found that social asymmetry predicted mortality over a 7-year follow-up period.

In its most severe form, YF manifests as a hemorrhagic fever that causes severe damage to visceral organs. Although coagulopathy is a defining feature of severe YF in humans, the mechanism by which it develops remains uncertain. Hepatocytes are a major target of yellow fever virus (YFV) infection, and the coagulopathy in severe YF has long been attributed to massive hepatocyte infection and destruction that results in a defect in clotting factor synthesis. However, when we analyzed blood from Brazilian patients with severe YF, we found high concentrations of plasma D-dimer, a fibrin split product, suggestive of a concurrent consumptive process. To define the relationship between coagulopathy and hepatocellular tropism, we compared infection and disease in Fah(?/?), Rag2(?/?), and Il2r?(?/?) mice engrafted with human hepatocytes (hFRG mice) and rhesus macaques using a highly pathogenic African YFV strain. YFV infection of macaques and hFRG mice caused substantial hepatocyte infection, liver damage, and coagulopathy as defined by virological, clinical, and pathological criteria. However, only macaques developed a consumptive coagulopathy whereas YFV-infected hFRG mice did not. Thus, infection of cell types other than hepatocytes likely contributes to the consumptive coagulopathy associated with severe YF in primates and humans. These findings expand our understanding of viral hemorrhagic disease and associated coagulopathy and suggest directions for clinical management of severe YF cases.","output":"Consumptive coagulopathy of severe yellow fever occurs independently of hepatocellular tropism and massive hepatic injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to be a major public health problem. Vulnerable populations include older individuals with presumed weakening of the immune response. Identification of factors influencing COVID-19 infection could provide an additional means for protecting such individuals. MethodsMembers of a family study previously interviewed as middle aged individuals were re-contacted and asked to participate in extended phone interview (2-3 hours) covering past and current mental health issues, physical health diagnoses, use of alcohol and drugs, and exposure to anyone with COVID-19. The average follow-up period was 32 years. Detailed medication use was collected to confirm medical diagnoses and to reveal possible protective effects of particular drug classes currently prescribed for the participant by their physician. Serology was available for red cell antigens (ABO, Kell, Duffy, Kidd, Rhesus) and HLA subtypes. Analyses were conducted to contrast COVID-19 + and COVID-19 - individuals for physical and mental health diagnoses, use of alcohol and drugs, and red cell and HLA serology. Additionally, analyses were conducted to contrast these groups with a group reporting known exposure but absence of COVID-19 symptoms or diagnosis by a health professional. ResultsInterviews were completed between September 2020 and November 2021. A total of 42 of the 90 individuals interviewed had been vaccinated at the time of interview. At the time of interview, 11.1% reported having developed COVID-19. Using quantity per occasion (QPO) and quantity by frequency (QXF) totals in the past month by type of alcohol consumed, we found a significant association between QPO for liquor (p=0.017) and marginal effects for QXF for liquor consumption (p=0.06). Exposed individuals who were COVID-19 negative tended to drink more liquor than those who were positive, an average of about one drink per day. Beer and wine consumption were not statistically significant. A diagnosis of alcohol use disorder at baseline evaluation was not a significant predictor of being COVID positive or negative. Self-reported current depression or depression in the past only was not a predictor of COVID-19 status based on a single question \\"Are you depressed currently or only in the past?\\". In contrast, completion of a clinical interview designed to elicit depressed mood and concurrent symptoms for determination of the lifetime presence or absence of a depressive episode did reveal a significant effect. Comparison of responses at baseline to follow-up showed those most resilient to developing COVID-19 were those without evidence of a depressive episode by lifetime history at both points in time. Physical health issues were analyzed for those that were frequently occurring in our sample such as hypertension but not found to be significant. BMI was analyzed and found to be statistically non-significant. Analysis of HLA variation across the whole sample did not reveal a significant association but among males two variants, A1 and B8, did show significant variation associated with COVID-19+ and COVID-19-status. Analyses of the red cell antigens revealed one significant red cell effect; Kidd genotypic variation was associated with COVID-19 status. InterpretationWe tentatively conclude that use of specific types of alcohol, namely liquor, is associated with reduced frequency of COVID-19. However, the amount is low, averaging about 1 drink per day. Enlarged samples are needed to confirm these results. The finding that past history of alcohol use disorder does not increase likelihood of developing COVID-19 is important. It should be noted that the 34 individuals diagnosed with AUD at baseline had survived an average of 32 years in order to participate in the current interview suggesting they may be especially resilient to adverse health conditions. The finding that a single question designed to elicit the presence or absence of depressed mood either currently or in the past was not a risk factor for COVID-19 in contrast to report of a clinically significant past history of a depressive episode based on more extensive examination using DSM criteria is important.

To screen local animal populations in the United States for exposure to SARS-like coronaviruses, we developed a serological assay using the receptor binding domain (RBD) from SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2s RBD differs from common human and animal coronaviruses allowing us to identify animals previously infected with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. Using an indirect ELISA for SARS-CoV-2s RBD, we screened serum from wild and domestic animals for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2s RBD. Surprisingly pre-pandemic feline serum samples submitted to the University of Tennessee Veterinary Hospital were [~]70% positive for anti-SARS RBD antibodies. This was independent of prior infection with a feline coronavirus (FCoV), eliminating the possibility of FCoV cross-reactivity.

This result holds even if the measurement method of the indicators is adjusted and endogeneity is considered; this indicates that the research conclusions are robust. Moreover, this kind of health inequality mainly comes from the economic and leisure effects of underemployment for workers with different educational levels.

Female students predominated the overall sample with 920 participants (71.4%). In general, there was a statistically significant positive relationship between perceived stress and health anxiety. Health anxiety and perceived stress levels were significantly higher among international students compared to domestic ones. Regarding coping, wishful thinking was associated with higher levels of stress and anxiety among international students, while being a goal-oriented person acted the opposite way. Among the domestic students, cognitive restructuring as a coping strategy was associated with lower levels of stress and anxiety. Concerning health anxiety, female students (domestic and international) had significantly higher levels of health anxiety compared to males. Moreover, female students had significantly higher levels of perceived stress compared to males in the international group, however, there was no significant difference in perceived stress between males and females in the domestic group. CONCLUSION: The elevated perceived stress levels during major life events can be further deepened by disengagement from home (being away/abroad from country or family) and by using inadequate coping strategies. By following and adhering to the international recommendations, adopting proper coping methods, and equipping oneself with the required coping and stress management skills, the associated high levels of perceived stress and anxiety could be mitigated.","output":"Health anxiety, perceived stress, and coping styles in the shadow of the COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted a study to document the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on cancer screening continuum in selected low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

Managers/supervisors from 18 programs in 17 countries participated. Lockdown was imposed in all countries except Brazil. Screening was suspended for at least 30 days in 13 countries, while diagnostic-services for screen-positives were suspended in 9 countries. All countries except Cameroon, Bangladesh, India, Honduras and China managed to continue with cancer treatment throughout the outbreak. The participants rated service availability compared to pre-COVID days on a scale of 0 (no activities) to 100 (same as before).

Therefore, it is important to detect bla(NDM) genes in childrens clinical samples as quickly as possible and analyze their characteristics. Here, a recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) assay, which operates in a single one-step reaction tube at 39C in 5?15 min, was established to target bla(NDM) genes in childrens clinical samples. The analytical sensitivity of the RAA assay was 20 copies, and the various bacterial types without bla(NDM) genes did not amplify. This method was used to detect bla(NDM) genes in 112 childrens stool samples, 10 of which were tested positive by both RAA and standard PCR. To further investigate the characteristics of carbapenem-resistant bacteria carrying bla(NDM) in children, 15 carbapenem-resistant bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Acinetobacter junii, and Proteus mirabilis) were isolated from the 10 samples. Notably, more than one bacterial type was isolated from three samples. Most of these isolates were resistant to cephalosporins, cefoperazone-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, aztreonam, co-trimoxazole, and carbapenems. bla(NDM)(C)(1) and bla(NDM)(C)(5) were the two main types in these samples.

Conditions such as HIV infection or treatment with immunosuppressors (in cancer or autoimmune diseases) are not among the bad prognosis factors for development of distress. To date, there have been no reported case fatalities in children, probably due to their more immature immune system. Our conclusions follow: (1) The milder form of SARS in children and the apparent protective factor that immunosupression represent rules out a significant viral cytopathic effect (they would be the most affected). (2) The evidence for immune implication in distress strongly supports immunomodulators for therapy: phosphodiesterase inhibitors (due to their down-modulating activity on proinflammatory cytokines); inhaled corticoids (aimed at producing a local immunomodulation); teophylline or nedocromil sodium (which prevents inflammatory cell recruitment into the airway wall). (3) An early immunomodulatory therapy, based on the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and clinical parameters to evaluate the respiratory function such as arterial oxygen saturation, could prevent the occurrence of distress. (4) Vaccine design should consider the immune origin of distress.

This study investigated the use of a sequential compression mechanical pump with thigh-high sleeves with compression cycles timed to venous refilling. We hypothesized that this would recruit pooled venous blood from the lower limbs, maintain the central blood volume and thus decrease the incidence of hypotension. METHODS One hundred parturients scheduled for elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia were recruited and randomly assigned to use of either a mechanical pump (Group M) or control (Group C). A standardized protocol for co-hydration and anesthesia was followed. Hypotension, defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure by >20% from baseline, was treated with 6-mg boluses of intravenous ephedrine. The incidence of hypotension was defined as the primary outcome. Median ephedrine requirement was taken as a measure of the severity of hypotension. RESULTS Hypotension occurred in 12 of 47 (25.5%) patients in Group M compared to 27 of 45 (60%) in Group C (P=0.001). The median [range] ephedrine dose was greater in Group C (12 [0-24]mg) compared to Group M (0 [0-12]mg) (P<0.001). There was no difference between groups in the time to onset of hypotension.

This meta-analysis aims to systematically compare the diagnostic performance of different clinical specimen collection methods. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN, and Research Square from Jan 1, 2000, to Nov 16, 2020. We included original clinical studies that examined the performance of nasopharyngeal swabs and any additional respiratory specimens for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals presenting in ambulatory care. Studies without data on paired samples, or those that only examined different samples from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases were not useful for examining diagnostic performance of a test and were excluded. Diagnostic performance, including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, was examined using random effects models and double arcsine transformation. FINDINGS: Of the 5577 studies identified in our search, 23 studies including 7973 participants with 16 762 respiratory samples were included. Respiratory specimens examined in these studies included 7973 nasopharyngeal swabs, 1622 nasal swabs, 6110 saliva samples, 338 throat swabs, and 719 pooled nasal and throat swabs. Using nasopharyngeal swabs as the gold standard, pooled nasal and throat swabs gave the highest sensitivity of 97% (95% CI 93-100), whereas lower sensitivities were achieved by saliva (85%, 75-93) and nasal swabs (86%, 77-93) and a much lower sensitivity by throat swabs (68%, 35-94). A comparably high positive predictive value was obtained by pooled nasal and throat (97%, 90-100) and nasal swabs (96%, 87-100) and a slightly lower positive predictive value by saliva (93%, 88-97). Throat swabs have the lowest positive predictive value of 75% (95% CI 45-96). Comparably high specificities (range 97-99%) and negative predictive value (range 95-99%) were observed among different clinical specimens. Comparison between health-care-worker collection and self-collection for pooled nasal and throat swabs and nasal swabs showed comparable diagnostic performance. No significant heterogeneity was observed in the analysis of pooled nasal and throat swabs and throat swabs, whereas moderate to substantial heterogeneity (I2 &#8805;30%) was observed in studies on saliva and nasal swabs. INTERPRETATION: Our review suggests that, compared with the gold standard of nasopharyngeal swabs, pooled nasal and throat swabs offered the best diagnostic performance of the alternative sampling approaches for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ambulatory care. Saliva and nasal swabs gave comparable and very good diagnostic performance and are clinically acceptable alternative specimen collection methods. Throat swabs gave a much lower sensitivity and positive predictive value and should not be recommended. Self-collection for pooled nasal and throat swabs and nasal swabs was not associated with any significant impairment of diagnostic accuracy. Our results also provide a useful reference framework for the proper interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 testing results using different clinical specimens.

Objective: We aimed to study the association between previous COVID-19 infection and antibody levels after COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: A serological analysis to measure SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgA, and neutralizing antibodies was performed on individuals who received one or two doses of either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 vaccines in Kuwait. A Student t-test was performed and followed by generalized linear regression models adjusted for individual characteristics and comorbidities were fitted to compare the average levels of IgG and neutralizing antibodies between vaccinated individuals with and without previous COVID-19 infection. Results: A total of 1,025 individuals were recruited. The mean levels of IgG, IgA, and neutralizing antibodies were higher in vaccinated subjects with previous COVID-19 infections than in those without previous infection. Regression analysis showed a steeper slope of decline for IgG and neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated individuals without previous COVID-19 infection compared to those with previous COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: Previous COVID-19 infection appeared to elicit robust and sustained levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in vaccinated individuals.

The number of people suffering from pollen allergies has increased dramatically in recent decades. Pollen allergies affect up to 30% of the world population. Pollen of the common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) is one of the most aggressive allergens in the world. We have used a series of immunoinformatics approaches to design an effective epitope-based vaccine, which might induce a competent immunity against a major allergen Amb a 11. CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell epitopes and their corresponding MHC restricted alleles were identified by prediction tools provided by immune epitope database (IEDB). Among T-cell epitopes, MHC class I peptide (GLMEPAFTYV) and MHC class II peptide (LVCFSFSLVLILGLV) were identified as most suitable. From all predicted B-cell epitopes, only one epitope (GKLVKFSEQQLVDC) containing sequence from the conserved region was chosen for next processing. Selected epitopes have been validated by molecular docking analysis. These epitopes showed a very strong binding affinity to MHC I molecule and MHC II molecule with binding energy scores ? 729.3 and ? 725.0 kcal/mole respectively. Performed experimental validation showed that only the MHC class II peptide (LVCFSFSLVLILGLV) can stimulate T cells from ragweed allergic patients and IgE antibodies specific to the ragweed pollen do not recognize this epitope. Therefore, this peptide could be potentially used as a vaccine against the major allergen Amb a 11. The B-cell epitope GKLVKFSEQQLVDC forms a stable complex with the IgE molecule (energy weighted score ? 695,0 kcal/mole). Tested sera from patients with ragweed allergy showed that the ragweed specific IgE antibodies can bind to the identified B-cell epitope. Population coverage analysis was performed for CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell epitopes. It was predicted that CD4+ T-cell epitope (LVCFSFSLVLILGLV) covers 90.56% of the population of Europe and 99.36% of the world population. CD8+ T-cell epitope (GLMEPAFTYV) has a population coverage of 77.37% for Europe and 71.35% for all the world.","output":"Design of an Epitope-Based Peptide Vaccine Against the Major Allergen Amb a 11 Using Immunoinformatic Approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in order to protect the patient and to save hospital beds, cancelation of elective surgeries has become a great challenge. Considering that obesity is a chronic disease and the possible effect imposed by quarantine on weight gain with worsening rates of obesity and metabolic comorbidities, the creation of a protocol for a safe return to bariatric surgery became essential. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the incidence of new-onset severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) symptoms in patients who underwent bariatric procedures during the declining curve period. SETTING: Private practice METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted and included patients with indications for bariatric surgery during the decreasing curve period of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic who underwent surgery under a hospital security protocol. Patients were asked to answer a questionnaire and had a swab PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The primary outcome measure was the presence of 14-day and 30-day postoperative symptoms associated with COVID-19. Mortality was also analyzed. RESULTS: Three hundred patients with negative RT-PCR were operated on from May to June 2020. Seventeen patients had their surgery postponed because of a positive RT-PCR test or close contact. None of the patients developed new-onset SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic infection after 30 days of observation. No deaths were reported. Eleven had complications not related to SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Even though this population may have a poorer outcome when infected with SARS-CoV-2, this security protocol has shown that the procedure can be safely performed during the outbreak.","output":"Restarting Elective Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery Under a Security Protocol During the COVID-19 Pandemic-a Prospective Observational Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency, and time to detorsion is imperative for testicular salvage. During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients may delay emergency care due to stay-at-home orders and concern of COVID-19 exposure. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether emergency presentation for testicular torsion was delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether the rate of orchiectomy increased compared to a retrospective period. STUDY DESIGN: Patients were prospectively enrolled in a multicenter study from seven institutions in the United States and Canada. Inclusion criteria were patients two months to 18 years of age with acute testicular torsion from March through July 2020. The retrospective group included patients from January 2019 through February 2020. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis tests, Chi-square tests, and logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 221 patients were included: 84 patients in the COVID-19 cohort and 137 in the retrospective cohort. Median times from symptom onset to emergency department presentation during COVID-19 compared to the retrospective period were 17.9 hours (IQR 5.5-48.0) and 7.5 hours (IQR 4.0-28.0) respectively (p = 0.04). In the COVID-19 cohort, 42% of patients underwent orchiectomy compared to 29% of pre-pandemic controls (p = 0.06). During COVID-19, 46% patients endorsed delay in presentation compared to 33% in the retrospective group (p = 0.04). DISCUSSION: We found a significantly longer time from testicular torsion symptom onset to presentation during the pandemic and a higher proportion of patients reported delaying care. Strengths of the study include the number of included patients and the multicenter prospective design during the pandemic. Limitations include a retrospective pre-pandemic comparison group. CONCLUSIONS: In a large multicenter study we found a significantly longer time from testicular torsion symptom onset to presentation during the pandemic and a significantly higher proportion of patients reported delaying care. Based on the findings of this study, more patient education is needed on the management of testicular torsion during a pandemic.","output":"A Multicenter Study of Acute Testicular Torsion in the Time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To know their real epidemiological histories in 1,091 probale cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) without definite history of contact with SARS patients in the first survey.

Six replicated experiments were conducted between 2010 and 2016 with field-grown basil of a susceptible cultivar exposed to naturally occurring wind-dispersed sporangiospores of P. belbahrii to evaluate conventional fungicides registered for basil downy mildew in the United States and in development for this use. This project revealed the importance for successful management of using a preventive fungicide application schedule, maintaining a 7-day application interval, and using application equipment designed to provide thorough spray coverage to plants (drop nozzles). Fungicide efficacy was assessed based on incidence of symptomatic leaves rather than disease severity, which is stringent but realistic because there is zero tolerance for disease on fresh-market herbs. Most fungicides were tested as the formulated product marketed in the United States. Oxathiapiprolin was tested as experimental formulations. Its trade name is Orondis. Overall best control was achieved in 2016. Excellent control (99% based on AUDPC values) was obtained with four fungicide programs with oxathiapiprolin, Revus, and ProPhyt, indicating this combination of chemistry was more important than specific timing for each fungicide. Ranman applied in alternation with Revus plus K-Phite was not quite as effective (89% control); this treatment was ineffective in 2015 when the 7-day spray interval was not maintained. Best treatment in 2015 was Quadris applied in alternation with Revus plus oxathiapiprolin for two of three Revus applications. Two different alternations of these fungicides also were effective. But Quadris alternated with Revus was ineffective. When tested singly, the most effective fungicides in 2013 (listed in order based on AUDPC values) were Zampro, Revus, oxathiapiprolin, and Ranman. ProPhyt was effective in 2013 but not in 2012, when another phosphorous acid fungicide, K-Phite, also was ineffective. Only oxathiapiprolin and Zampro were effective in the 2012 experiment; Revus and Ranman were ineffective. Presidio was ineffective both years. Based on the results from this study, Orondis is the most effective fungicide among those evaluated for managing basil downy mildew, and Zampro is second. Neither were labeled for this use on field-grown basil as of June 2020.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective, multicenter study of 874 COVID-19 patients admitted to five tertiary hospitals from February 20 to April 14, 2020. Data on clinical features, laboratory parameters, medications, and treatment outcomes were collected until April 30, 2020, and compared between patients with normal and abnormal aminotransferases. RESULTS: Abnormal aminotransferase levels were observed in 362 patients (41.1%), of which 94 out of 130 (72.3%) and 268 out of 744 (36.0%) belonged to the severe and non-severe COVID-19 categories, respectively. The odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for male patients, patients with a higher body mass index, patients with severe COVID-19 status, and patients with lower platelet counts were 1.500 (1.029 to 2.184, p=0.035), 1.097 (1.012 to 1.189, p=0.024), 2.377 (1.458 to 3.875, p=0.001), and 0.995 (0.993 to 0.998, p>0.001), respectively, indicating an independent association of these variables with elevated aminotransferase levels. Lopinavir/ritonavir and antibiotic use increased the odds ratio of abnormal aminotransferase levels after admission (1.832 and 2.646, respectively, both p<0.05). The median time to release from quarantine was longer (22 days vs 26 days, p=0.001) and the mortality rate was higher (13.0% vs 2.9%, p<0.001) in patients with abnormal aminotransferase levels. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal aminotransferase levels are common in COVID-19 patients and are associated with poor clinical outcomes.

Clinical Case: A 60 year old woman with newly diagnosed breast cancer presented for workup of an adrenal mass found on PET scan. An abdominal contrast CT-scan demonstrated a left 3.2 cm indeterminant adrenal mass. Initial laboratory testing demonstrated positive 24 hour urine metanephrines (metanephrine 951 mcg/24hr, n < 400 mcg/24hr for HTN and normetanephrine 1302 mcg/24hr, n < 900 mcg/24h for HTN) and plasma metanephrines (normetanephrine 826 pg/mL, n < 145 pg/mL and metanephrine 391 pg/mL, n < 62 pgmL), suggestive of pheochromocytoma. An MIBG scintigraphy showed tracer uptake in the left adrenal gland, suspicious for pheochromocytoma. The patient was started on alpha then beta blockade with plan for removal, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, surgery was delayed. In the interim, breast cancer therapy was adjusted to avoid complications or symptoms from the possible pheochromocytoma. The patient had always been asymptomatic, even during the physical and emotional stress of cancer and chemotherapy. She only had a diagnosis of uncontrolled hypertension for four years prior to presentation, treated with Valsartan-Hydrochlorothiazide, with average systolic BP of 140C180, and diastolic BP of 80C100. With the addition of Doxazosin and Metoprolol, the patients BP improved, with all readings < 120/90. A left adrenalectomy was performed nearly six months after initial presentation, with final pathology report demonstrating moderately differentiated pheochromocytoma, with clean surgical margins. The patient remained hypertensive for months after the procedure, with initial systolic (SBP) readings of 150C160, and diastolic (DBP) readings of 90C100. However, follow up plasma metanephrine levels were normal (normetanephrine 165 pg/mL n < 191.8 pg/mL and metanephrine 22.1 pg/mL n < 88 pg/mL).

We performed a meta-analysis to assess the impact of IL-6 inhibition on mortality from COVID-19, utilising meta-regression to explore differences in study results. METHODS: Systematic database searches were performed to identify RCTs comparing IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab and sarilumab) to placebo or standard of care in adults with COVID-19. Meta-analysis was used to estimate the relative risk of mortality at 28 days between arms, expressed as a risk ratio. Within-study mortality rates were compared, and meta-regression was used to investigate treatment effect modification. RESULTS: Data from nine RCTs were included. The combined mortality rate across studies was 19% (95% CI: 18, 20%), ranging from 2% to 31%. The overall risk ratio for 28-day mortality was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.99), in favour of benefit for IL-6 inhibition over placebo or standard of care, with low treatment effect heterogeneity: I2 0% (95% CI: 0, 53%). Meta-regression showed no evidence of treatment effect modification by patient characteristics.

The purpose of this study is to assess the willingness of nurses to participate in the fight against COVID-19 in China and to identify factors associated therewith. This cross-sectional study examines nurses working in 11 Chinese cities including Macau, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Dongguan, Huizhou, Guangzhou, Zhaoqing, Foshan, Jiangmen, Zhongshan, and Zhuhai. Questionnaires were collected from 19 May to 7 August 2020. A total of 8065 questionnaires were received, of which 8030 valid questionnaires were included for analysis. A total of 53.4% of participants reported that they had signed up to support the COVID-19 pandemic response. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that being single (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.60C0.87), having no children (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.68C0.97), possessing higher professional qualifications (OR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.14C1.37), having a more prestigious professional title (OR = 1.68, 95%CI: 1.50C1.90), being an administrative supervisor (OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.45C0.63), having a higher caring dimensions inventory score (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.01C1.01), working in a hospital (OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.39C0.72), and receiving employer-provided care training (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.68C0.87) were predictive of nurses willingness to participate in the fight against COVID-19.

METHODS We undertook a systematic search of multiple databases for studies that ascertained an association between serum lipids and suicidality in adult patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (18-65 years) from database inception to 2nd September 2020. Qualitative analysis was done using National Institute of Health (NIH) scales. The Standard Mean Difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each study and standardized relative to the study. Adjusted p-value, Z-test, and heterogeneity were calculated, as well as testing for publication bias. RESULTS Of 1262 records identified, 17 studies (n= 3113) were included in our systematic review, while 11 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The majority of studies (11) rated fair on qualitative analysis. Data from seven studies (n= 1597) revealed a medium effect size for an association between low total cholesterol and suicide attempts (SMD -0.560; 95% CI - 0.949 - 0.170; p =0.005). People with history of suicide attempt had a mean cholesterol value 0.56 SD lower than the mean in those without suicide attempts. There were differences in how a suicide attempt was defined and there was high heterogeneity (I2 = 83.3%). No significant association was found between any of the serum lipid parameters and suicide ideation. Funnel-plot analysis suggested small study effects with publication bias.

In this study, a binary ML classifier is formulated that was trained and tested on 1720 peptide examples. The support vector machine classifier uses Kidera factors to categorize peptides into one of two groups based on their binding ability. The classifier exhibits satisfactory performance, as demonstrated by various performance metrics. In addition, key variables that bear a huge impact on the model were identified, such as peptide hydrophobicity.

The Medical Genetics Clinic at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Waisman Center (WCMGC) rapidly transitioned to offering appointments using telemedicine in March 2020 when the public health emergency for COVID-19 pandemic was declared. METHODS Datasets were reviewed for the periods April - July 2019 (pre-COVID baseline) and April - July 2020 (COVID project data). Patient schedules were accessed to determine the number of appointments kept, no-shows, and late cancellations. A telephone survey was utilized to assess patient satisfaction with telemedicine. RESULTS Fewer appointments were missed and providers completed more clinic visits after transitioning to telemedicine. Patients and their families were equally satisfied with care received and were amenable to telemedicine use in the future. Telemedicine allowed WCMGC to continue serving patients during a period of restricted on-site services, suggesting its continuation would improve access to genetic services.","output":"Rapid Transition to Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Medical Genetics Experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Pfizer/BioNtech BNT162b2 is a major vaccine used in the Australian COVID-19 immunisation programme.

A total of 243 adverse events following immunisation (0.42% of total vaccine doses) were recorded in the immediate observation period post-vaccination, which were predominantly immunisation stress-related responses. Of the 110 patients who experienced an adverse event with their first dose of the vaccine, 90% returned for their second dose of the vaccine, with 87% not reporting any further adverse reaction with the subsequent dose. Nineteen (0.03% of total doses) people were reviewed for an allergic reaction, of which 10 (53%) reported a history of prior allergies. A female predominance was present in both total adverse reactions (70%) and allergic vaccine reactions (79%). Only two patients experienced anaphylaxis (0.003% of total doses), in keeping with low rates of adverse reactions to the BNT162b2 vaccine in the current literature.

How entrepreneurs learn may be transformed as digital technologies provide new spaces for learning, such as online communities. Online communities can gather thousands of participants and provide entrepreneurs with new opportunities for learning that are not limited by time, space, or social class. Yet, we know little about how entrepreneurs take advantage of the new digital opportunities of learning. To remedy this, we studied a large online community of entrepreneurs on Reddit (r/startups), where we qualitatively analyzed the top-voted 100 threads from 2018 to 2019 (10,277 comments in total). By drawing on coactive vicarious learning, a theory that describes how learning is socially constructed through discursive interactions, we outline how entrepreneurial learning is socially constructed through conversations, which are taking place in different micro-learning contexts. Through identifying distinct entrepreneurial learning conversations, we build new theory on entrepreneurial learning in online communities. Our theorizing contributes to (1) the growing research on how entrepreneurial learning is socially constructed in communities, (2) the current debate on knowledge creation in online communities, and (3) the knowledge on how coactive vicarious learning unfolds in communities. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: When entrepreneurs go online to learn, new research shows how online communities provide entrepreneurs with diverse learning spaces for developing ideas, learning new skills, and coping with the uncertainties of being an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs increasingly use social media for doing business, but can they also use it to learn about doing business? In this article, we investigate this question by studying an online community of entrepreneurs on Reddit called r/startups, in which entrepreneurs exchange experiences and help each other with questions and issues. We show that entrepreneurial learning is taking place in five forms of learning conversations, which are situated in four learning contexts that differ from each other, from a classroom with a studentCteacher dynamic, a collab space where entrepreneurs collect ideas and develop new skills and knowledge, a club context in which they challenge each other, and a care context in which they can bring their fears and uncertainties. Our findings show how entrepreneurship practitioners can make use of online communities, encouraging teaching and policy to pay more attention to how entrepreneurs work digitally.","output":"Entrepreneurial learning in online communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is a liquid, gel, or foam that contains ethanol or isopropanol used to disinfect hands. Hand hygiene is an important component of the U.S. response to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). If soap and water are not readily available, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products that contain at least 60% ethyl alcohol (ethanol) or 70% isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) in community settings (1); in health care settings, CDC recommendations specify that alcohol-based hand sanitizer products should contain 60%-95% alcohol (&#8805;60% ethanol or &#8805;70% isopropanol) (2). According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates alcohol-based hand sanitizers as an over-the-counter drug, methanol (methyl alcohol) is not an acceptable ingredient. Cases of ethanol toxicity following ingestion of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products have been reported in persons with alcohol use disorder (3,4). On June 30, 2020, CDC received notification from public health partners in Arizona and New Mexico of cases of methanol poisoning associated with ingestion of alcohol-based hand sanitizers. The case reports followed an FDA consumer alert issued on June 19, 2020, warning about specific hand sanitizers that contain methanol. Whereas early clinical effects of methanol and ethanol poisoning are similar (e.g., headache, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, and decreased level of consciousness), persons with methanol poisoning might develop severe anion-gap metabolic acidosis, seizures, and blindness. If left untreated methanol poisoning can be fatal (5). Survivors of methanol poisoning might have permanent visual impairment, including complete vision loss; data suggest that vision loss results from the direct toxic effect of formate, a toxic anion metabolite of methanol, on the optic nerve (6). CDC and state partners established a case definition of alcohol-based hand sanitizer-associated methanol poisoning and reviewed 62 poison center call records from May 1 through June 30, 2020, to characterize reported cases. Medical records were reviewed to abstract details missing from poison center call records. During this period, 15 adult patients met the case definition, including persons who were American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN). All had ingested an alcohol-based hand sanitizer and were subsequently admitted to a hospital. Four patients died and three were discharged with vision impairment. Persons should never ingest alcohol-based hand sanitizer, avoid use of specific imported products found to contain methanol, and continue to monitor FDA guidance (7). Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for methanol poisoning when evaluating adult or pediatric patients with reported swallowing of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer product or with symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings (e.g., elevated anion-gap metabolic acidosis) compatible with methanol poisoning. Treatment of methanol poisoning includes supportive care, correction of acidosis, administration of an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor (e.g., fomepizole), and frequently, hemodialysis.","output":"Serious Adverse Health Events, Including Death, Associated with Ingesting Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizers Containing Methanol - Arizona and New Mexico, May-June 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the novel coronavirus emerged in late December, 2019 in Wuhan, China, millions of people have been infected and thousands of patients have died.

The present study aimed to evaluate the involvement of the human endogenous retrovirus -W envelope (HERV-W ENV) in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection considering recent findings that HERVs are activated in response to infectious agents and lead to various immunopathological effects. We analysed HERV-W ENV expression in blood cells of COVID-19 patients in correlation with clinical characteristics and have discussed its potential role in the outcome of the disease. METHODS: We analysed HERV-W ENV expression in blood samples of COVID-19 patients and healthy donors by flow cytometry and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR analysis, and evaluated its correlation with clinical signs, inflammatory markers, cytokine expression, and disease progression. FINDINGS: HERV-W ENV was highly expressed in the leukocytes of COVID-19 patients but not in those of healthy donors. Its expression correlated with the markers of T-cell differentiation and exhaustion and blood cytokine levels. The percentage of HERV-W ENV-positive lymphocytes correlated with inflammatory markers and pneumonia severity in COVID-19 patients. Notably, HERV-W ENV expression reflects the respiratory outcome of patients during hospitalization. INTERPRETATION: Given the known immuno- and neuro-pathogenicity of HERV-W ENV protein, it could promote certain pathogenic features of COVID-19 and therefore serve as a biomarker to predict clinical progression of disease and open to further studies for therapeutic intervention.

OBJECTIVE: To report demographic and radiographic features along with macroscopic, microscopic, and microbiologic postmortem lung findings in patients with COVID-19 infections. DESIGN: Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection and postmortem examination (3/2020-5/2020) were included. Clinical findings were abstracted from medical records. Lungs were microscopically reviewed independently by 4 thoracic pathologists. Imaging studies were reviewed by a thoracic radiologist. RESULTS: Eight patients (7 men, 87.5%; median age of 79 years, range, 69-96) died within a median of 17 days (range, 6-100) from onset of symptoms. The median lung weight was 1,220 g (range, 960-1,760); consolidations were found in 5 of 8 (62.5%) patients; gross thromboemboli were noted in one of 8 (12.5%) patient. Histologically, all patients had acute bronchopneumonia, 6 of 8 (75%) patients had also DAD. Two of 8 (25%) patients had aspiration pneumonia in addition. Thromboemboli, usually scattered and rare, were identified in 5 of 8 (62.5%) patients in small vessels and in two of these patients also in pulmonary arteries.

With the number of cases rising we have reported the first possible implications of COVID-19 on panhypopituitarism in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Clinical Case: A 59-year-old man was referred to the Endocrinology Counseling Center on 12/10/2020. For 15 years he did not take thyroid and adrenal replacement therapy. As a child, he was treated for short stature, as well as his two sisters. He had signs and symptoms of myxedema. He was urgently hospitalized to the Department of Endocrinology. His condition has worsened in the last month, more intensely in the last 10 days. He complained of general weakness, malaise, drowsiness, shortness of breath, fatigue, constipation, swelling of the lower legs. The patient was enormously adipose and moved harder with help of a walking stick. The thyroid gland appeared smaller on palpation. Laboratory investigations showed low and borderline levels of the following hormones TSH 0.590 (0.3-4.2 mU/L), FT4 1.44 (12.0-22.0 pmol/L), FT3 0.858 (3.1-6.8 pmol/L), ACTH at 8 am 2.59, ACTH at 16 pm 8.44 (7.20-63.3 pg/ml), GH 0.090 (0.0-14.0), FSH <0.7 (1.6-9.7 IU/L), LH <0.7 (0.7-7.8 IU/L), prolactin <30.8 (78-380 uIU/ml), testosterone 1.01 (above 50 years 2.5-21.6 nmol/l), cortisol at 8 am 557, cortisol at 16 pm 674, cortisol at 11 pm 674 (morning: 123-626 nmol/L, afternoon 46-389 nmol/L), DHS 1.87 (2.17-11.7 nmol/L). On 12/10/2020 he tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. On 14/10/2020 his condition worsened. He was somnolent, and even though he was admitted to diuretic therapy, he had decreased urine output. His D-dimer was 3.93 (0-0.055 mcg/mL). CT findings of thoracic organs described cardiomegaly, atherosclerotic altered thoracic aorta, and changes in the pulmonary parenchyma on both sides. On 16/10/2020 the patient was transferred to the cardiology department. SARS-CoV-2 test was repeated, and it was positive. The patient exited due to pulmonary arrest on 17/10/2020.

C3H mice suffered severe lung infection with significant body weight reduction and died within 7 days after intranasal infection. Infectious viruses were isolated mainly from the lungs and trachea. Histopathological examination revealed interstitial pneumonia with monocytes infiltration. Following repeated intranasal infection, mice developed antibodies to particular structural and non-structural proteins of PRV. The results of these immunological assays will help to develop laboratory protocols for sero-epidemiological studies.

Respiratory infections are very common. They are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality and are costly in terms of lost time from work, inappropriate use of antibiotics, and lengthy hospital stays. Laboratory detection of causative agents can influence treatment and allow appropriate infection control measures, potentially saving time and money, promoting quicker recovery for the patient, and lowering the risk of nosocomial transmission of the organism. Molecular testing may be the most sensitive method of detecting respiratory viruses. These methods have been shown to detect multiple viruses in a single sample more often than any of the other methods described and, in addition, can detect viruses that are difficult or impossible to grow. The detection of nonviable organisms may provide additional insight into disease but provides its own challenges in terms of determining clinical significance of positive results.

However, one of the rare causes is periampullary or juxtapapillary duodenal diverticulum. Although duodenal diverticula are relatively common in the general population, the overwhelming majority are asymptomatic. Duodenal diverticula can cause combined pancreaticobiliary obstruction through multiple mechanisms such as stasis-induced primary choledocholithiasis, stasis-induced intradiverticular enterolith, or longstanding diverticulitis, causing stenosing fibrosing papillitis or a combination of more than one of these mechanisms. Herein, I report a case of Lemmel syndrome due to a combination of multiple mechanisms and review the available literature on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnostic work-up, and management of juxtapapillary duodenal diverticulum. PATIENT CONCERNS Multiple episodes of abdominal pain, jaundice, anorexia, fever, and significant unintentional weight loss.

However, there are few prospective studies evaluating the use of a direct aspiration first pass technique in distal vessel occlusions. This post hoc analysis of the PROMISE study examines the safety and effectiveness of the Penumbra System with the ACE68 and ACE64 Reperfusion Catheters for aspiration thrombectomy in the M1 and M2 segments of the middle cerebral artery. METHODS PROMISE is a prospective, multicenter study that enrolled 204 patients with anterior circulation LVO AIS-treated frontline with ACE68/ACE64 catheters. We compared clinical and angiographic outcomes, complications, and mortality in patients with M1 and M2 occlusions. The association of M1 and M2 location and functional independence or mTICI 2b-3 reperfusion was described in univariable and multivariable analyses. RESULTS One hundred sixty-one patients (124 M1 and 37 M2 locations) met the study criteria. Post procedure mTICI 2b-3 reperfusion (93% vs. 92%, p = 1.00), functional independence (57% vs. 70%, p = 0.18), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (1.6% vs. 2.7%, p = 0.55), device- or procedure-related serious adverse events at 30 days (4.0% vs. 8.1%, p = 0.39), and mortality at 90 days (6.6% vs. 2.7%, p = 0.69) were comparable between M1 and M2 occlusions.

Similar to CDI, patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) require early identification and isolation, appropriate personal protective equipment, and environmental disinfection to prevent further transmission. In light of this similarity between isolation and protective requirements to prevent transmission of these diseases, we aim to investigate whether there was a decrease in the incidence of CDI during the peak periods of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to historical rates. Methods This is a single-center retrospective analysis of the rates of CDI in our institution. COVID-19 time periods were identified from March 2020 to January 2021 and peak periods (with >50 active patients per day) were defined. The non-COVID-19 periods were July 2017 to February 2020. Rates of CDI were also directly compared across the yearly time period. CDI rates were presented in a per 1000 patient days format. Rates were analyzed per year and during the COVID-19 peaks at our institution. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare rates between two time periods, while differences across multiple time intervals were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results The median (interquartile range [IQR]) of CDI rates of infection per 1000 patient days for the non-COVID time period from July 2017 to February 2020 was 0.34 (0.23-0.45) while COVID time periods had higher 0.44 (0.25-0.51) rates of CDI although this was not statistically significant (p=0.224).

People with inflammatory arthritis (IA) are at a higher risk of mental health and psychosocial consequences of the pandemic compared with the general population, since they are potentially more vulnerable to COVID-19 and experience higher rates of existing comorbid mental health disorder. Furthermore, vulnerable patients were advised to self-isolate for 12 weeks, which could further exacerbate emotional distress. This study aimed to explore the impacts of lockdown on mental health and wellbeing, and to determine which factors were associated with worse disease outcomes. Methods An online questionnaire was completed by 338 participants in the UK with an IA condition between June and July 2020. The questionnaire, designed with input from a service user, assessed various aspects of the impact of the pandemic on the quality of life of people with IA, including their mental health. Self-reported visual analogue scales (VAS) for patient global assessment (PGA) of disease activity, pain, fatigue, and emotional distress were completed relating to the previous week, and retrospectively for pre-lockdown (March) and early-lockdown (April). Specific mental health outcomes were further captured using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ8) and the short UCLA loneliness scale. Linear regressions were conducted to determine mental health factors associated with worse outcomes on physical health measures (PGA, pain, and fatigue), controlling for fear of COVID-19 and COVID-19 status. Results Overall, 49% of participants met the PHQ8 criteria for moderate to severe depressive symptoms and 58% reported their mental health had worsened by more than 10 points on the emotional distress VAS during lockdown. Finally, 37% reported they were concerned about loneliness, with 26% indicating this had worsened during lockdown. Emotional distress VAS was significantly associated with PGA (b = 0.21, p< 0.01), pain (b = 0.24, p<0.01), and fatigue (b = 0.36, p<0.01). Similarly, depression was also associated with PGA (b = 0.95, p<0.01), pain (b = 0.92, p<0.01), and fatigue (b = 1.56, p<0.01). However, loneliness was not associated with any of the physical health VAS scores but was associated with the emotional distress VAS (b = 1.83, p=0.00). These results remained consistent for emotional distress, depression, and loneliness as predictors when accounting for fear of COVID-19 and COVID-19 status. Conclusion There has been a clear impact of the pandemic on the mental health of people with IA, and this should be taken into consideration by clinicians, especially as it appears to be related to worse overall reported physical health. The mixed results for loneliness in comparison to other mental health measures may illustrate the inter-relatedness of these aspects of mental and physical health, particularly in the context of lockdown.

Specifically we investigated pre-existing medical conditions, social isolation, financial stress and deprivation as a predictor for wellbeing and whether there were community level characteristics which protect against poorer wellbeing. Methods Using online survey responses from the COVID-19 modules of Understanding society, we linked 8379 English cases across five waves of data collection to location based deprivation statistics. We used ordinary least squares regression to estimate the association between deprivation, pre-existing conditions and socio-demographic factors and the change in well-being scores over time, as measured by the GHQ-12 questionnaire. Results A decline in wellbeing was observed at the beginning of the first lock down period at the beginning of March 2020. This was matched with a corresponding recovery between April and July as restrictions were gradually lifted. There was no association between the decline and deprivation, nor between deprivation and recovery. The strongest predictor of wellbeing during the lock down, was the baseline score, with the counterintuitive finding that for those will pre-existing poor wellbeing, the impact of pandemic restrictions on mental health were minimal, but for those who had previously felt well, the restrictions and the impact of the pandemic on well-being were much greater.

Analysis of qualitative student interviews reinforced these findings and provided further support for the importance of reliable technology during remote learning. ? 2021, North American Business Press.

To examine the safety profiles of these medications, we systematically evaluated the adverse events (AEs) of these medications from published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, and the ClinicalTrials.gov for all the RCTs comparing CQ or HCQ with placebo or other active agents, published before March 31, 2020. The random-effects or fixed-effects models were used to pool the risk estimates relative ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the outcomes. Results: The literature search yielded 23 and 17 studies for CQ and HCQ, respectively, that satisfied our inclusion criteria. Of these studies, we performed meta-analysis on the ones that were placebo-controlled, which included 6 studies for CQ and 14 studies for HCQ. We did not limit our analysis to published reports involving viral treatment alone; data also included the usage of either CQ or HCQ for the treatment of other diseases. The trials for the CQ consisted of a total of 2,137 participants (n=1,077 CQ, n=1,060 placebo), while the trials for HCQ involved 1,096 participants (n=558 HCQ and n=538 placebo). The overall mild or total AEs were statistically higher comparing CQ or HCQ to placebo. The AEs were further categorized into four groups and analyses revealed that neurologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and ophthalmic AEs were higher in participants taking CQ compared to placebo. Although this was not evident in HCQ treated groups, further analyses suggested that there were more AEs attributed to other organ system that were not included in the categorized meta-analyses. Additionally, meta-regression analyses revealed that total AEs was affected by dosage for the CQ group. Conclusions: Taken together, we found that participants taking either CQ or HCQ have more AEs than participants taking placebo. Precautionary measures should be taken when using these drugs to treat COVID-19.","output":"Assessment of Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine Safety Profiles: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid\\\\19 pandemic has fundamentally reshaped our lives.

Although much has improved in the field of equine anaesthesia in recent years, we are still far from reducing anaesthetic-related mortality in this species in comparison with small animal anaesthesia. The aim of this multicentre study was to probe the usefulness of an internet-based method that utilised an electronic questionnaire and statistical software to show the data and report outcomes from horses undergoing general anaesthesia and certain procedures using standing sedation. Within six months, 8656 cases from 69 centres were collected: 6701 procedures under general anaesthesia and 1955 under standing sedation. The results demonstrated (i) the utility of the method and (ii) that some horses died unexpectedly when undergoing not only general anaesthesia, but also standing sedation. Finally, (iii) we present some descriptive data that outline the current anaesthesia practice compared with the previous CEPEF2. We concluded that our internet-based method is suitable for this type of study. New techniques may reduce the mortality rate. However, the results presented here should be interpreted cautiously as these are only preliminary data with lower numbers than CEPEF2. ABSTRACT: It is almost 20 years since the largest observational, multicentre study evaluating the risks of mortality associated with general anaesthesia in horses. We proposed an internet-based method to collect data (cleaned and analysed with R) in a multicentre, cohort, observational, analytical, longitudinal and prospective study to evaluate peri-operative equine mortality. The objective was to report the usefulness of the method, illustrated with the preliminary data, including outcomes for horses seven days after undergoing general anaesthesia and certain procedures using standing sedation. Within six months, data from 6701 procedures under general anaesthesia and 1955 standing sedations from 69 centres were collected. The results showed (i) the utility of the method; also, that (ii) the overall mortality rate for general anaesthesia within the seven-day outcome period was 1.0%. In horses undergoing procedures other than exploratory laparotomy for colic (noncolics), the rate was lower, 0.6%, and in colics it was higher, at 3.4%. For standing sedations, the overall mortality rate was 0.2%. Finally, (iii) we present some descriptive data that demonstrate new developments since the previous CEPEF2. In conclusion, horses clearly still die unexpectedly when undergoing procedures under general anaesthesia or standing sedation. Our method is suitable for case collection for future studies.","output":"Data Collection for the Fourth Multicentre Confidential Enquiry into Perioperative Equine Fatalities (CEPEF4) Study: New Technology and Preliminary Results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Helicases are motor proteins that use the free energy of NTP hydrolysis to catalyze the unwinding of duplex nucleic acids.

Self-retaining barbed suture devices have been tested for a variety of surgical applications. With the exception of clinical reports and various experimental studies on enterotomy, little has been published so far on the use of barbed suture for end-to-end intestinal anastomoses. The aim of the study was to compare two different barbed suture materials for end-to-end jejuno-jejunal anastomosis in pigs. End-to-end jejuno-jejunal anastomosis were performed with unidirectional barbed (A group), bidirectional barbed (B group) or normal (C group) sutures in each animal. A comparison was then made between the groups based on adhesions scoring, suturing time, bursting pressure and histopathology. RESULTS Mean construction times in the A group (518  40 s) and in the B group (487  45 s) were significantly lower than in the C group (587  63 s) but were not different between A and B group (P = 0.10). Mean bursting pressures were significantly higher in the intact intestine (197  13 mmHg) than in any other group (group A 150  16 mmHg, group B 145  22 mmHg, group C 145  24 mmHg). Among anastomotic techniques, the bursting pressures were not significantly different. Histologically no difference could be detected in the grade of inflammation, collagen deposition and neovascularization at the anastomotic sites. CONCLUSIONS Barbed sutures can be effectively used for handsewn end-to-end jejunojejunal anastomosis in pigs.

Given language barriers, patients with limited English proficiency present a unique set of challenges in integrating telehealth and ensuring equity. Using data from 84,419 respondents in the 2015-18 California Health Interview Survey, we assessed the association between limited English proficiency and telehealth use (telephone and video visits) and evaluated the impact of telehealth use on health care access and use. We found that patients with limited English proficiency had lower rates of telehealth use (4.8 percent versus 12.3 percent) compared with proficient English speakers. In weighted multivariable logistic regression, patients with limited English proficiency still had about half the odds of using telehealth. Telehealth use was associated with increased emergency department use for all patients.

The need for more agile structures and more efficient mechanisms to transfer globally dispersed knowledge are two key enablers in this evolution. With increased interest, this paper offers the first systematic, integrative review of 100 articles on FGWAs. The review indicates that these forms of global work appear to be a somewhat overlooked double-edged sword in that they may confer significant but unrealised value for MNEs alongside hidden, adverse consequences for individuals. Notable was the lack of insight into the HR function's input or oversight at either a strategic or operational level. We find that there is a distinct lack of strategic linkages to global mobility and/or HR functions. We propose a research agenda that centres on better understanding the international HR function's role and responsibility in providing a more strategic and sustainable perspective of these increasingly common FGWAs alongside virtual work.

The COVID-19 global pandemic has necessitated increased use of telehealth, but one limitation of telehealth is the inability to collect respiratory specimens. We initiated a protocol for at-home collection of oropharyngeal (OP) swabs from children with CF. METHODS: Home respiratory specimen collection was offered during telehealth encounters. Home OP swab kits were sent to participating families via mail with instructions for collection and return. Specimens were returned by overnight shipping or dropped off at a hospital lab for processing and culture. We evaluated demographic data and compared culture results from the home-collected specimen to the most recent specimen collected in clinic. We also tracked the frequency of newly identified Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS: Home OP swab kits were sent to families of 33 children with CF (range 1.5-19 years). OP swab kits were successfully returned from 19 children (range 1.5-19 years). One or more CF pathogens grew from 79% of the specimens. For four individuals, the home collected specimen demonstrated the new growth of P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Home collection of OP swabs for bacterial culture is feasible in children with CF across a range of ages. Most home-collected specimens demonstrated growth of one or more CF pathogens and results were similar to recent in-clinic specimens, suggesting acceptable sample collection technique.

In this study, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, class II T cell epitopes of HPV16-E7 were predicted. Therefore, we designed a plan to find the most effective peptides to prompt appropriate immune responses. For this purpose, retrieving protein sequences, conserved region identification, phylogenic tree construction, T cell epitope prediction, epitope-predicted population coverage calculation, and molecular docking were performed consecutively and most effective immune response prompting peptides were selected. Based on different tools index, six CD8+ T cells and six CD4+ epitopes were chosen. This combination of 12 epitopes created a putative global vaccine with a 95.06% population coverage.

Patients severely affected with COVID-19 present distinct clinical features, including acute respiratory disorder, neutrophilia, cytokine storm, and sepsis. In addition, multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines are found in the plasma of such patients. Transcriptome sequencing of different specimens obtained from patients suffering from severe episodes of COVID-19 shows dynamics in terms of their immune responses. However, those host factors required for SARS-CoV-2 propagation and the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for dysfunctional immune responses during COVID-19 infection remain elusive. In the present study, we analyzed the mRNA-long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) co-expression network derived from publicly available SARS-CoV-2-infected transcriptome data of human lung epithelial cell lines and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients. Through co-expression network analysis, we identified four differentially expressed lncRNAs strongly correlated with genes involved in various immune-related pathways crucial for cytokine signaling. Our findings suggest that the aberrant expression of these four lncRNAs can be associated with cytokine storms and anti-viral responses during severe SARS-CoV-2 infection of the lungs. Thus, the present study uncovers molecular interactions behind the cytokine storm activation potentially responsible for hyper-inflammatory responses in critical COVID-19 patients.","output":"mRNA-lncRNA Co-Expression Network Analysis Reveals the Role of lncRNAs in Immune Dysfunction during Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The challenge in treating severe COVID-19 in the absence of targeted medication is enforcing physicians to search carefully for clinical predictors of severity.

Current clinical studies have interpreted that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the host receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In addition, ACE2 is the major component of the renin-angiotensin system. ACE2 deteriorates angiotensin II, a peptide that is responsible for the promotion of stroke. The downregulation of ACE2 further activates an immunological cascade. Thus, researchers need to explore and examine the possible links between COVID-19 and ischemic stroke (IS). Human ACE2 expression level and pattern in various tissues might be decisive for the vulnerability, symptoms, and treatment outcomes of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The swift increase in the knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 has given creditable evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infected patients also encounter neurological deficits. As the SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, it will hamper the activity of ACE2 in providing neuroprotection, especially in the case of stroke patients. Due to the downregulation of ACE2, the inflammatory response is activated in the ischemic penumbra. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people with various pre-existing diseases, including IS, in such a way that these patients need special care and attention for their survival. Several clinical trials are currently ongoing worldwide as well as many other projects are in different stages of conceptualization and planning to facilitate the effective management of stroke patients with COVID-19 infection.","output":"Cross-Talk Between Key Players in Patients with COVID-19 and Ischemic Stroke: A Review on Neurobiological Insight of the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remote learning and shelter\\\\in\\\\place orders during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic are associated with obesity risk factors such as decreased physical activity, altered routines and sleep schedules, increased screen time, and non\\\\nutritious food choices.

METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Observational studies that investigated the survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy after curative resection in elderly patients (age &#8805; 70 years) with colon or rectal cancer were included. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate and OS were assessed. Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool. RESULTS: Eleven studies in elderly patients with colon cancer were included.

Despite favorable safety data, serious adverse events have been described. However, central nervous system complications such as encephalitis have rarely been reported. We present the case of a 70-year-old woman with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver cirrhosis and advanced HCC who developed severe encephalitis after only one cycle of atezolizumab/bevacizumab. PATIENT CONCERNS: Ten days after administration, the patient presented with confusion, somnolence, and emesis. Within a few days, the patient's condition deteriorated, and mechanical ventilation became necessary. DIAGNOSIS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed increased cell count and elevated protein values. Further work-up revealed no signs of an infectious, paraneoplastic, or other autoimmune cause. INTERVENTION: Suspecting an atezolizumab/bevacizumab-related encephalitis, we initiated a high-dose steroid pulse therapy as well as repeated plasmapheresis, which resulted in clinical improvement and remission of CSF abnormalities.

The analysis showed that most parents rated home education positively. However, almost a third of the parents gave a negative evaluation, which was mainly related to concerns about the child's school success and feelings of uncertainty resulting from communication with the school.

The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) previously made available a tool for validating and annotating influenza virus sequences that is used to check submissions to GenBank. Before this project, there was no analogous tool in use for non-influenza viral sequence submissions. We developed a system called VADR (Viral Annotation DefineR) that validates and annotates viral sequences in GenBank submissions. The annotation system is based on the analysis of the input nucleotide sequence using models built from curated RefSeqs. Hidden Markov models are used to classify sequences by determining the RefSeq they are most similar to, and feature annotation from the RefSeq is mapped based on a nucleotide alignment of the full sequence to a covariance model. Predicted proteins encoded by the sequence are validated with nucleotide-to-protein alignments using BLAST. The system identifies 43 types of alerts that (unlike the previous BLAST-based system) provide deterministic and rigorous feedback to researchers who submit sequences with unexpected characteristics. VADR has been integrated into GenBanks submission processing pipeline allowing for viral submissions passing all tests to be accepted and annotated automatically, without the need for any human (GenBank indexer) intervention. Unlike the previous submission-checking system, VADR is freely available (https://github.com/nawrockie/vadr) for local installation and use. VADR has been used for Norovirus submissions since May 2018 and for Dengue virus submissions since January 2019. Other viruses with high numbers of submissions will be added incrementally. VADR improves the speed with which non-flu virus submissions to GenBank can be checked and improves the content and quality of the GenBank annotations. The availability and portability of the software allow researchers to run the GenBank checks prior to submitting their viral sequences, and thereby gain confidence that their submissions will be accepted immediately without the need to correspond with GenBank staff. Reciprocally, the adoption of VADR frees GenBank staff to spend more time on services other than checking routine viral sequence submissions.","output":"VADR: validation and annotation of virus sequence submissions to GenBank"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemi COVID-19 menyebabkan kegiatan pariwisata berkurang secara drastis dan berdampak pada perekonomian. Dengan adanya konsep new normal, pemerintah kembali membuka kegiatan pariwisata dengan melaksanakan protokol kesehatan yang ketat. Kebijakan ini juga diberlakukan di Kabupaten Padang Pariaman. Akan tetapi, perlu kebijakan yang jelas untuk setiap jenis industri yang berkaitan dengan kepariwisataan karena potensi penularannya berbeda tergantung dari kegiatan yang dilaksanakan. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengkaji pencegahan penyebaran pandemi COVID-19 pada sektor pariwisata khususnya di Kabupaten Padang Pariaman Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa telah ada regulasi dari pemerintah mengenai penerapan protokol kesehatan pada kegiatan pariwisata, namun pada pelaksanaan di lapangan, belum ada kontrol yang jelas sehingga masih memungkinkan terjadinya potensi penularan COVID-19. Dengan adanya peraturan Adaptasi Kebiasaan Baru, diharapkan semua masyarakat khususnya pelaku wisata memahami dan mengaplikasikan protokol kesehatan lebih baik lagi, untuk mengurangi potensi penularan COVID-19 di sektor pariwisata. Kata kunci: Pariwisata, New normal, COVID-19, Adaptasi Kebiasaan Baru The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically reduced tourism activities and has significant impact on the economy. With the new normal concept, the government has re-opened tourism activities by implementing strict health protocols. This policy is also enforced in Padang Pariaman Regency. However, it is necessary to have clear guidelines for each type of tourism industry related to tourism because the potential for transmission is different depending on the activities carried out. This study aims to examine the handling and prevention of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the tourism sector, especially in Padang Pariaman Regency. The results show that there are regulations from the government regarding the application of health protocols in tourism activities. However, there is no direct control in its implementation, so that is still possible for potential transmission of COVID-19. With the existence of the New Habit Adaptation regulation, it is expected that all people, and especially tourism actors, will understand and apply better health protocols to reduce the potential for COVID-19 transmission in the tourism sector.

This systematic review and meta-analysis examine available evidence for accuracy of laryngeal ultrasound in diagnosing vocal cord immobility in infants and children after surgery and trauma affecting the vocal cords. DESIGN Medical subject heading terms were used to search MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for relevant citations. Publications from January 1, 2000, to June 30, 2020 were included in the search strategy. Study inclusion criteria consisted of randomized control trials and nonrandomized retrospective or prospective observational studies where vocal cord motion was evaluated by laryngeal ultrasound and compared with a reference test. Studies were excluded if there was insufficient data to compute a sensitivity/specificity table. Case reports, case series less than 10, and manuscripts not published in English were also excluded. PATIENTS Studies which included subjects younger than or equal to 18 years were considered for full article review. SETTINGS No restrictions on study settings were imposed in this systematic review. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The initial search returned 1,357 citations. After de-duplication, abstract, and full review, eight citations were included in the final meta-analysis. A bivariate random-effects meta-analysis was performed, which revealed a pooled sensitivity for laryngeal ultrasound in detecting vocal cord immobility of 91% (95% CI, 83-95%), specificity of 97% (95% CI, 82-100%), diagnostic odds ratio 333.56 (95% CI, 34.00-3,248.71), positive likelihood ratio 31.58 (95% CI, 4.50-222.05), and negative likelihood ratio 0.09 (95% CI, 0.05-0.19).

We are undertaking the ComeBACK (Coaching and Exercise for Better Walking) study, a 3-arm hybrid Type 1 randomised controlled trial evaluating a health coaching intervention and a text messaging intervention. We used an implementation planning framework, the PRACTical planning for Implementation and Scale-up (PRACTIS), to guide the process evaluation for the trial. The aim of this paper is to describe the protocol for the process evaluation of the ComeBACK trial using the framework of the PRACTIS guide. METHODS: A mixed methods process evaluation protocol was developed informed by the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance on process evaluations for complex interventions and the PRACTIS guide. Quantitative data, including participant questionnaires, health coach and administrative logbooks, and website and text message usage data, is being collected over the trial period. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups with trial participants, health coaches and health service stakeholders will explore expectations, factors influencing the delivery of the ComeBACK interventions and potential scalability within existing health services. These data will be mapped against the steps of the PRACTIS guide, with reporting at the level of the individual, provider, organisational and community/systems. Quantitative and qualitative data will elicit potential contextual barriers and facilitators to implementation and scale-up. Quantitative data will be reported descriptively, and qualitative data analysed thematically. DISCUSSION: This process evaluation integrates an evaluation of prospective implementation and scale-up. It is envisaged this will inform barriers and enablers to future delivery, implementation and scale-up of physical activity interventions. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to describe the application of PRACTIS to guide the process evaluation of physical activity interventions.

This study aimed to investigate the spatial distribution of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths from COVID-19 and its association with social vulnerability. METHODS: An ecological study was conducted in 81 urban regions (UR) of Juiz de Fora from March to November 2020. Exposure was measured using the Health Vulnerability Index (HVI), a synthetic indicator that combines socioeconomic and environmental variables from the Demographic Census 2010. Regression models were estimated for counting data with overdispersion (negative binomial generalized linear model) using Bayesian methods, with observed frequencies as the outcome, expected frequencies as the offset variable, and HVI as the explanatory variable. Unstructured random-effects (to capture the effect of unmeasured factors) and spatially structured effects (to capture the spatial correlation between observations) were included in the models. The models were estimated for the entire period and quarter. RESULTS: There were 30,071 suspected cases, 8,063 confirmed cases, 1,186 hospitalizations, and 376 COVID-19 deaths. In the second quarter of the epidemic, compared to the low vulnerability URs, the high vulnerability URs had a lower risk of confirmed cases (RR=0.61; CI95% 0.49-0.76) and a higher risk of hospitalizations (RR=1.65; CI95% 1.23-2.22) and deaths (RR=1.73; CI95% 1.08-2.75). CONCLUSIONS: The lower risk of confirmed cases in the most vulnerable UR probably reflected lower access to confirmatory tests, while the higher risk of hospitalizations and deaths must have been related to the greater severity of the epidemic in the citys poorest regions.","output":"COVID-19's intra-urban inequalities and social vulnerability in a medium-sized city"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives To describe the use and findings of cardiopulmonary imaging - chest X-ray (cX-ray), echocardiography (cEcho), chest CT (cCT), lung ultrasound (LUS)) and/or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) - in COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in Latin America (LATAM) Background The SARS-Cov-2 is one of the largest and most active threats to healthcare in living memory. There is an information gap on imaging services resources (ISR) used and their findings during the pandemic in LATAM. Methods This was a multicenter, prospective, observational study of COVID-19 inpatients conducted from March to December 2020 from 12 high-complexity centers in nine LATAM countries. Adults (> 18 yrs) with at least one imaging modality performed, followed from admission until discharge and/or in-hospital death, were included. Results We studied 1435 hospitalized patients (64% males) with a median age of 58 years classified into three regions: 262 from Mexico (Mx), 428 from Central America and Caribbean (CAC), and 745 from South America (SAm). More frequent comorbidities were overweight/obesity (61%), hypertension (45%), and diabetes (27%). During hospitalization, 58% were admitted to ICU. The in-hospital mortality was 28% (95%CI 25-30) highest in Mx (37%). The most frequent cardiopulmonary imaging performed were cCT (61%)-more frequent in Mx and SAm-, and cX-ray (46%) -significantly used in CAC-. The cEcho was carried out in 18%, similarly among regions, and LUS in 7%, more frequently in Mx. The cMRI was performed in only one patient in the cohort. Abnormal findings on the cX-ray were related to peripheral (63%) or basal infiltrates (52%), and in cCT with ground glass infiltrates (89%). Both were more commonly in Mx. In LUS, interstitial syndrome (56%) was the most related abnormal finding, predominantly in Mx and CAC.

Five randomized trials of catheter-based interventional treatment of stroke with special stents were published in 2015. METHODS Recently published randomized trials of mechanical thrombectomy are selectively reviewed. RESULTS These trials documented the clinical efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in the treatment of occlusion of a major cerebral artery in the distribution of the internal carotid artery (evidence level 1a, recommendation grade A). Roughly 4-10% of all stroke patients could benefit from such an intervention. In the trials, 85% of the patients were first treated with IV-tPA. A recanalization of the occluded vessel was achieved by MT in 59-88% of patients. The percentage of patients with no deficit or only a mild deficit was 33-71% among those who received the intervention, compared to 19-40% in the control groups. The trial data indicate that MT is effective for elderly patients as well (age over 80). Thrombectomy did not increase the rate of secondary, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.

To understand this process, we assess data from dengue national and municipal basins regarding population and demographics, transportation network, human mobility, and Ae. aegypti monitoring for the Brazilian state of Acre since the first recorded dengue case in the year 2000 to the year 2015. During this period, several changes in Acres transport infrastructure and urbanization have been started. To reconstruct the process of dengue introduction in Acre, we propose an analytic framework based on concepts used in malaria literature, namely vulnerability and receptivity, to inform risk assessments in dengue-free regions as well as network theory concepts for disease invasion and propagation. We calculate the probability of dengue importation to Acre from other Brazilian states, the evolution of dengue spread between Acrean municipalities and dengue establishment in the state. Our findings suggest that the landscape changes associated with human mobility have created favorable conditions for the establishment of dengue virus transmission in Acre. The revitalization of its major roads, as well as the increased accessibility by air to and within the state, have increased dengue vulnerability. Unplanned urbanization and population growth, as observed in Acre during the period of study, contribute to ideal conditions for Ae. aegypti mosquito establishment, increase the difficulty in mosquito control and consequently its local receptivity.","output":"The introduction of dengue follows transportation infrastructure changes in the state of Acre, Brazil: A network-based analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Explanations for the brain size increments through primate and, particularly, human evolution are numerous.

This study aimed to test the influence of daily movement on primates' brain sizes, controlling for these other behavioral and ecological factors. We used a large comparative dataset of extant primate species and phylogenetic comparative methods. Our results show a significant correlation between daily movement and brain mass, which is not explained by the influence of diet, social group size, HR, or body mass. Hence, from an evolutionary timescale, a longer daily movement distance is not a constraining factor for the energetic investment in a larger brain.

We sought to determine whether the CVD health needs of Pacific people vary according to their ethnicity or place of birth. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of medical research databases and grey literature to identify relevant data published up to 2020. Texts were included if they contained original data stratified by Pacific-specific ethnicity or place of birth on the burden or management of CVD, and were assessed as having good quality using a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute quality assessment tool. The protocol for this review was registered with the Open Science Forum ( https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/X7NR6 ). RESULTS Of 3679 texts identified, 310 full texts were reviewed and the quality of 23 of these assessed, using the pre-defined search strategy. Six items (four reports, one article, one webpage) of good quality met the review eligibility criteria. All included texts provided data on epidemiology but only one reported on the management of CVD. Four texts were of Pacific populations in Pacific Island countries and two were of Pacific diaspora in other countries. Data from the Global Burden of Disease study, which provided estimates for the greatest number of Pacific countries, showed substantial differences in mortality rates between Pacific countries for every CVD type. For example, the mortality rate per 100,000 for ischemic heart disease (IHD) ranged from 103.41 in the Cook Islands to 430.35 in the Solomon Islands.

In the majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the alveolar space was persistently enriched in T cells and monocytes. Bulk and single-cell transcriptomic profiling suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infects alveolar macrophages, which in turn respond by producing T cell chemoattractants.

After nearly 2 months efforts by the Chinese government and people from all walks of life, the epidemic in China has gradually been controlled. The awareness of the disease has gradually increased. We have detected the SARS-CoV-2 gene in the patient's sputum, throat swabs and feces, blood and even urine samples, but whether the SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and the extrapulmonary age is unknown. Methods: We collected data from 146 patients admitted to the Public Health Center of Taizhou Hospital, Zhejiang University, China from January 23, 2020 to March 11, 2020, and confirmed the diagnosis of new-type coronavirus pneumonia by RT-PCR. The final selection was made after screening. For a total of 134 confirmed patients, we collected their clinical data and sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs or throat swabs, fecal nucleic acid test results, and calculated the age of each specimen. Results: A total of 134 confirmed patients were included in the study;of them, 93 were of the common type, and 41 were critically ill. There were no significant differences between males and females, P = 0.853) and their epidemiological history ( P = 0.441). The average age of severe patients was 55.85  13.28 years, which was higher than that of common patients at 44.06  12.86 years ( P = 0.00). The results showed that the time of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper respiratory tract was 15.1  7.23 days for common patients and 20.56  6.59 days for severe patients, which was longer than that of common patients ( P = 0.00). The time of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the lower respiratory tract was 27.45  10.06 days for common patients and 29.78  10.11 days for severe patients. There was no statistical difference ( P = 0.328);SARS-CoV-2 RNA existed in the digestive tract. The time was 22.6  7.69 days for common patients and 27.24  7.86 days for severe patients, which was longer than that of common patients ( P = 0.01). SARS-CoV-2 existed for a shorter time in the upper respiratory and digestive tracts than in the lower respiratory tract. CONCLUSION : SARS-CoV-2 is present in the lower respiratory tract for longer than the upper respiratory and digestive tracts, and there were no statistical differences in the lower respiratory tract between common and severe patients.","output":"Study on the Age of SARS-CoV-2 in Respiratory and Digestive Tract Samples: A Retrospective Study guixian-wu1,dongqin-lv*,susu-He,qian-chen,lin-ling,shaungquan-yan,xiaomai-wu,yongpo-jiang"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intracellular bacterial pathogens have evolved sophisticated infection strategies, including the release and secretion of virulence factors to interfere with host cell functions and to perturb immune responses. For Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), the type III secretion systems encoded on Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPI) 1 and 2 mediates invasion of the bacterium into innate immune cells and regulates bacterial replication and survival within the hostile environment of the host, respectively. Here, we explore the temporal and strain-specific dual perspective response of both the host and pathogen during cellular infection via quantitative proteomics. We report time- and pathogenicity island-specific expression and secretion of infection-associated proteins (i.e., SL1344_1263, SL1344_3112, SL1344_1563, and YnhG) and regulated immune response proteins in macrophage, including Cd86, Cd40, Casp4, C3, IL-1, and Cd69). Through intracellular macrophage and in vivo murine models of infection, we reveal a role in virulence for three of the bacterial proteins (SL1344_1263, SL1344_1563, and YnhG), defining their importance as novel T3SS effectors. We characterize the temporal intra- and extracellular production of the effectors and identify their interaction networks in host cells, representing inhibitory and stimulatory pathways mounted by invading bacterial pathogens. Author Summary The relationship between a host and pathogen is intricate, and regulation of the host immune response correlates with the progressive timing of infection and tailored responses to the pathogen. Relying on detection and quantification of protein-level changes using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we explore the production of known and novel effectors by Salmonella during intracellular survival within macrophage. Our results portray a role for these effectors in bacterial virulence using an in vivo murine model of infection, and we define a dynamic network of interaction between the effectors and host proteins. These interactions reveal opportunity for drug design to disrupt modulation of the host by the invading bacterium as a new strategy for combatting infection. Our approach is dynamic and universal, with the power to alter therapeutic discovery against infectious diseases.","output":"Dual perspective proteomics infectome profiling discovers Salmonella type III secretion system effector functions in macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectivesIn December 2020, an unprecedented vaccination programme to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic was initiated worldwide. However, the vaccine provision is currently insufficient for most countries to vaccinate their entire eligible population, so it is essential to develop the most efficient vaccination strategies. COVID-19 disease severity and mortality vary by age, therefore age-dependent vaccination strategies must be developed. Study design/MethodsHere, we use an age-dependent SIERS (susceptible-infected-exposed-recovered-susceptible) deterministic model to compare four hypothetical age-dependent vaccination strategies and their potential impact on the COVID-19 epidemic in Kyrgyzstan. ResultsOver the short-term (until March 2022), a vaccination rollout strategy focussed on high-risk groups (aged >50 years) with some vaccination among high-incidence groups (aged 20-49 years) may decrease symptomatic cases and COVID-19-attributable deaths. However, there will be limited impact on the estimated overall number of COVID-19 cases with the relatively low coverage of high-incidence groups (15-25% based on current vaccine availability). Vaccination plus non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as mask wearing and social distancing, will further decrease COVID-19 incidence and mortality and may have an indirect impact on all-cause mortality. ConclusionsOur results and other evidence suggest that vaccination is most effective in flattening the epidemic curve and reducing mortality if supported by NPIs. In the short-term, focussing on high-risk groups may reduce the burden on the health system and result in fewer deaths. However, the herd effect from delaying another peak may only be achieved by greater vaccination coverage in high-incidence groups.","output":"Mathematical modelling of COVID-19 vaccination strategies in Kyrgyzstan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent measures to control the spread of the virus by border closure and suspension of commercial flights, decision-makers in several countries had to deal with one or more forms of repatriation problems, international and domestic. In addressing an international repatriation problem, a country must schedule flights to return its citizens. Typically, the flight schedules of commercial airlines are announced, and passengers buy their seats accordingly. However, in repatriation, the opposite happens: citizens express their wishes to return to their countries, and flights need to be scheduled. Due to several constraints, decision-makers should repatriate the most vulnerable citizens first. In this work, we offer an overview of repatriation problems from an optimization perspective by visiting real-life cases. We compare the Indian and Jordanian repatriation programs to find similarities and differences between the two. We also develop several mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) to model different repatriation phases and solve respective illustrative examples to demonstrate the use of the MILPs. Last, we solve two stages of a problem that resembles Jordans actual repatriation program.

Here, we proposed to assess the relationship between IL-6 and outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our cohort consisted of 46 adult patients with PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted in a COVID-19 ward of the Hospital de Braga (HB) from April 7 to May 7, 2020, whose IL-6 levels were followed over time. We found that IL-6 levels were significantly different between the disease stages. Also, we found a significant negative correlation between IL-6 levels during stages IIb and III, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), and partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2), showing that IL-6 correlates with respiratory failure. Compared to the inflammatory markers available in the clinic routine, we found a positive correlation between IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP). However, when we assessed the predictive value of these two markers, IL-6 behaves as a better predictor of disease progression. In a binary logistic regression, IL-6 level was the most significant predictor of the non-survivors group, when compared to age and CRP.

Iso-osmolal iodixanol (290 mOsm/kg H2O) infusion demonstrated smaller infarcts and less intracranial hemorrhage compared with low-osmolal iopamidol and saline. No studies comparing iodinated radiographic contrast media in human stroke have been performed, to our knowledge. We hypothesized that low-osmolal contrast media may be associated with worse outcomes compared with iodixanol in the Interventional Management of Stroke III Trial (IMS III). MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed prospective iodinated radiographic contrast media data for 133 M1 occlusions treated with endovascular therapy. We compared 5 prespecified efficacy and safety end points (mRS 0-2 outcome, modified TICI 2b-3 reperfusion, asymptomatic and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and mortality) between those receiving iodixanol (n = 31) or low-osmolal contrast media (n = 102). Variables imbalanced between iodinated radiographic contrast media types or associated with outcome were considered potential covariates for the adjusted models. In addition to the iodinated radiographic contrast media type, final covariates were those selected by using the stepwise method in a logistic regression model. Adjusted relative risks were then estimated by using a log-link regression model. RESULTS Of baseline or endovascular therapy variables potentially linked to outcome, prior antiplatelet agent use was more common and microcatheter iodinated radiographic contrast media injections were fewer with iodixanol. Relative risk point estimates are in favor of iodixanol for the 5 prespecified end points with M1 occlusion. The percentage of risk differences are numerically greater for microcatheter injections with iodixanol. CONCLUSIONS While data favoring the use of iso-osmolal iodixanol for reperfusion of M1 occlusion following IV rtPA are inconclusive, potential pathophysiologic mechanisms suggesting clinical benefit warrant further investigation.","output":"Outcome Differences between Intra-Arterial Iso- and Low-Osmolality Iodinated Radiographic Contrast Media in the Interventional Management of Stroke III Trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diarrhoea in lambs and kids is often a complex, multi-factorial syndrome.

Non-responders were re-mailed the questionnaire on two further occasions, 2 and 4 weeks after the first posting. Completed questionnaires were received from 884 households. No pets were kept by 387 (43.8%) respondents. Dogs and cats were owned by 295 (33.4%) and 198 (22.5%) of households, respectively, with 7.8% of households having both cat(s) and dog(s). Fish and birds were the next most popular pets. Of the 198 cat-owning households, 54.0% kept only cat(s), while 46.5% kept cats with other pets. The distribution of cat ownership across Sydney was non-uniform. Each cat-owning household kept 1.3 cats on average, with the majority keeping one (75.8% households) or two (18.7%). For the 260 cats, the mean age was 7.1 years, the median 6 years, with a range of 3 months to 22 years. There were significantly more female (143; 55%) than male cats (117; 45%). Only seven cats (2.7%) were sexually entire, and these were all 6 years. Crossbred cats outnumbered pedigree cats by a ratio of 3.3:1. The Burmese was the most common breed, followed by the Persian. The median age of pedigree cats (5.5 years) was significantly lower than for domestic crossbred cats (7.0 years). Most cats were housed both indoors and outdoors (72.6%), with 19.7% being restricted to indoors and/or pet park enclosures. Pedigree cats were significantly more likely than crossbreds to be housed indoors.

Throughout 2020, this alleged correlation was promoted and distributed widely on social media, often in the form of maps overlaying the distribution of COVID-19 cases with the instillation of 5G towers. These conspiracy theories are not fringe phenomena, and they form part of a growing repertoire for conspiracist activist groups with capacities for organised violence.

For each, we consider the unique theoretical and technical challenges involved in specifying meaningful correlation, and how their discarding facilitates conspiracist attribution. In doing so, we offer a basis both to interrogate conspiracists uses and interpretation of data from elementary principles and offer some cautionary notes on the potential for their future misuse in an age of data democratization.

The model can be used to simulate various scenarios of the implemented intervention measures and calculate possible epidemic outcomes, including the necessary hospital capacities. Considering promising results regarding the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, the model is extended to simulate vaccination among different population strata. The findings from various simulation scenarios have shown that, with implementation of strict measures of contact reduction, it is possible to control COVID-19 and reduce number of deaths. The findings also show that limiting effective contacts within the most susceptible population strata merits a special attention. However, the findings also show that the disease has a potential to remain in the population for a long time, likely with a seasonal pattern. If a vaccine, with efficacy equal or higher than 65%, becomes available it could help to significantly slow down or completely stop circulation of the virus in human population.

This study aimed to investigate students psychological health and academic satisfaction in the context of COVID-19 and academic year-end stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Standardized self-filled scales for anxiety, depression, stress, psychological well-being, academic satisfaction (subjective assessment of students quality of life in their educational setting), and an ad-hoc scale for stress on the learning experience due to COVID-19 were used in this cross-sectional study. Participants were first- to third-year students of eight different health-related tracks in Geneva, Switzerland. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical regression analyses were applied. RESULTS: In June 2020, out of 2835 invited students, 433 (15%) completed the survey. Academic satisfaction was a stronger mental health predictor than COVID-19 stress on the learning experience, which mainly predicted stress and anxiety. Lower academic satisfaction scores were significantly associated with stress ( = ?0.53, p < 0.001), depression ( = ?0.26, p < 0.001), anxiety ( = ?0.20, p < 0.001), while higher scores with psychological well-being ( = 0.48, p < 0.001). Identifying as female was strongly associated with anxiety and stress but not with depression or psychological well-being. Lower age was associated with stress only. The nature of the academic training had a lesser impact on mental health and the academic year had no impact. CONCLUSIONS: Academic satisfaction plays a more substantial role than COVID-19 stress on the learning experience in predicting students overall mental health status. Training institutions should address the underlying factors that can enhance students academic satisfaction, especially during the COVID-19 period, in addition to ensuring that they have a continuous and adequate learning experience, as well as access to psychosocial services that help them cope with mental distress and enhance their psychological well-being.","output":"Psychological distress and well-being among students of health disciplines in Geneva, Switzerland: The importance of academic satisfaction in the context of academic year-end and COVID-19 stress on their learning experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Some prominent companies, such as the retail clothing company H&M, took laudable action to mitigate the impact on workers by agreeing to take delivery of already produced garments, to pay for goods in production, and to do so in accordance with previously agreed prices and payment terms 9 In contrast, the U S department store chain Kohls invoked the force majeure provisions of its contracts to cancel, without consultation, its clothing orders from Korean and Bangladeshi suppliers [ ]the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) imported the core UNGP concept of human rights due diligence (HRDD) into its revised 2011 Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises 11 HRDD is a process that enables companies to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for their involvement in human rights harm to vulnerable people in their own activities and in their business relationships [ ]the European Commission announced that in the first quarter of 2021, it will issue a legislative directive mandating human rights and environmental due diligence for companies based within the European Union (EU) and foreign firms that conduct significant business there 14 The reach of the EU legislation could be extraterritorial as a practical matter for non-EU companies doing business in the EU 15 2 To quote the consulting firm McKinsey: Businesses that successfully implemented a lean, global model of manufacturing achieved improvements in indicators such as inventory levels, on-time-in-full deliveries, and shorter lead times","output":"Irresponsible Exit: Exercising Force Majeure Provisions in Procurement Contracts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most COVID-19 cases are treated as outpatients, while the majority of studies on COVID-19 focus on inpatients Little is known about the self-reporting and self-rating of the disease's symptoms, and the associations of prophylactic use of dietary supplements with COVID-19 severity have not been addressed The aims of this study are to evaluate COVID-19 severity and to relate them to sociodemographic characteristics and prophylactic dietary supplements An observational patient-based study conducted through an online questionnaire on recovered COVID-19 patients The patients were assessed for several severity parameters, sociodemographic parameters, and prophylactic dietary supplement use A total of 428 patients were evaluated Age and presence of comorbidities had positive associations with the severity parameters The severe infection group had the highest proportion of patients stressed about COVID-19 (P &lt; 0 05) Cigarette, but not hookah, smoking was significantly associated with less severe symptoms Vitamin D negatively predicted disease severity (P &lt; 0 05) In conclusion, stress, age, and presence of comorbidities were the most important positive predictors of COVID-19 severity, while prophylactic vitamin D use and smoking were significant negative predictors The use of protective measures and other prophylactic dietary supplements was not significantly associated with symptom severity","output":"COVID-19 severity in relation to sociodemographics and vitamin D use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a major global public health challenge. This study aimed to investigate on how people perceive the COVID-19 outbreak using the components of the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) and to find out how this might contribute to possible behavioral responses to the prevention and control of the disease. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Iran during March and April 2020. Participants were recruited via online applications using a number of platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, and Instagram asking people to take part in the study. To collect data an electronic self-designed questionnaire based on the EPPM was used in order to measure the risk perception (efficacy, defensive responses, perceived treat) related to the COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, chi-square, t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA), were used to explore the data. RESULTS: A total of 3727 individuals with a mean age (SD) of 37.0 (11.1) years participated in the study. The results revealed significant differences in efficacy, defensive responses and perceived treat among different population groups particularly among those aged 60 and over. Women had significantly higher scores than men on some aspects such as self-efficacy, reactance, and avoidance but men had higher perceived susceptibility scores compared to women. Overall 56.4% of participants were engaged in danger control (preventive behavior) while the remaining 43.6% were engaged in fear control (non-preventive behavior) process. CONCLUSION: More than half of all participants motivated by danger control. This indicated that more than half of participants had high perceived efficacy (i.e., self-efficacy and response efficacy). Self-efficacy scores were significantly higher among participants who were older, female, single, lived in rural areas, and had good economic status. The results suggest that socioeconomic and demographic factors are the main determinants of the COVID-19 risk perception. Indeed, targeted interventions are essential for controlling the pandemic.

METHODS: This cross-sectional hospital-based study included 7,008 tele-consultations presenting between March 23(rd) and April 19(th) 2020. A three-level protocol was implemented to triage the calls. The data of patient queries were collected using a Google Form/Sheets and the tele-calls were returned using the patient information retrieved from the electronic medical record system. RESULTS: Overall, 7,008 tele-calls were addressed, of which 2,805 (40.02%) patients where a clinical-related query was answered were included for analysis. The most common queries were related to redness/pain/watering/blurring of vision (31.52%), closely followed by usage of medications (31.05%). The majority of the queries were directed to the department of cornea (34.15%), followed by retina (24.74%). Less than one-fifth of the patients were from the lower socio-economic class (16.08%) and one-fourth were new patients (23.96%). The most common advice given to the patient was related to management of medications (54.15%) followed by appointment related (17.79%). Emergency requests requiring further evaluation by an ophthalmologist accounted for a small percentage (16.36%) of patients.

METHODS: We included 257 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia from three teaching hospitals in Rhode Island. We extracted data from within the first 24 hours of admission. Variables were excluded if values were missing in >20% of cases, otherwise missing values were imputed. 115 patients with complete data after imputation were used for primary analysis. Sensitivity analysis was done after exclusion of one variable (LDH) in the complete dataset (n=257). Primary and secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and critical illness (mechanical ventilation or death), respectively. RESULTS: Only the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (RO-AUC) of COVID-GRAM (0.775, 95%CI 0.525-0.915) for in-hospital death, and CURB65 for in-hospital death (RO-AUC 0.842, 95%CI 0.674-0.932) or critical illness (RO-AUC=0.766, 95%CI 0.584-0.884) were significantly better than random. Sensitivity analysis yielded similar trends. Calibration plots showed better agreement between estimated and observed probability of in-hospital death for CURB65, compared to COVID-GRAM. The negative predictive value (NPV) of CURB65&#8805;2 was 97.2% for in-hospital death and 88.1% for critical illness.

The purpose of the sample and sample size was to ensure representation of different segments of the hotel industry to include international chain affiliated hotels, Australian chain affiliated hotels and independent hotels.FindingsAn analysis of the findings suggests that the major barriers to implementing and sustaining environmental sustainability in the Australian hotel industry are time, financial challenges, availability of resources and the views and imperatives of hotel owners and shareholders. The major drivers are financial, marketing, owner and shareholder interests and guest preferences. These stakeholders play a major role in creating both barriers and drivers.Research limitations/implicationsBased on the results, this study can modify the application of stakeholder theory to a degree and argue that stakeholders need to co-operate further to drive sustainability.

METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal analysis of COVID19 convalescents, using neutralizing antibody assays and SARS-CoV-2 serologic assay platforms employing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) or nucleocapsid (N) antigens. RESULTS: Sensitivities of serologic assays to diagnose prior SARS-CoV-2 infection changed with time. One widely used commercial platform that had an initial sensitivity of >95% declined to 71% at 81-100 days post diagnosis. The trajectories of median binding antibody titers measured over ~3 to 4 months were not dependent on the use of SARS-CoV-2 N or S proteins as antigen. The median neutralization titer decreased by ~45% per month. Each serological assay gave quantitative antibody titers that correlated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers, but S-based serological assay measurements better predicted neutralization potency. Correlation between S-binding and neutralization titers deteriorated with time and decreases in neutralization titers were not predicted by changes in S-binding antibody titers. CONCLUSIONS: Different SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays are more or less well suited for surveillance versus prediction of serum neutralization potency. Extended follow up should facilitate the establishment of appropriate serologic correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.","output":"Longitudinal analysis of serology and neutralizing antibody levels in COVID19 convalescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Social media platforms provide an easily accessible and time-saving communication approach for individuals with mental disorders compared to face-to-face meetings with medical providers.

Despite several emerging vaccines, there remains no verifiable therapeutic targeted specifically to the virus. Here we present a highly effective small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 infection using a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery system. Multiple siRNAs targeting highly conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were screened, and three candidate siRNAs emerged that effectively inhibit the virus by greater than 90% either alone or in combination with one another. We simultaneously developed and screened two novel LNP formulations for the delivery of these candidate siRNA therapeutics to the lungs, an organ that incurs immense damage during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Encapsulation of siRNAs in these LNPs followed by in vivo injection demonstrated robust repression of virus in the lungs and a pronounced survival advantage to the treated mice. Our LNP-siRNA approaches are scalable and can be administered upon the first sign of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.

This study analyzed plasma samples from 126 eligible convalescent blood donors in addition to 15 naive individuals, as well as an additional 20 convalescent individuals as a validation cohort. Multiplexed Fc Array binding assays and functional antibody response assays were utilized to evaluate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody composition and activity. Donor convalescent plasma samples contained a range of antibody cell- and complement-mediated effector functions, indicating the diverse antiviral activity of humoral responses observed among recovered individuals. In addition to viral neutralization, convalescent plasma samples contained antibodies capable of mediating such Fc-dependent functions as complement activation, phagocytosis, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against SARS-CoV-2. Plasma samples from a fraction of eligible donors exhibited high activity across all activities evaluated. These polyfunctional plasma samples could be identified with high accuracy with even single Fc Array features, whose correlation with polyfunctional activity was confirmed in the validation cohort. Collectively, these results expand understanding of the diversity of antibody-mediated antiviral functions associated with convalescent plasma, and the polyfunctional antiviral functions suggest that it could retain activity even when its neutralizing capacity is reduced by mutations in variant SARS-CoV-2.IMPORTANCE Convalescent plasma has been deployed globally as a treatment for COVID-19, but efficacy has been mixed. Better understanding of the antibody characteristics that may contribute to its antiviral effects is important for this intervention as well as offer insights into correlates of vaccine-mediated protection. Here, a survey of convalescent plasma activities, including antibody neutralization and diverse effector functions, was used to define plasma samples with broad activity profiles.

There are risks and benefits associated with both the type of interventions. Hence, this review was conducted to compare outcomes of immediate and delayed induction of labour among women with hypertensive disorder of pregnancy based on disease severity and gestational age. METHODS: We conducted systematic searches in various databases including Medline, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL), Scopus, and Embase from inception until October 2019.Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the quality of published trials. A meta-analysis was performed with random-effects model and reported pooled Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Fourteen randomized controlled trials with 4244 participants were included. Majority of the studies had low or unclear bias risks. Amongst late onset mild pre-eclampsia patients, the risk of renal failure was significantly lower with immediate induction of labour (pooled RR: 0.36; 95%CI: 0.14 to 0.92). In severe pre-eclampsia patients, immediate induction of labour significantly reduced the risk of having small-for-gestational age babies compared to delayed induction of labour (pooled RR: 0.49; 95%CI: 0.29-0.84).Delayed induction was found to significantly reduce the risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome risk among late onset mild pre-eclampsia patients (pooled RR: 2.15; 95%CI: 1.14 to 4.06) None of the other outcomes demonstrated statistically significant difference between the two interventions. CONCLUSION: Delayed induction of labour with expectant monitoring may not be inferior to immediate induction of labour in terms of neonatal and maternal outcomes. Expectant approach of management for late onset mild pre-eclampsia patients may be associated with decreased risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, while immediate induction of labour among severe pre-eclampsia patients is associated with reduced risk of small-for-gestational age babies and among mild pre-eclampsia patients, it is associated with reduced risk of severe renal impairment.","output":"Immediate versus delayed induction of labour in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY Residency applicant evaluation and selection is a critical part of developing and maintaining a high-quality plastic surgery residency program.

METHODS AND RESULTS In a single centre retrospective observational study of all adult patients undergoing cardiac reoperations for isolated CABG between 2004 and 2016, we identified 310 patients, and excluded those who received concomitant cardiac procedures (n = 205). Of the remaining 105 patients, 47 received isolated redo-CABG using MiECC, and 58 received CECC. Propensity score modelling was performed, and inversed probability treatment analysis was used between the treatment groups. Primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events or need for conversion to CECC. Groups were comparable, apart from a higher incidence of NYHA class III or higher in CECC group (33.5% vs 8.6%, p= 0.004). Shorter times for operation, cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp were observed in the MiECC group. The incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was significantly lower with MiECC (22.1%, p = 0.012). No significant difference was observed in all-cause 30-day mortality between the MiECC and CECC groups (6.8% vs. 8.3%, p = 0.81). CONCLUSION We found no difference in overall mortality between CECC and MiECC in patients undergoing reoperation for isolated CABG.

This study investigated the role of curcumin chitosan (CuCs) nanocomposite as a potential anti-HCV-4a agent in human hepatoma cells Huh7. METHODS: Docking of curcumin and CuCs nanocomposite and binding energy calculations were carried out. Chitosan nanoparticles (CsNPs) and CuCs nanocomposite were prepared with an ionic gelation method and characterized with TEM, zeta size and potential, and HPLC to calculate encapsulation efficiency. Cytotoxicity studies were performed on Huh7 cells using MTT assay and confirmed with cellular and molecular assays. Anti-HCV-4a activity was determined using real-time PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: The strength of binding interactions between protein ligand complexes gave scores with NS3 protease, NS5A polymerase, and NS5B polymerase of -124.91, -159.02, and -129.16, for curcumin respectively, and -68.51, -54.52, and -157.63 for CuCs nanocomposite, respectively. CuCs nanocomposite was prepared at sizes 29C39.5 nm and charges of 33 mV. HPLC detected 4% of curcumin encapsulated into CsNPs. IC50 was 8 g/mL for curcumin and 25 g/mL for the nanocomposite on Huh7 but was 25.8 g/mL and 34 g/mL on WISH cells. CsNPs had no cytotoxic effect on tested cell lines. Apoptotic genes expression revealed the caspase-dependent pathway mechanism. CsNPs and CuCs nanocomposite demonstrated 100% inhibition of viral entry and replication, which was confirmed with HCV core protein expression. CONCLUSION: CuCs nanocomposite inhibited HCV-4a entry and replication compared to curcumin alone, suggesting its potential role as an effective therapeutic agent.","output":"Antiviral Activity of Chitosan Nanoparticles Encapsulating Curcumin Against Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 4a in Human Hepatoma Cell Lines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the sales of fast-food businesses have dropped sharply Customer satisfaction has always been one of the key factors for the sustainable development of enterprises However, in the fast-food restaurant business, gaining the knowledge of customer satisfaction is one of the critical tasks Moreover, text reviews in social media have become one of important reference sources for customers decisions in buying services and products Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to explore whether customer voices from social media reviews are different during the COVID-19 outbreak and to propose a new method to reduce interpersonal contact when collecting data A text mining scheme which includes least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and decision trees (DT) are presented to discover the essential factors for customers to increase their satisfaction from unstructured online customer reviews Finally, three real world review sets were employed to validate the effectiveness of the presented text mining scheme Experimental results can help companies to properly adapt to similar epidemic situations in the future and facilitate their sustainable development ? 2020 by the authors Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland","output":"Using a text mining approach to hear voices of customers from social media toward the fast-food restaurant industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Throughout the time of the global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 virus, there has been a compelling necessity for the development of effective antiviral agents and prophylactic vaccines to limit the virus spread, disease burden, hospitalization, and mortality.

We performed a timely analysis of ischemic stroke (IS) and related consultations using the telestroke TEMPiS working diagnosis database prior (PL), within (WL), and after easing (EL) of CPL. METHODS: Twelve hospitals were selected and data analyzed regarding IS (including intravenous thrombolysis [intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen; IV rtPA] and endovascular thrombectomy [EVT]) and related events from February 1 to June 15 during 2017C2020. In addition, we aimed to correlate events to various mobile phone mobility data. RESULTS: Following the significant reduction of IS, IV rtPA, and EVT cases during WL compared to PL in 2020 longitudinally (p values <0.048), we observed increasing numbers of consultations, IS, recommendations for EVT, and IV rtPA with the network in EL over WL not reaching PL levels yet. Absolute numbers of all consultations paralleled best to mobility data of public transportation over walking and driving mobility. CONCLUSIONS: While the decrease in emergency admissions including stroke during CPL can only be in part attributed by patients not seeking medical attention, stroke awareness in the pandemic, and direct COVID-19 triggered stroke remains of high importance. The number of consultations in TEMPiS during the lockdown parallels best with mobility of public transportation.

Methods are needed to systematically bridge this crucial gap to facilitate experimental testing of hypotheses and translation to clinical utility. RESULTS: Here, we leveraged cross-phenotype associations to identify traits with shared genetic architecture, using linkage disequilibrium (LD) information to accurately capture shared SNPs by proxy, and calculate significance of enrichment. This shared genetic architecture was examined across differing biological scales through incorporating data from catalogs of clinical, cellular, and molecular GWAS. We have created an interactive web database (interactive Cross-Phenotype Analysis of GWAS database (iCPAGdb)) to facilitate exploration and allow rapid analysis of user-uploaded GWAS summary statistics. This database revealed well-known relationships among phenotypes, as well as the generation of novel hypotheses to explain the pathophysiology of common diseases. Application of iCPAGdb to a recent GWAS of severe COVID-19 demonstrated unexpected overlap of GWAS signals between COVID-19 and human diseases, including with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis driven by the DPP9 locus. Transcriptomics from peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients demonstrated that DPP9 was induced in SARS-CoV-2 compared to healthy controls or those with bacterial infection. Further investigation of cross-phenotype SNPs associated with both severe COVID-19 and other human traits demonstrated colocalization of the GWAS signal at the ABO locus with plasma protein levels of a reported receptor of SARS-CoV-2, CD209 (DC-SIGN). This finding points to a possible mechanism whereby glycosylation of CD209 by ABO may regulate COVID-19 disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, connecting genetically related traits across phenotypic scales links human diseases to molecular and cellular measurements that can reveal mechanisms and lead to novel biomarkers and therapeutic approaches.

METHODS: The study included 253 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive patients with breast cancer who completed at least one course of trastuzumab treatment extracted from the hospital health information system of the provincial medical centre of Fujian. We adopted the propensity score-matching method to mimic a quasi-experimental design to estimate the impact of the public health insurance coverage policy on all the indicated patients with a before-after comparison of the total breast cancer-associated direct medical expenditures for a standard course of treatment or maintenance treatment and the proportionate patient out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure based on the real clinical data. RESULTS: We found evidence of an association between the public health insurance coverage of novel breast cancer medication and the reductions of the medical expenditure by US$18661.02 (95% CI 13 836.57 to 28 201.45), and the proportionate patient OOP expenditure by 24% (95% CI0.20 to 0.27).

Patients with FFO had lower admission SBP (15124 mm Hg vs 16528 mm Hg; p=0.010), while admission SBP levels were higher in patients who died during hospitalization (16934 mm Hg vs 15624 mm Hg; p=0.043). A 10 mm Hg increment in admission SBP was independently (p=0.010) associated with an increase of 12 cm3 in FIV (95% CI 3 to 21) in multiple linear regression models adjusting for potential confounders. A 10 mm Hg increment in admission SBP was independently (p=0.012) associated with a lower likelihood of FFO at 3 months (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.91) in multiple logistic regression models adjusting for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS Higher admission SBP is an independent predictor of increased FIV and lower likelihood of 3-month FFO in patients with ELVO treated with EVT.","output":"Admission systolic blood pressure and outcomes in large vessel occlusion strokes treated with endovascular treatment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microneedles were first conceptualized for drug delivery many decades ago, overcoming the shortages and preserving the advantages of hypodermic needle and conventional transdermal drug-delivery systems to some extent.

This paper seeks to understand community\\\\based PSWs' satisfaction with opportunities for job\\\\related training at their employing organization to provide the skills and knowledge to meet the demands of their evolving role. METHODS: Data for this paper are from a cross\\\\sectional survey of 1746 community\\\\based PSWs in Ontario, Canada entitled, The PSW Health and Safety Matters Survey www.pswshaveasay.ca. This survey was part of a research project Keeping Community Based PSWs Safe in a Changing World of Work, funded by the Ontario Ministry of Labour. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlations, multivariate regression, and thematic analysis. RESULTS: Quantitative analysis revealed most community homecare organizations offer PSWs job\\\\related training to help them retain and update their skills and that PSWs have a moderate level of satisfaction with their job\\\\related training. The analysis revealed that PSWs' satisfaction with organizational training is greater when the organization provides work\\\\related training on challenging tasks, lifting and transferring tasks, and tasks delegated by nurses and supervisors. Data from the open\\\\ended question highlighted seven key themes for desired training by PSWs: safe body mechanics for moving/lifting clients, managing aggression primarily with clients, infection control, CPR/first aid, mental illness, equipment training, and basic health and safety. CONCLUSION: Implications for factors associated with PSWs' satisfaction with opportunities for job\\\\related training are discussed along with recommendations for mitigating variability in education and training to meet the demands of their evolving role.","output":"Community\\\\based personal support workers' satisfaction with job\\\\related training at the organization in Ontario, Canada: Implications for future training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global pandemic that has spread all over the word. To avoid the virus transmission, healthcare workers (HCWs) must wear adequate personal protective equipment (PPE). PPE is associated with several side events, including skin reactions.

The association between PM and coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has not been well established in the current literature. We sought to summarize the limited body of literature regarding PM in patients with COVID-19 and characterize the presentation and clinical outcomes of PM in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-COV-2 pneumonia at our institution to better define the incidence, prognosis, and available treatment for this condition. Materials and Methods: All patients with a proven diagnosis of COVID-19 and PM between March 18, 2020 and May 5, 2020 were identified through hospital records. Retrospective analysis of radiology records and chart review were conducted. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were collected and descriptive statistics was analyzed. Results: Thirty-six patients met inclusion criteria. Out of the 346 intubated COVID-19 patients, 34 (10%) had PM. The incidence of PM increased for the first 4 weeks of the pandemic, and then began to decrease by week 5. At the endpoint of the study, 12 (33.33%) patients were alive and 24 patients (66.67%) had died. Conclusion: PM, although a rare phenomenon, was more prevalent in COVID-19 patients compared with historical patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome. The etiology of this condition may be attributed to higher susceptibility of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to a combination of barotrauma and airway injury.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Outcome of Pneumomediastinum in Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The mental health status of health care workers (HCWs) related to COVID-19 is of great importance.

Here we characterize transmission risk between 1,178 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and their 15,648 close contacts based on detailed contact tracing data from Hunan, China. We find that 80% of secondary transmissions can be traced back to 14% of SARS-CoV-2 infections, indicating substantial transmission heterogeneities. Regression analysis suggests a marked gradient of transmission risk scales positively with the duration of exposure and the closeness of social interactions, after adjusted for demographic and clinical factors. Population-level physical distancing measures confine transmission to families and households; while case isolation and contact quarantine reduce transmission in all settings. Adjusted for interventions, the reconstructed infectiousness profile of a typical SARS-CoV-2 infection peaks just before symptom presentation, with ~50% of transmission occurring in the pre-symptomatic phase. Modelling results indicate that achieving SARS-CoV-2 control would require the synergistic efforts of case isolation, contact quarantine, and population-level physical distancing measures, owing to the particular transmission kinetics of this virus.","output":"Transmission heterogeneities, kinetics, and controllability of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The ontology authoring step in ontology development involves having to make choices about what subject domain knowledge to include. This may concern sorting out ontological differences and making choices between conflicting axioms due to limitations in the logic or the subject domain semantics. Examples are dealing with different foundational ontologies in ontology alignment and OWL 2 DLs transitive object property versus a qualified cardinality constraint. Such conflicts have to be resolved somehow. However, only isolated and fragmented guidance for doing so is available, which therefore results in ad hoc decision-making that may not be the best choice or forgotten about later. RESULTS: This work aims to address this by taking steps towards a framework to deal with the various types of modeling conflicts through meaning negotiation and conflict resolution in a systematic way. It proposes an initial library of common conflicts, a conflict set, typical steps toward resolution, and the software availability and requirements needed for it. The approach was evaluated with an actual case of domain knowledge usage in the context of epizootic disease outbreak, being avian influenza, and running examples with COVID-19 ontologies.

Therefore, they must employ protective measures. In practice, HCWs in Israel were not fully prepared for this sudden COVID-19 outbreak. This research aimed to identify and compare: (1) Israeli HCWs perceptions regarding the official COVID-19 guidelines applicability and their protective value, and (2) HCWs executives response to HWCs concern regarding personal protective equipment (PPE) shortage. METHODS: A mixed-methods sequential explanatory design consists of: (1) An online survey of 242 HCWs about the application of the guidelines and PPE, and (2) Personal interviews of 15 HCWs executives regarding PPE shortage and the measures they are taking to address it. RESULTS: A significant difference between the perceived applicability and protective value was found for most of the guidelines. Some of the guidelines were perceived as more applicable than protective (hand hygiene, signage at entrance, alcohol rub sanitizers at entrance, and mask for contact with symptomatic patients). Other were perceived as less applicable than protective (prohibited gathering of over 10 people, maintaining a distance of 2 m, and remote services). CONCLUSIONS: HCWs need the support of the healthcare authorities not only to provide missing equipment, but also to communicate the risk to them. Conveying the information with full transparency, while addressing the uncertainty element and engaging the HCWs in evaluating the guidelines, are critical for establishing trust.","output":"A mixed-methods sequential explanatory design comparison between COVID-19 infection control guidelines applicability and their protective value as perceived by Israeli healthcare workers, and healthcare executives response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccination is a simple strategy recommended for the prevention of influenza infection and its complications. The meta-analysis aimed to provide current supportive evidence for the breadth and validity of the observed protective effects of influenza vaccination on cardiovascular and respiratory adverse outcomes and all-cause mortality in older adults and in general adult population. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library to identify all published studies comparing influenza vaccination with placebo from the database inception to November 11, 2018. These included studies reporting the associations of influenza vaccination with the risk of aforementioned adverse outcomes. RESULTS: The pooled adjusted relative risks among influenza-vaccinated people relative to unvaccinated people for the outcomes of interest were 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.70-0.78) for cardiovascular diseases (63 studies), 0.82 (95% CI = 0.75-0.91) for respiratory diseases (29 studies), and 0.57 (95% CI = 0.51-0.63) for all-cause mortality (43 studies).

One specific application is to monitor compliance of website and social media activity with respect to jurisdictional regulations. These data may then identify breaches of compliance and inform disciplinary actions. Our study aimed to evaluate the novel use of internet analytics by a Canadian chiropractic regulator to determine their registrants compliance with three regulations related to specific health conditions, pregnancy conditions and most recently, claims of improved immunity during the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: A customized internet search tool (Market Review Tool, MRT) was used by the College of Chiropractors of British Columbia (CCBC), Canada to audit registrants websites and social media activity. The audits extracted words whose use within specific contexts is not permitted under CCBC guidelines. The MRT was first used in October of 2018 to identify words related to specific health conditions. The MRT was again used in December 2019 for words related to pregnancy and most recently in March 2020 for words related to COVID-19. In these three MRT applications, potential cases of word misuse were evaluated by the regulator who then notified the practitioner to comply with existing regulations by a specific date. The MRT was then used on that date to determine compliance. Those found to be non-compliant were referred to the regulator's inquiry committee. We mapped this process and reported the outcomes with permission of the regulator. RESULTS: In September 2018, 250 inappropriate mentions of specific health conditions were detected from approximately 1250 registrants with 2 failing to comply. The second scan for pregnancy related terms of approximately1350 practitioners revealed 83 inappropriate mentions. Following notification, all 83 cases were compliant within the specified timeframe. Regarding COVID-19 related words, 97 inappropriate mentions of the word \\"immune\\" were detected from 1350 registrants with 7 cases of non-compliance. CONCLUSION: Internet analytics are an effective way for regulators to monitor internet activity to protect the public from misleading statements. The processes described were effective at bringing about rapid practitioner compliance. Given the increasing volume of internet activity by healthcare professionals, internet analytics are an important addition for health care regulators to protect the public they serve.","output":"The use of internet analytics by a Canadian provincial chiropractic regulator to monitor, evaluate and remediate misleading claims regarding specific health conditions, pregnancy, and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of October 2018, a storm of unprecedented strength severely damaged the forests of the eastern sector of the Italian Alps. The affected forest area covers 42,500 ha. The president of one of the damaged regions asked for help from the University of Padua. After eight months of discussion, the authors of this article wrote a consensus text. The sometimes asper debate brought to light some crucial aspects: 1) even experienced specialists may have various opinions based on scientific knowledge that lead to conflicting proposals for action. For some of them there is evidence that to restore a destroyed natural environment it is more judicious to do nothing; 2) the soil corresponds to a living structure and every ecosystems management should be based on it; 3) faced with a catastrophe, people and politicians find themselves unarmed, also because they rarely have the scientific background to understand natural processes. Yet politicians are the only persons who make the key decisions that drive the economy in play and therefore determine the near future of our planet. This article is an attempt to respond directly to a governor with a degree in animal production science, who formally and prudently asked a university department called Land, Environment, Agriculture and Forestry for help before taking decisions; 4) the authors also propose an artistic interpretation of facts (uncontrolled storm) and conclusions (listen to the soil). Briefly, the authors identify the soil as an indispensable source for the renewal of the destroyed forest, give indications on how to prepare a map of the soils of the damaged region, and suggest to anchor on this soil map a series of silvicultural and soil management actions that will promote the soil conservation and the faster recovery of the natural dynamic stability and resilience.

Research Design, Participants, and Research context: This was a quantitative cross-sectional descriptive study conducted among 117 nurses working in critical care units. Data collection tools were sociodemographic, occupational, and COVID-19Crelated questionnaires and previously validated Spanish version of Ethical Conflict in Nursing Questionnaire-Critical Care Version. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: We obtained permission from the Ethics Committee and participants' informed consent. FINDINGS: Data indicates a moderate level of exposure to ethical conflicts. The most frequent ethical conflicts were related to situations about \\"treatment and clinical procedures.\\" The most intensity of ethical conflicts was related to situations about \\"treatment and clinical procedures\\" and \\"dynamics of the service and working environment.\\" No statistical significance was identified between the socio-demographic variables and level of exposure to ethical conflicts.

The MNP arrays were subjected to superconducting quantum interference device measurements; flat samples (10 nm Co coated with 10 nm Au) exhibited an M(s) of 117.3 emu g(?1), which was lower than the reported literature value for bulk Co (162.7 emu g(?1)).

As such, it has been crucial to the success of vaccines. Yet, the recent pandemic has illuminated key gaps in our knowledge related to the factors influencing effective memory formation and the inability to predict the longevity of immune protection. In recent decades, researchers have acquired a number of novel and powerful tools with which to study the factors underpinning humoral memory. These tools have been used to study the B-cell fate decisions that occur within the germinal centre, a site where responding B-cells undergo affinity maturation and is one of the major routes for memory B-cell and high-affinity long-lived plasma cell formation. The advent of single-cell sequencing technology has provided an enhanced resolution for studying fate decisions within the germinal centre and cutting-edge techniques have enabled researchers to model this reaction with more accuracy both in vitro and in silico. Moreover, modern approaches to studying memory B-cells have allowed us to gain a better appreciation for the heterogeneity and adaptability of this vital class of B-cells. Together, these studies have facilitated important breakthroughs in our understanding of how these systems operate to ensure a successful immune response. In this review, we describe recent advances in the field of germinal centre and memory B-cell biology in order to provide insight into how humoral memory is formed, as well as the potential for generating lasting immunity to novel pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Advances in understanding the formation and fate of B-cell memory in response to immunisation or infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SEC and U.S. Justice Department are investigating suspicious stock trades made by U.S. Senator Richard Burr in February 2020, which might have been based in part upon confidential information about the Coronavirus pandemic disclosed at closed-door congressional hearings, which if true, might violate the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge, or STOCK Act.

The present work aimed to determine the molecular mechanisms by which EV derived from inflammatory dental pulp stem cell (iDPSC-EV) influence periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) and provide a potential strategy for bone and dental pulp regeneration. METHODS: The osteogenic and odontogenic differentiation was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blot, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay, ALP staining, alizarin red S (ARS) staining, and immunofluorescence staining. To detect proliferation, the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, and flow cytometry analysis were used. EVs were isolated by the Exoperfect kit and ultrafiltration and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and western blot. The expression profile of miRNAs in EVs was studied using miRNA sequence and bioinformatics, and one of the upregulated miRNAs was evaluated on PDLSCs. RESULTS: The inflammatory microenvironment stimulated osteogenic and odontogenic differentiation of DPSCs and iDPSC-EV behaved alike on PDLSCs. MiR-758-5p was upregulated in iDPSC-EV and was demonstrated to play a significant role in the osteogenic and odontogenic commitment of PDLSCs. A dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed the binding site between miR-758-5p and limb development membrane protein 1 (LMBR1). The knockdown of LMBR1 also enhanced the above potential. Mechanically, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling was activated.

Previous studies conducted on coronavirus outbreaks including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome pandemic found that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety were the most common mental health problems and long-term consequences of these outbreaks. Currently, comprehensive and integrated information on the global prevalence of PTSD due to the COVID-19 pandemic is lacking. OBJECTIVE: In the present meta-analysis, we examined the global prevalence and associated risk factors of PTSD in patients/survivors of COVID-19, health professionals, and the population at large. DESIGN: Meta-analysis. DATA SOURCE: Cochrane, CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and manual search up to June 2021. METHODS: We included studies evaluating the prevalence of PTSD during the COVID-19 pandemic in either patients/survivors, health professionals, and the population at large. The data were analyzed using logit transformation with the random-effects model. Risk of bias assessment was conducted using Hoy and colleagues. RESULTS: A total of 63 studies (n=124,952) from 24 different countries were involved. The overall pooled estimate of PTSD prevalence was 17.52% (95% CI 13.89 to 21.86), with no evidence of publication bias (t=-0.22, p-value=0.83). This study found a high prevalence of PTSD among patients with COVID-19 (15.45%; 95% CI 10.59 to 21.99), health professionals (17.23%; 95% CI 11.78 to 24.50), and the population at large (17.34%; 95% CI 12.21 to 24.03). Subgroup analyses showed that those working in COVID-19 units (30.98%; 95% CI, 16.85 to 49.86), nurses (28.22%; 95% CI, 15.83 to 45.10), those living in European countries (25.05 %; 95% CI 19.14 to 32.06), and studies that used Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (30.18 %, 95% CI 25.78 to 34.98) demonstrated to have the highest PTSD prevalence compared to other subgroups. Meta-regression analyses revealed that the elderly (above age 65) had lower PTSD prevalence (-1.75, 95% CI -3.16 to -0.34) than the adult population.

One such therapy involves the consumption of chlorine dioxide, which is commonly used in the cleaning industry and is available commercially as a mineral solution. This substance has been promoted as a preventive or treatment agent for several diseases, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. As interest in chlorine dioxide has grown since the start of the pandemic, health agencies, institutions, and organizations worldwide have tried to discourage and restrict the consumption of this substance. Objective The aim of this study is to analyze search engine trends in Mexico to evaluate changes in public interest in chlorine dioxide since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We retrieved public query data for the Spanish equivalent of the term chlorine dioxide from the Google Trends platform. The location was set to Mexico, and the time frame was from March 3, 2019, to February 21, 2021. A descriptive analysis was performed. The Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests were used to identify significant changes in search volumes for this term between four consecutive time periods, each of 13 weeks, from March 1, 2020, to February 27, 2021. Results From the start of the pandemic in Mexico (February 2020), an upward trend was observed in the number of searches compared with that in 2019. Maximum volume trends were recorded during the week of July 19-25, 2020. The search volumes declined between September and November 2020, but another peak was registered in December 2020 through February 2021, which reached a maximum value on January 10. Percentage change from the first to the fourth time periods was +312.85, C71.35, and +228.18, respectively. Pairwise comparisons using the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests showed significant differences between the four periods (P<.001). Conclusions Misinformation is a public health risk because it can lower compliance with the recommended measures and encourage the use of therapies that have not been proven safe. The ingestion of chlorine dioxide presents a danger to the population, and several adverse reactions have been reported. Programs should be implemented to direct those interested in this substance to accurate medical information.","output":"Misinformation About and Interest in Chlorine Dioxide During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Mexico Identified Using Google Trends Data: Infodemiology Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 mitigation strategies have been challenging to implement in resource-limited settings due to the potential for widespread disruption to social and economic well-being. Here we predict the clinical severity of COVID-19 in Malawi, quantifying the potential impact of intervention strategies and increases in health system capacity. METHODS: The infection fatality ratios (IFR) were predicted by adjusting reported IFR for China, accounting for demography, the current prevalence of comorbidities and health system capacity. These estimates were input into an age-structured deterministic model, which simulated the epidemic trajectory with non-pharmaceutical interventions and increases in health system capacity. FINDINGS: The predicted population-level IFR in Malawi, adjusted for age and comorbidity prevalence, is lower than that estimated for China (0.26%, 95% uncertainty interval (UI) 0.12%C0.69%, compared with 0.60%, 95% CI 0.4% to 1.3% in China); however, the health system constraints increase the predicted IFR to 0.83%, 95% UI 0.49%C1.39%. The interventions implemented in January 2021 could potentially avert 54 400 deaths (95% UI 26 900C97 300) over the course of the epidemic compared with an unmitigated outbreak. Enhanced shielding of people aged 60 years could avert 40 200 further deaths (95% UI 25 300C69 700) and halve intensive care unit admissions at the peak of the outbreak. A novel therapeutic agent which reduces mortality by 0.65 and 0.8 for severe and critical cases, respectively, in combination with increasing hospital capacity, could reduce projected mortality to 2.5 deaths per 1000 population (95% UI 1.9C3.6). CONCLUSION: We find the interventions currently used in Malawi are unlikely to effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission but will have a significant impact on mortality. Increases in health system capacity and the introduction of novel therapeutics are likely to further reduce the projected numbers of deaths.","output":"Potential impact of intervention strategies on COVID-19 transmission in Malawi: a mathematical modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A general procedure for the optimization of atomic density-fitting basis functions is designed with the balance between accuracy and numerical stability in mind.

METHODS: We identified patients admitted to Cannes hospital for Delta-variant-related Covid-19 infection from July to September 2021. Their main demographic parameters, inflammatory markers, and clinical characteristics were recorded. Differences between fully vaccinated subjects and unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated individuals were analyzed. RESULTS: We included 126 patients (57% male, mean age 64 years, mean delay since symptoms onset 7.8 days). Among admitted patients, 94 (75%) were not vaccinated, 11 (8%) incompletely so and 21 (17%) were fully vaccinated.

To this end, this study focused on the gentrification situations occurring before and after the COVID-19 pandemic in the Itaewon area, South Korea, by using semantic network analysis. We analyzed news articles on the gentrification phenomenon in the Itaewon area reported in South Korea. As a result, gentrification in the Itaewon area is divided into four stages. The first stage of gentrification (2010~2014) is initial stage of gentrification. Gentrification stage 2 (2015~2017) is the period of commercialization as a gentrification growth stage. The first stage of degentrification (2018~2019) is the maturation period of gentrification. The second stage of degentrification (2019~30 June 2020) is the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results confirm the existing theoretical frameworks while building a more nuanced definition through operationalizing gentrification and degentrification. As with the etymology of the term, the degentrification phenomenon can only be revealed when the gentrification phenomenon is prominently displayed. This study has an implication in that it tried to phenomenologically examine the specific phenomenon of the next stage of gentrification through the term degentrification.","output":"Degentrification?

However, these sanitary measures have been partially lifted due to socioeconomic factors causing a worrisome rebound of the epidemic in several countries. In this work, we assess the effectiveness of the mitigation implemented to constrain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Mexican territory during 2020. We also investigate to what extent the initial deployment of the vaccine will help to mitigate the pandemic and reduce the need for social distancing and other mobility restrictions. Our modeling approach is based on a simple mechanistic Kermack-McKendrick-type model. To quantify the effect of NPIs, we perform a monthly Bayesian inference using officially published data. The results suggest that in the absence of the sanitary measures, the cumulative number of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths would have been at least twice the official number. Moreover, for low vaccine coverage levels, relaxing NPIs may dramatically increase the disease burden; therefore, safety measures are of critical importance at the early stages of vaccination. The simulations also suggest that it may be more desirable to employ a vaccine with low efficacy but reach a high coverage than a vaccine with high effectiveness but low coverage levels. This supports the hypothesis that single doses to more individuals will be more effective than two doses for every person.","output":"Estimating the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccination on the progress of the COVID-19 epidemic in Mexico: a mathematical approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic not only challenged deeply-rooted daily patterns but also put a spotlight on the role of computational modeling in science and society.

The identified new genes and novel mutations suggest an independent origin of the distinct phenotypes in Cambodian aborigines through parallel evolution, refuting the long-standing argument on the common ancestry of these phenotypes among the worldwide rainforest hunter-gatherers.

A major question during the last decades has centred on understanding whether new advances in developmental biology are compatible with the standard view or whether they compel a new theory. Here, I argue that the answer to this question depends on which concept of morphogenesis is held. Morphogenesis can be conceived as (1) a chemically driven or (2) a mechanically driven process. According to the first option, genetic regulatory networks drive morphogenesis. According to the second, morphogenesis results from an invariant tendency of embryonic tissues to restore changes in mechanical stress. While chemically driven morphogenesis allows an extension of the standard view, mechanically driven morphogenesis would deeply transform it. Which of these hypotheses has wider explanatory power is unknown. At present, the problem of biological form remains unsolved.","output":"On the problem of biological form."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Complex protein glycosylation occurs through biosynthetic steps in the secretory pathway that create macro- and microheterogeneity of structure and function. Required for all life forms, glycosylation diversifies and adapts protein interactions with binding partners that underpin interactions at cell surfaces and pericellular and extracellular environments. Because these biological effects arise from heterogeneity of structure and function, it is necessary to measure their changes as part of the quest to understand nature. Quite often, however, the assumption behind proteomics that posttranslational modifications are discrete additions that can be modeled using the genome as a template does not apply to protein glycosylation. Rather, it is necessary to quantify the glycosylation distribution at each glycosite and to aggregate this information into a population of mature glycoproteins that exist in a given biological system. To date, mass spectrometric methods for assigning singly glycosylated peptides are well-established. But it is necessary to quantify glycosylation heterogeneity accurately in order to gauge the alterations that occur during biological processes. The task is to quantify the glycosylated peptide forms as accurately as possible and then apply appropriate bioinformatics algorithms to the calculation of micro- and macro-similarities. In this review, we summarize current approaches for protein quantification as they apply to this glycoprotein similarity problem.","output":"Calculating Glycoprotein Similarities From Mass Spectrometric Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected several million people. With the outbreak of the epidemic, many researchers are devoting themselves to the COVID-19 screening system. The standard practices for rapid risk screening of COVID-19 are the CT imaging or RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction). However, these methods demand professional efforts of the acquisition of CT images and saliva samples, a certain amount of waiting time, and most importantly prohibitive examination fee in some countries. Recently, some literatures have shown that the COVID-19 patients usually accompanied by ocular manifestations consistent with the conjunctivitis, including conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, or increased secretions. After more than four months study, we found that the confirmed cases of COVID-19 present the consistent ocular pathological symbols; and we propose a new screening method of analyzing the eye-region images, captured by common CCD and CMOS cameras, could reliably make a rapid risk screening of COVID-19 with very high accuracy.

This presents a major challenge, given the limited availability of evidence, especially in the early phases of the pandemic. Decision-makers thus turned to scientific experts to help to convey and contextualize the evidence for public health policymaking. The way in which these experts were consulted varied widely. Some decision-makers called on expert committees in which they convened multiple experts from different disciplines. However, the composition and role of these committees have raised questions of transparency and representation. This study examines whether and how expert committees in Germany were convened at the federal and national level to advise governments and ministries during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We investigated the disciplinary composition, gender representation and the transparency related to the convening of these bodies, work processes and the accessibility of results. METHODS: We performed a multi-stage document analysis. Between May and July 2020, we submitted freedom-of-information requests to the governmental institutions at both a federal and a national level. In addition to analysing the responses to these requests, we conducted a thorough search and analysis of the i) pandemic preparedness plans, (ii) official press releases and (iii) minor interpellations (Kleine Anfragen) at the federal and state level. We included documents on expert committees in the SARS-CoV-2 context for the period from January to the beginning of December 2020 and carried out a qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: We identified a total of 21 expert committees that were established in ten federal states and four federal ministries. In eleven committees, the members were known by name with women making up 26 % of the members. Biomedical disciplines such as virology, hygiene, medicine, and biology were the most commonly represented. Other disciplines including economics, law and sociology, and non-scientific experts were represented in seven federal states. The members of ten committees were not known by name. These committees covered different thematic areas (school and day-care, civil participation, medicine and care, economic topics), and their members were more commonly practitioners or affected populations. DISCUSSION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to an increased consultation of experts in public health policymaking. However, expert committees in Germany are not sufficiently representative and interdisciplinary to take different perspectives into account and ultimately advise politicians in complex pandemic situations. Furthermore, the work of these committees is not sufficiently transparent because access to information is limited. CONCLUSION: Due to this lack of transparency, it is unclear whether and how the expert committees exerted an influence on politics. Transparency of political decision-making processes and the consideration of pluralistic perspectives are considered essential for the legitimation and quality of political decisions in a pandemic and should therefore be strengthened in pandemic management in Germany.","output":"Politikberatung durch Expert*innenr?te in der SARS-CoV-2-Pandemie in Deutschland: Eine Dokumentenanalyse aus Public-Health-Perspektive"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The starting point of this study is based on a ground observation in Tunisia: The unsustainable blood donations and the shortage of clinical blood in some periods of the year (i.e. holidays; covid-19).

ResultsDatabase searches retrieved 6277 articles, 838 articles met the inclusion criteria, and 135 articles were included after full-text screening, from which 917 indicators were retrieved. Indicators assessing the diagnostic process showed a decreasing trend: from 33 indicators reporting on screening, 30 (91%) signalled a decrease during the pandemic (n=30 indicators, 91%). A reduction was also observed in the number of diagnostic procedures (n=64, 58%) and in the diagnoses (n=130, 89%). The proportion of diagnoses in the emergency setting and waiting times showed an increasing trend (n=8, 89% and n=14, 56%, respectively). Nine indicators (64%) showed stability in cancer stages distribution. A decreasing trend in the proportion of earliest stage cancers was reported by 63% of indicators (n=9), and 70% (n=43) of indicators showed an increasing trend in the proportion of advanced-stage cancers.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics were obtained from adults with T1D and compared during three periods: before lockdown (Period 1), lockdown (Period 2) and de-escalation after the end of lockdown (Period 3). In addition, patients who presented clinically meaningful glycemic improvement during Period 2 (defined by a glucose management indicator [GMI] reduction  0.5%) were compared with those who did not present it, and a logistic regression analysis was used to select predictive variables. RESULTS The study included 138 subjects. During Period 2, there was a decrease in mean glucose, GMI, time above range and an increase in time in range, compared with Period 1. During Period 3 these findings were maintained, in addition to a reduction in glycemic variability and an increase in sensor use and scans per day. Twenty-four patients (17.4%) presented clinically meaningful glycemic improvement during lockdown. No differences were detected between patients, except for the last laboratory A1c value.

Patients presented 5 to 11 days after first vaccination. The spectrum of clinical manifestations included cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT), arterial cerebral thromboembolism, and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). All patients had thrombocytopenia and markedly elevated D-Dimer. Autoantibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) were detected in all patients although they had never been exposed to heparin. Immunoglobulin from patient sera bound to healthy donor platelets in an AZD1222-dependant manner, suppressed by heparin. Aggregation of healthy donor platelets by patient sera was demonstrated in the presence of buffer or AZD1222 and was also suppressed by heparin. Anticoagulation alone or in combination with eculizumab or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resolved the pathology in three patients. Two patients had thromboembolic events despite anticoagulation at a time when platelets were increasing after IVIG. In summary, an unexpected autoimmune prothrombotic disorder is described after vaccination with AZD1222. It is characterized by thrombocytopenia and anti-PF4 antibodies binding to platelets in AZD1222-dependent manner.

Due to the prone of this deadly virus, uncertainty is significantly the facility for a health condition. There are solutions to handle insecurity about health from coronavirus for assessing the condition through FIS (Fuzzy Inference System). Therefore, for this particular reason we study and develop the fuzzy system to help assess the safety of health-related issues of the patient's condition according to the changes of environment. The FIS is permitted to assess the patient's history like temperature of the body, travel history, disinfection frequency, breathing problem, suffering cough and cold and ventilation rate. A fuzzy system consists of several steps like fuzzification, fuzzy database rule and also defuzzification. Furthermore, a study of FIS identifies the risk of health status according to the patient's condition.

Computer folding of the 3 NTR sequence predicted three stem-loop structures (SL1, SL2, and SL3 in the 3 to 5 direction), which generally were supported by solution structure analyses. The importance of these sequence and/or structural elements to PVX RNA accumulation was further analyzed by inoculation of Nicotiana tabacum (NT-1) protoplasts with PVX transcripts containing mutations in the 3 NTR. Analyses of RNA accumulation by S(1) nuclease protection indicated that multiple sequence elements throughout the 3 NTR were important for minus-strand RNA accumulation. Formation of SL3 was required for accumulation of minus-strand RNA, whereas SL1 and SL2 formation were less important. However, sequences within all of these predicted structures were required for minus-strand RNA accumulation, including a conserved hexanucleotide sequence element in the loop of SL3, and the CU nucleotide in a U-rich sequence within SL2. In contrast, 13 nucleotides that were predicted to reside in SL1 could be deleted without any significant reduction in minus or plus-strand RNA levels. Potential polyadenylation signals (near upstream elements; NUEs) in the 3 NTR of PVX RNA were more important for plus-strand RNA accumulation than for minus-strand RNA accumulation. In addition, one of these NUEs overlapped with other sequence required for optimal minus-strand RNA levels.

Using NMR, we show here that the PW-turn motif exists in a conformational equilibrium between folded and disordered states. We found that the fraction of conformers in the NS5A-D2 ensemble that adopt the structured motif is allosterically modulated both by the cis/trans isomerization of the surrounding prolines that are CypA substrates and by substitutions conferring resistance to cyclophilin inhibitor. Moreover, we noted that this fraction is directly correlated with HCV RNA replication efficiency.

RESULTS During the study period, 1594 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. We found 22 patients with ischaemic stroke (1.38%), 6 of whom did not meet the inclusion criteria. The remaining 16 patients were included in the study (15 cases of ischaemic stroke and one case of transient ischaemic attack). Median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 9 (interquartile range: 16), and mean (standard deviation) age was 73 years (12.8). Twelve patients (75%) were men. Mean time from COVID-19 symptom onset to stroke onset was 13 days. Large vessel occlusion was identified in 12 patients (75%). We detected elevated levels of D-dimer in 87.5% of patients and C-reactive protein in 81.2%.

Studies on temporal dynamics of its shedding suggests it peaks 1C2 days prior to any symptom onset. Therefore, a large proportion of patients are actively spreading the disease unknowingly whilst undetected. However, lengthy lockdowns and isolation leads to a host of socioeconomic issues and are impractical. Conversely, there exists no study describing this group and their clinical significance despite their key role in disease transmission. METHODS: As a result, we devised a retrospective study to look at the prevalence of presymptomatic patients with COVID-19 from data sourced via our medical records office. Subsequently, we identify early indicators of infection through demographic information, biochemical and radiological abnormalities which would allow early diagnosis and isolation. In addition, we will look into the clinical significance of this group and their outcome; if it differs from asymptomatic or symptomatic patients. Descriptive statistics were used in addition to tabulating the variables and corresponding values for reference. Variables are compared between the presymptomatic group and others via Chi-square testing and Fishers exact test, accepting a p value of < 0.05 as significant. RESULTS: Our analysis shows a higher proportion of presymptomatic patients with atypical symptoms like chest pain while symptomatic patients commonly present with respiratory symptoms like cough and shortness of breath. Besides that, there were more females presenting as presymptomatic patients compared to males (p = 0.019) and these group of patients were likely to receive treatment (p < 0.001). Otherwise, we were not able to identify other statistically significant markers suggesting a patient is presymptomatic.

Our hypothesis is that fellowship applicants would find that recorded audiovisual radiology content adds value to the conventional selection process, may increase engagement by using their own smartphone device, and also facilitate understanding of imaging findings of radiology-based questions, while maintaining social distancing. METHODS: One senior staff radiologist of each subspecialty prepared 4 audiovisual radiology questions for each subspecialty. We conducted a survey using online questionnaires for 123 fellowship applications for musculoskeletal (39), internal medicine (61) and neuroradiology (23) programs to evaluate the experience of using audiovisual radiology content as a substitute for the conventional text evaluation.

Patients that survive may face a slow recovery with long lasting side effects that can afflict different organs. SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects epithelial airway cells that express the host entry receptor Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) which binds to spike protein trimers on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 virions. However, SARS-CoV-2 can spread to other tissues even though they are negative for ACE2. To gain insight into the molecular constituents that might influence SARS-CoV-2 tropism, we determined which additional host factors engage with the viral spike protein in disease-relevant human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBEo(?)). We found that spike recruited the extracellular proteins laminin and thrombospondin and was retained in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) by the proteins DJB11 and FBX2 which support re-folding or degradation of nascent proteins in the ER. Because emerging mutations of the spike protein potentially impact the virus tropism, we compared the interactome of D614 spike with that of the rapidly spreading G614 mutated spike. More D614 than G614 spike associated with the proteins UGGT1, calnexin, HSP7A and GRP78/BiP which ensure glycosylation and folding of proteins in the ER. In contrast to G614 spike, D614 spike was endoproteolytically cleaved, and the N-terminal S1 domain was degraded in the ER even though C-terminal S2 only proteoforms remained present. D614 spike also bound more laminin than G614 spike, which suggested that extracellular laminins may function as co-factor for an alternative, S2 only dependent virus entry. Because the host interactome determines whether an infection is productive, we developed a novel proteome-based cell type set enrichment analysis (pCtSEA). With pCtSEA we determined that the host interactome of the spike protein may extend the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 beyond mucous epithelia to several different cell types, including macrophages and epithelial cells in the nephron. An S2 only dependent, alternative infection of additional cell types with SARS-CoV-2 may impact vaccination strategies and may provide a molecular explanation for a severe or prolonged progression of disease in select COVID-19 patients.","output":"The Host Interactome of Spike Expands the Tropism of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: We used viral genomics to deeply analyze the first SARS-CoV-2 infection clusters in the metropolitan region of Hamburg, Germany.

Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 variant tracing highlights both, low infection dose transmissions suggestive of fomites as route of infection in the initial cluster and high and low infection dose transmissions in family clusters indicative of fomites and droplets as infection routes. This suggests (1) single viral particle infection can be sufficient to initiate SARS-CoV-2 infection and (2) household/family members are exposed to high virus loads and therefore have a high risk to acquire SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Low and high infection dose transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the first COVID-19 clusters in Northern Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current study investigates the connectedness between US COVID-19 news, Dowes Jones Index (DJI), green bonds, gold, and bitcoin prices for the period 22 January 2020C3 August 2021.

Despite the face validity of claims for influence, studies on the causes of obesity have reported the influence of the food environment to be inconsistent. This inconsistency has been attributed to the variability of measures used by researchers to represent the food environmentsResearcher-Defined Food Environments (RDFE) like circular, street-network buffers, and others. This study (i.) determined an individuals Activity Space (AS) (ii.) explored the accuracy of the RDFE in representing the AS, (iii.) investigated the accuracy of the RDFE in representing actual exposure, and (iv.) explored whether exposure to food outlet reflects the use of food outlets. METHODS: Data were collected between June and December 2018. A total of 65 participants collected Global Positioning System (GPS) data, kept receipt of all their food purchases, completed a questionnaire about their personal information and had their weight and height measured. A buffer was created around the GPS points and merged to form an AS (GPS-based AS). RESULTS: Statistical and geospatial analyses found that the AS size of participants working away from home was positively related to the Euclidean distance from home to workplace; the orientation (shape) of AS was also influenced by the direction of workplace from home and individual characteristics were not predictive of the size of AS. Consistent with some previous studies, all types and sizes of RDFE variably misrepresented individual exposure in the food environments. Importantly, the accuracy of the RDFE was significantly improved by including both the home and workplace domains. The study also found no correlation between exposure and use of food outlets. CONCLUSIONS: Home and workplace are key activity nodes in modelling AS or food environments and the relationship between exposure and use is more complex than is currently suggested in both empirical and policy literature.","output":"Exploring factors affecting individual GPS-based activity space and how researcher-defined food environments represent activity space, exposure and use of food outlets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A heterogeneous pattern was detected in COVID-19 severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients The aim of this study was to define special features and individualized treatment modalities for this fatal infectious disease Methods: Thirty-six patients diagnosed as COVID-19 severe ARDS were chosen Lung mechanics (compliance), the extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) and pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI), and serum concentrations of immunology markers (interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, IL-8, ferritin, and C-reactive protein) were measured Accordingly, individualized treatment consisting of Actemra, hemoperfusion (HP), continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was implemented for each patient Results: Patients were categorized according to the lung compliance: 18 in 'L type' with compliance &gt;40 cc/cmH2O and 18 in 'H type' with compliance 40 cc/cmH2O In 16 patients, standard mechanical ventilation management and antiviral therapy were unsuccessful;therefore, hemodynamic and immunity responses were evaluated Results of transpulmonary thermodilution in L-type patients surprisingly showed EVLWI = 8 8  1 3 (6 9-9 7) and PVPI = 2 4  0 1 (2 2-2 6) In the H-type patients, five cases showed EVLWI = 8 7  0 8 (7 5-9 8) and PVPI = 2 6  0 3 (2 1-2 8) which were subclassified as 'Ha type' and five cases with EVLWI = 17 5  1 9 (15 7-20 6) and PVPI = 3 9  0 4 (3 5-4 5) were named 'Hb type' By measuring immunologic markers, these two groups were subdivided into high and low marker groups Individualized treatment resulted in 2 survivals with Actemra, 1 with HP, 2 with HP + CRRT, and 1 with ECMO Conclusion: According to the heterogeneity of COVID-19 severe ARDS presentation, which is due to various immunologic and hemodynamic responses, a systematic approach is an important and relatively successful strategy in choosing the appropriate treatment modality ?

METHODS: Forty seven nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens from 25 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and 22 SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals were investigated for expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), NOD-like receptors family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), interleukin (IL) - 6, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and type-1 interferons (IFNs) by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Increased expression of TLR2, MDA5 and ACE2 was detected in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in comparison with controls. MDA5 expression was significantly higher in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients than the patients with severe symptoms. The asymptomatic group showed significant induction of type 1 IFNs than the symptomatic group. Non-specific induction of TLR7 could be observed in nasopharyngeal (NP) cells irrespective of symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 positivity.

Recently, studies revealed that self-DNA from by-products of chromosome instability and tumors could activate the cGAS-STING pathway, and subsequently promote or inhibit tumor development. However, the prognostic value and correlations with immune infiltrates of the cGAS-STING pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been clarified. In this study, we used the Molecular Signatures Database, Oncomine, UALCAN, Human Protein Atlas, Kaplan-Meier plotter, LinkedOmics, and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource databases. Overexpression of XRCC5, IRF3, TRIM21, STAT6, DDX41, TBK1, XRCC6, TREX1, PRKDC, and TMEM173 was markedly correlated with clinical stages and pathological grades in HCC. Moreover, higher mRNA expression of XRCC5, XRCC6, and PRKDC was significantly related with shorter overall survival. However, higher mRNA expression of IFI16, STAT6, NLRC3, and TMEM173 was associated with favorable overall survival. Our results suggested that the kinase targets of the cGAS-STING pathway included the SRC family of tyrosine kinases (LCK and LYN), phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinase (PIKK) family kinases (ATM and ATR), and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1). Furthermore, we identified significant correlations among the expression of cGAS-STING pathway and infiltration of B cells, CD4+T cells, CD8+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells in HCC. The expression of the cGAS-STING pathway also exhibited strong relationships with diverse immune marker sets in HCC.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 76 COVID-19 patients who underwent abdominal CT for abdominal complaints from March 1 to April 15, 2020, in a large urban multihospital Health System were included. Those with positive abdominal CT findings (n = 14) were then excluded, with 62 patients undergoing final analysis (30M/32F; median age 63 years, interquartile range (IQR) 52C75 years, range 30C90 years). Demographic and clinical data were extracted. CT lung base assessment was performed by a cardiothoracic radiologist. Data were compared between discharged and hospitalised patients using Wilcoxon or Fishers exact tests. RESULTS: The majority of the population was non-elderly (56.4%, < 65 years) and most (81%) had underlying health conditions. Nineteen percent were discharged and 81% were hospitalised. The most frequent abdominal symptoms were pain (83.9%) and nausea/vomiting/anorexia (46.8%). Lung base CT findings included ground-glass opacities (95.2%) in a multifocal (95.2%) and peripheral (66.1%) distribution. Elevated laboratory values (when available) included C-reactive protein (CRP) (97.3%), D-dimer (79.4%), and ferritin (68.8% of males and 81.8% of females). Older age (p = 0.045), hypertension (p = 0.019), and lower haemoglobin in women (p = 0.042) were more frequent in hospitalised patients. There was no difference in lung base CT findings between discharged and hospitalised patients (p > 0.165).

The endothelial glycocalyx plays a critical role in glomerular barrier function. In the present study, the effects of piperazine ferulate (PF) on HG-induced filtration barrier injury of glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs) were investigated and the underlying mechanism was assessed. Immunofluorescence was used to observe the distribution of the glycocalyx as well as the expression levels of syndecan-1 and Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Endothelial permeability assays were performed to assess the effects of PF on the integrity of the filtration barrier. Protein and mRNA expression levels were measured by western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analyses, respectively. In vitro experiments revealed that adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) mediated HG-induced glycocalyx degradation and endothelial barrier injury. PF inhibited the HG-induced endothelial barrier injury and restored the expression levels of heparanase-1 (Hpa-1), ZO-1 and occludin-1 by AMPK. In vivo assays demonstrated that PF reduced the expression levels of Hpa-1, increased the expression levels of ZO-1 and attenuated glycocalyx degradation in the glomerulus. These data suggested that PF attenuated HG-induced filtration barrier injury of GEnC by regulating AMPK expression.","output":"Piperazine ferulate prevents high-glucose-induced filtration barrier injury of glomerular endothelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deep Connection is an installation and virtual reality artwork made using full body 3D and 4D magnetic resonance scan datasets.

Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is a mutant type of FCoV that is characterized by causing fibrinous serositis with effusions in the pleural and abdominal cavities (wet form) and/or granulomatous-necrotizing inflammatory lesions in several organs (dry form). There have been numerous studies on FIP worldwide, whereas information about this disease in Thailand is still limited. Most studies involving molecular surveillance and evaluation of FCoV field strains have examined the genetic diversity of the spike and accessory ORF3c coding regions. Of these, the S gene is more divergent and is responsible for the two FCoV serotypes, while ORF3c harbors mutations that result either in early termination or destruction of the protein. In this study, we investigated the genetic diversity and genetic relationships among the current Thai and global FCoV strains in the accessory and nucleocapsid genes using a virus-specific PCR method. Comparative sequence analysis suggested that the Thai FCoV isolates were most closely related to strains reported in the Netherlands, the USA, and China. In the ORF3ab sequences, some Thai strains were more than 99% identical to the DF-2 prototype strain. Truncation of the 3a gene product was found in Thai FCoV strains of group 2. Amino acid deletions were observed in the N, ORF3c, and ORF7b proteins of Thai FCoV sequences. The accessory gene sequence divergence may be responsible for driving the periodic emergence and continued persistence of FCoVs in Thai domestic cat populations.

Identifying the individual oscillatory components that constitute an observed biological signal leads to profound understanding about the biological system. The instantaneous frequency (IF), the amplitude modulation (AM), and their temporal variability are widely used to describe these oscillatory phenomena. In addition, the shape of the oscillatory pattern, repeated in time for an oscillatory component, is also an important characteristic that can be parametrized appropriately. These parameters can be viewed as phenomenological surrogates for the hidden dynamics of the biological system. To estimate jointly the IF, AM, and shape, this paper applies a novel and robust time-frequency analysis tool, referred to as the synchrosqueezing transform (SST). The usefulness of the model and SST are shown directly in predicting the clinical outcome of ventilator weaning. Compared with traditional respiration parameters, the breath-to-breath variability has been reported to be a better predictor of the outcome of the weaning procedure. So far, however, all these indices normally require at least [Formula: see text] min of data acquisition to ensure predictive power. Moreover, the robustness of these indices to the inevitable noise is rarely discussed. We find that based on the proposed model, SST and only [Formula: see text] min of respiration data, the ROC area under curve of the prediction accuracy is [Formula: see text]. The high predictive power that is achieved in the weaning problem, despite a shorter evaluation period, and the stability to noise suggest that other similar kinds of signal may likewise benefit from the proposed model and SST.","output":"Evaluating Physiological Dynamics via Synchrosqueezing: Prediction of Ventilator Weaning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has widely affected healthcare systems worldwide.

The analysis of the regulatory measures impact on bank insolvency risk provides further support of the private interest view regarding the impact of market discipline. In addition to regulations, ownership structure (e.g., ownership concentration and foreign ownership) also plays a significant role in shaping the risk-taking behavior of banks in the MENA region. Our analysis reveals that the effect of banking regulations on risk-taking behavior strongly depends on the type of ownership structure prevailing in each banking system (Islamic and conventional). Our findings inform regulatory authorities concerned with improving the financial stability of banking sectors in the MENA countries and other emerging economies where Islamic and conventional banks co-exist, to carefully tailor banking reform initiatives depending on the type of the banking system as they may pursue different risk management strategies.

Despite these recommendations, limited empirical information exists on the frequency and characteristics of mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks occurring in the United States. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review to identify articles about mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks occurring in the United States from 2005 to 2014. A standard form was used to abstract information from relevant articles identified from six medical, behavioral and social science literature databases. We also analyzed data from the National Outbreaks Reporting System (NORS), maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 2009, to estimate the frequency of mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks reported to the system. RESULTS: We identified 21 published articles describing 72 mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks. Of these 72, 40 (56%) were associated with agriculture fairs and Influenza A H3N2v following probable swine exposure, and 25 (35%) with youth summer camps and pandemic Influenza A H1N1. Outbreaks of measles (n = 1) and mumps (n = 2) were linked to the international importation of disease. Between 2009 and 2013, 1,114 outbreaks were reported to NORS, including 96 respiratory disease outbreaks due to Legionella. None of these legionellosis outbreaks was linked to a mass gathering according to available data. CONCLUSION: Mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks may be uncommon in the United States, but have been reported from fairs (zoonotic transmission) as well as at camps where participants have close social contact in communal housing. International importation can also be a contributing factor. NORS collects information on certain respiratory diseases and could serve as a platform to monitor mass gathering-related respiratory outbreaks in the future.","output":"Mass Gatherings and Respiratory Disease Outbreaks in the United States C Should We Be Worried?

The genders' perceptions of opportunity, fear of failure and motivations before and during the pandemic, are employed to predict propensity to start a business during this crisis. Results comparing the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) datasets between 2019 and 2020 suggest that while pandemic has been found to affect women more severely than men, women's perceived availability of opportunities during COVID-19 emerged more tightly related to financial motivations, as their main impetus to start a business.

Prevention of viral infections by vaccination, antiviral prophylaxis, and behavioral measures is therefore of paramount importance.

EXPERT OPINION The clinical significance of the reduced humoral response following mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in SOT recipients still needs to be better clarified, in particular with regard to the vaccines' efficacy in preventing severe disease. Although a third dose improve immunogenicity and is already integrated into routine practice in several countries, further research is still needed to explore additional interventions. In the upcoming years, further data are expected to better delineate the role of virus-specific cell mediated immune monitoring for the prevention of CMV and potentially other viral diseases, and the role of the letermovir in the prevention of CMV in SOT recipients. Future studies including clinical endpoints will hopefully facilitate the integration of successful new influenza vaccination strategies into clinical practice.","output":"Prevention of viral infections in solid organ transplant recipients in the era of COVID-19: a narrative review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acknowledging the need to address fallout from the COVID\\\\19 crisis that it says has exacerbated decades\\\\long inequalities for struggling Californians, the administration of California Gov.

Colombia is no stranger to this situation, being subject to massive cancellations of medically necessary surgical procedures categorized as non vital. The objective of this study is to show the results of a program of elective essential and non-essential low and medium complexity orthopedic surgeries performed during the mitigation phase of the COVID-19 pandemic with a pre-surgical clinical protocol, without serological or molecular testing, during April, 2020 in two institutions in Bogot, Colombia. Method: ology ? :? A multicenter, observational, retrospective, descriptive study of a cohort of patients who underwent elective orthopedic surgery at two institutions in the city of Bogota, Colombia, during April 2020. We performed a preoperative clinical protocol without including serological or molecular tests, an epidemiological survey, describing the type of surgery, their score in the MeNTs (medically necessary time sensitive) scale, and the presence of suggestive symptoms of COVID-19 postoperatively. Results: ? :? A total of 179 patients underwent orthopedic surgery with an average age of 47 years (swilk= 0.021) (Shapiro-Wilk) ranging between 18 and 81 years, with a majority of females (61.5%). As for the surgeries, 86 (48%) were knee operations, 42 (23.5%) hand surgeries, 34 (19%) shoulder surgeries, and 17 (9.5%) foot and ankle surgeries. The average MeNTS of all patients was 44.6 points. During the two weeks after surgery, four patients were considered suspects for COVID-19 for presenting at least two symptoms associated with the disease representing an incidence of 2.3%. Two (1.1%) of these four patients consulted an emergency department where RT-PCR(reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) type tests were performed, obtaining a negative result for SARSCov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2). No patients died or were hospitalized for symptoms associated with COVID-19. Conclusion: ? :? Through the implementation of a pre-surgical clinical protocol (physical examination, clinical survey inquiring about signs, symptoms and epidemiological contacts), a pre-surgical isolation and without the performance of molecular or serological diagnostic tests, the present study showed good results in the performance of low and medium complexity elective orthopedic surgery at an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Wide-angle X-ray diffraction suggested that the tacticity of the PS chains on the nanoparticle surface is mainly atactic. PS-grafted-TiO nanoparticles were stably dispersed in good solvents for PS chains due to the steric repulsion between the grafted chains derived from the osmotic pressure effect and their affinity for the solvents. When the PS-grafted-TiO particles were finely dispersed, the ultraviolet absorption due to TiO was strong and the difference in absorbance between the visible and ultraviolet regions was ten or more times greater than that for non-grafted TiO. By adding PS-grafted-TiO particles with PS matrix powder in CHCl, hybrid films were prepared by solvent casting. The PS-grafted-TiO-PS hybrid films showed high transmittance in the visible light region accompanied by ultraviolet absorption characteristic of TiO due to the fine dispersion of nanoparticles in the PS matrix.

Therefore, psychiatrists and GPs are key populations where it is crucial to examine stigma, improve attitudes and reduce discrimination towards psychiatric patients. AIMS This study is the first to explore mental health-related stigma among Portuguese psychiatrists and GPs, examining the differences between these two specialities and assessing whether sociodemographic and professional variables are associated with stigma. METHOD A cross-sectional study was performed between June 2018 and August 2019. A consecutive sample of 55 Psychiatrists and 67 GPs working in Porto (Portugal) filled a 25-item self-report questionnaire to assess their attitudes towards PDMDs in clinical practice. The instrument was designed by the authors, based on previous mental health-related stigma studies and validated scales. The questionnaire includes 12 stigma dimensions (Autonomy, Coercion, Incompetence, Dangerousness, Permanence, Pity, Responsibility, Segregation, Labelling, Diagnostic Overshadowing, Shame and Parental Incompetence), and its total score was used to measure Overall Stigma (OS). Sample characteristics were examined using descriptive statistics, and the factors affecting stigma were assessed through regression analysis. RESULTS GPs exhibit significantly higher OS levels than psychiatrists, and present higher scores in the dimensions of dangerousness, parental incompetence, diagnostic overshadowing and responsibility. Besides medical speciality, several other sociodemographic variables were associated with sigma, including age, gender, having a friend with a mental disorder, professional category, agreement that Psychiatry diverges from core medicine and physician's interest in mental health topics. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that both psychiatrists and GPs hold some degree of stigmatizing attitudes towards PDMDs. Overall, these results bring new light to stigma research, and provide information to tailor anti-stigma interventions to Portuguese psychiatrists and GPs.","output":"Prescribing stigma in mental disorders: A comparative study of Portuguese psychiatrists and general practitioners."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Little is known about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination in Africa. We sought to understand Malawian healthcare workers' (HCWs') COVID-19 vaccination and its hypothesized determinants. METHODS: In March 2021, as the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out commenced in Malawi, we surveyed clinical and lay cadre HCWs (n=400) about their uptake of the vaccine and potential correlates (informed by the WHO Behavioral and Social Drivers of COVID-19 Vaccination framework). We analyzed uptake and used adjusted multivariable logistic regression models to explore how 'what people think and feel' constructs were associated with HCWs' motivation to be vaccinated. RESULTS: Of the surveyed HCWs, 82.5% had received the first COVID-19 vaccine dose. Motivation (eagerness to be vaccinated) was strongly associated with confidence in vaccine benefits (adjusted OR [aOR] 9.85, 95% CI 5.50 to 17.61) and with vaccine safety (aOR 4.60, 95% CI 2.92 to 7.23), but not with perceived COVID-19 infection risk (aOR 1.38, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.16). Of all the information sources about COVID-19 vaccination, 37.5% were reportedly negative in tone. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs in Malawi have a high motivation to be vaccinated and a high COVID-19 vaccine uptake.

Therefore, the present study was aimed at investigating whether arthroscopic optical imaging can accurately detect bacterial biofilms on prosthetic joints. METHODS Here, we applied a conjugate of the antibiotic vancomycin and the near-infrared fluorophore IRDye800CW, in short vanco-800CW, in combination with arthroscopic optical imaging to target and visualize biofilms on infected prostheses. RESULTS We show in a human post-mortem prosthetic knee infection model that a staphylococcal biofilm is accurately detected in real time and distinguished from sterile sections in high resolution.

Relying on triage scores to ration care, while relieving clinicians from making morally distressing decisions under high situational pressure, distracts clinicians from what is essentially deeply humanistic issues entrenched in this protracted public health crisis. Such an approach will become increasingly untenable as countries flatten their epidemic curves. Decisions regarding ICU admission are particularly challenging in older people, who are most likely to require critical care, but for whom benefits are most uncertain. Before applying score-based triage, physicians must first discern if older people will benefit from critical care (beneficence) and second, if he wants critical care (autonomy). When deliberating beneficence, physicians should steer away from solely using age-stratified survival probabilities from epidemiological data. Instead, decisions must be based on individualised risk-stratification that encompasses evidence-based predictors of adverse outcomes specific to older adults. Survival will also need to be weighed against burden of treatment, as well as longer-term functional deficits and quality-of-life. By identifying the robust older people who may benefit from critical care, clinicians should proceed to elicit his values and preferences that would determine the treatment most aligned with his best interest. During these dialogues, physicians must truthfully convey the emergent clinical reality, discern the older persons therapeutic goals and discuss the feasibility of achieving them.

This study was undertaken during the height of the Australian pandemic (H1N1) 2009 outbreak to measure self-reported willingness to comply with physician recommendations to stay home for seven days, and to compare responses for the current strain of pandemic influenza, avian influenza, seasonal influenza, and the common cold. METHODS: Data were collected as part of the Queensland Social Survey (QSS) 2009, which consisted of a standardized introduction, 37 demographic questions, and research questions incorporated through a cost-sharing arrangement. Four questions related to respondents' anticipated compliance with a physician's advice to stay home if they had a common cold, seasonal influenza, pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza or avian influenza were incorporated into QSS 2009, with responses recorded using a balanced Likert scale ranging from \\"very unlikely\\" to \\"very likely.\\" Discordance between responses for different diseases was analysed using McNemar's test. Associations between demographic variables and anticipated compliance were analysed using Pearson's chi-square or chi-square for linear-by-linear association, and confirmed using multivariate logistic regression; p < 0.05 was used to establish statistical significance. RESULTS: Self-reported anticipated compliance increased from 59.9% for the common cold to 71.3% for seasonal influenza (p < .001), and to 95.0% for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza and 94.7% for avian influenza (p < 0.001 for both versus seasonal influenza). Anticipated compliance did not differ for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and avian influenza (p = 0.815). Age and sex were both associated with anticipated compliance in the setting of seasonal influenza and the common cold. Notably, 27.1% of health and community service workers would not comply with physician advice to stay home for seasonal influenza. CONCLUSIONS: Ninety-five percent of people report they would comply with a physicians' advice to stay home for seven days if they are diagnosed with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 or avian influenza, but only 71% can be expected to comply in the setting of seasonal influenza and fewer still can be expected to comply if they are diagnosed with a common cold.

METHODS: A multi-institutional retrospective study was performed by querying the electronic health records at nine children's hospitals. Patients who sustained traumatic injuries while vaping from January 2016 through December 2019 were identified. Patient demographics, injury characteristics, and the details of trauma management were reviewed. RESULTS: 15 children sustained traumatic injuries due to e-cigarette explosion. The median age was 17 y (range 13-18). The median injury severity score was 2 (range 1-5). Three patients reported that their injury coincided with their first vaping experience. Ten patients required hospital admission, three of whom required intensive care unit admission. Admitted patients had a median length of stay of 3 d (range 1-6). The injuries sustained were: facial burns (6), loss of multiple teeth (5), thigh and groin burns (5), hand burns (4), ocular burns (4), a radial nerve injury, a facial laceration, and a mandible fracture.

Objective: To assess hospital discharge rates, demographic factors, and outcomes of hospitalization associated with the COVID-19 pandemic among US patients with IS before vs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used data from the Vizient Clinical Data Base on 324a?013 patients with IS at 478 nonfederal hospitals in 43 US states between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. Patients were eligible if they were admitted to the hospital on a nonelective basis and were not receiving hospice care at the time of admission. A total of 41 166 discharged between January and March 2020 were excluded from the analysis because they had unreliable data on COVID-19 status, leaving 282 847 patients for the study. Exposure: Ischemic stroke and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Monthly counts of discharges among patients with IS in 2020. Demographic characteristics and outcomes, including in-hospital death, among patients with IS who were discharged in 2019 (control group) were compared with those of patients with IS with or without comorbid COVID-19 (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups, respectively) who were discharged between April and December 2020. Results: Of the 282 847 patients included in the study, 165 912 (50.7% male; 63.4% White; 26.3% aged &#8805;80 years) were allocated to the control group; 111 418 of 116 935 patients (95.3%; 51.9% male; 62.8% White; 24.6% aged &#8805;80 years) were allocated to the non-COVID-19 group and 5517 of 116 935 patients (4.7%; 58.0% male; 42.5% White; 21.3% aged &#8805;80 years) to the COVID-19 group. A mean (SD) of 13a?846 (553) discharges per month among patients with IS was reported in 2019. Discharges began decreasing in February 2020, reaching a low of 10a?846 patients in April 2020 before returning to a prepandemic level of 13a?639 patients by July 2020. A mean (SD) of 13a?492 (554) discharges per month was recorded for the remainder of 2020. Black and Hispanic patients accounted for 21.4% and 7.0% of IS discharges in 2019, respectively, but accounted for 27.5% and 16.0% of those discharged with IS and comorbid COVID-19 in 2020. Compared with patients in the control and non-COVID-19 groups, those in the COVID-19 group were less likely to smoke (16.0% vs 17.2% vs 6.4%, respectively) and to have hypertension (73.0% vs 73.1% vs 68.2%) or dyslipidemia (61.2% vs 63.2% vs 56.6%) but were more likely to have diabetes (39.8% vs 40.5% vs 53.0%), obesity (16.2% vs 18.4% vs 24.5%), acute coronary syndrome (8.0% vs 9.2% vs 15.8%), or pulmonary embolus (1.9% vs 2.4% vs 6.8%) and to require intubation (11.3% vs 12.3% vs 37.6%).

Here, we present reconstituted viral envelopes (virosomes) derived from influenza virus as suitable vehicles for in vitro as well as in vivo delivery of siRNAs. Virosomes are vesicles that bear in their membrane the influenza virus spike protein hemagglutinin (HA). This protein mediates binding of native virus to and fusion with cellular target membranes. Accordingly, virosomes with membrane-incorporated HA bind to cells, are taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and fuse with the endosomal membrane to release their contents into the cytoplasm. When complexed to cationic lipids, siRNA was successfully encapsulated in virosomes. Virosomes with encapsulated siRNA fused with target membranes in a pH-dependent manner and delivered the encapsulated siRNA to several cell lines in vitro. Virosome-delivered siRNA markedly downregulated the synthesis of newly induced and constitutively expressed green fluorescent protein. Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of siRNA-loaded virosomes resulted in delivery of the nucleotides to cells in the peritoneal cavity. Our results indicate that virosomes are a promising delivery device for in vivo application, especially where topical administration of siRNA, for example, to the respiratory tract is envisaged.","output":"Reconstituted influenza virus envelopes as an efficient carrier system for cellular delivery of small-interfering RNAs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This symposium will present four 2020 Editors Choice articles from the Journal of Gerontology Medical Sciences that focus on issues relevant to vulnerable older populations.

An early report from newly established laboratory\\\\based influenza surveillance in Lao PDR. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 4(2), 47C52. Background Prior to 2007, little information was available about the burden of influenza in Laos. We report data from the first laboratory\\\\based influenza surveillance system established in the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic. Methods Three hospitals in the capital city of Vientiane began surveillance for influenza\\\\like illness (ILI) in outpatients in 2007 and expanded to include hospitalized pneumonia patients in 2008. Nasal/throat swab specimens were collected and tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses by multiplex ID\\\\Tag(TM) respiratory viral panel (RVP) assay on a Luminex? 100 MAP IS instrument (Qiagen, Singapore). Results During January 2007 to December 2008, 287 of 526 (546%) outpatients with ILI were positive for at least one respiratory virus. Influenza was most commonly identified, with 63 (120%) influenza A and 92 (175%) influenza B positive patients identified. In 2008, six of 79 (76%) hospitalized pneumonia patients were positive for influenza A and four (51%) were positive for influenza B. Children <5 years represented 19% of viral infections in outpatients and 38% of pneumonia inpatients. Conclusion Our results provide the first documentation of influenza burden among patients with febrile respiratory illness and pneumonia requiring hospitalization in Laos. Implementing laboratory\\\\based influenza surveillance requires substantial investments in infrastructure and training. However, continuing outbreaks of avian influenza A/H5N1 in poultry and emergence of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic strain further underscore the importance of establishing and maintaining influenza surveillance in developing countries.","output":"An early report from newly established laboratory\\\\based influenza surveillance in Lao PDR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bacterial components and cytokines induce Interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) expression in monocytes. Aberrant low IL-7R expression of monocytes has been identified as a feature of tuberculosis immunopathology. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying IL-7R regulation of monocytes and tuberculosis serum effects IL-7R expression. Serum samples from tuberculosis patients and healthy controls, cytokine candidates, and mycobacterial components were analyzed for in vitro effects on IL-7R expression of primary monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), and monocyte cell lines. IL-7R regulation during culture and the role of FoxO1 was characterized. In vitro activation induced IL-7R expression in human monocytes and serum samples from tuberculosis patients boosted IL-7R expression. Although pathognomonic tuberculosis cytokines were not associated with serum effects, we identified cytokines (i.e., GM-CSF, IL-1?, TNF, IFN?3) that induced IL-7R expression in monocytes and/or MDM comparable to mycobacterial components. Blocking of cytokine subsets (i.e., IL-1?/TNF in monocytes, GM-CSF in MDM) largely diminished IL-7R expression induced by mycobacterial components. Finally, we showed that in vitro induced IL-7R expression was transient and dependent on constitutive FoxO1 expression in primary monocytes and monocyte cell lines.

It is unknown whether ethanol-induced alterations in nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) cholinergic projections to the BLA mediate anxiety-related behaviors through direct modulation of GABA and glutamate afferents. Following 10 days of CIE exposure and 24 hours of withdrawal, we recorded GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic responses in BLA pyramidal neurons with electrophysiology, assessed total protein expression of cholinergic markers, and quantified acetylcholine and choline concentrations using a colorimetric assay. We measured &#945; 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) dependent modulation of presynaptic function at distinct inputs in AIR- and CIE-exposed BLA coronal slices as a functional read-out of cholinergic neurotransmission. CIE/withdrawal upregulates the endogenous activity of &#945; 7 nAChRs, facilitating release at both GABAergic' local' interneuron and glutamatergic synaptic responses to stria terminalis (ST) stimulation, with no effect at GABAergic lateral paracapsular cells. CIE caused a three-fold increase in BLA acetylcholine concentration, with no changes in &#945; 7 nAChR or cholinergic marker expression. These data illustrate that &#945; 7 nAChR-dependent changes in presynaptic function serve as a proxy for CIE-dependent alterations in synaptic acetylcholine levels. Thus, cholinergic projections appear to mediate CIE-induced alterations at GABA/glutamate inputs.","output":"Chronic ethanol exposure potentiates cholinergic neurotransmission in the basolateral amygdala"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores asymmetric interdependencies between the twelve largest cryptocurrency and Gold returns, over the period January 2015 C June 2020 within a NARDL (nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag) framework We focus our analysis on the epicentre of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic from March 2020 to June 2020 During this crisis, cryptocurrencies are more correlated and more of them have returns that are cointegrated with Gold returns Moreover, cryptocurrencies develop a long-term as well as a short-term asymmetric response to Gold returns during the COVID-19 period where most cryptocurrency returns respond more to negative changes and exhibit more persistence with Gold returns Overall, our most important result confirms that the connectedness between Gold price returns and cryptocurrency returns increase in economic turmoil, such as during the COVID-19 crisis","output":"Asymmetric interdependencies between large capital cryptocurrency and Gold returns during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is reported in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and influenza infection independently, usually associated with noninvasive and mechanical ventilation.

A thoracoscopic esophagectomy may minimize injury to the chest wall and reduce surgical invasiveness. Conventional thoracoscopic procedures are performed in the left lateral-decubitus position. Recently, procedures performed in the prone position have received more attention because of improvements in operative exposure or surgeon ergonomics. However, the efficacy of the prone position in an aggressive thoracoscopic esophagectomy with an extensive lymphadenectomy has not been fully documented. METHODS We successfully performed a thoracoscopic esophagectomy with a three-field extensive lymphadenectomy in 43 esophageal carcinoma patients in the prone position from December 2007 to December 2009. We describe our procedures with the patients in the prone position, focusing especially on a lymphadenectomy along the left recurrent laryngeal nerve where the nodes are frequently involved and precise dissection is technically challenging. To determine further the advantages of this position, we retrospectively compared surgical outcomes in 43 patients to those of 34 patients who underwent a thoracoscopic esophagectomy in the left lateral decubitus position as a historical control from January 2006 to November 2007. RESULTS It was easier to explore the operative field around the left recurrent laryngeal nerve during a thoracoscopic esophagectomy in the prone position. The mean duration of the aggressive thoracoscopic procedure in the prone position was 307 min, which was significantly longer than in the left lateral decubitus position, but the total estimated blood loss in the prone position was significantly lower. There was no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications between the two procedures. CONCLUSIONS A thoracoscopic esophagectomy in the prone position is technically safe and feasible and provides better surgeon ergonomics and better operative exposure around the left recurrent laryngeal nerve during an aggressive esophagectomy.","output":"Lymphadenectomy along the left recurrent laryngeal nerve by a minimally invasive esophagectomy in the prone position for thoracic esophageal cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A series of 2-substituted benzoxazinones were synthesized and subjected to anti-human coronavirus and ICAM-1 expression inhibition assays.

Radiotherapy is commonly used to treat breast cancer, reducing the risk of recurrence after surgery.

Recently, lipid droplets (LDs) have been proposed as functional markers of cancer stem cells, also being involved in increased cell tumorigenicity. LD biogenesis is a multistep process requiring various enzymes, including Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2). In this context, we evaluated the effect of PF-06424439, a selective DGAT2 inhibitor, on MCF7 breast cancer cells exposed to X-rays. Our results demonstrated that 72 h of PF-06424439 treatment reduced LD content and inhibited cell migration, without affecting cell proliferation. Interestingly, PF-06424439 pre-treatment followed by radiation was able to enhance radiosensitivity of MCF7 cells. In addition, the combined treatment negatively interfered with lipid metabolism-related genes, as well as with EMT gene expression, and modulated the expression of typical markers associated with the CSC-like phenotype.

Our aim was to assess whether airway gene expression of mediators of pulmonary epithelial sodium and liquid absorption, and further, respiratory morbidity, associate with cord blood GC concentrations. METHODS: The study included 64 infants delivered <32 weeks gestation. Cortisol and betamethasone in umbilical cord blood were quantified with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The total GC concentration was calculated. Gene expression of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), Na,K-ATPase, and serum- and GC-inducible kinase 1 at <2 h and at 1 day postnatally in nasal epithelial cell samples was quantified with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The mean oxygen supplementation during the first 72 h was calculated. RESULTS: Concentrations of cord blood betamethasone and total GC were significantly lower in infants with RDS and correlated with mean oxygen supplementation. Expression of ENaC and 1- and 1Na,K-ATPase at <2 h correlated with betamethasone and total GC concentrations. Expression of Na,K-ATPase was lower in infants with RDS. CONCLUSION: Enhancement of lung liquid absorption via increased expression of sodium transporters may contribute to the beneficial pulmonary effects of antenatal GCs. IMPACT: RDS is related to lower umbilical cord blood GC concentrations and lower airway expression of sodium transporters. In addition to the timing of antenatal GC treatment, resulting concentrations may be of importance in preventing RDS. Induction of sodium transport may be a factor contributing to the pulmonary response to antenatal GCs.","output":"Glucocorticoids, sodium transport mediators, and respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this chapter, the understanding of circularity goes beyond material resource management, deepening the spatial implications of a more circular management and use of wastescapes, investigated at the urban and metropolitan scale.

In this situation, the spaces most at risk of urban and peri-urban areas could be found in the unresolved places which are defined as wastescapes, since they are in general still poorly used and valued. Building on the European H2020 research project REPAiR, the definition of wastescapes, provided in this study, builds upon work for two main cases: the metropolitan areas of Amsterdam (The Netherlands) and Naples (Italy). Wastescapes are discarded territories, however, they can also be understood as opportunities to realize regenerative concepts and support strategies related to environmental, spatial and social challenges of the territories and their surroundings. Core is then to improve the socio-ecological values of such territories. Wastescapes are different case by case, being affected by site-specific challenges and characterized by high complexity. The research presented in this chapter shows that the route towards a Circular Economy requires the consideration of wastescapes as spatial resources important to be included in strategies of transition. It represents a fundamental step to overcome problems related to both resource (and land) scarcity, land use in general and spatial fragmentation, while providing opportunities to include through eco-innovative services other values than just the monetary ones to society. The spatial regeneration of wastescapes in the built environment involves a re-thinking of the structure of these areas in a larger (metropolitan) context. Within such metropolitan settings, in particular peri-urban territories, also referred to as the areas in-between urban and rural landscapes, are most affected and characterized by this problem of wastescapes. ? 2022, The Author(s).","output":"From Wastescapes Towards Regenerative Territories.

RESULTS: Fear of loneliness and infection weigh heavily on palliative care patients. Most patients wanted to avoid hospitalization due to increased risk of infection. Protective measures of SAPV gave them a sense of security and were accepted despite restrictions on personal contact. Modern forms of communication were useful but could not replace personal contact. CONCLUSION: The pandemic led to changes in SAPV and had an impact on the social environment of palliative care patients. Protective measures are important for the sense of security of palliative care patients under care. The quality of care provided by the SAPV structure adapted to COVID-19 is usually not perceived by patients as having deteriorated. Fears of social isolation are highly valued by palliative care patients and can be reduced by SAPV. Personal contact with SAPV cannot be replaced by modern communication options, although patients do accept telemedicine as an emergency solution.","output":"SAPV-Patienten in der COVID-19-Krise: Eine interviewbasierte Studie ber Erfahrungen von Palliativpatienten"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of acute pulmonary embolism (APE) in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients referred to CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) by the emergency department. METHODS: From March 14 to April 6, 2020, 72 non-hospitalized patients referred by the emergency department to CTPA for COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively identified. Relevant clinical and laboratory data and CT scan findings were collected for each patient. CTPA scans were reviewed by two radiologists to determinate the presence or absence of APE. Clinical classification, lung involvement of COVID-19 pneumonia, and CT total severity score were compared between APE group and non-APE group. RESULTS: APE was identified in 13 (18%) CTPA scans. The mean age and D-dimer of patients from the APE group were higher in comparison with those from the non-APE group (74.4 vs. 59.6 years, p = 0.008, and 7.29 vs. 3.29 g/ml, p = 0.011). There was no significant difference between APE and non-APE groups concerning clinical type, COVID-19 pneumonia lung lesions (ground-glass opacity: 85% vs. 97%; consolidation: 69% vs. 68%; crazy paving: 38% vs. 37%; linear reticulation: 69% vs. 78%), CT severity score (6.3 vs. 7.1, p = 0.365), quality of CTPA (1.8 vs. 2.0, p = 0.518), and pleural effusion (38% vs. 19%, p = 0.146). CONCLUSIONS: Non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia referred to CT scan by the emergency departments are at risk of APE. The presence of APE was not limited to severe or critical clinical type of COVID-19 pneumonia. KEY POINTS: a? Acute pulmonary embolism was found in 18% of non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients referred by the emergency department to CTPA. Two (15%) patients had main, four (30%) lobar, and seven (55%) segmental acute pulmonary embolism. a? Five of 13 (38%) patients with acute pulmonary embolism had a moderate clinical type. a? Severity and radiological features of COVID-19 pneumonia showed no significant difference between patients with or without acute pulmonary embolism.","output":"Acute pulmonary embolism in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients referred to CTPA by emergency department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the last decade, conflict or natural disasters have displaced unprecedented numbers of persons. This leads to conditions prone to outbreaks that imperil the health of displaced persons and threaten global health security. Past literature has minimally examined the association of communicable disease outbreaks with complex emergencies (CEs) and natural disasters (NDs). METHODS: To examine this association, we identified CEs and NDs using publicly available datasets from the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters and United Nations Flash and Consolidated Appeals archive for 2005C2014. We identified outbreaks from World Health Organization archives. We compared findings to identify overlap of outbreaks, including their types (whether or not of a vaccine-preventable disease), and emergency event types (CE, ND, or Both) by country and year using descriptive statistics and measure of association. RESULTS: There were 167 CEs, 912 NDs, 118 events linked to Both types of emergencies, and 384 outbreaks. Of CEs, 43% were associated with an outbreak; 24% NDs were associated with an outbreak; and 36% of Both types of emergencies were associated with an outbreak. Africa was disproportionately affected, where 67% of total CEs, 67% of Both events (CE and ND), and 46% of all outbreaks occurred for the study period. The odds ratio of a vaccine-preventable outbreak occurring in a CE versus an ND was 4.14 (95% confidence limits 1.9, 9.4). CONCLUSIONS: CEs had greater odds of being associated with outbreaks compared with NDs. Moreover, CEs had high odds of a vaccine-preventable disease causing that outbreak. Focusing on better vaccine coverage could reduce CE-associated morbidity and mortality by preventing outbreaks from spreading.","output":"Public health implications of complex emergencies and natural disasters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral infectious diseases have been seriously threatening human health. The receptor binding is the first step of viral infection. Predicting virus-receptor interactions will be helpful for the interaction mechanism of viruses and receptors, and further find some effective ways of preventing and treating viral infectious diseases so as to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by viruses. Some computation algorithms have been proposed for identifying potential virus-receptor interactions. However, a common problem in those methods is the presence of noise in the similarity network. A new computational model (Network Enhancement and the Regularized Least Squares [NERLS]) is proposed to predict virus-receptor interactions based on improving similarities by Network Enhancement (NE). NERLS integrates the virus sequence similarity, the receptor sequence similarity and known virus-receptor interactions. We compute the virus sequence similarity and known virus-receptor interactions to construct the virus similarity network. The receptor similarity network is constructed by the Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity and the receptor sequence similarity. To obtain the final virus similarity network and the final receptor similarity network, NE is, respectively, applied for reducing the noise of the virus similarity network and the receptor similarity network. Finally, NERLS employs the regularized least squares to predict interactions of viruses and receptors. The experiment results show that NERLS achieves the area under curve value of 0.893 and 0.921 in 10-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation, respectively, which is consistently superior to four related methods [which include Initial interaction scores method via the neighbors and the Laplacian regularized Least Square (IILLS), Bi-random walk on a heterogeneous network (BRWH), Laplacian regularized least squares classifier (LapRLS), and Collaborative matrix factorization (CMF)]. Furthermore, a case study also demonstrates that NERLS effectively predicts potential virus-receptor interactions.","output":"Prediction of Virus-Receptor Interactions Based on Improving Similarities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has within its short time since identification has caused major mortality and morbidity in our communities Obese patients seem to have poorer outcomes amongst COVID-19 patients, based on observational studies We conducted a study to analyze if there were any statistical differences in the outcomes and inflammatory markers between non-obese and obese COVID-19 inpatients METHODS: A single center, retrospective observational study obtaining data from all COVID-19 positive patients admitted to an urban tertiary care center in New Jersey between March 15th, 2020 to April 16th, 2020 Patients with BMI of 29 9 kg/m2 and below were classified as non-obese and all patients BMI of 30 kg/m2 and above, as obese The primary outcomes of death and discharge rates between the two groups, were compared using Chi-square test The secondary outcomes that were analyzed included admission to the ICU, the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and the incidence of shock We also looked at the commonly used markers including CRP, ferritin, IL-6, LDH and D-dimer RESULTS: Data from 900 patients were included analyzed, of which 547 (60 8%) patients were non-obese and 353 (39 2%) were obese There were no statistically significant differences noted in primary outcomes of death (41 4% (n=226) vs 40 8% (n=144), p= 0 9472) or in discharge from the hospital (58 6% (n=321) vs 59 2% (n=209), p=0 9559) between non obese and obese patients 38% of obese patients were admitted to the ICU vs 31 4% of non obese patients 33 1% of obese patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation over 25 4% non-obese patients More obese patients (25 2% vs 21 3%) went into shock However, the differences between the groups were not statistically significant When comparing inflammatory markers, CRP and LDH seemed significantly elevated in obese patients (mean CRP (205 6 vs 198 4, p=0 493) and mean LDH (643 5 vs 601 3, p=0 792)) However, they were not statistically significant and similarly other markers including IL-6, ferritin and D-dimer did not show any major differences as well CONCLUSIONS: Obese patients did not reveal a statistically significant difference in primary outcomes of death vs discharge and the need for ICU, mechanical ventilation or incidence of shock in comparison to non obese patients in our study","output":"A comparison between obese and non-obese COVID-19 patients in an urban hospital in new jersey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 54-year-old woman is reported with severe pulsatile tinnitus.

This contact with conspecifics is essential for their evolution and survival. Among the recommendations to reduce transmission of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for COVID-19 are social distancing and home confinement. These measures may negatively affect the social life and, consequently, the emotional state and eating behavior of individuals. We assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the anxiety, premenstrual symptoms, and eating behavior of young women. Data collection was conducted in person (prepandemicfrom March to December 2019) and online (during the pandemicAugust 2020). A total of 71 participants, average age of 21.26 years (SD = 0.41), took part in the study. Trait anxiety during the pandemic was significantly lower than in the prepandemic period. Investigation of the anxiety/stress symptom of the Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST) revealed that this symptom was more severe before the pandemic. There was a decline in the desire for sweet and fatty foods during the pandemic. However, craving for traditional foods rose significantly in the same period. Uncontrolled and emotional eating were significantly lower during the pandemic. The results suggest that the pandemic may have had a positive impact on anxiety and eating behavior of the participants, which may be due to differences between urban and rural populations and the latter living with their families. These findings are important for raising a discussion regarding the effects of the current environment on the regulation of cognitive and dietary adaptations.","output":"Effects of Social Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic on Anxiety and Eating BehaviorA Longitudinal Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Because liver cancer cells express the ACE2 viral receptor, they are widely used as models of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression and localization in human liver cancers and in non-tumor livers. We studied ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in transcriptomic datasets totaling 1503 liver cancers, followed by high-resolution confocal multiplex immunohistochemistry and quantitative image analysis of a 41-HCC tissue microarray. In cancers, we detected ACE2 and TMPRSS2 at the biliary pole of tumor hepatocytes. In whole mount sections of five normal liver samples, we identified ACE2 in hepatocytes bile canaliculi, biliary epithelium, sinusoidal and capillary endothelial cells. Tumors carrying mutated -catenin showed ACE2 DNA hypomethylation and higher mRNA and protein expression, consistently with predicted -catenin response sites in the ACE2 promoter. Finally, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression networks highlighted hepatocyte-specific functions, oxidative stress and inflammation, suggesting a link between inflammation, ACE2 dysfunction and metabolic breakdown.","output":"Well-differentiated liver cancers reveal the potential link between ACE2 dysfunction and metabolic breakdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Packaging is necessary for preserving and delivering products and has significant impacts on human health and the environment. Particle matter (PM) may be released from packages and transferred to the air during a typical peeling process, but little is known about this package-to-air migration route of particles. Here, we investigated the emission profiles of total and biological particles, and the horizontal and vertical dispersion abilities and community structure of viable microbes released from packaging to the air by peeling. The results revealed that a lot of inhalable particles and viable microbes were released from package to the air in different migration directions, and this migration can be regulated by several factors including package material, effective peeling area, peeling speed and angles, as well as the characteristics of the migrant itself. Dispersal of package-borne viable microbes provides direct evidence that viable microbes, including pathogens, can survive the aerosolization caused by peeling and be transferred to air over different distances while remaining alive. Based on the experimental data and visual proof in movies, we speculate that nonbiological particles are package fibers fractured and released to air by the external peeling force exerted on the package and that microbe dispersal is attributed to surface-borne microbe suspension by vibration caused by the peeling force. This investigation provides new information that aerosolized particles can deliver package-borne substances and viable microbes from packaging to the ambient environment, motivating further studies to characterize the health effects of such aerosolized particles and the geographic migration of microbes via packaging.","output":"Release of inhalable particles and viable microbes to the air during packaging peeling: Emission profiles and mechanisms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Fellow Case Reports INTRODUCTION: MIS-C is described as a clinical syndrome developing secondary to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children and adolescents. The presentation is similar to Kawasaki syndrome, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and toxic shock syndrome. We present a case of MIS-C in a young adult two weeks after receiving vaccination for COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: 21 year old female with a past medical history of asthma who presented to the emergency department (ED) with fevers, chills and photophobia since receiving the J&J COVID-19 vaccine 2 weeks prior. On evaluation, COVID test was negative. Labs were notable for leukopenia, elevated liver enzymes. She as admitted to the medical floor. Her course was complicated by worsening transaminases >2000 IU/L with progressive encephalopathy. She had witnessed seizure activity requiring intubation and transfer to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Computed Tomography (CT) abdomen was unremarkable. Head CT showed no acute abnormalities. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed diffuse nonspecific white matter signal abnormalities. Additional labwork revealed ferritin of 937 mcg/L, and CRP of 47.3 mg/L and an elevated NT-proBNP. Film array and hepatitis panel was negative. COVID spike and nucleocapsid antibodies were both positive. She underwent a liver biopsy which was consistent with acute hepatitis and bone marrow biopsy which was negative for HLH. Lumbar puncture with elevated opening pressure of 27 cm H20. Extensive infectious workup for bacterial, fungal and viral etiologies were negative. She met criteria for MIS-C/A. She received high dose Intravenous Dexamethasone, Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) and anakinra infusion. Her labwork and encephalopathy improved and she was discharged home. DISCUSSION: MISC-C/A is seen in patients presenting 3 to 5 days after an asymptomatic or mild COVID infection. It is unclear whether the inflammatory response seen in our patient was secondary to a recent asymptomatic COVID infection, her vaccination or both. Cases have been mostly reported in children and patients under 21 years of age. Presentation is usually associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, evidence of mucocutaneous inflammation (rash, conjunctivitis, oromucosal changes), lymphopenia, and high levels of circulating inflammation. The goals of treatment for MIS-C are to decrease systemic inflammation and restore organ function, with use of high dose steroids, IVIG or anakinra. CONCLUSIONS: It is currently unknown if MIS-C/A might follow CVOID immunization, but a need exists to define this potential entity for monitoring as a potential adverse event. It is also important to maintain an index of suspicion for this disorder in the adult post-covid population.

Blood and respiratory culture results were abstracted and adjudicated by multiple authors. The primary outcome was the rate of bacteremia. We secondarily looked to define clinical or laboratory features associated with bacteremia. RESULTS: There were 542 patients admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an average age of 62.8 years. Of these, 395 had blood cultures performed upon admission, with six true positive results (1.1% of the total population). An additional 14 patients had positive respiratory cultures treated as true pathogens in the first 72 h. Low blood pressure and elevated white blood cell count, neutrophil count, blood urea nitrogen, and lactate were statistically significantly associated with bacteremia.

MGF360 genes have been implicated in the modulation of the IFN-I response. The molecular mechanisms contributing to innate immunity are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that ASFV MGF360-12L (MGF360 families 12L protein) significantly inhibited the mRNA transcription and promoter activity of IFN- and NF-B, accompanied by decreases of IRF3, STING, TBK1, ISG54, ISG56 and AP-1 mRNA transcription. Also, MGF360-12L might suppress the nuclear localization of p50 and p65 mediated by classical nuclear localization signal (NLS). Additionally, MGF360-12L could interact with KPNA2, KPNA3, and KPNA4, which interrupted the interaction between p65 and KPNA2, KPNA3, KPNA4. We further found that MGF360-12L could interfere with the NF-B nuclear translocation by competitively inhibiting the interaction between NF-B and nuclear transport proteins. These findings suggested that MGF360-12L could inhibit the IFN-I production by blocking the interaction of importin  and NF-B signaling pathway, which might reveal a novel strategy for ASFV to escape the host innate immune response.

We present the case of a 50-year-old lady with recurrent microvascular and macrovascular thromboses who was initially treated with endovascular stents and amputation progressing to require immunosuppression and anticoagulation, to include steroids, rituximab, intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old lady presented to the Emergency Department with bilateral leg and abdominal pain. Her co-morbidities included type two diabetes, psoriasis, three miscarriages, borderline personality disorder and a heavy smoking history. Clinical examination revealed pulse deficits in the distal lower limbs with gangrene evidence of ischaemia on her toe digits. CT angiogram demonstrated complete thrombus of the Infrarenal abdominal aorta extending to the common iliac and external iliac arteries bilaterally. Thrombolysis ensued and an aortic stent was inserted with symptom relief. Two weeks later readmission occurred with bilateral leg pain; Ultrasound Doppler revealed a tight stenosis at the distal aortic region. Initial management consisted of Intravenous heparin but worsening ischaemia resulted in insertion of kissing stents at the aortic bifurcation. The patients pain settled with no residual arterial compromise. One month later the patient was re-admitted with bilateral leg pain and necrotic right toes; this led to a right forefoot amputation. A triphasic bilateral finger colour change was noted with ischaemic pain and livedo reticularis on lower limbs, with a decision to institute Iloprost and methylprednisolone ensued. Antiphospholipid antibodies returned showing triple positivity. Management subsequently included addition of IV rituximab, plasma exchange, IVIG and sildenafil. Two months later the patient was re-admitted with complete lower limb paralysis due to a complete thrombus of the aortic bi-iliac stent; thrombolysis ensued with good result. A further admission 1- month later occurred due to sepsis and an infected necrotic left forefoot resulting in an above knee amputation. No further endovascular stenting was advised to risk of embolic seeding following medical management. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: We have described a case of cAPS on a previously asymptomatic female patient who presented with diffuse peripheral and central thromboses. Our patient suffered from intra-abdominal organ infarction and subsequent acute kidney injury, recurrent arterial and venous occlusion over a period of 12 months and previous pulmonary emboli. Livedo reticularis and gangrene were visible cutaneous manifestations of this disorder on our patient. cAPS accounts for less than 1% of APS and has a high mortality of 50% which means early and frequent discussion with specialist centres is important. In addition to the clinical features described in our patient, laboratory features included moderate thrombocytopaenia and evidence of haemolysis (raised bilirubin and LDH). The cAPS registry demonstrates that the majority of patients are female (72%) with a mean age of 37 years, 46% have primary APS, 40% suffer from SLE and 9% from other autoimmune diseases. This patient does not have a secondary autoimmune condition. The most common clinical features to present before cAPS develops include foetal loss, previous DVT or thrombocytopaenia, two of which our patient demonstrated. The prognosis and clinical features of cAPS have been shown to depend on the extent of thrombosis, organs affected and the presence of a systemic immune response from affected tissues. Treatment options available for cAPS consist of multiorgan support, anticoagulation and immunosuppression, in the form of glucocorticoids, rituximab, IV Immunoglobulin and plasma exchange. Our patient required all of these due to accelerating thrombosis as determined by new gangrene, ongoing livedo reticularis rash and thrombocytopenia. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: Our case demonstrates the importance of keeping a high index of suspicion for cAPS as up to 46% will have this as their first presenting feature of APS  including our patient. On her admission to hospital particular attention was paid to clinical examination which suggested Raynauds and a skin rash consistent with livedo reticularis  this prompted a rheumatology consult, serology testing, starting Iloprost and tertiary centre transfer. The diagnosis was secure with high titre of IgG anticardiolipin antibody, anti Beta-2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies and Lupus Anticoagulant detected  all on two occasions more than 12 weeks apart. Patients may present to surgical specialties in view of peripheral vascular symptoms and signs. It would be appropriate to identify patients with APS early to prevent multiple surgeries or considerations for endovascular stents, as they are frequently not successful. This case highlights the need for discussion and education within the multi-disciplinary setting for patients with APS, including surgical teams.

We aimed to characterize the impact of the number of imported cases and the implementation of first-level emergency response (FLER) policy. METHODS: A SCQIHR switching model was constructed and verified by the complete phased data of COVID-19 in Chongqing in 2020. Then it was used to investigate the impact of the number of imported cases and the timing of FLER. Lastly, it was evaluated by three actual scenarios in Chongqing in 2021. RESULTS: The proposed model can fit the multidimensional time series well. After the implementation of FLER, the mean effective reproduction number, contact rate and misdetection rate were decreased significantly, but the quarantine rate for close contacts and isolation rate for non-hospitalized infectious cases were increased significantly. The peaks of quarantined close contacts and hospitalized infectious cases increased linearly with the increase of the number of imported cases and the lag of FLER time, which was verified by three actual scenarios in Chongqing in 2021.

Animals lose their natural habitats due to extensive landscape changes, consequently crowding them together and increasing their interaction with humans. Additionally, it is also important to emphasise the increasing concern on climate change because climate can modify the distribution and intensity of other diseases such as vector-borne disease. Unfortunately, the global resources for biodiversity conservation were diluted by government support for activities harmful to the environment. A tragic example is from the Amazon rainforest, that experienced fast environmental depletion and high social inequalities. Extractive systems and extensive land use on a large scale have induced deforestation, great loss of biodiversity, carbon emission, and water contamination, leading to indigenous land dispossession, violence, and rural-urban migration. The deforested areas in the Amazon region increase considerably at an alarming speed each year. The COVID-19 pandemic is an evidence to show how viruses and pathogens move further and faster than before, which means we must also show a quick response. It requires financing and, mostly, changes in human behaviour.

However, these studies have been mostly performed in patients admitted to the hospital and hence likely already (severely) affected. Another suggested approach uses prophylactic (H)CQ treatment aimed at preventing either severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection or the development of disease. A substantial number of clinical trials are planned or underway aimed at assessing the prophylactic benefit of (H)CQ. However, (H)CQ may lead to QT prolongation and potentially induce life-threatening arrhythmias. This may be of particular relevance to patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease and those taking other QT-prolonging drugs. In addition, it is known that a certain percentage of the population carries genetic variant(s) that reduces their repolarization reserve, predisposing them to (H)CQ-induced QT prolongation, and this may be more relevant to female patients who already have a longer QT interval to start with. This review provides an overview of the current evidence on (H)CQ therapy in patients with COVID-19 and discusses different strategies for prophylactic (H)CQ therapy (ie, preinfection, postexposure, and postinfection). In particular, the potential cardiac effects, including QT prolongation and arrhythmias, will be addressed.

We have developed an even less invasive technique, modified laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection, and compared outcomes of modified laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection and open splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection in patients with portal hypertension. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated outcomes in 107 cirrhotic patients with portal hypertensive bleeding and secondary hypersplenism who underwent modified laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection (n = 37) or open splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection (n = 70) between January 2010 and February 2013. Their demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were compared. RESULTS Modified laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection was successful in all patients, with none requiring conversion to open surgery or having significant perioperative complications. Operation time was significantly longer for modified laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection than open splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection (P < 0.0001), but estimated intraoperative blood loss (P = 0.0004); volume of intraoperative blood transfusion (P < 0.05); visual analog scale pain score on the first postoperative day (P < 0.0001); times to first oral intake (P < 0.0001), passage of flatus (P = 0.0004), and off-bed activity (P < 0.0001); postoperative hospital stay (P < 0.0001); postoperative days of temperature >38.0 C (P = 0.002); white blood cell counts on postoperative days 1 (P < 0.0001) and 7 (P < 0.05) were significantly reduced in the modified laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection group. The percentage of patients experiencing postoperative complications was significantly lower in the modified laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection group than in the open splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection group (13.5 % [5/37] vs. 35.7 % [25/70], P < 0.05).

These processes are especially significant in long-term persistent infections where multiple viral genotypes co-replicate in a single host, generating abundant genotypic variants, some of which may possess novel host-colonizing and pathogenicity traits. In some plants, successive vegetative propagation of infected tissues and introduction of new genotypes of a virus by vector transmission allows for viral populations to increase in complexity for hundreds of years allowing co-replication and subsequent recombination of the multiple viral genotypes. Using a resequencing microarray, we examined a persistent infection by a Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) complex in citrus, a vegetatively propagated, globally important fruit crop, and found that the complex comprised three major and a number of minor genotypes. Subsequent deep sequencing analysis of the viral population confirmed the presence of the three major CTV genotypes and, in addition, revealed that the minor genotypes consisted of an extraordinarily large number of genetic variants generated by promiscuous recombination between the major genotypes. Further analysis provided evidence that some of the recombinants underwent subsequent divergence, further increasing the genotypic complexity. These data demonstrate that persistent infection of multiple viral genotypes within a host organism is sufficient to drive the large-scale production of viral genetic variants that may evolve into new and emerging viruses.","output":"Persistent Infection and Promiscuous Recombination of Multiple Genotypes of an RNA Virus within a Single Host Generate Extensive Diversity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Online communities can provide social support for those recovering from opioid use disorder. However, advice-seekers on these platforms risk exposure to uncurated medical advice, potentially harming their health or recovery efforts. The objective of this analysis is to combine text annotation, social network analysis, and statistical modeling to identify advice-seekers on online social media for buprenorphine-naloxone use and study their characteristics. Methods: We collected 5,258 posts and their comments from Reddit between 2014 and 2019. Among 202 posts which met our inclusion criteria, we annotated each post to determine which were advice-seeking (n=137) and not advice-seeking (n=65). We also annotated each posting user's medication use stage and quantified their connectedness using social network analysis. In order to analyze the relationship between advice-seeking with a user's social connectivity and medication use stage, we constructed four models which varied in explanatory variables. Results: The stepwise model (containing \\"total degree\\" (P=0.002), \\"using: inducting/tapering\\" (P<0.001), and \\"using: other\\" (P=0.01) as significant explanatory variables) outperformed all other models. We found that users with fewer connections and who are currently using buprenorphine-naloxone are more likely to seek advice than users who are well-connected and no longer using the medication, respectively. Importantly, advice-seeking behavior is most accurately predicted using a combination of network characteristics and medication use status, rather than either factor alone. Conclusions: Our findings provide insights for the clinical care of people recovering from opioid use disorder and the nature of online medical advice-seeking overall.

As a novel pathogen, the nature and degree of risk of COVID-19 to individuals with rheumatic diseases were unknown, as was its ability to induce musculoskeletal and autoimmune disease. Concerns were related to the chronic autoimmune or inflammatory disease and immune suppressive medications to treat it. The consequences of this infection are currently not fully understood, including the autoimmune sequelae. Here we present two cases of inflammatory arthritis with a temporal link to COVID-19. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: CASE 1: A 37-year-old Caucasian male was referred to Rheumatology with severe joint pains. He developed flu-like symptoms in early April 2020, with myalgia, fever, sore throat, anosmia, and fatigue. SARS-CoV-2 PCR swab was positive. He recovered from these initial symptoms, however 4 weeks later, he developed pain and swelling in his hands, feet, ankles, and knee joints with early morning stiffness. On examination, there was marked synovitis of hands, wrists, knees, and ankle joints. Systemic examination was otherwise normal. CASE 2: A 70-year-old lady developed sore throat and cough started in late March 2020. 3 weeks later, she became generally unwell with lethargy and fatigue. Her cough gradually improved, but she continued to experience breathlessness on minimal exertion. In early May 2020, she developed excruciating pain in her hands, wrists, and right knee joints with morning stiffness. On examination she had synovitis in the wrists, small joints of the hands and right knee. Systemic examination otherwise was unremarkable. Given the severe inflammatory arthritis, both patients were commenced on oral prednisolone with remarkable improvement 4 weeks later. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: We present 2 cases of acute inflammatory arthritis, which were suspected to have been triggered by COVID-19 viral infection without any musculoskeletal complications with good prognosis. COVID-19 is a new disease and our understanding of it is continuing to grow. The initial concern was that COVID-19 -19 infection may lead to severe illness in immunocompromised patients, including those and with rheumatic conditions. However, this was not seen in large numbers. To our knowledge, COVID-19-related inflammatory arthritis has not previously been reported in the literature. Our current understanding of the COVID-19 pathogenic mechanisms is limited. However, it is likely that the disease may evolve in overlapping phases. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: In both cases, it was suggested that COVID-19 19 may be a triggering factor for inflammatory arthritis with good prognosis and settled with steroid therapy. It was suggested that arthritis may occur in patients with COVID-19, in previously fit and well patients without any underlying co-morbidities and autoimmune rheumatic disease and warrants urgent Rheumatology review. However, all COVID-19 suspected cases should be investigated on an individual basis to exclude other diagnosis to avoid missing other common reversible illnesses.","output":"O06 Inflammatory arthritis triggered by COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Honest disclosures of COVID-19 behaviors and symptoms is critical.

People with severe mental illness have greater mortality risk than the general population, experience health care inequalities throughout life and represent a vulnerable, under-served and under-treated population, who have been overlooked in health inequality research to date. There is currently a dearth of evidence in relation to understanding the palliative care needs of people with severe mental illness and how future care delivery can be designed to both recognise and respond to those needs. This study aims to co-design an evidenced informed service model of integrated palliative care for persons living with a severe mental illness. Methods: This qualitative sequential study underpinned by interpretivism will have six phases. An expert reference group will be established in Phase 1, to inform all stages of this study. Phase 2 will include a systematic literature review to synthesise current evidence in relation to palliative care service provision for people with severe mental illness. In Phase 3, qualitative interviews will be undertaken with both, patients who have a severe mental illness and in receipt of palliative care (n = 13), and bereaved caregivers of people who have died 6C18 months previously with a diagnosis of severe mental illness (n = 13), across two recruitment sties in the United Kingdom. Focus groups (n = 4) with both mental health and palliative care multidisciplinary staff will be undertaken across the two recruitment sites in Phase 4. Phase 5 will involve the co-design of a service model of integrated palliative care for persons living with severe mental illness. Phase 6 will develop practice recommendations for this client cohort. Discussion: Palliative care needs to be available at all levels of care systems; it is estimated that, globally, only 14% of patients who need palliative care receive it. Reducing inequalities experienced by people with severe mental illness is embedded in the National Health Service Long Term Plan. Internationally, the gap between those with a mental illness needing care and those with access to care remains considerable. Future policy and practice will benefit from a better understanding of the needs of this client cohort and the development of a co-designed integrated care pathway to facilitate timely access to palliative care for people with a severe mental illness.","output":"Co-Design of an Evidenced Informed Service Model of Integrated Palliative Care for Persons Living with Severe Mental Illness: A Qualitative Exploratory Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, a new nature-inspired human-based optimization algorithm is proposed which called Coronavirus Herd Immunity Optimizer (CHIO). The inspiration of CHIO is originated from the herd immunity concept as a way to tackle coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). The speed of spreading coronavirus infection depends on how the infected individuals directly contact with other society members. In order to protect other members of society from the disease social distancing is suggested by health experts. Herd immunity is a state the population reach when most of the population is immune which results in the prevention of disease transmission. These concepts are modeled in terms of optimization concepts. CHIO mimics the herd immunity strategy as well as the social distancing concepts. Three types of individual cases are utilized for herd immunity: susceptible, infected, and immuned. This is to determine how the newly generated solution updates its genes with social distancing strategies. CHIO is evaluated using 23 well-known benchmark functions. Initially, the sensitivity of CHIO to its parameters is studied. Thereafter, the comparative evaluation against seven state-of-the-art methods is conducted. The comparative analysis verifies that CHIO is able to yield very competitive results compared to those obtained by other well-established methods.

This study examined how physician leaders managed to quickly design a new model for acute-care physicians' work, adopted across four large hospitals in a public health authority in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The research employed a qualitative case study methodology, with inductive analysis of interview transcripts and documents. Shortly after a physician work model redesign, we interviewed key informants: the physician leaders and others who participated in or supported the model's development. Participants were chosen based on their leadership role and through snowballing. All those who were approached agreed to participate. Results: A process model describes leadership actions during four phases of work model development (priming, early planning, readying for operations and transition). These actions were: (1) recognising the threat, (2) committing to action, (3) forming and organising, (4) building and relying on relationships, (5) developing supporting processes and (6) designing functions and structure. We offer three additional contributions to knowledge about leadership in a time of crisis: (1) leveraging peer-professional leadership to initiate, formalise and organise change processes, (2) designing a new work model on existing and emerging evidence and (3) building and relying on relationships to unify various actors.

We aimed to identify optimal symptom combinations to capture most cases using fewer tests with implications for COVID-19 vaccine developers across different resource settings and public health. METHODS: UK and US users of the COVID-19 Symptom Study app who reported new-onset symptoms and an RT-PCR test within seven days of symptom onset were included. Sensitivity, specificity, and number of RT-PCR tests needed to identify one case (test per case [TPC]) were calculated for different symptom combinations. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm was applied to generate combinations with optimal trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity. FINDINGS: UK and US cohorts included 122,305 (1,202 positives) and 3,162 (79 positive) individuals. Within three days of symptom onset, the COVID-19 specific symptom combination (cough, dyspnoea, fever, anosmia/ageusia) identified 69% of cases requiring 47 TPC. The combination with highest sensitivity (fatigue, anosmia/ageusia, cough, diarrhoea, headache, sore throat) identified 96% cases requiring 96 TPC.

Although arbidol has been widely used in China to treat COVID-19 patients, clinical trials to date have not clearly substantiated this approach. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of arbidol for COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 132 moderate and severe COVID-19 patients admitted to Jinyintan Hospital and Huoshenshan Hospital (officially designated for COVID-19 treatment) from February to March 2020 in Wuhan, China. This study mainly evaluated the efficacy of arbidol in patients with COVID-19 in the early stage of the SARS coronavirus 2 epidemic.

Due to the shortage of beds at the time, not every patient could be admitted immediately. We looked for the early stages of the sudden outbreak, places of limited medical resources, limited ward beds, and delayed admission; thus, some patients naturally fit into the control group who did not receive any antiviral drugs. Out of the 132 patients, 72 received arbidol treatment, and 60 did not. We compared the disease course of the two groups and explored the predictors of extended disease duration. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients commenced arbidol, and 60 patients did not receive arbidol treatment. The disease duration in the former group was shorter (23.42  6.92 vs 29.60  6.49, P < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that the risk of a prolonged course of disease increased by 7.158 times in the non-arbidol treatment group. Ferritin > 483.0 ng/mL and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > 237.5 U/L were found to be independent risk factors for protracted cases, with the risk of an extended disease duration increasing to 2.852 times and 5.946 times, respectively. CONCLUSION: The duration course of moderate and severe COVID-19 patients is reduced by 6.183 d when arbidol is administered. Ferritin > 486.5 ng/mL and LDH > 239.5 U/L are independent risk factors for delayed recovery from COVID-19. Early oral administration of arbidol 200 mg t.i.d. with a 10-d course of treatment may be an effective management strategy in COVID-19 patients, particularly those with increased serum ferritin or elevated LDH.","output":"Efficacy of arbidol in COVID-19 patients: A retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid\\\\19 pandemic brings into focus both the burdens on individuals, and the effects on the culture and society in general In our encounters with our patients, we as psychoanalysts have experienced the broad spectrum of possible reactions to the viral threat, just as it is found throughout society: from real fear to panic or, on the contrary, to a denial of the impending danger We are facing drastic changes which are connected with painful losses but sometimes also with new possibilities in our accustomed lives Nevertheless, the loss of trust in the preservation of individual and general health and of economic existence as well goes beyond the individual and leads to tensions and even cracks in the supposed social consensus Thus, in the relationship of the individual to society, the pandemic exacerbates the ambivalence between self\\\\interest and solidarity, not infrequently to the point of forming hostile attitudes In this article, the author explores the question of to what extent it is possible to speak about a new Civilization and Its Discontents in light of the increasing social tensions under the conditions of the pandemic It is the task of psychoanalysis to explicitly name the unconscious conflict between striving for pleasure and happiness or the search for security, in order to also contribute to dealing with the resulting aggression and fear of death in times of pandemic [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of International Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies is the property of John Wiley & Sons, Inc and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"A new Civilization and Its Discontents in times of COVID\\\\19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although behaviors such as handwashing, mask wearing, and social distancing are known to limit viral spread, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, many individuals in the United States did not adopt them. The positivity resonance theory of co-experienced positive affect (Fredrickson, 2016) holds that shared pleasant states that include the key features of mutual care and a sense of oneness through behavioral synchrony function to build prosocial tendencies (e.g., self-transcendent and other-oriented dispositions of felt unity, empathy, altruism, and general positivity toward humanity). We tested the theory-driven hypothesis that prosocial tendencies are associated with high-quality social connections characterized by the affective state of positivity resonance and, in turn, account for behaviors to slow the spread of COVID-19. We measured perceived positivity resonance at the level of social episodes either during the COVID-19 pandemic (study 1, N = 1059, AprilCMay 2020) or before it (study 2, N = 227, MarchCNovember 2019). In both studies, cross-sectionally and prospectively, results suggest that perceived positivity resonance had a positive indirect effect on self-reported hygienic behaviors (e.g., handwashing and mask wearing), which was mediated by a latent measure of prosocial tendencies. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these mediation effects to be independent of competing predictors of prosocial tendencies (e.g., overall positive and negative affect, frequency of social interaction) and competing predictors of health behaviors (e.g., political orientation, high-risk status, illness symptoms). Effects for social distancing were mixed. Overall, findings are consistent with the view that positivity resonance builds self-transcendent prosocial tendencies that motivate behaviors to protect community health.

To investigate the usefulness of a serological assay to predict vaccine efficacy, we analyzed the levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in the sera from BNT162b2 vaccinated individuals in Japan. METHODSThis study included 219 individuals who received two doses of BNT162b2. The levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA against RBD were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and after the first and second vaccination, respectively. The relationship between antibody levels and several factors including age, gender, and hypertension were analyzed. Virus-neutralizing activity in sera was measured to determine the correlation with the levels of antibodies. A chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) method to measure IgG against RBD was developed and validated for the clinical setting. RESULTSThe levels of all antibody isotypes were increased after vaccination. Among them, RBD-IgG was dramatically increased after the second vaccination. The IgG levels in females were significantly higher than in males. There was a negative correlation between age and IgG levels in males. The IgG levels significantly correlated with the neutralizing activity. The CLEIA assay measuring IgG against RBD showed a reliable performance and a high correlation with neutralizing activity. CONCLUSIONSMonitoring of IgG against RBD is a powerful tool to predict the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and provides useful information in considering a personalized vaccination strategy for COVID-19.","output":"Antibody responses to BNT162b2 vaccination in Japan: Monitoring vaccine efficacy by measuring IgG antibodies against the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant mortality worldwide. The disease attacks the lung tissue and may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. An in vitro study showed that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has a prophylactic effect against COVID-19 due to its anti-inflammatory effects. The present study aimed to evaluate the prophylactic effect of HCQ on individuals in close contact with patients with COVID-19. METHOD: In this quasi-trial study, we prescribed HCQ for 7 days to all people who had close contact with a patient with COVID-19. All contacts underwent a nasal swab in two steps, and those positive for COVID-19 were excluded from the study. After 14 days of follow-up, the clinical and laboratory manifestations of COVID-19 were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 113 participants completed the study. The HCQ group comprised 51 (45.13 %) contacts, and 62 (54.86 %) contacts were allocated to the control group. According to the results of clinical examination and real-time polymerase chain reaction test, 8 (12.90%) contacts in the control group were reported to have contracted COVID-19. In the HCQ group, 7 (13.72%) contacts were confirmed to have contracted COVID-19. There was no relationship between HCQ use and age, sex, underlying disorders, and laboratory data (all p >0.05). In terms of HCQ side effects, five participants experienced gastrointestinal and cutaneous side effects that subsided on discontinuation of HCQ.

Recently, minimally invasive endoscopic techniques via a transorbital superior eyelid approach (ETOA) or endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) have been proposed as viable alternatives to transcranial approaches for orbital tumors. In this study, the authors investigated the feasibility of 360 circumferential access to orbital tumors via both ETOA and EEA. METHODS: Between April 2014 and June 2019, 16 patients with orbital tumors underwent either ETOA or EEA at the authors' institution. Based on the neuro-topographic \\"four-zone model\\" of the orbit with its tumor epicenter around the optic nerve in the coronal plane, ETOA (n = 10, 62.5%) was performed for tumors located predominantly superolateral to the nerve and EEA (n = 6, 37.5%) for those located predominantly inferomedial to the nerve. Eight patients (50%) presented with intraconal tumors and 8 (50%) with extraconal ones. The orbital tumors included orbital schwannoma (n = 6), cavernous hemangioma (n = 2), olfactory groove meningioma (n = 1), sphenoorbital meningioma (n = 1), chondrosarcoma (n = 1), trigeminal schwannoma (n = 1), metastatic osteosarcoma (n = 1), mature cystic teratoma (n = 1), sebaceous carcinoma (n = 1), and ethmoid sinus osteoma (n = 1). The clinical outcomes and details of surgical techniques were reviewed. RESULTS: Gross-total resection was achieved in 12 patients (75%), near-total resection in 3 (18.8%), and subtotal resection in 1 (6.2%). Eight (88.9%) of the 9 patients with preoperative proptosis showed improvement after surgery, and 4 (66.7%) of the 6 patients with visual symptoms demonstrated improvement. Four (40%) of the 10 patients treated with ETOA experienced partial third nerve palsy immediately after surgery (3 transient and 1 persistent). There have been no postoperative CSF leaks or infections in this series. CONCLUSIONS: Without transcranial approaches requiring temporalis muscle dissection and orbitozygomatic osteotomy, the selection of ETOA or EEA based on a concept of a four-zone model with its epicenter around the optic nerve successfully provides a minimally invasive 360 circumferential access to the entire orbit with acceptable morbidity.","output":"Use of endoscopic transorbital and endonasal approaches for 360 circumferential access to orbital tumors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fibrosis is the final pathological outcome and major cause of morbidity and mortality in many common and chronic inflammatory, immune-mediated, and metabolic diseases.

We applied four MR methods (MRMix, IMRP, IVW, MREgger) to publicly available GWAS summary statistics from European (COVID-19 GWAS n = 2956) and multi-ethnic populations (COVID-19 GWAS n = 10,908) to better understand extant causal associations between Type II Diabetes (GWAS n = 659,316), BMI (n = 681,275), diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and pulse pressure (n = 757,601 for each) and COVID-19 hospitalization risk across populations. Although no significant causal effect evidence was observed, our data suggested a trend of increasing hospitalization risk for Type II diabetes (IMRP OR, 95% CI 1.67, 0.96C2.92) and pulse pressure (OR, 95% CI 1.27, 0.97C1.66) in the multi-ethnic sample.

The acetaminophen absorption test (APAT) was used to determine abomasal emptying rate. Four healthy and five diarrheic female Holstein-Friesian calves (age < 14 days) were included in the study. For APAT, calves were fed 2 L of milk replacer containing 50 mg acetaminophen/kg body weight, and blood samples were taken during a 12-h period afterward. Concomitantly, a WAC in the abomasum continuously measured luminal pH, pressure, and temperature. Five hours post suckling, intraluminal temperature was significantly higher in diarrheic calves than in healthy calves. Abomasal pH and pressure were not significantly different, but intraluminal pressure was always numerically lower in diarrheic calves. During APAT no significant differences in maximum acetaminophen concentrations (C(max)) and time to reach maximum acetaminophen concentration (T(max)) were observed. Nonlinear regression findings revealed a longer acetaminophen half-time (AAP t(1/2)) in diarrheic calves compared to healthy calves [564  96 min vs. 393  84 min, respectively; P = 0.04] and lower area under the concentration curve values (e.g., 60 min postprandial AUC(60) 681  244 (g?min)/mL vs. 1064  23 (g?min)/mL, respectively; P = 0.04). In conclusion, abomasal luminal conditions were different between diarrheic and healthy calves. Significant differences in APAT reflected a delay in abomasal emptying in diarrheic calves. Impaired abomasal movement may induce enhanced bacterial fermentation processes as indicated by a higher abomasal temperature in diarrheic calves, which should be considered in management of their feeding.","output":"Measurement of abomasal conditions (pH, pressure and temperature) in healthy and diarrheic dairy calves using a wireless ambulatory capsule"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Altered expression of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), longer than 200 nucleotides without potential for coding protein, has been observed in diverse human diseases including viral diseases. It is largely unknown whether lncRNA would deregulate in SARS-CoV-2 infection, causing ongoing pandemic COVID-19. To identify, if lncRNA was deregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, we analyzed in silico the data in GSE147507. It was revealed that expression of 20 lncRNA like MALAT1, NEAT1 was increased and 4 lncRNA like PART1, TP53TG1 was decreased in at least two independent cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2. Expression of NEAT1 was also increased in lungs tissue of COVID-19 patients. The deregulated lncRNA could interact with more than 2800 genes/proteins and 422 microRNAs as revealed from the database that catalogs experimentally determined interactions. Analysis with the interacting gene/protein partners of deregulated lncRNAs revealed that these genes/proteins were associated with many pathways related to viral infection, inflammation and immune functions. To find out whether these lncRNAs could be regulated by STATs and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), we used ChIPBase v2.0 that catalogs experimentally determined binding from ChIP-seq data. It was revealed that any one of the transcription factors IRF1, IRF4, STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5A had experimentally determined binding at regions within -5kb to +1kb of the deregulated lncRNAs in at least 2 independent cell lines/conditions. Our analysis revealed that several lncRNAs could be regulated by IRF1, IRF4 STAT1 and STAT3 in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and lncRNAs might be involved in antiviral response.

Our results shed light on how inclusive corporate culture filters through an organization to help minority communities during a crisis, and underscore the effect of corporate social attitudes on important stakeholder outcomes.","output":"COVID Racial Disparities in Financial Complaints and the Role of Corporate Social Attitudes (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mast cells (MCs) are strategically distributed at barrier sites and prestore various immunocyte-recruiting cytokines, making them ideal targets for selective activation to treat peripheral infections. Here, we report that topical treatment with mastoparan, a peptide MC activator (MCA), enhances clearance of Staphylococcus aureus from infected mouse skins and accelerates healing of dermonecrotic lesions. Mastoparan functions by activating connective tissue MCs (CTMCs) via the MRGPRX2 (Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor member X2) receptor. Peripheral CTMC activation, in turn, enhances recruitment of bacteria-clearing neutrophils and wound-healing CD301b+ dendritic cells. Consistent with MCs playing a master coordinating role, MC activation also augmented migration of various antigen-presenting dendritic cells to draining lymph nodes, leading to stronger protection against a second infection challenge. MCAs therefore orchestrate both the innate and adaptive immune arms, which could potentially be applied to combat peripheral infections by a broad range of pathogens.","output":"MRGPR-mediated activation of local mast cells clears cutaneous bacterial infection and protects against reinfection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose This paper aims to examine the economic rationale for the COVID-19 wage subsidy and grants related to assets and the accounting for these wealth transfers under NZ IAS 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance The principal contribution is presenting an economics-accounting nexus for government assistance to firms during a pandemic and for the nation's economic development Design/methodology/approach This is a descriptive study that draws on the economic theory of regulation to understand the rationale for wealth transfers, then examining the accounting for the wealth transfers by analyzing the financial statements of NZX 50 companies that received the wage subsidy and SkyCity and Chorus that received substantial grants to develop and operate the New Zealand International Convention Centre and building a large part of New Zealand's Ultra-Fast Broadband fiber optic network, respectively Findings First, the 10 NZX 50 companies that received the government's wage subsidy were justified to receive it from the legal, ethical and moral perspectives However, some non-NZX 50 companies, while legally entitled to the wage subsidy, took advantage of the wealth transfer when they were profitable and paid dividends This latter group of companies was not seen as behaving ethically and morally Second, the government granted millions of dollars to SkyCity and Chorus for building critical infrastructures that are economically beneficial for the nation and that are unlikely to attract private investment, and these companies accounted for the grants related to assets in accordance with NZ IAS 20 Research limitations/implications The financial statement impacts of the wage subsidy are based on a subset of NZX 50 companies with available information at the time of writing However, they do not compromise the external validity of the findings because the wage subsidy applies to all businesses Similarly, the manner in which SkyCity and Chorus accounted for the grants related to assets would apply equally to any entity that is a recipient of such a grant Originality/value This paper presents an economic understanding for the existence of government grants and how the accounting mirrors the economic rationale for the \\"grants related to income\\" and \\"grants related to assets \\" This paper demonstrates the importance of the economics-accounting nexus","output":"The economics and accounting for COVID-19 wage subsidy and other government grants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis, tests with high sensitivity and specificity are crucial for the identification and management of COVID-19 patients.

We modelled three scenarios to test the impact of travel bans on epidemic control. Scenario one was no ban, scenario two and three were the current ban followed by a full or partial lifting (allow over 100 000 university students to enter Australia, but not tourists) from the 8th of March 2020. METHODS: We used disease incidence data from China and air travel passenger movements between China and Australia during and after the epidemic peak in China, derived from incoming passenger arrival cards. We used the estimated incidence of disease in China, using data on expected proportion of under-ascertainment of cases, and an age specific deterministic model to model the epidemic in each scenario. RESULTS: The modelled epidemic with the full ban fitted the observed incidence of cases well, predicting 57 cases on March 6th in Australia, compared to 66 observed on this date, however we did not account for imported cases from other countries. The modelled impact without a travel ban results in more than 2000 cases and about 400 deaths, if the epidemic remained localised to China and no importations from other countries occurred. The full travel ban reduced cases by about 86%, while the impact of a partial lifting of the ban is minimal, and may be a policy option. CONCLUSIONS: Travel restrictions were highly effective for containing the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia during the epidemic peak in China and averted a much larger epidemic at a time when COVID-19 was largely localised to China. This research demonstrates the effectiveness of travel bans applied to countries with high disease incidence. This research can inform decisions on placing or lifting travel bans as a control measure for the COVID-19 epidemic.","output":"The effectiveness of full and partial travel bans against COVID-19 spread in Australia for travellers from China during and after the epidemic peak in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effect of temperature (60, 70, 80, and 90 C) and time (30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 min) on citric acid extraction of Haden mango (Mangifera indica L. cv.

The incidence curves are then used to estimate epidemiological quantities, such as daily reproductive numbers and infectivity ratios. We found that during a brief period before the official control measures were implemented in Philadelphia, the drop in the daily number of new infections due to an average infector was much larger than expected from the depletion of susceptibles during that period; this finding was subjected to extensive sensitivity analysis.

Executive apathy was predicted by depressive symptoms, emotional apathy by motivational deficit and initiative apathy comprised a mixed executive-emotional form and a pure deficit of action initiation. The three forms of subclinical apathy remained similar in the context of increased depressive symptoms due to a global pandemic. This study confirmed the presence and independence of three forms of subclinical apathy in healthy students, which remained similar even in the light of increased depressive scores.

METHODS: Youth diagnosed with PBD I, II, or NOS, at high risk for the disorder (BD-HR) and healthy controls were recruited from the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic at Stanford University School of Medicine. Researchers administered a personality inventory and evaluated current mood state. RESULTS: BD and BD-HR youth scored lower in Emotional Regulation than did HC youth (F (3, 70) = 10.75, p < .001).

She discontinued the medication and did not come for follow-up visits because of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. After 10 months she came back with pain and a diffuse swelling with indurated margin, in the same region involving right buccal vestibule and retromolar area. After incisional biopsy it was found that the lesion has progressed to squamous cell carcinoma, and the patient was referred to the Department of Oral Surgery where segmental mandibulectomy was done with placement of free fibula graft. The OLP is considered as a potentially malignant disorder and patient should be advised to avoid additional risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol and should be followed at minimum a year interval as prognosis and patient survival is directly related to stage and grade of cancer at its initial diagnosis.","output":"Malignant transformation of oral lichen planus: A peril of covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Reported transmission rates of SARS-CoV-2 within families vary widely, and there are few reports on transmission from children to other family members. More knowledge is needed to guide infection control measures. Objective: To characterize the family index case for detected SARS-CoV-2 and describe testing and secondary attack rates in the family. Design: Register-based cohort study. Setting: Individual-level administrative data of all families and all PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 in Norway in 2020. Participants: All families with at least one parent and one child below the age of 20, who lived at the same address (N=662 582), where at least one member tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 2020. Main outcome measures: Secondary attack rates (SAR7) were defined as the share of non-index family members with a positive PCR test within seven days of the index case. SARs were calculated separately for parent- and child-index cases, and for parent- and child-secondary cases. Results: We identified 7548 index cases, comprising 26 991 individuals, of which 12184 were parents and 14808 children. The index was a parent in 66% of the cases. Among the children, 42% of the index cases were in the age group 17-20 and only 8% 0-6 years. When the index was a parent, SAR7 was 24% (95%CI 24 to 25), whilst SAR7 was 14% (95%CI 13 to 15) when the index was a child. However, SAR7 was 24% (95%CI 20 to 28) when the index was a child aged 0-6 years and declined steeply with increasing age of the index child. SAR7 from index parent to other parents was 35% (95%CI 33 to 36), and from index child to other children 12% (95%CI 11 to 13). SAR7 from index child aged 0-6 to parents was 27% (95%CI 22 to 33). The percent of non-index family members tested within 7 days after the index case, increased from about 20% in April to 80% in December, however, SAR7 stabilized at about 20% from May. Conclusion: Parents and older children are most often index cases for SARS-CoV-2 in families in Norway, while parents and young children more often transmit the virus within the families. This study suggests that whilst the absolute infection numbers are low for young children because of their low introduction rate, when infected, young children and parents transmit the virus to the same extent within the family.","output":"Secondary attack rates of COVID-19 in Norwegian families: A nation-wide register-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 is one of the three U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19. Its most common side effect, injection site pain, occurs because of locally recruited inflammatory mediators and is mitigated by the lymphatic system. Side effects may discourage individuals from receiving vaccines; therefore, reducing the duration of injection site pain can promote vaccination compliance. Osteopathic manipulative treatments (OMT) can directly affect the physiology underlying muscle soreness; however, there is currently no literature that supports the use of OMT in this scenario. In this case report, an otherwise healthy male presented with acute left deltoid soreness after receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The pain began 5 h prior to the visit. Three hours after being treated with lymphatic OMT, the severity of the pain was significantly reduced and was alleviated 8h after onset in comparison to the median duration of 24-48 h. He received his second dose 3 weeks later. This case report can provide future studies with the groundwork for further investigating the role of OMT in treating postvaccination muscle soreness, which can improve patient satisfaction and potentially promote vaccination compliance.","output":"Lymphatic osteopathic manipulative treatment reduces duration of deltoid soreness after Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread throughout China. This study aimed to clarify the characteristics of patients with refractory COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, we included 155 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1(st) to February 5(th). The cases were divided into general and refractory COVID-19 groups according to the clinical efficacy after hospitalization, and the difference between groups were compared. RESULTS: Compared with general COVID-19 patients (45.2%), refractory patients had an older age, male sex, more underlying comorbidities, lower incidence of fever, higher levels of maximum temperature among fever cases, higher incidence of breath shortness and anorexia, severer disease assessment on admission, high levels of neutrophil, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein, lower levels of platelets and albumin, and higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion (P<0.05). Refractory COVID-19 patients were more likely to receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, and adjunctive treatment including corticosteroid, antiviral drugs and immune enhancer (P<0.05). After adjustment, those with refractory COVID-19 were also more likely to have a male sex and manifestations of anorexia and fever on admission, and receive oxygen, expectorant and adjunctive agents (P<0.05) when considering the factors of disease severity on admission, mechanical ventilation, and ICU transfer.

However, this method of delivery is resource-intensive and unable to reach a high number of ECEs. The purpose of the Training pre-service EArly CHildhood educators in PA (TEACH) pilot study was to test the implementation (e.g., fidelity, feasibility, acceptability) of an e-Learning course targeting PA and SB among a sample of pre-service (i.e., post-secondary students) and in-service (i.e., practicing) ECEs in Canada. METHODS: A pre-/post-study design was adopted for this pilot study, and implementation outcomes were assessed cross-sectionally at post-intervention. Pre-service ECEs were purposefully recruited from three Canadian colleges and in-service ECEs were recruited via social media. Upon completing the e-Learning course, process evaluation surveys (n = 32 pre-service and 121 in-service ECEs) and interviews (n = 3 pre-service and 8 in-service ECEs) were completed to gather ECEs perspectives on the e-Learning course. Fidelity was measured via e-Learning course metrics retrieved from the web platform. Descriptive statistics were calculated for quantitative data, and thematic analysis was conducted to analyze qualitative data. RESULTS: Moderate-to-high fidelity to the TEACH study e-Learning course was exhibited by pre-service (68%) and in-service (63%) ECEs. Participants reported that the course was highly acceptable, compatible, effective, feasible, and appropriate in complexity; however, some ECEs experienced technical difficulties with the e-Learning platform and noted a longer than anticipated course duration. The most enjoyed content for pre- and in-service ECEs focused on outdoor play (87.5% and 91.7%, respectively) and risky play (84.4% and 88.4%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the value of e-Learning for professional development interventions for ECEs. Participant feedback will be used to make improvements to the TEACH e-Learning course to improve scalability of this training.

Purified, soluble MHVR expressed from a recombinant vaccinia virus neutralized the infectivity of the A59 strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) in a concentration-dependent manner. Several anchored murine Bgps in addition to MHVR can also function as MHV-A59 receptors when expressed at high levels in nonmurine cells. To investigate the interactions of these alternative MHVR glycoproteins with MHV, we expressed and purified to apparent homogeneity the extracellular domains of several murine Bgps as soluble, six-histidine-tagged glycoproteins, using a baculovirus expression system. These include MHVR isoforms containing four or two extracellular domains and the corresponding Bgp1(b) glycoproteins from MHV-resistant SJL/J mice, as well as Bgp2 and truncation mutants of MHVR and Bgp1(b) comprised of the first two immunoglobulin-like domains. The soluble four-domain MHVR glycoprotein (sMHVR[1-4]) had fourfold more MHV-A59 neutralizing activity than the corresponding soluble Bgp1(b) (sBgp1(b)) glycoprotein and at least 1,000-fold more neutralizing activity than sBgp2. Although virus binds to the N-terminal domain (domain 1), soluble truncation mutants of MHVR and Bgp1(b) containing only domains 1 and 2 bound virus poorly and had 10- and 300-fold less MHV-A59 neutralizing activity than the corresponding four-domain glycoproteins. In contrast, the soluble MHVR glycoprotein containing domains 1 and 4 (sMHVR[1,4]) had as much neutralizing activity as the four-domain glycoprotein, sMHVR[1-4]. Thus, the virus neutralizing activity of MHVR domain 1 appears to be enhanced by domain 4. The sBgp1(b)[1-4] glycoprotein had 500-fold less neutralizing activity for MHV-JHM than for MHV-A59. Thus, MHV strains with differences in S-glycoprotein sequence, tissue tropism, and virulence can differ in the ability to utilize the various murine Bgps as receptors.","output":"Purified, soluble recombinant mouse hepatitis virus receptor, Bgp1(b), and Bgp2 murine coronavirus receptors differ in mouse hepatitis virus binding and neutralizing activities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) heavily relies on universal access to testing to identify who is infected; tracking them to make sure they do not spread the disease further; and tracing those with whom they have been in contact.

Descriptive statistics and independent t-tests were used to describe student samples and determine the differences in students satisfaction and performance. Reflections of students satisfaction revealed that about 65.8% were satisfied with the learning involvement and about 60.5% were satisfied with the class interaction. Almost two-thirds of the class agreed that the smart interactive tools applied in the online course could help them attain their learning goals better. Among all the smart interactive functions, the class quiz was the most effective one in helping students grasp the main points of the course. No significant differences were found between the two teaching modes in the overall and academically higher or lower performing students final exam average scores. Compared to each band score of such two teaching modes, no one failed to pass the final exam in the online course, however, three lower-performing students who were taught in the traditional course failed.

METHODS: Participants were infants born <32 weeks gestational age (GA), N=116. We defined family SES by the infants' health insurance (private/higher vs. public/lower) and family language by the language mothers used to communicate with clinical staff (English vs. Other language). Family SES or family language groups were compared on: (1) the total amount of KC infants experienced during hospitalization; (2) frequency of KC per visitation days; and, (3) duration of KC events per day. RESULTS: Infants in the lower SES and Other language groups experienced KC in reduced amounts, lower frequencies, and shorter durations than infants in either the higher SES or English language groups. SES and language group differences remained significant after controlling for family visitation and GA at birth. After controlling for SES, language group differences in KC duration remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed disparities in the total amount, frequency, and duration of KC in the neonatal intensive care unit as a function of both family SES and language families used to communicate with clinical staff.

More than 90 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and more than 2 million people have died of complications due to COVID-19 worldwide. COVID-19, in its severe form, presents with an uncontrolled, hyperactive immune response and severe immunological injury or organ damage that accounts for morbidity and mortality. Even in the absence of complications, COVID-19 can last for several months with lingering effects of an overactive immune system. Dysregulated myeloid and lymphocyte compartments have been implicated in lung immunopathology. Currently, there are limited clinically-tested treatments of COVID-19 with disparities in the apparent efficacy in patients. Accurate model systems are essential to rapidly evaluate promising discoveries but most currently available in mice, ferrets and hamsters do not recapitulate sustained immunopathology described in COVID19 patients. Here, we present a comprehensively humanized mouse COVID-19 model that faithfully recapitulates the innate and adaptive human immune responses during infection with SARS-CoV-2 by adapting recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV)-driven gene therapy to deliver human ACE2 to the lungs &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; of MISTRG6 mice. Our unique model allows for the first time the study of chronic disease due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the context of patient-derived antibodies to characterize in real time the potential culprits of the observed human driving immunopathology;most importantly this model provides a live view into the aberrant macrophage response that is thought to be the effector of disease morbidity and ARDS in patients. Application of therapeutics such as patient-derived antibodies and steroids to our model allowed separation of the two aspects of the immune response, infectious viral clearance and immunopathology. Inflammatory cells seeded early in infection drove immune-patholgy later, but this very same early anti-viral response was also crucial to contain infection.","output":"A humanized mouse model of chronic COVID-19 to evaluate disease mechanisms and treatment options"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The authors explored shifts in social interactions, content engagement and history learning as students who were studying one pandemic simultaneously experienced another.

In the United States, one of the critical issues in coping with the pandemic has been a lack of essential personal protective equipment (PPE), at the local, state, and national level. As COVID-19 is primarily transferred through respiratory routes, adequate respiratory protection is a dire necessity. The shift from durable and reusable medical supplies in recent years to their single use counterparts has reduced the resiliency of the medical system with respect to PPE and other critical supplies in the current pandemic. This work explores the role of reusable compared to single use respiratory protection in the current pandemic, including reprocessing of single use options, from the perspective of number of equivalent protection devices needed. The current state of literature is also reviewed to provide context to this work, with respect to resource procurement. The economic cost of PPE throughout a pandemic is explored, and it is found that utilizing reusable PPE options depending on filter cycling may be less costly. Increased waste production is another issue with the current pandemic, and this is explored utilizing a mass basis, finding that reusable respiratory PPE would generate less waste than using single use PPE in a business as usual scenario. As future outbreaks of COVID-19 are likely along with other future pandemics, this work provides insights at how to prepare from the standpoint of PPE, and in particular respiratory protection.","output":"Personal respiratory protection and resiliency in a pandemic, the evolving disposable versus reusable debate and its effect on waste generation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Community variation (i.e., beta diversity) along geographical gradients is a well-known ecological pattern, but the corresponding variation in beta diversity components (e.g., species turnover and nestedness) and underlying drivers remain poorly understood. Based on two alternative approaches (that is, the beta diversity partitioning proposed by Baselga and the Local Contributions to Beta Diversity (LCBD) partitioning proposed by Legendre), we examined the patterns of beta diversity components of lacustrine benthos, from bacteria to diatoms and chironomids, in the surface sediments along a 100-m water-depth gradient in Lugu Lake. We further quantified the relative importance of spatial, environmental and biotic variables in explaining water-depth patterns in beta diversity. Based on the Baselga's framework, there was a taxonomic dependency for the patterns of beta diversity components with water-depth, showing a significant species turnover pattern for bacteria, while diatoms and chironomids showed significant nestedness. This dependency was also evident in the patterns of community uniqueness with water-depth because based on Legendre's framework, the LCBD decreased with water depth for bacteria whereas increased with depth for diatoms. The total beta diversity and species turnover of bacteria could be explained by the pure effects of spatial, environmental and biotic variables. A total of 26.8% and 23.6% of the nestedness component of diatoms and chironomids was explained by environmental variables, respectively, while species turnover was mostly related to spatial variables. Bacteria total LCBD and species replacement were driven only by environmental variables. For diatoms and chironomids, however, most of the total LCBD and its two components were explained by spatial variables, and biotic variables were most important for the diatom replacement component. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms responsible for community organizations along water-depth gradients from the perspective of beta diversity components.","output":"Taxonomic dependency of beta diversity components in benthic communities of bacteria, diatoms and chironomids along a water-depth gradient."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cognitive scientists have ramped up online testing in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Due to their inherent flexibility and robustness, multi-agent systems are applied in a growing range of real-world problems that involve heterogeneous tasks and uncertain information. Most previous works assume a unique way to decompose a task into roles that can later be assigned to the agents. This assumption is not valid for a complex task where the roles can vary and multiple decomposition structures exist. Meanwhile, it is unclear how uncertainties in task requirements and agent capabilities can be systematically quantified and optimized under a multi-agent system setting. A representation for complex tasks is proposed to avoid the non-convex task decomposition enumeration: agent capabilities are represented as a vector of random distributions, and task requirements are verified by a generalizable binary function. The conditional value at risk (CVaR) is chosen as a metric in the objective function to generate robust plans. An efficient algorithm is described to solve the model, and the whole framework is evaluated in two different practical test cases: capture-the-flag and robotic service coordination during a pandemic (e.g., COVID-19).

We find that that SARS-CoV-2 selectively infects hPSC-CMs through the viral receptor ACE2, whereas in hPSC-SMCs there is minimal viral entry or replication. After entry into cardiomyocytes, SARS-CoV-2 is assembled in lysosome-like vesicles and egresses via bulk exocytosis. The viral transcripts become a large fraction of cellular mRNA while host gene expression shifts from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism and up-regulates chromatin modification and RNA splicing pathways. Most importantly, viral infection of hPSC-CMs progressively impairs both their electrophysiological and contractile function, and causes widespread cell death. These data support the hypothesis that COVID-19-related cardiac symptoms can result from a direct cardiotoxic effect of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infects human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, impairing electrical and mechanical function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wat: Verpleegkundigen van het Verpleegkundig Oncologisch Centrum (VOC) van het Zuyderland Medisch Centrum in Sittard-Geleen ontwikkelden een spel om collegas te enthousiasmeren voor EBP.","output":"3 vragen over Spel over EBP"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globalization entails several medical problems, along with economic and social complications.

This paper assembles user perspectives and critically examines existing evidence and future potential of mobile phone data derived from call detail records (CDRs) and two-way short message service (SMS) platforms, for managing and responding to humanitarian disasters caused by communicable disease outbreaks. We undertake a scoping review of relevant literature and in-depth interviews with key informants to ascertain the: (i) information that can be gathered from CDRs or SMS data; (ii) phase(s) in the disease disaster management cycle when mobile data may be useful; (iii) value added over conventional approaches to data collection and transfer; (iv) barriers and enablers to use of mobile data in disaster contexts; and (v) the social and ethical challenges. Based on this evidence we develop a typology of mobile phone data sources, types, and end-uses, and a decision-tree for mobile data use, designed to enable effective use of mobile data for disease disaster management.

METHODS: Between February and July 2020, we included patients who tested positive for COVID\\\\19 from two anticoagulant clinics in the Netherlands. We collected international normalized ratios (INRs) determined between 26 weeks before infection and 12 weeks after. Time in therapeutic range (TTR) and the variance growth rate (VGR) were calculated within patients. RESULTS: Fifty\\\\one patients with COVID\\\\19 (mean age, 84 years) were included, of whom 15 (29%) were men. Mean TTR in the 26 weeks before COVID\\\\19 was 80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 75\\\\85) compared to 59% (95% CI, 51\\\\68) in the 6 weeks after infection. Mean TTR difference was ?23% (95% CI, ?32 to ?14) with a time above therapeutic range of 38% (95% CI, 30\\\\47) in the 6 weeks after infection. The TTR rose again to 79% (95% CI, 69\\\\89) between 6 and 12 weeks after infection. Also, VGR increased, with a mean increase of 4.8 (95% CI, 2.1\\\\7.5) in the 6 weeks after infection.

The coatings were deposited on AISI 1040 steel substrates using a high velocity air fuel thermal spray process. The microstructure of the coatings was observed by a scanning electron microscope, while their phase composition was analyzed using an energy-dispersive microanalysis system. In addition, the microhardness of the coatings and substrate was measured, and the surface topography of the eroded surface layers was observed using a 3D optical profilometer. The results revealed that the cavitation resistance of the WC-20CrC-7Ni coatings was better than that of the WC-10Co4Cr coatings. The observation of the structure and surface topography made it possible to identity the reasons for the differences between the cavitation resistance of both coatings: The WC-20CrC-7Ni coatings had a finer grain structure, lower pore density, and lower as-sprayed surface roughness. These differences, along with the presence of a high Cr and Ni content in the feedstock powder, that increased the coating corrosion resistance, contributed to improving the cavitation resistance and reducing the material loss of the WC-20CrC-7Ni coatings.","output":"Cavitation Resistance of WC-10Co4Cr and WC-20CrC-7Ni HVAF Coatings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has triggered serious disruption in economic, social and cultural dynamics around the globe. Higher education has also suffered undeniable challenges as a result of the pandemic, with thousands of university students all over the world experiencing displacement, disconnect and disengagement from formal learning. In the Global South, online and distance education programmes tend to be concentrated in urban centres. In Nepal, students from rural areas, low socio-economic and gendered spaces, and those with low proficiencies in English and technological skills are experiencing inequalities in access to and participation in online and distance education. This article outlines how universities' shift to online teaching and learning modes due to the COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced social inequalities in Nepal. For the study presented here, the author collected data through netnographic research methods. These included online interviews with university executives, online focus group discussions (FGDs) with university teachers and students, observation of and participation in online classes and policy conferences and reviews of online documents. The article analyses three overriding mechanisms which are reinforcing social inequalities in higher education: (1) universities' policy trajectories in shifting teaching/learning from face-to-face to online mode; (2) infrastructural limitations challenging effective implementation of online teaching/learning; and (3) a lack of strong pedagogic support for students from disadvantaged and marginalised spaces, including those with low proficiencies in English and technological skills. The author presents a number of tangible strategies for universities to implement in order to mitigate social inequalities.

Notably, the Vietnamese capital has mostly relied on the use of face masks and hand sanitizer during travel, instead of requiring physical distancing on buses. This study examines public bus passengers levels of compliance with Covid-19 safety measures, and the factors that affect compliance. METHODS: Face-to-face surveys were administered between 7 September and 3 October 2020, right after the end of the third wave of Covid-19 in Hanoi on 51 bus routes. Exploratory Factor Analysis was carried out to extract factors from attitudinal statements. The extracted factors, passengers socio-demographic traits, and their bus use patterns were modelled to determine which variables lead to more compliance with Covid-19 safety measures. RESULTS: We found that 100% of passengers wore face masks (which were mandated), albeit 11% did so incorrectly, while only 28% of passengers used the hand sanitizer provided by bus operators (which was recommended but not required). In addition, 38% of passengers carried their own bottles of hand sanitizer while travelling, despite a relatively low risk of contracting the virus. Women, older passengers, and urbanites were less likely to sanitise their hands. Frequent bus travellers behaved like the population at large with regard to protective measures against Covid-19. CONCLUSIONS: Hanoi's overall measures - full use of face masks and partial use of hand sanitizer - were sufficient to contain three relatively minor Covid-19 waves while still maintaining regular bus operations most of the time. If other cities were able to reach these levels of compliance, most would be in much better position vis--vis public transport use during the pandemic (or an epidemic).

Its N-terminal region harbors the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity, and its C-terminus contains a cap assembling line composed of a capping domain and a methyltransferase domain (MTase) followed by a C-terminal domain (CTD) of unknown function. The L protein MTase catalyzes methylation at the 2'-O and N-7 positions of the cap structures. In addition, the MTase of Ebola virus can induce cap-independent internal adenosine 2'-O-methylation. In this work, we investigated the CTD role in the regulation of the cap-dependent and cap-independent MTase activities of the L protein. We found that the CTD, which is enriched in basic amino acids, plays a key role in RNA binding and in turn regulates the different MTase activities. We demonstrated that the mutation of CTD residues modulate specificaly the different MTase activities. Altogether, our results highlight the pivotal role of the L protein CTD in the control of viral RNA methylation, which is critical for Ebola virus replication and escape from the innate response in infected cells.IMPORTANCE Ebola virus infects human and non-human primates causing severe infections that are often fatal.

Various quantitative performance indicators, which included the numbers of referrals and the case-mix, were compared with their values in previous years. Two of the three networks surveyed (A and B) provided telemedicine services for any type of medical or surgical case, while the third (network C) handled only pediatric radiology cases. All networks operated in Africa, but networks A and C also provided services in other resource-constrained regions. Two of the networks (networks B and C) used local staff to submit referrals, while network A relied mainly on its expatriate staff. During the first half of 2020, the numbers of referrals received on network B increased substantially, while in contrast, the numbers of referrals on network A declined. All three networks had relatively stable referral rates during 2018 and 2019. All three networks delivered a service that was rated highly by the referrers. One network operated at relatively high efficiency compared to the other two, although it is not known if this is sustainable. The networks which were more reliant on local referrers saw little reductionor even an increasein submitted cases, while the network that had the most dependence on international staff saw a big fall in submitted cases.

Disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite were used, yet no scientific evidence is available on its effectiveness to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 on the human body through spraying, although this chemical is effective in the elimination of the virus on inanimate surfaces. Since safety issues are of importance, countries have halted the operation of these tunnels. Available literature has suggested several effective disinfectants against SARSCoV-2, including iodine-based solution, such as povidone-iodine (PVP-I). This report describes the evaluation of the bactericidal activity of PVP-I in comparison to sodium hypochlorite, both in vitro and following spraying under a model tunnel. Two bacteria strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600) were used as model microorganisms. The spraying pattern and droplets distribution from the tunnel are also being described and were correlated with the effectiveness of the disinfectant droplets to eliminate the model bacteria. Results showed that 0.5 % v/v PVP-I and 0.5% v/v sodium hypochlorite are bactericidal (>5 log10 reduction) in vitro. However, sprayed disinfectants did not show similar activity. Bacterial growth was seen in all cloth samples for 0.5% v/v PVP-I and all cloth samples except right shoulder for 0.5 % v/v sodium hypochlorite.

The presence of a huge inflammatory response, defined as \\"cytokine storm,\\" is being studied in order to understand what might be the prognostic factors implicated in the progression of the infection, with ferritin being one of such markers. The role of ferritin as a marker of inflammation is already known, and whether it changes differently between COVID and non-COVID patients still remains unclear. The aim of this retrospective analysis is to understand whether the inflammatory process in these two types is different. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, we compared 17 patients affected by SARS-CoV-2, who had been admitted between February and April 2020 (group A) along with 30 patients admitted for acute surgical disease with SARS-CoV-2 negative swab (group B). A further subgroup of Covid negative patients with leukocytosis was compared to group A. RESULTS: In group A, the median (interquartile range) serum ferritin was 674 (1284) ng/mL, and it was double the cutoff (300 ng/mL) in 9 out of 17 (52%). The median (IQR) value of ferritin level in the total blood samples of group B was 231, and in the subgroup with leucocytosis, 149 (145). Group A showed a significantly higher ferritin median level compared to the entire group B (two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.0001) as well as to the subgroup with leucocytosis (p < 0.0014). CONCLUSIONS: The role of iron metabolism appears to be directly involved in COVID infection.

We placed SARS-CoV-2-challenged index hamsters and naive hamsters into closed system units each comprising 2 different cages separated by a polyvinyl chloride air porous partition with unidirectional airflow within the isolator. The effect of a surgical mask partition placed between the cages was investigated. Besides clinical scoring, hamster specimens were tested for viral load, histopathology, and viral nucleocapsid antigen expression. RESULTS: Noncontact transmission was found in 66.7% (10/15) of exposed naive hamsters. Surgical mask partition for challenged index or naive hamsters significantly reduced transmission to 25% (6/24, P = .018). Surgical mask partition for challenged index hamsters significantly reduced transmission to only 16.7% (2/12, P = .019) of exposed naive hamsters. Unlike the severe manifestations of challenged hamsters, infected naive hamsters had lower clinical scores, milder histopathological changes, and lower viral nucleocapsid antigen expression in respiratory tract tissues. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by respiratory droplets or airborne droplet nuclei which could be reduced by surgical mask partition in the hamster model. This is the first in vivo experimental evidence to support the possible benefit of surgical mask in prevention of COVID-19 transmission, especially when masks were worn by infected individuals.","output":"Surgical Mask Partition Reduces the Risk of Noncontact Transmission in a Golden Syrian Hamster Model for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Computed Tomography (CT) departments have established additional acute capacity whilst maintaining essential services. The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in service delivery, working practices and decision-making role of diagnostic radiographers during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an electronic cross-sectional survey of diagnostic radiographers working in CT during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was open for 6-weeks, with radiographers from all geographical regions encouraged to respond. The questionnaire explored social distancing, patient scheduling and departmental organisation; PPE usage; recognition and escalation of COVID-19 changes, patient management pathways and any training. Additionally, we sought the personal perspectives of radiographers through free text comments. RESULTS: Following exclusions, 180 responses were analysed. Service delivery changes included social distancing (59.4%; n= 107), restriction of referrals to those considered time-critical (63.3%; n=114) and dedicated COVID-19 scanners (66.1%; n=119). Working practices were impacted by a need to implement PPE, although variation in PPE worn for different scenarios was seen. Half of the radiographers were routinely reviewing asymptomatic outpatient images for common COVID-19 signs, despite 63.5% of respondents not receiving formal training. Ad hoc patient pathways were in place in 90.5% of cases with 35% indicating that this was radiographer-led. CT staff had experienced anxiety, fatigue, and low morale, but praised teamwork. CONCLUSIONS: Radiographers were able to reduce the risk of transmission through social distancing, designated scanners, and PPE.

Delirium was assessed postoperative days 1-5. Exact logistic regression was used to determine whether sleep efficiency or apnea/hypopnea index predicts delirium. RESULTS Of 18 study participants, 15 successfully completed a home sleep study (mean age: 71.7 +/- 8.1 years old; 10 male subjects). Five subjects (33.3%) developed delirium.

METHODOLOGY Following a systematic search, we included any document endorsed by an organ donation organization, a professional society, or a government, that aims to direct the medical management of adult, neurologically deceased, multi-organ donors. We extracted recommendations pertaining to six domains: the autonomic storm, hemodynamic instability, hormone supplementation, ventilation, blood product transfusions, and general intensive care unit (ICU) care. Methodological quality of the guidelines was assessed by the validated AGREE-II tool. MAIN FINDINGS This review includes 27 clinical practice guidelines representing 26 countries published between 1993 and 2019. Using the AGREE-II validated tool for the evaluation of guidelines' quality, documents generally scored well on their scope and clarity of presentation. Nevertheless, quality was limited in terms of the scientific rigor of guideline development. Recommendations varied substantially across the domains of managing the autonomic storm, subsequent management of hemodynamic instability, hormone therapy, mechanical ventilation, blood product transfusion, and general ICU care. We found consistent recommendations for low tidal volume ventilation subsequent to the publication of a landmark clinical trial. CONCLUSION Highly inconsistent recommendations for deceased donor care summarized in this review likely reflect the relatively slow emergence of high-quality clinical research in this field, as well as a late uptake of recent validated guideline methodology. Even in this context of few randomized-controlled trials, our group supported the need for new Canadian guidelines for the management of organ donors that follow rigorous recognized methodology and grading of the evidence.

Increasing evidence suggests an association between childhood OSA and metabolic syndrome such as markers of cardiovascular disease, systemic hypertension, glucose intoleranceand increased lipid profile. Recent studies have targeted changes in metabolic markers in children using non-invasive ventilation (NIV) but no systematic reviews are available to summarise this emerging evidence. The purpose of this systematic review is to provide systematic synthesis of the evidence on the effect of NIV use on metabolic markers in children with OSA. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic search of electronic databases and grey literature will include paediatric interventional studies (random controlled trials, cohort studies) with and without a comparison group. Two reviewers will independently undertake the two step process of title/abstract and full-text screening. Data will be extracted and assessed, with aggregate data being reported. When the data allow, meta-analysis will be performed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION There are no ethical concerns with this systematic review, as data have previously been published. This review will inform clinicians taking care of children with OSA and obesity/metabolic syndrome about the potential effects of NIV therapies on metabolic markers and has the potential to change the approach to childhood OSA and obesity.

India has enforced a lockdown on 24th March 2020 and was subsequently extended in various phases. The lockdown due to the sudden spurt of the COVID-19 pandemic has shown a significant decline in concentration of air pollutants across India. The present article dealt with scenarios of air quality concentration of air pollutants, and effect on climatic variability during the COVID-19 lockdown period in Kolkata Metropolitan Area, India. The result showed that the air pollutants are significantly reduced and the air quality index (AQI) was improved during the lockdown months. Aerosol concentrations decreased by ? 54.94% from the period of pre-lockdown. The major air pollutants like particulate matters (PM(2.5), PM(10)), sulphur dioxide (SO(2)), carbon monoxide (CO) and Ozone (O(3)) were observed the maximum reduction ( ? 40 to ? 60%) in the COVID-19 lockdown period. The AQI has been improved by 54.94% in the lockdown period. On the other hand, Sens slope rank and the MannCKendal trend test showed the daily decreased of air pollutants rate is ? 0.051 to ? 1.586 g /m3.

Among the extrapulmonary manifestations reported, cardiovascular implications are remarkable as they can be potentially lethal. There have been rare reports of pericardial involvement, despite the pronounced cardiovascular complications including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock and venous thromboembolism. Herein, we reported a young man with cardiac tamponade as the presenting feature of COVID-19. CASE SUMMARY: An otherwise healthy 28-year-old man, was admitted with pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath and was diagnosed with COVID-19 associated cardiac tamponade. Emergency pericardiocentesis yielded large amount of hemorrhagic pericardial effusion which resulted in symptom relief. He was successfully treated with pericardiocentesis followed by anti-viral and anti-inflammatory medications and remained asymptomatic in 1-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: We highlight this case to mention that hemorrhagic cardiac tamponade can be a life-threatening complication of COVID-19, which can be treated if diagnosed early. Therefore, clinicians should be fully aware of this cardiac complication to consider in deteriorating COVID-19 patients.

Metabolic syndrome, which is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, may be a suitable alternative to traditional cardiovascular risk calculators that underestimate risk in young women. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in women who experienced a complicated pregnancy 6 months earlier. METHODS: This observational study investigated the prevalence of metabolic syndrome as defined by the International Diabetes Federation in all eligible participants (n = 247) attending a postpartum lifestyle intervention clinic from August 2018 to June 2021 at the Lyell McEwin Hospital in Adelaide, South Australia. RESULTS: A total of 89 (36%) participants met the criteria for metabolic syndrome at a mean follow up time of 7 months postpartum. Almost 90% of the cohort were abdominally obese, and over two thirds of the total cohort met at least two of the criteria for metabolic syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Women with a prior history of one of the common major pregnancy complications are at high risk of future cardiovascular and metabolic disease, with many showing either metabolic syndrome or multiple risk factors at only 7 months postpartum.

The paper articulates an improvisational approach to media architecture in the form of self-reflection by the project initiators. Necessitated by the limitations imposed by the lockdowns on cultural production and public discourse, the paper presents an alternative conceptual approach to media architecture that is not based on a fully-specified technological infrastructure for discourse and interaction but instead on improvisational practices that manifest themselves in different technical interfaces. This improvisational approach is not merely a mode of production, but raises questions of about the discourse of media architecture and its underlying assumptions of methodological rigor. In traditional HCI, systems and artifacts are often presented as stable and fully specified, while their users are considered interchangeable. In contrast, we consider urban media interfaces as improvisation-driven infrastructures (or improstructures) in which the actors and their relationships are stable, while the technologies they create are provisional and in flux. As a consequence, the defining property of media architecture is no longer the structural integration of media into architecture but the embodiment of mediated communication in objects and performances at concrete places. In an environment where many physical spaces are longer accessible and human contact among strangers diminished, the project explores the restorative function and capacities of media architecture for shared reflection and discourse in physical public space.","output":"Distancing interfaces -- improvisational media architectures for place-based discourse under lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza vaccination (fluv) is free and easily accessible to diabetics in Quebec.

Pts were asked if they planned taking the fluv and/or an eventual CVv, reasons for reticence to v, and attitudes toward and compliance with public health (PH) directives. They were also asked their primary source of health related information. Recent HbA1c and insulin use were recorded. Thirty four T2Ds were surveyed, 22 M 50C87 yrs (mean 69.2) and 12 F 49C84 yrs (mean 68.8). Eleven M and 5 F were on insulin. HbA1c ranged from 5.9C13.0 (mean 7.3). None of the pts had recently discussed v with a healthcare provider (HCP). One pt received his health related information from Facebook, the others from mainstream media. None had contraindications to v. None had been diagnosed with CV19. Past influenza history was unknown. Forty one percent (14/34) of pts, 11 M 50C86 yrs (mean 66.0) and 3 F 49C66 yrs (mean 59.0) did not plan to take the fluv. They explained their decisions as never having taken fluv (12 pts) or having been ill despite having taken it (2 pts). Neither accessibility nor cost were issues. Two F, 62 and 66 yrs, who refused fluv also refused CVv. Six M aged 60C86 yrs (mean 70.5) and 1 F aged 73 yrs were planning to wait to access real life safety (6pts) or efficacy (1pt) data before accepting CVv. All pts claimed to be following PH guidelines including social distancing, hand washing, and mask recommendations; 91.2% (31/34) fully agreed with PH policies, 2 were in moderate agreement and 1 thought PH policy was not strict enough. Of the latter 3 pts none planned on taking the fluv. One planned taking the CVv, 1 planned not to, and the 3rd planned to wait before deciding. Despite a long history of use, recommendations by experts, and free and easy accessibility, T2D pts questioned after the 1(st) wave of CV19 are not convinced of the fluvs importance.

To unravel the molecular mechanisms under soybean drought tolerance, we conducted comprehensive comparative transcriptome analyses of drought-tolerant genotype Jindou 21 (JD) and drought-sensitive genotype Tianlong No.1 (N1) seedlings that had been exposed to drought treatment. A total of 6038 and 4112 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in drought-tolerant JD and drought-sensitive N1, respectively. Subsequent KEGG pathway analyses showed that numerous DEGs in JD are predominately involved in signal transduction pathways, including plant hormone signaling pathway, calcium signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway. Interestingly, JA and BR plant hormone signal transduction pathways were found specifically participating in drought-tolerant JD. Meanwhile, the differentially expressed CPKs, CIPKs, MAPKs, and MAP3Ks of calcium and MAPK signaling pathway were only identified in JD. The number of DEGs involved in transcription factors (TFs) is larger in JD than that of in N1. Moreover, some differently expressed transcriptional factor genes were only identified in drought-tolerant JD, including FAR1, RAV, LSD1, EIL, and HB-PHD. In addition, this study suggested that JD could respond to drought stress by regulating the cell wall remodeling and stress-related protein genes such as EXPs, CALSs, CBPs, BBXs, and RD22s. JD is more drought tolerant than N1 owing to more DEGs being involved in multiple signal transduction pathways (JA, BR, calcium, MAPK signaling pathway), stress-related TFs, and proteins. The above valuable genes and pathways will deepen the understanding of the molecular mechanisms under drought stress in soybean.","output":"Key Soybean Seedlings Drought-Responsive Genes and Pathways Revealed by Comparative Transcriptome Analyses of Two Cultivars"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In diagnostic evaluation, it is necessary to assess the clinical impact of a new diagnostic as well as its diagnostic accuracy. The comparative interrupted time series design has been proposed as a quasi-experimental approach to evaluating interventions. We show how it can be used in the design of a study to evaluate a point-of-care diagnostic test for C-reactive protein in out-of-hours primary care services, to guide antibiotic prescribing among patients presenting with possible respiratory tract infection. This study consisted of a retrospective phase that used routinely collected monthly antibiotic prescribing data from different study sites, and a prospective phase in which antibiotic prescribing rates were monitored after the C-reactive protein diagnostic was introduced at some of the sites. METHODS: Of 8 study sites, 3 were assigned to receive the diagnostic and 5 were assigned as controls. We obtained retrospective monthly time series of respiratory tract targeted antibiotic prescriptions at each site. Separate ARIMA models at each site were used these to forecast monthly prescription counts that would be expected in the prospective phase, using simulation to obtain a set of 1-year predictions alongside their standard errors. We show how these forecasts can be combined to test for a change in prescription rates after introduction of the diagnostic and estimate power to detect this change. RESULTS: Fitted time series models at each site were stationary and showed second-order annual seasonality, with a clear December peak in prescriptions, although the timing and extent of the peak varied between sites and between years. Mean one-year predictions of antibiotic prescribing rates based on the retrospective time series analysis differed between sites assigned to receive the diagnostic and those assigned to control. Adjusting for the trend in the retrospective time series at each site removed these differences. CONCLUSIONS: Quasi-experimental designs such as comparative interrupted time series can be used in diagnostic evaluation to estimate effect sizes before conducting a full randomised controlled trial or if a randomised trial is infeasible. In multi-site studies, existing retrospective data should be used to adjust for underlying differences between sites to make outcome data from different sites comparable, when possible.

The C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (CAR) is a novel inflammation-based prognostic score. This study was performed to examine the associations of the preoperative CAR with clinical outcomes in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) after curative resection. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the preoperative CAR in 184 patients who underwent curative resection for CRLM from November 2001 to January 2018 at Kumamoto University (Kumamoto, Japan). The optimal cutoff level of the preoperative CAR was determined by survival classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. We compared clinicopathological factors and prognoses between the high-CAR and low-CAR groups. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs), controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: A higher preoperative CAR was associated with worse overall survival (OS) (p < 0.0001) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (p = 0.003). Applying survival CART analysis, the high-CAR group comprised 33 patients (17.9%). In the multivariate analyses, a high CAR was independently associated with shorter OS (HR, 2.82; 95% confidence interval, 1.63-4.72; p = 0.0004) and RFS (HR, 1.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.49; p = 0.040). A high CAR was associated with a large tumor size, high serum carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels, high intraoperative blood loss, and more postoperative complications. CONCLUSION: A high preoperative CAR is associated with shorter OS and RFS and might serve as a prognostic marker for patients with CRLM after curative resection.","output":"Preoperative C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio and clinical outcomes after resection of colorectal liver metastases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is common cause of acute respiratory infection in infants and young children Group life in postpartum care centers is easily exposed to infectious diseases in neonates and puerperds immediately after giving birth, and the harm caused by exposure to them is much greater In particular, respiratory diseases are highly infectious and infections occur in a short period of time among them, RSV infections are very serious in children under 5 years of age, leading to death This paper studied an infection of RSV in outbreaks at postpartum care center in Busan In 4 postpartum care centers, a total of 877 people (390 neonates, 386 puerperds, 106 others) were exposed to RSV outbreak Of these, there were 73 RSV-positive patients;most of them had cough and runny nose and no fever We were collected from neonates and puerperds with acute respiratory tract a total of 146 samples (throat swabs) In 51 samples, RSV (43 cases), human rhinovirus (6 cases), human coronavirus NL63 (1 case), and human coronavirus 229E (1 case) were found to be positive and the rest were negative All 43 RSV positive samples were identified as RSV B Sequence analysis of the detected strains was performed to confirm the molecular genetic information of RSV Out of 43 RSV positive samples, 38 samples were successfully sequenced using the G gene, resulting in all of the same genotype BA9 This study provides a better understanding of RSV prevalence patterns and genetic characteristics It also contributes to the accumulation of epidemiological data and the development of public health and hygiene","output":"A Study of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Outbreak at Postpartum Care Center in Busan, Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oscillating series of scores can be approximated with locally optimized smoothing functions.

We estimated the incidence of outpatient illness due to 12 different viruses during November 2018 through April 2019 in a fully enumerated population. METHODS: We conducted active surveillance for ambulatory care visits for acute respiratory illness (ARI) among members of Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA). Enrolled patients provided respiratory swab specimens which were tested for 12 respiratory viruses using RT-PCR. We estimated the cumulative incidence of infection due to each virus overall and by age group. RESULTS: The KPWA population under surveillance included 202,562 individuals, of whom 2,767 (1.4%) were enrolled in the study. Influenza A(H3N2) was the most commonly detected virus, with an overall incidence 21 medically attended illnesses per 1,000 population; the next most common viruses were influenza A(H1N1) (18 per 1,000), coronaviruses (13 per 1,000), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 13 per 1,000), and rhinovirus (9 per 1,000). RSV was the most common cause of medically attended ARI among children aged 1-4 years; coronaviruses were the most common among adults aged &#8805;65 years.

Twenty (7.6%) episodes resulted in transfer to hospital and 136 patients provided responses to feedback surveys and reported their experience as very good (61.7%, n=87) or good (34.8%, n=49). Implementation success was high, with the model widely accepted and adopted across the health service. The service delivery model was considered to be low-cost in comparison to inpatient hospital-based care.ConclusionsOverall, as a rapidly developed and implemented low-tech model of care, the virtual ward was found to provide an effective, accessible and low-cost solution to managing low-acuity COVID-19-positive patients in the community. This model should be considered in future pandemics as a hospital-avoidance response, with the ability to minimise patient-to-healthcare worker transmission, reduce personal protective equipment use and enhance patient adherence with isolation requirements.

Peer review articles containing their own data collected between 1986 and 2022 were reviewed. We reviewed 67 peer review articles and included 33 that met criteria. Studies focused on the adverse risk factors and the results of patients either before/after receiving adjuvant or early salvage/salvage radiotherapy were included in the analysis. Patient characteristics had an effect on what treatment a patient would receive; if a patient had more than one adverse risk factor such as a high Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, T-stage, or positive margins, they would receive immediate radiation after prostatectomy, which would classify as ART. If the patient had no adverse risk factors after surgery, they would be placed in an observation period to follow their PSA and overall health, and only if necessary, undergo ESRT. Of the 33 studies, ART was proven to be only slightly more beneficial when relating to biochemical recurrence-free survival while ART and ESRT results were similar in metastasis-free survival and overall survival. ART and ESRT are overall comparable in their patient outcomes, despite their own unique pros and cons. The use of ESRT reduces overtreatment in men who may not experience biochemical recurrence.

MATERIAL AND METHODS We report a prospective and randomized study of patients who have been operated on for inguinal hernia between march of 2009 to march 2010, divided into 2 groups of 45 patients. In AutoAdhesive (AA) group, we included patients operated on with an autoadhesive mesh and in Classic Lichtenstein (CL) group we included cases with an inguinal hernioplasty with sutured polypropylene mesh. We evaluated time of inactivity, complications, recurrences and grade of pain after one year. RESULTS The mean age was 60 years in AA group and 49 in LC group. There were more men than women and there were no differences in co-morbilities between groups. The mean size of hernia orifice was 3cm in both groups and 60% of the hernias were indirect. After one year, 77 patients were evaluated; 39 in LC group and 38 in AA group. 86,8% and 87,2% of them were asymptomatic. The mean time of recovery of daily activities was 15 days in both groups. There were neither recurrences nor severe chronic pain in the AA group. The mean of grade of pain was 0 (range:0-4) in AA group and 0 (range: 0-5) in LC group. In this group, there was one recurrence and one patient was taking analgesics for intense pain. No mortality nor other long term complications were found.

Although previously thought to be a benign, self-limiting condition, recent studies have confirmed that patients with takotsubo syndrome have persistent subtle ongoing cardiac dysfunction, and many continue to have limiting symptoms despite restoration of left ventricular ejection fraction. Moreover, these patients have a substantial burden of morbidity as well as mortality with high rates of subsequent major adverse cardiovascular events that approach those of patients with acute coronary syndrome. The mechanisms behind this condition remain elusive. Despite substantial research, the medical community continues to have an incomplete understanding of its underlying etiology and pathophysiology. Catecholamine-induced myocardial injury is the most established and well-known theory, but this does not explain all of the clinical features and presentations of the condition, and numerous other pathways and abnormalities are emerging. Because of the poor understanding of its underlying pathophysiology, there is a lack of evidence-based interventions to treat the acute episode, to avoid recurrences and to prevent major adverse cardiovascular events.

Once infection has occurred, FCV can persist in the cat population, but the molecular mechanism of how it escapes the innate immune response is still unknown. In this study, we found FCV strain 2280 to be relatively resistant to treatment with IFN-. FCV 2280 infection inhibited IFN-induced activation of the ISRE (Interferon-stimulated response element) promoter and transcription of ISGs (Interferon-stimulated genes). The mechanistic analysis showed that the expression of IFNAR1, but not IFNAR2, was markedly reduced in FCV 2280-infected cells by inducing the degradation of IFNAR1 mRNA, which inhibited the phosphorylation of downstream adaptors. Further, overexpression of the FCV 2280 nonstructural protein p30, but not p30 of the attenuated strain F9, downregulated the expression of IFNAR1 mRNA. His-p30 fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and purified, and an in vitro digestion assay was performed. The results showed that 2280 His-p30 could directly degrade IFNAR1 RNA but not IFNAR2 RNA. Moreover, the 5UTR of IFNAR1 mRNA renders it directly susceptible to cleavage by 2280 p30. Next, we constructed two chimeric viruses: rFCV 2280-F9 p30 and rFCV F9-2280 p30. Compared to infection with the parental virus, rFCV 2280-F9 p30 infection displayed attenuated activities in reducing the level of IFNAR1 and inhibiting the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, whereas rFCV F9-2280 p30 displayed enhanced activities. Animal experiments showed that the virulence of rFCV 2280-F9 p30 infection was attenuated but that the virulence of rFCV F9-2280 p30 was increased compared to that of the parental viruses. Collectively, these data show that FCV 2280 p30 could directly and selectively degrade IFNAR1 mRNA, thus blocking the type I interferon-induced activation of the JAK-STAT signalling pathway, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of FCV infection.","output":"Feline calicivirus strain 2280 p30 antagonizes type I interferon-mediated antiviral innate immunity through directly degrading IFNAR1 mRNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101641.].","output":"Corrigendum to \\"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and COVID-19 infection during pregnancy\\" [Trav Med Infect Dis.

Global events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have clearly shown that social inequalities also manifest within communication structures, including those of science communication. Practices which are inclusive of diverse audiences are key if we wish to engage diverse audiences in finding solutions to societal issues. Yet there is little available evidence to show which diverse, marginalised and/or excluded groups are being engaged within science communication, and via what means. This paper develops a systematic map of academic literature spanning 40 years to provide a preliminary evidence base of how diversity and inclusion within science communication research and practice is conceived and implemented. Although the discipline has shown an increased focus within the last 5 years, science communication must evolve further in order to develop a robust evidence base for understanding what constitutes inclusive science communication in both theory and practice. ?

METHODS: Baseline UK Biobank data (2006-10) for England were linked to SARS-CoV-2 test results from Public Health England (16 March to 26 July 2020). Included participants were employed or self-employed at baseline, alive and aged <65 years in 2020. Poisson regression models were adjusted sequentially for baseline demographic, socioeconomic, work-related, health, and lifestyle-related risk factors to assess risk ratios (RRs) for testing positive in hospital or death due to COVID-19 by three occupational classification schemes (including Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) 2000). RESULTS: Of 120 075 participants, 271 had severe COVID-19. Relative to non-essential workers, healthcare workers (RR 7.43, 95% CI 5.52 to 10.00), social and education workers (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.82) and other essential workers (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.45) had a higher risk of severe COVID-19. Using more detailed groupings, medical support staff (RR 8.70, 95% CI 4.87 to 15.55), social care (RR 2.46, 95% CI 1.47 to 4.14) and transport workers (RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.21 to 4.00) had the highest risk within the broader groups.

Little is known of their travel health seeking behaviours. China is the biggest source of international students studying in Australia and the unprecedented epidemic of COVID-19 in China makes this an important area of research. METHODS: Focus groups of Chinese international students were conducted to explore travel health-related knowledge, attitudes and practices. Eligible participants were studying in Sydney, and had travelled to China and Hong Kong to visit friends and relatives in the preceding 18 months. A variety of topics were explored, using a focus group guide. Thematic analysis was undertaken on the transcripts using nVivo software. The list of codes and themes were not pre-determined but developed through content analysis. RESULTS: Two focus groups were held with a total of 28 participants. Risk perception about VFR travel was generally low among Chinese international students. Pre-travel healthcare was not sought. Students strongly relied on the Internet, social media, parents and friends in China for travel health advice.

In these facilities, viral transmission can be facilitated by shortages of human and material resources, which can lead to suboptimal application of infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures. To improve the dissemination of COVID-19 IPC guidelines, we developed a serious game called \\"Escape COVID-19\\" using Nicholson's RECIPE for meaningful gamification, as engaging serious games have the potential to induce behavioral change. OBJECTIVE: As the probability of executing an action is strongly linked to the intention of performing it, the objective of this study was to determine whether LTCF employees were willing to change their IPC practices after playing \\"Escape COVID-19.\\" METHODS: This was a web-based, triple-blind, randomized controlled trial, which took place between November 5 and December 4, 2020. The health authorities of Geneva, Switzerland, asked the managers of all LTCFs under their jurisdiction to forward information regarding the study to all their employees, regardless of professional status. Participants were unaware that they would be randomly allocated to one of two different study paths upon registration. In the control group, participants filled in a first questionnaire designed to gather demographic data and assess baseline knowledge before accessing regular online IPC guidelines. They then answered a second questionnaire, which assessed their willingness to change their IPC practices and identified the reasons underlying their decision. They were then granted access to the serious game. Conversely, the serious game group played \\"Escape COVID-19\\" after answering the first questionnaire but before answering the second one. This group accessed the control material after answering the second set of questions. There was no time limit. The primary outcome was the proportion of LTCF employees willing to change their IPC practices. Secondary outcomes included the factors underlying participants' decisions, the domains these changes would affect, changes in the use of protective equipment items, and attrition at each stage of the study. RESULTS: A total of 295 answer sets were analyzed. Willingness to change behavior was higher in the serious game group (82% [119/145] versus 56% [84/150]; P<.001), with an odds ratio of 3.86 (95% CI 2.18-6.81; P<.001) after adjusting for professional category and baseline knowledge, using a mixed effects logistic regression model with LTCF as a random effect. For more than two-thirds (142/203) of the participants, the feeling of playing an important role against the epidemic was the most important factor explaining their willingness to change behavior. Most of the participants unwilling to change their behavior answered that they were already applying all the guidelines.

Epidemic information and medical resources across different regions were collected and compared. Results All deaths from COVID-19 in Tianmen occurred in the hospital, and the proportion of patients with critical (8.5%) symptoms in the hospital is higher than the average in China. In addition, the number of affected patients in Tianmen is quite low, but the hospital and the whole city had the highest CFR in the early stage of the epidemic. Completely different from the stable CFR in Hubei Province, the CFR of COVID-19 in the hospital and city dropped dramatically, from the largest value in China to a more average level, within a few days. Analysis of government public documents showed that the per capita medical resources in Tianmen are worse than those of Wuhan and Hubei.

METHODS: This was a simple random study in which ophthalmologists practicing in Saudi Arabia were asked to fill in a self-administered online survey during the period from March 28, 2020, to April 04, 2020. Four validated psychiatric assessment tools were used to detect symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and stress perception. RESULTS: One hundred and seven participants successfully completed the survey with a response rate of 30.6%. Males constituted 56.1% (n = 60).

The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) was used to assess ELS in 100 young health participants. They were divided into two groups: \\"low\\" CTQ group (limitation of none/minimal ELS) and \\"high\\" CTQ group (low to moderate ELS).

The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 is known to spread by human-to-human transmission, and in about 40% cases, the exposed individuals are asymptomatic which makes it difficult to contain the virus. Methods: This paper presents a modified SEIR epidemiological model and uses concepts of optimal control theory for analysis of the effects of intervention methods of the COVID19. Fundamentally the pandemic intervention problem can be viewed as a mathematical optimization problem as there are contradictory outcomes in terms of reduced infection and fatalities but with serious economic downturns. Results: Concepts of optimal control theory have been used to determine the optimal control (intervention) levels of i) social contact mitigation and suppression, and ii) pharmaceutical intervention modalities, with minimum impacts on the economy. Numerical results show that with optimal intervention policies, there is a significant reduction in the number of infections and fatalities. The computed optimum intervention policy also provides a timeline of systematic enforcement and relaxation of stay-at-home regulations, and an estimate of the peak time and number of hospitalized critical care patients. Conclusion: The proposed method could be used by local and state governments in planning effective strategies in combating the pandemic. The optimum intervention policy provides the necessary lead time to establish necessary field hospitals before getting overwhelmed by new patient arrivals.

The short form Caregivers Well-Being Scale was collected for the mothers in each group 12 weeks before intervention (T1), at intervention initiation (T2), immediately after intervention termination (T3), as well as at 12 weeks after intervention termination (T4). Mothers of participants in the Group 1 showed a stable level of well-being across all four evaluations with a slight improvement during the lockdown, without significant change. Similarly, the well-being level of mothers in the Group 2 showed a statistically significant increase in their well-being between T2 and T3 (during the lockdown) and its reduction to the pre-intervention level between T3 and T4 (after the lockdown). The results suggest that the lockdown did not negatively affect the participants mothers well-being, leading to its improvement. Moreover, the proposed intervention could have supported the mothers in managing the new daily routine at home, positively affecting maternal well-being.","output":"Impact of a Remotely Supervised Motor Rehabilitation Program on Maternal Well-Being During the COVID-19 Italian Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several factors such as hypertension, bile duct disease, and age can affect the duration of COVID, which can lead to long COVID.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiology and etiologies of respiratory illnesses among pilgrims returning to Jordan after the 2014 Hajj. STUDY DESIGN: Surveillance for respiratory illness among pilgrims returning to Jordan after the 2014 Hajj was conducted at sentinel health care facilities using epidemiologic surveys and molecular diagnostic testing of upper respiratory specimens for multiple respiratory pathogens, including MERS-CoV. RESULTS: Among the 125 subjects, 58% tested positive for at least one virus; 47% tested positive for rhino/enterovirus. No cases of MERS-CoV were detected. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of pilgrims returning to Jordan from the 2014 Hajj with respiratory illness were determined to have a viral etiology, but none were due to MERS-CoV.

We investigated the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its association with sociodemographic characteristics, anthropometric measures, and lifestyle factors among premenopausal and postmenopausal women (n = 784). METHODS: Face-to-face interviews were conducted to collect information and serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were measured after the interviews. RESULTS: A total of 57% of women were vitamin D deficient with higher vitamin D deficiency found among premenopausal women (64.7%) compared to postmenopausal women (49%). The median serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (IQR) were 16.7 ng/ml (IQR 9.8C30.0). Factors associated with vitamin D deficiency were lower socioeconomic status (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.15C3.48), younger age with highest vitamin D deficiency found in < 35 years of age group (OR 3.11; 95% CI 1.76C5.51), and winter season (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.07C2.15) after adjusting for multiple confounders. The use of vitamin D supplement (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38C0.92) and vigorous exercise (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05C0.80) were protective against vitamin D deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, with detrimental health effects, among younger women belonging to lower socioeconomic status and during the winter season. The use of vitamin D supplements and vigorous exercise were protective measures. Public health campaigns are needed for education and awareness about vitamin D deficiency to improve vitamin D status for younger women living in poor environments.

The purpose of this study was to examine how municipalities in one Finnish region promote mental health, with a focus on the promotion of childrens mental health. METHODS: Document analysis was used as a research method. Documents were selected for a one-year period (2018) from three municipalities of the North Savo region. Analysed documents (n=269) were municipal strategies, programmes and plans, as well as meeting minutes of municipal councils, boards and committees. Eight domains of the structural indicators of mental health were used as an analysis frame.

The Philippines is a LMIC that has had a relatively severe COVID-19 outbreak but has recently curtailed transmission while gradually easing interventions. Methods We applied an age-structured compartmental model that incorporated time-varying mobility, testing, and personal protective behaviors (through a Minimum Health Standards policy, MHS) to represent the Philippines COVID-19 epidemic nationally and for three highly affected regions (Calabarzon, Central Visayas, and the National Capital Region). We estimated effects of control measures, key epidemiological parameters, and projected the impacts of easing interventions. Results Population age structure, contact rates, mobility, testing, and MHS were sufficient to explain the Philippines epidemic based on the good fit between modelled and reported cases, hospitalisations, and deaths. Several of the fitted epidemiological parameters were consistent with those reported in high-income settings. The model indicated that MHS reduced the probability of transmission per contact by 15-32%. The December 2020 case detection rate was estimated at ~14%, population recovered at ~12%, and scenario projections indicated high sensitivity to MHS adherence. Conclusions COVID-19 dynamics in the Philippines are driven by age, contact structure, and mobility, and the epidemic can be understood within a similar framework as for high-income settings. Continued compliance with low-cost MHS measures should allow the Philippines to maintain epidemic control, but disease resurgence remains a threat due to low population immunity and detection rates.","output":"Understanding COVID-19 dynamics and the effects of interventions in the Philippines: A mathematical modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of 2021 a new SARS-CoV-2 variant, Omicron, emerged and quickly spread across the world. It has been demonstrated that Omicrons high number of Spike mutations lead to partial immune evasion from even polyclonal antibody responses, allowing frequent re-infection and vaccine breakthroughs. However, it seems unlikely these antigenic differences alone explain its rapid growth; here we show Omicron replicates rapidly in human primary airway cultures, more so even than the previously dominant variant of concern, Delta. Omicron Spike continues to use human ACE2 as its primary receptor, to which it binds more strongly than other variants. Omicron Spike mediates enhanced entry into cells expressing several different animal ACE2s, including various domestic avian species, horseshoe bats and mice suggesting it has an increased propensity for reverse zoonosis and is more likely than previous variants to establish an animal reservoir of SARS-CoV-2. Unlike other SARS-CoV-2 variants, however, Omicron Spike has a diminished ability to induce syncytia formation. Furthermore, Omicron is capable of efficiently entering cells in a TMPRSS2-independent manner, via the endosomal route. We posit this enables Omicron to infect a greater number of cells in the respiratory epithelium, allowing it to be more infectious at lower exposure doses, and resulting in enhanced intrinsic transmissibility.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 variant, Omicron, shows rapid replication in human primary nasal epithelial cultures and efficiently uses the endosomal route of entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we provided a comprehensive methodology for designing and integrating miniature system in the biosensor application.

We investigated the incidence and prognostic implications of early hepatic dysfunction (serum bilirubin >2 mg/dL within 48 hrs of admission). DESIGN Prospective, multicenter cohort study. SETTING Thirty-two medical, surgical, and mixed intensive care units. PATIENTS A total of 38,036 adult patients admitted consecutively over a period of 4 yrs. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Excluding patients with preexisting cirrhosis (n = 691; 1.8%) and acute or acute-on-chronic hepatic failure (n = 108, 0.3%), we identified 4,146 patients (10.9%) with early hepatic dysfunction. These patients had different baseline characteristics, longer median intensive care unit stays (5 vs. 3 days; p < .001) and increased hospital mortality (30.4% vs. 16.4%; p < .001). Hepatic dysfunction was also associated with higher observed-to-expected mortality ratios (1.02 vs. 0.91; p < .001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed an independent mortality risk of hepatic dysfunction (odds ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.71-2.03; p < .001), which exceeded the impact of all other organ dysfunctions. A case-control study further confirmed these results: Patients with early hepatic dysfunction exhibited significantly increased raw and risk-adjusted mortality compared with control subjects.

After controls, all four studies found a positive association between intention to be vaccinated and usage of broadcast and print media. The three studies which operationalised media usage in terms of frequency found no effect for social media. However, the study which operationalised media use in terms of informational reliance found a negative effect for social media. Youth, low household income, female gender, below degree-level of education, and membership of other than white ethnic groups were each also found to be associated with lower intentions to be vaccinated in at least two of the four studies. In all four studies, intention to be vaccinated was positively associated with having voted either for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential elections or for Labour Party candidates in the 2019 UK general election. Neither of the UK studies found an association with having voted for Conservative Party candidates, but both US studies found a negative association between intention to be vaccinated and having voted for Donald Trump. The consistent finding of greater intention to be vaccinated among users of legacy media but not among users of social media suggests that social media do not currently provide an adequate replacement for legacy media, at least in terms of public health communication.

Epidemics are non-linear processes. Results may be counterintuitive. The average number of vulnerable persons infected by an infectious fit person is a crucial parameter of the epidemic in the two type population. Intuitively this parameter should be small.

The hallmark of pathophysiology in acute respiratory distress syndrome is the loss of the alveolar capillary permeability barrier and the presence of protein-rich edema fluid in the alveoli. This alteration in permeability and accumulation of fluid in the alveoli accompanies damage to the lung epithelium and vascular endothelium along with dysregulated inflammation and inappropriate activity of leukocytes and platelets. In addition, there is uncontrolled activation of coagulation along with suppression of fibrinolysis and loss of surfactant. These pathophysiological changes result in the clinical manifestations of acute respiratory distress syndrome, which include hypoxemia, radiographic opacities, decreased functional residual capacity, increased physiologic deadspace, and decreased lung compliance. Resolution of acute respiratory distress syndrome involves the migration of cells to the site of injury and re-establishment of the epithelium and endothelium with or without the development of fibrosis. Most of the data related to acute respiratory distress syndrome, however, originate from studies in adults or in mature animals with very few studies performed in children or juvenile animals. The lack of studies in children is particularly problematic because the lungs and immune system are still developing during childhood and consequently the pathophysiology of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome may differ in significant ways from that seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults.

Our theoretical framework reproduces the recent explosive growth in anti-vaccination views, and predicts that these views will dominate in a decade. Insights provided by this framework can inform new policies and approaches to interrupt this shift to negative views.

At the same time, the collapse of the boundaries between these domains imposed by the pandemic created unique opportunities for intersectoral planning and collaboration. While the challenge of integration is not unique to oncology, the organisation of cancer care and its linkages to palliative care and to global health may allow it to be a demonstration model for how the problem of integration can be addressed. Before the pandemic, the large majority of individuals with cancer in need of palliative care in low- and middle-income countries and the poor or marginalised in high-income countries were denied access. This inequity was highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as individuals in impoverished or population-dense settings with weak health systems have been more likely to become infected and to have less access to medical care and to palliative and end-of-life care. Such inequities deserve attention by government, financial institutions and decision makers in health care. However, there has been no framework in most countries for integrated decision-making that takes into account the requirements of public health, clinical medicine and palliative and end-of-life care.

Therefore, developing accurate forecasting models to improve epidemic prediction towards better prevention and capabilities management is a complex task. Here, we describe an exploratory analysis to identify non-health risk factors that could improve the forecast and events risk signals using a feasible and practical approach by combining surveillance report data with non-health data from open data sources. Methods: A line listing was developed using information from the World Health Organization Disease Outbreaks News from 2016-2018. A database was created merging the line listing data with non-health indicators from the World Bank. Poisson regression models employing forward imputations were used to establish relationships and predict values over the dependent variable (health event frequency); which are the health events reported by each country to WHO during 2016-2018. Findings: The resulting regression model provided evidence that changes in non-health factors important to community experiences impact the risk of the number of major health events that a country could experience. Three non-health indicators (extrinsic factors) were associated significantly to event frequency (population urban change, gross domestic product change per capita -a novel factor, and average forest area). An exploratory analysis of the current COVID-19 pandemic suggested similar associations, but confounding by global disease burden is likely. Conclusion: Continued development of forecasting approaches capturing available whole-of-society extrinsic factors (non-health factors); could improve the risk management process through earlier hazard identification, and as importantly inform strategic decision processes in multisectoral strategies to preventing, detecting, and responding to pandemic-threat events.","output":"Identifying Non-traditional Epidemic Disease Risk Factors associated to major Health Events from WHO and World Bank Open Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Activation of the serum-resident complement system begins a cascade that leads to activation of membrane-resident complement receptors on immune cells, thus coordinating serum and cellular immune responses.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic (1). That same day, the first confirmed COVID-19-associated fatality occurred in New York City (NYC). To identify confirmed COVID-19-associated deaths, defined as those occurring in persons with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, on March 13, 2020, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) initiated a daily match between all deaths reported to the DOHMH electronic vital registry system (eVital) (2) and laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19. Deaths for which COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, or an equivalent term is listed on the death certificate as an immediate, underlying, or contributing cause of death, but that do not have laboratory-confirmation of COVID-19 are classified as probable COVID-19-associated deaths. As of May 2, a total of 13,831 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated deaths, and 5,048 probable COVID-19-associated deaths were recorded in NYC (3). Counting only confirmed or probable COVID-19-associated deaths, however, likely underestimates the number of deaths attributable to the pandemic. The counting of confirmed and probable COVID-19-associated deaths might not include deaths among persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection who did not access diagnostic testing, tested falsely negative, or became infected after testing negative, died outside of a health care setting, or for whom COVID-19 was not suspected by a health care provider as a cause of death. The counting of confirmed and probable COVID-19-associated deaths also does not include deaths that are not directly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The objective of this report is to provide an estimate of all-cause excess deaths that have occurred in NYC in the setting of widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Excess deaths refer to the number of deaths above expected seasonal baseline levels, regardless of the reported cause of death. Estimation of all-cause excess deaths is used as a nonspecific measure of the severity or impact of pandemics (4) and public health emergencies (5).

These cell types are derived from tracheobronchial stem/progenitor cells via a Notch dependent mechanism. Although specific arrays of Notch receptors regulate cell fate determination, the function of the ligands Jagged1 (JAG1) and Jagged2 (JAG2) is unclear. This study used primary human bronchial air-liquid- interface cultures, gamma secretase inhibition, and neutralizing antibodies to show: 1) JAG1 and JAG2 were necessary for secretory progenitor cell fate determination; 2) JAG2 suppressed squamous differentiation; and 3) pausing of the ciliated cell differentiation process after Notch inhibition. Histological, cell fractionation, cell surface biotinylation, and ubiquitination analyses demonstrated that all cells were JAG1 positive but that little JAG1 was present on the cell surface. In contrast, JAG2 was expressed in a positive-negative pattern and was abundant on the cell surface. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and tankyrase inhibition studies showed that GSK3 regulated JAG2 trafficking, and that this mechanism was WNT-independent. Collectively, these data indicate that variation in JAG2 trafficking creates regions of high, medium, and low ligand expression. Thus, distinct assemblies of JAG1 and JAG2 may regulate Notch signal strength and determine the fate of tracheobronchial stem/progenitor cells.

Due to the sporadic occurrence of the Ebola infection, there is insufficient research regarding how the United States emergency nurses provide care to patients potentially infected with the Ebola virus and the nurses motivation to protect themselves when providing care to these patients. This study was aimed to investigate the predictors of emergency room nurses protection motivation. Method A cross-sectional design was employed in the study. A survey developed based on a modified Protection Motivation Theory was administered to randomly selected emergency room nurses who are members of the Emergency Nurses Association. Descriptive statistics, nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H-Test (as well as post hoc Dunn-Bonferroni test), Spearman Rho correlation, and Stepwise Multiple Linear regression were conducted for data analysis. Result Protection motivation was found in two components: proactive and passive protection motivation. The regression analysis indicated that response efficacy (=.27, p<.001) and self-efficacy (=.17, p<.01) significantly predict emergency nurses proactive protection motivation, while perceived vulnerability (=.26, p<.001), response cost (=.19, p=.001) and knowledge (=-.15, p<.01) significantly predict emergency nurses passive protection motivation. Conclusion Results indicate the need for interventions to improve emergency nurses response efficacy, self-efficacy, and knowledge, while simultaneously reducing the nurses perceived vulnerability and response cost. Such interventions would be expected to proactively motivate nurses to protect themselves when providing care to patients that exhibit the signs and symptoms of an Ebola infection and reduce their passive protection motivation.","output":"A Cross-Sectional Examination on the Factors Related to Emergency Nurses Motivation to Protect Themselves against an Ebola Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM AND OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the economic impact and the dental practice changes associated with the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a cross-sectional survey conducted at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (May 2020). The study sample was derived from the Columbia University College of Dental Medicine Alumni network, which included the graduating classes between 1975 and 2015. Active dental practitioners were surveyed regarding changes to their current operations and protective safety measures through a 22 closed-ended questionnaire-based survey. RESULTS The response rate was 17%. Nearly 70.92% of respondents laid off at least one staff member during the COVID-19 pandemic, 51.80% expressed fear of permanent closure, and 79.43% applied for a small business administration loan. There were no significant associations between the amount of time in practice and the need to lay off staff members, the fear of going out of business, or the rates of application for the small business administration loan. Many practitioners bought at least one device geared toward reducing COVID-19 transmission, such as ultraviolet (UV) lights (26.21%), extraoral suctions (37.31%), and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) air filters (54.55%). CONCLUSION At the peak of the pandemic, the majority of dental providers had to reduce staff and seek financial assistance. Concurrently, many of these practices also invested in new safety equipment with the intention of reducing viral transmission. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE External mouth suctions, commercial air purifiers, and air exchange devices might be useful in the private practice setting. However, financially strained practitioners should recognize that these devices have not currently been proven to be effective against the COVID-19 virus.

Our Cochrane Review is restricted to studies with low-dose misoprostol (initially  50 g), as higher doses pose unacceptably high risks of uterine hyperstimulation. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of low-dose oral misoprostol for labour induction in women with a viable fetus in the third trimester of pregnancy. SEARCH METHODS: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (14 February 2021) and reference lists of retrieved studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing low-dose oral misoprostol (initial dose  50 g) versus placebo, vaginal dinoprostone, vaginal misoprostol, oxytocin, or mechanical methods; or comparing oral misoprostol protocols (one- to two-hourly versus four- to six-hourly; 20 g to 25 g versus 50 g; or 20 g hourly titrated versus 25 g two-hourly static). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Using Covidence, two review authors independently screened reports, extracted trial data, and performed quality assessments. Our primary outcomes were vaginal birth within 24 hours, caesarean section, and hyperstimulation with foetal heart changes. MAIN RESULTS: We included 61 trials involving 20,026 women. GRADE assessments ranged from moderate- to very low-certainty evidence, with downgrading decisions based on imprecision, inconsistency, and study limitations. Oral misoprostol versus placebo/no treatment (four trials; 594 women) Oral misoprostol may make little to no difference in the rate of caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.11; 4 trials; 594 women; moderate-certainty evidence), while its effect on uterine hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes is uncertain (RR 5.15, 95% CI 0.25 to 105.31; 3 trials; 495 women; very low-certainty evidence). Vaginal births within 24 hours was not reported. In all trials, oxytocin could be commenced after 12 to 24 hours and all women had pre-labour ruptured membranes. Oral misoprostol versus vaginal dinoprostone (13 trials; 9676 women) Oral misoprostol probably results in fewer caesarean sections (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.90; 13 trials, 9676 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Subgroup analysis indicated that 10 g to 25 g (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.87; 9 trials; 8652 women) may differ from 50 g (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.34; 4 trials; 1024 women) for caesarean section. Oral misoprostol may decrease vaginal births within 24 hours (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.00; 10 trials; 8983 women; low-certainty evidence) and hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.59; 11 trials; 9084 women; low-certainty evidence). Oral misoprostol versus vaginal misoprostol (33 trials; 6110 women) Oral use may result in fewer vaginal births within 24 hours (average RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95; 16 trials, 3451 women; low-certainty evidence), and less hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.92, 25 trials, 4857 women, low-certainty evidence), with subgroup analysis suggesting that 10 g to 25 g orally (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.57; 6 trials, 957 women) may be superior to 50 g orally (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.11; 19 trials; 3900 women). Oral misoprostol probably does not increase caesarean sections overall (average RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.16; 32 trials; 5914 women; low-certainty evidence) but likely results in fewer caesareans for foetal distress (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.99; 24 trials, 4775 women). Oral misoprostol versus intravenous oxytocin (6 trials; 737 women, 200 with ruptured membranes) Misoprostol may make little or no difference to vaginal births within 24 hours (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.33; 3 trials; 466 women; low-certainty evidence), but probably results in fewer caesarean sections (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.90; 6 trials; 737 women; moderate-certainty evidence). The effect on hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes is uncertain (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.26; 3 trials, 331 women; very low-certainty evidence). Oral misoprostol versus mechanical methods (6 trials; 2993 women) Six trials compared oral misoprostol to transcervical Foley catheter. Misoprostol may increase vaginal birth within 24 hours (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.79; 4 trials; 1044 women; low-certainty evidence), and probably reduces the risk of caesarean section (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.95; 6 trials; 2993 women; moderate-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference in hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.21; 4 trials; 2828 women; low-certainty evidence). Oral misoprostol one- to two-hourly versus four- to six-hourly (1 trial; 64 women) The evidence on hourly titration was very uncertain due to the low numbers reported. Oral misoprostol 20 g hourly titrated versus 25 g two-hourly static (2 trials; 296 women) The difference in regimen may have little or no effect on the rate of vaginal births in 24 hours (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.16; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is of very low certainty for all other reported outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose oral misoprostol is probably associated with fewer caesarean sections (and therefore more vaginal births) than vaginal dinoprostone, and lower rates of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes. However, time to birth may be increased, as seen by a reduced number of vaginal births within 24 hours. Compared to transcervical Foley catheter, low-dose oral misoprostol is associated with fewer caesarean sections, but equivalent rates of hyperstimulation. Low-dose misoprostol given orally rather than vaginally is probably associated with similar rates of vaginal birth, although rates may be lower within the first 24 hours. However, there is likely less hyperstimulation with foetal heart changes, and fewer caesarean sections performed due to foetal distress. The best available evidence suggests that low-dose oral misoprostol probably has many benefits over other methods for labour induction. This review supports the use of low-dose oral misoprostol for induction of labour, and demonstrates the lower risks of hyperstimulation than when misoprostol is given vaginally. More trials are needed to establish the optimum oral misoprostol regimen, but these findings suggest that a starting dose of 25 g may offer a good balance of efficacy and safety.","output":"Low-dose oral misoprostol for induction of labour"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly developed into a pandemic. Increased levels of ferritin due to cytokine storm and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis were found in severe COVID-19 patients.

The main cause of death in patients with COVID-19 is a systemic pro-inflammatory mechanism that quickly progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Hematological ratios as affordable indicators of inflammatory response were studied in COVID-19 patients. The study aimed to study the importance of the blood cell indexes of the systemic inflammatory response, as the Aggregate Index of Systemic Inflammation (AISI), neutrophils lymphocyte to platelet ratio (NLPR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and, systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) in predicting intensive care unit (ICU) admission of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: 495 COVID-19 patients managed in four tertiary centers; divided into non-ICU and ICU groups. RESULTS: Total leucocyte count (TLC), AISI, NLPR, SII, and SIRI were more elevated in the ICU group (P < 0.001 for all except AMC P = 0.006), while this group had less absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) (P = 0.047). We estimated the optimal cut-off values of the hematological ratio; AISI (729), NLPR (0.0195), SII (1346), and SIRI (2.5). SII had the highest specificity (95.6%), while NLPR had the highest sensitivity (61.3%). Age, AISI, CRP, D-dimer, and oxygen aid were the independent predictors for ICU admission in COVID-19 in multivariate logistic regression.

Intuitively, problems and challenges can be better handled by managing expectations in software teams. Aim. Our goal is to understand whether the expectations of software developers vary towards diverse stakeholders in software teams. Method. We surveyed 181 professional software developers to understand their expectations from five different stakeholders: (1) organizations, (2) managers, (3) peers, (4) new hires, and (5) government and educational institutions. The five stakeholders are determined by conducting semi-formal interviews of software developers. We ask open-ended survey questions and analyze the responses using open coding. Results. We observed 18 multi-faceted expectations types. While some expectations are more specific to a stakeholder, other expectations are cross-cutting. For example, developers expect work-benefits from their organizations, but expect the adoption of standard software engineering (SE) practices from their organizations, peers, and new hires. Conclusion. Out of the 18 categories, three categories are related to career growth. This observation supports previous research that happiness cannot be assured by simply offering more money or a promotion. Among the most number of responses, we find expectations from educational institutions to offer relevant teaching and from governments to improve job stability, which indicate the increasingly important roles of these organizations to help software developers.

Analyses of spatial locations, chemical properties, and structural and energetic impacts of the observed amino acid changes in >48,000 viral proteome sequences showed how each one of the 29 viral study proteins have undergone amino acid changes. Structural models computed for every unique sequence variant revealed that most substitutions map to protein surfaces and boundary layers with a minority affecting hydrophobic cores. Conservative changes were observed more frequently in cores versus boundary layers/surfaces. Active sites and protein-protein interfaces showed modest numbers of substitutions. Energetics calculations showed that the impact of substitutions on the thermodynamic stability of the proteome follows a universal bi-Gaussian distribution. Detailed results are presented for six drug discovery targets and four structural proteins comprising the virion, highlighting substitutions with the potential to impact protein structure, enzyme activity, and functional interfaces. Characterizing the evolution of the virus in three dimensions provides testable insights into viral protein function and should aid in structure-based drug discovery efforts as well as the prospective identification of amino acid substitutions with potential for drug resistance.","output":"Evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome in three dimensions (3D) during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The study examined the influence of COVID-19 on job satisfaction and occupation preference among medical workers. The outbreak of COVID-19 started from Wuhan served as an exogenous shock on many people's lives, especially those with a career in the medical industry. Method: We conducted a large scale online survey experiment in China and UK (for robustness check) regarding the influence of the COVID-19 epidemic on medical occupation preference. The experiment in China has a two by two factorial design varying engagement and severity of influence during the epidemic, including the comparison between (1) medical and nonmedical workers;(2) Wuhan and non-Wuhan residents.The survey was conducted during March 2020, a time when the epidemic in Wuhan has passed its peak, which allow us to get more respondents from medical workers.Findings: We find that people who are medical workers are less willing to accept their children and partners engaging in medical occupations (reverse occupation inheritance);such a tendency is stronger among individuals in Wuhan than in other places in China. Willingness for children/partners to choose medical occupations is significantly influenced by individuals direct/indirect experiences during the epidemic, risk-taking preferences, prosocial preferences and information (news) shocks. Moreover, medical workers in Wuhan also exhibit significantly lower pro-social and higher risk averse, as well as significantly differences in future life and economic expectations from other groups.Interpretation: Our results indicate serious burnout among medical workers who conducted intensive workload under the severe influence of COVID-19 epidemic. The conclusion is based mainly on ex post comparisons and descriptive analysis, nonetheless it showed systematic differences that cannot be explain by other controlling factors expect the epidemic.

Both receptor binding and membrane fusion activities are mediated by the virus spike glycoprotein, S. As with other class I membrane fusion proteins, S is post-translationally cleaved, in this case by furin, into S1 and S2 components that remain associated following cleavage. Fusion activation following receptor binding is proposed to involve the exposure of a second proteolytic site (S2), cleavage of which is required for the fusion peptide release. We have investigated the binding of ACE2 to the furin-cleaved form of SARS-CoV-2 S by cryoEM. We classify ten different molecular species including the unbound, closed spike trimer, the fully open ACE2-bound trimer, and dissociated monomeric S1 bound to ACE2. The ten structures describe sequential ACE2 binding events which destabilise the spike trimer, progressively opening up, and out, the individual S1 components. The opening process reduces S1 contacts with each other and un-shields the trimeric S2 core, priming fusion activation and dissociation of ACE2-bound S1 monomers. The structures also reveal refolding of one of the S1 subdomains, following ACE2 binding, that disrupts interactions with S2, notably involving Asp614, leading to destabilisation of the structure of S2 proximal to the secondary (S2) cleavage site.","output":"Sequential receptor binding primes the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein for membrane fusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Occupational and non-occupational risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have been reported in healthcare workers (HCWs), but studies evaluating risk factors for infection among physician trainees are lacking We aimed to identify sociodemographic, occupational, and community risk factors among physician trainees during the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in New York City In this retrospective study of 328 trainees at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, we administered a survey to assess risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1 February and 30 June 2020 SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by self-reported and laboratory-confirmed IgG antibody and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test results We used Bayesian generalized linear mixed effect regression to examine associations between hypothesized risk factors and infection odds The cumulative incidence of infection was 20 1% Assignment to medical-surgical units (OR, 2 51;95% CI, 1 18C5 34), and training in emergency medicine, critical care, and anesthesiology (OR, 2 93;95% CI, 1 24C6 92) were independently associated with infection Caring for unfamiliar patient populations was protective (OR, 0 16;95% CI, 0 03C0 73) Community factors were not statistically significantly associated with infection after adjustment for occupational factors Our findings may inform tailored infection prevention strategies for physician trainees responding to the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Factors Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Physician Trainees in New York City during the First COVID-19 Wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Backgroundthe COVID19 pandemic has resulted in worldwide morbidity at unprecedented scale.

Importantly, seabirds can be long-lived and cross multiple continents within a single annual cycle, thus their exposure to parasites may be greater than other taxa. With changing climatic conditions expected to influence parasite distribution and abundance, understanding current level of infection, transmission pathways and population-level impacts are integral aspects for predicting ecosystem changes, and how climate change will affect seabird species. In particular, a range of micro- and macro-parasites can affect seabird species, including ticks, mites, helminths, viruses and bacteria in gulls, terns, skimmers, skuas, auks and selected phalaropes (Charadriiformes), tropicbirds (Phaethontiformes), penguins (Sphenisciformes), tubenoses (Procellariiformes), cormorants, frigatebirds, boobies, gannets (Suliformes), and pelicans (Pelecaniformes) and marine seaducks and loons (Anseriformes and Gaviiformes). We found that the seabird orders of Charadriiformes and Procellariiformes were most represented in the parasite-seabird literature. While negative effects were reported in seabirds associated with all the parasite groups, most effects have been studied in adults with less information known about how parasites may affect chicks and fledglings. We found studies most often reported on negative effects in seabird hosts during the breeding season, although this is also the time when most seabird research occurs. Many studies report that external factors such as condition of the host, pollution, and environmental conditions can influence the effects of parasites, thus cumulative effects likely play a large role in how parasites influence seabirds at both the individual and population level. With an increased understanding of parasite-host dynamics it is clear that major environmental changes, often those associated with human activities, can directly or indirectly affect the distribution, abundance, or virulence of parasites and pathogens.","output":"Chapter One Parasites of seabirds: A survey of effects and ecological implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intelligent Transport System should be renovated in many aspects in post-pandemic situation like COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to validate the BCSDTSD instrument for assessing behavioral changes related to the use of digital technologies during social distancing. METHOD: Validation of the BCSDTSD in 5 phases: 1. construction of an initial scale with 10 questions; 2. evaluation of the questions by a panel of experts; 3. application to 1,012 volunteers via the internet; 4. statistical analysis of the results; and 5. preparation of the validated final version of the BCSDTSD.

Using two different mathematical models for different datasets, we aimed to estimate measles transmissibility over time and explore any heterogeneous transmission patterns. METHODS: The first model relied on the temporal distribution for date of illness onset for cases, and a generation-dependent model was applied to the data. Another model focused on the transmission network. Using the illness-onset date along with the serial interval and geographical location of exposure, we reconstructed a transmission network with 19 unknown links. We then compared the number of secondary transmissions with and without clinical symptoms or laboratory findings. RESULTS: Using a generation-dependent model (assuming three generations other than the index case), the reproduction number (R) over generations 0, 1, and 2 were 25.3, 1.3, and <0.1, respectively, explicitly yielding the transmissibility over each generation. The network data enabled us to demonstrate that both the mean and the variance for the number of secondary transmissions per primary case declined over time. Comparing primary cases with and without secondary transmission, high viral shedding was the only significant determinant (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The R declined abruptly over subsequent generations. Use of network data revealed the distribution of the number of secondary transmissions per primary case and also allowed us to identify possible secondary transmission risk factors.

Living organisms are constantly exposed to pathogens and a molecular war begins when a host encounters a pathogen. Nevertheless, a disease as an outcome of a pathogen attack remains an exception rather a rule. Pathogenic diseases like influenza and HIV/AIDS have seriously affected many societies worldwide as well as challenge our abilities to fight the responsible agents. Over the past decade, strains of many common pathogens have continued to develop resistance to the drugs that once were effective against them. Parasite genome sequences do not themselves provide a full explanation of the biology of an organism or on the molecular war involved in host-pathogen associations. Since the 1990s, proteomic tools have been successfully employed in a large number of studies to find and identify proteins involved in biological phenomena, such as host-parasite interactions. Thus, it is apparent that parasitologists and molecular biologists should attempt to improve their experimental design. In this chapter, new ways based on evolutionary concepts are suggested to enable further elucidation of the molecular complexities of hostCpathogen genome interactions.

METHODS: We analyzed data obtained from 254 vaccinated individuals, and assessed vaccine hesitancy, depression, anxiety, and peritraumatic distress, as well as several demographic, health, and COVID-19-related factors. RESULTS: Logistic regressions demonstrated that above and beyond socio-demographic, health, and COVID-19-related factors, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was the most prominent risk factor for anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic distress. Higher levels of vaccine hesitancy were found to double the risk for depression and peritraumatic stress (ORs > 2), and to triple the risk for anxiety (OR > 3).

Governments worldwide have legislated non-essential service shutdowns and adapted essential service provision in order to minimise face-to-face contact. We anticipate major consequences resulting from such policies, with marginalised populations expected to bear the greatest burden of such measures, especially those with substance use disorders (SUDs). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We aim to conduct (1) a scoping review to summarise the available evidence evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with SUDs, and (2) an evidence map to visually plot and categorise the current available evidence evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on patients with SUDs to identify gaps in addressing high-risk populations. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required for this scoping review as we plan to review publicly available data. This is part of a multistep project, whereby we intend to use the findings generated from this review in combination with data from an ongoing prospective cohort study our team is leading, encompassing over 2000 patients with SUDs receiving medication-assisted therapy in Ontario prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Investigating and addressing the immediate and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with substance use disorders: a scoping review and evidence map protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To conduct a qualitative investigation on a subset of participants from a previously completed Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) to understand why factors identified from the DCE are important, how they influenced preference for virtual consultations (VC) and how COVID-19 has influenced preference for VC. METHODS: A quota sample was recruited from participants who participated in our DCE. We specifically targeted participants who were strongly in favour of face-to-face consultations (F2F - defined as choosing all or mostly F2F in the DCE) or strongly in favour of virtual consultations (VC - defined as choosing all or mostly VC consultations in the DCE) to elicit a range of views. Interviews were conducted via telephone or videoconference, audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and uploaded into NVIVO software. A directed content analysis of transcripts was undertaken in accordance with a coding framework based on the results of the DCE and the impact of COVID-19 on preference. RESULTS: Eight F2F and 5 VC participants were included. Shorter appointments were less worth travelling in for than a longer appointment and rush hour travel had an effect on whether travelling was acceptable, particularly when patients experienced pain as a result of extended journeys. Socioeconomic factors such as cost of travel, paid time off work, access to equipment and support in its use was important. Physical examinations were preferable in the clinic whereas talking therapies were acceptable over VC. Several participants commented on how VC interferes with the patient-clinician relationship. VC during COVID-19 has provided patients with the opportunity to access their care virtually without the need for travel. For some, this was extremely positive. CONCLUSIONS: This study investigated the results of a previously completed DCE and the impact of COVID-19 on patient preferences for VC. Theoretically informative insights were gained to explain the results of the DCE. The use of VC during the COVID-19 pandemic provided opportunities to access care without the need for face-to-face social interactions. Many felt that VC would become more commonplace after the pandemic, whereas others were keen to return to F2F consultations as much as possible. This qualitative study provides additional context to the results of a previously completed DCE.

Over the last decade, new devices and fitness technology companies are attempting to tap into this data, uncovering a treasure trove of useful information that, when applied correctly, has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach healthcare and chronic conditions like asthma, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: By harnessing exciting developments in personalization, digitization, wellness, and patient engagement, care providers can improve health outcomes for our patients in a way we have never been able to do in the past. While new technologies to capture individual health metrics are everywhere, how can we use this information to make a real difference in our patients' lives? Navigating the complicated landscape of personal wearable devices, asthma inhaler sensors, and exercise apps can be daunting to even the most tech savvy physician. This manuscript will give you the tools necessary to make lasting changes in your patients' lives by exposing them to a world of usable, affordable, and relatable health technology that resonates with their personal fitness and wellness goals.

Emerging of its antibiotic-resistant strains persuade researchers to find alternative treatment options such as immunization against the notorious nosocomial pathogen. Oma87 has been introduced as an immunogenic outer membrane protein via reverse vaccinology. However, protectivity of A. baumannii Oma87 is not well known. The current research undertakes a study on the immunogenicity of recombinant Oma87 in a murine model. Some physico-chemical properties were assessed via in silico analyses. The corresponding gene was amplified and cloned into pET28a plasmid. The recombinant protein was purified and then was administered to immunize mice. Sera obtained from the immunized mice were assessed with respect to the triggered antibodies. Challenges were performed on actively or passively immunized mice. In silico analyses revealed that this protein is the same as BamA. A high titer of specific antibody was raised against rOma87 even after the first injection. The specific antibody recognized the whole cell of A. baumannii. Both active and passive immunizations confer 100 and 50% protection, respectively against ~ 2  lethal dose (LD) of A. baumannii in the murine sepsis model. Although none of mice received ~ 5  LD of A. baumannii survived in passive immunization, 25% of mice challenged with ~ 7  LD of the bacteria survived and the dead mice exhibited a delayed death.

Research on scalable, tailored, online mindfulness training programs is needed. We sought to test the feasibility and acceptability of a remotely delivered 8-week mindfulness-based intervention, Being Present 2.0 (BP2.0). METHODS: We performed a single-arm feasibility study of BP2.0 among patients with any metastatic gastrointestinal cancer receiving chemotherapy, with or without an informal caregiver. Participants were instructed to practice mindfulness using pre-recorded guided meditations 5 times per week using a study-specific website and to attend a weekly live, interactive virtual meeting facilitated by a trained instructor. The web-based platform enabled direct measurement of adherence. RESULTS: The study enrolled 46 of 74 (62%) patients contacted, together with 23 caregivers (69 participants total), from May to October 2018. Median patient age was 52 (range 20-70 years), 39% were male, 67% non-Hispanic white, 65% had colorectal cancer, and 78% lived outside of San Francisco. The top reasons cited for participation were to reduce stress/anxiety and learn how to meditate. Mean baseline National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer (NCCN DT) scores were 4.7 (patients) and 5.8 (caregivers). The study discontinuation rate was 20% (eight patients and six caregivers). Among the remaining 55 participants, 43 (78%) listened to at least one audio recording and/or attended at least one virtual meeting, although adherence data was incomplete. The retention rate was 71%, with 39 participants completing at least one follow-up assessment. In post-intervention qualitative interviews, 88% of respondents reported a positive experience. Compared to baseline, participants reported significantly reduced post-intervention NCCN DT scores (mean 3.1; P = .012).

Selenium, as one of the important micronutrients implicated in viral infections, was suggested to play roles. METHODS: An ecological study was performed to assess the association between the COVID-19 related fatality and the selenium content both from crops and topsoil, in China. RESULTS: Totally, 14,045 COVID-19 cases were reported from 147 cities during 8 December 2019C13 December 2020 were included. Based on selenium content in crops, the case fatality rates (CFRs) gradually increased from 1.17% in non-selenium-deficient areas, to 1.28% in moderate-selenium-deficient areas, and further to 3.16% in severe-selenium-deficient areas (P = 0.002). Based on selenium content in topsoil, the CFRs gradually increased from 0.76% in non-selenium-deficient areas, to 1.70% in moderate-selenium-deficient areas, and further to 1.85% in severe-selenium-deficient areas (P < 0.001). The zero-inflated negative binomial regression model showed a significantly higher fatality risk in cities with severe-selenium-deficient selenium content in crops than non-selenium-deficient cities, with incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 3.88 (95% CIs: 1.21C12.52), which was further confirmed by regression fitting the association between CFR of COVID-19 and selenium content in topsoil, with the IRR of 2.38 (95% CIs: 1.14C4.98) for moderate-selenium-deficient cities and 3.06 (1.49C6.27) for severe-selenium-deficient cities.

The virus grows within the lower respiratory tract, where early-stage symptoms (such as cough, fever, and sore throat) develop, and then it causes a lung infection (pneumonia).

We have presented a prediction model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and our own developed mathematical equation-based algorithm named SymptomNet. The CNN algorithm classifies lung infections (pneumonia) using frontal chest X-ray images, and the symptom analysis algorithm (SymptomNet) predicts the possibility of COVID-19 infection from the developed symptoms in a patient. By combining the CNN image classifier method and SymptomNet algorithm, we have developed a model that predicts COVID-19 patients with an approximate accuracy of 96%.

A booster dose of vaccine induced stronger antibody responses than a dose-sparing half-dose boost, although the magnitude of T cell responses did not increase with either boost dose.

Since it is often impossible to observe the state of all nodes in a network, a common method is to detect harmful cascades from sparsely placed sensors. However, the harmful cascades are usually dynamic (e.g., the cascade initiators and diffusion trajectories can change over the time), which can severely destroy the robustness of selected sensors. Meanwhile the large scale of current networks greatly increases the time complexity of sensor selection. Motivated by the observation, in this paper we investigate the scalable sensor selection problem for early detection of dynamic harmful cascades in networks. Specifically, we first put forward a dynamic susceptible-infected model to describe harmful cascades, and formally define a detection time minimization (DTM) problem which focuses on effective sensors placement for early detection of dynamic cascades. We prove that it is #P-hard to calculate the objective function exactly and propose two Monte-Carlo methods to estimate it efficiently. We prove the NP-hardness of DTM problem and design a corresponding greedy algorithm. Based on that, we propose an efficient upper bound based greedy (UBG) algorithm with the theoretical performance guarantee reserved.

The impact of the removal of mask restrictions, however, on COVID-19 outcomes for elementary students, educators/staff, and their households is not well known. MethodsWe used a previously published agent-based dynamic transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 in K-12 schools to simulate an elementary school with 638 students across 6 scenarios: combinations of three viral infectiousness levels (reflecting wild-type virus, alpha variant, and delta variant) and two student vaccination levels (0% and 50% coverage to reflect potential authorization in this age group). For each scenario, we varied observed community COVID-19 incidence (0 to 50 cases/100,000 people/day) and mitigation effectiveness (0-100% reduction to in-school secondary attack rate), and evaluated two outcomes over a 30 day period: (1) the probability of at least one in-school transmission, and (2) the increase in total cases among students, educators/staff, and their household members between in-person and remote instruction. ResultsOver 30 days in the simulated elementary school, the probability of at least one in-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the number of projected infections in the immediate school community varied widely. In one scenario with the delta variant and no student vaccination, assuming that baseline mitigation measures of simple ventilation and handwashing reduce the secondary attack rate by 40%, if decision-makers seek to keep the monthly probability of an in-school transmission below 50%, additional mitigation (e.g., masking) would need to be added at a community incidence of approximately 4/100,000/day. Once students are vaccinated, thresholds shift substantially higher. LimitationsThe interpretation of model results should be limited by the uncertainty in many of the parameters, including the effectiveness of individual mitigation interventions and vaccine efficacy against the delta variant, and the limited scope of the model beyond the school community. Additionally, the assumed case detection rate (33% of cases detected) may be too high in areas with decreased testing capacity. ConclusionDespite the assumption of high adult vaccination, the risks of both in-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission and resulting infections among students, educators/staff, and their household members remain high when the delta variant predominates and students are unvaccinated. Mitigation measures or vaccinations for students when available can substantially reduce these risks. These findings underscore the potential role for responsive plans, where mitigation is deployed based on local COVID-19 incidence and vaccine uptake.","output":"When do elementary students need masks in school?

Nonetheless, patients may have been billed if their plans did not implement waivers or if waivers did not capture all hospitalization-related care. Assessment of out-of-pocket spending for COVID-19 hospitalizations in 2020 may show the financial burden that patients may experience if insurers allow waivers to expire, as many chose to do during 2021. OBJECTIVE: To estimate out-of-pocket spending for COVID-19 hospitalizations in the US in 2020. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used data from the IQVIA PharMetrics Plus for Academics Database, a national claims database representing 7.7 million privately insured patients and 1.0 million Medicare Advantage patients, regarding COVID-19 hospitalizations for privately insured and Medicare Advantage patients from March to September 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mean total out-of-pocket spending, defined as the sum of out-of-pocket spending for facility services billed by hospitals (eg, accommodation charges) and professional and ancillary services billed by clinicians and ancillary providers (eg, clinician inpatient evaluation and management, ambulance transport). RESULTS: Analyses included 4075 hospitalizations; 2091 (51.3%) were for male patients, and the mean (SD) age of patients was 66.8 (14.8) years. Of these hospitalizations, 1377 (33.8%) were for privately insured patients. Out-of-pocket spending for facility services, professional and ancillary services, or both was reported for 981 of 1377 hospitalizations for privately insured patients (71.2%) and 1324 of 2968 hospitalizations for Medicare Advantage patients (49.1%). Among these hospitalizations, mean (SD) total out-of-pocket spending was $788 ($1411) for privately insured patients and $277 ($363) for Medicare Advantage patients. In contrast, out-of-pocket spending for facility services was reported for 63 hospitalizations for privately insured patients (4.6%) and 36 hospitalizations for Medicare Advantage patients (1.3%). Among these hospitalizations, mean (SD) total out-of-pocket spending was $3840 ($3186) for privately insured patients and $1536 ($1402) for Medicare Advantage patients. Total out-of-pocket spending exceeded $4000 for 2.5% of privately insured hospitalizations compared with 0.2% of Medicare Advantage hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, few patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in 2020 were billed for facility services provided by hospitals, suggesting that most were covered by insurers with cost-sharing waivers. However, many patients were billed for professional and ancillary services, suggesting that insurer cost-sharing waivers may not have covered all hospitalization-related care.

Previously, we have shown that loss of angiotensin-I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) promotes the ACE/angiotensin-II (Ang-II)/angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) axis, a deleterious arm of RAS, unleashing its detrimental effects in diabetes. As suggested by the recent reports regarding the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), upon entry into the host, this virus binds to the extracellular domain of ACE2 in nasal, lung, and gut epithelial cells through its spike glycoprotein subunit S1. We put forth the hypothesis that during this process, reduced ACE2 could result in clinical deterioration in COVID-19 patients with diabetes via aggravating Ang-II-dependent pathways and partly driving not only lung but also bone marrow and gastrointestinal pathology. In addition to systemic RAS, the pathophysiological response of the local RAS within the intestinal epithelium involves mechanisms distinct from that of RAS in the lung; however, both lung and gut are impacted by diabetes-induced bone marrow dysfunction. Careful targeting of the systemic and tissue RAS may optimize clinical outcomes in subjects with diabetes infected with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infections and ACE2: Clinical Outcomes Linked With Increased Morbidity and Mortality in Individuals With Diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We research how the Russian authorities, using both fact-checking resources and law enforcement measures, have been fighting COVID-rumors and fake news during 2020-2021. To find out what the Russian government considers to be the most dangerous rumors, we built three databases: COVID-rumors in social media (6.2 million reposts from 1 January through 30 April);cases of court prosecutions against spreaders of fake news (240 cases from February, 2020 to August, 2021);and cases of debunking of fake news on coronafake.ru (194 cases). The majority of Russian infodemic texts in social media (65%) consists of anti-vaccination narratives and folk medicine for COVID-19. Those rumors are generally claimed to be the most socially dangerous because they can adversely influence human behavior. Meanwhile, of the fake news and rumors which became the subjects of court cases, the majority (84%) concern the possible negative socio-political scenarios of the coronavirus pandemic and express distrust of the actions of government institutions. At the same time, anti-vaccination fake news and false medical advice draw no attention from state agencies. Thus, the policy of the Russian state in the fight against the infodemic turns out to be focused mainly on preserving the legitimacy of government institutions and public confidence in them, and less on public health. ?

METHODS This is an observational study composed of patients admitted to the ICU. Demographics, anthropometric data for calculating body mass index (BMI), and laboratory data were obtained at admission: blood count, ferritin, arterial blood gas, serum zinc levels, and C-reactive protein. Also, arterial oxygen tension (PaO2 ) divided by fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2 ) was calculated by the first arterial blood gas after intubation. A diagnosis of severe ARDS was determined if the PaO2 /FiO2 ratio was 100 mm Hg. Low zinc levels were established if zinc levels were <70 g/dL. RESULTS A total of 269 patients met inclusion criteria; 51.3% were men; median age was 74 (66-81) years; 91.1% (245 of 269) were elderly. The median BMI was 30.1 (24.7-32.1) kg/m2 , with 59.9% (161 of 269) of patients having overweight and obesity. The prevalence of low zinc levels was 79.6% (214 of 269) and severe ARDS was 56.5% (152 of 269). There was an association of low zinc levels and severe ARDS (odds ratio [OR], 14.4; 95% CI, 6.2-33.5; P < .001), even after adjusting for baseline variables (OR, 15.4; 95% CI, 6.5-36.3; P < .001).

SARS-CoV-2 spreads via respiratory droplets, saliva, or direct contact. Therefore it is important to control the viral load in the saliva and respiratory secretions. One of the most simple and cost-effective measures that can be adopted by the public and healthcare professionals to prevent cross-contamination and community transmission, is the implementation of effective oral and throat hygiene. Recent evidence has confirmed 0.5% PVP-I mouthrinse/gargle for 30 seconds can reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus infectivity to below detectable levels. PVP-I can even interrupt SARS-CoV-2 attachment to oral and nasopharyngeal tissues and lower the viral particles in the saliva and respiratory droplets.

These organizations interface with multiple stakeholder groups. An active analysis of stakeholder groups to identify under-served areas and communities has not been performed. Using stakeholder data from Toronto Humane Society (THS) from 2015C2019, this study performed a retrospective spatial analysis to identify well served and under-served geographic areas for adopters, surrenders, public veterinary service (PVS) clients, volunteers and foster parents, using Hot Spot analysis. Correlation analysis was performed to determine whether the spatial distribution of the groups correlated with the four socioeconomic metrics of the 2016 Ontario Marginalization Index (residential instability, material deprivation, dependency, and ethnic concentration), and a metric representing the distribution of Indigenous residents. For each stakeholder group, there were well served areas, typically in central Toronto where THS is located, and under-served areas, typically in the north-west and north-east corners of Toronto and in the surrounding cities of the Greater Toronto Area. The area served by THS PVS extended further north than the other hot spot areas. The number of adopters increased as the residential instability metric increased, whereas the number of adopters decreased as the ethnic concentration metric increased. The rate of surrenders increased as the Indigenous metric increased. Public Veterinary Service clients increased as the residential instability, material deprivation, and Indigenous metrics increased. One of the primary limitations of this study was the confounding factor of distance from THS. Individuals living further from THS are less likely to utilize its services, particularly if there is another accessible AWO nearby, and therefore may appear to reflect an under-served population that may not truly be under-served. A regional approach would help to overcome this limitation. The results provide useful insights into stakeholder engagement and provide a foundation for analysis of more targeted areas, as well as for strategies to reach under-served demographics. Similar analyses by other AWOs would be helpful to address inequities in a larger geographic area.

Austrian women (N = 53) took part in the training program, whose physical condition was assessed before the start of the program, then reassessed after three months and after six months; the organizers also had them fill out the sense of coherence questionnaire (SOC) as well as the Regensburger insomnia scale. After the lifting of the lockdown introduced due to the pandemic, participants completed an online survey relating to their changed life conditions, physical activities, sense of coherence and sleep quality. Results: After the first three months of the training, no significant changes were detected. After six months, the participants SOC and sleep quality improved (Friedman test: p = 0.005 and p < 0.001). During the lockdown, sleep quality generally deteriorated (W-rank test: p = 0.001), while SOC did not change.

They hijack host cellular machinery for their replication and survival by targeting crucial cellular physiological pathways, including transcription, translation, immune pathways, and apoptosis. Immediately after translation, the host and viral proteins undergo a process called post-translational modification (PTM). PTMs of proteins involves the attachment of small proteins, carbohydrates/lipids, or chemical groups to the proteins and are crucial for the proteins' functioning. During viral infection, host proteins utilize PTMs to control the virus replication, using strategies like activating immune response pathways, inhibiting viral protein synthesis, and ultimately eliminating the virus from the host. PTM of viral proteins increases solubility, enhances antigenicity and virulence properties. However, RNA viruses are devoid of enzymes capable of introducing PTMs to their proteins. Hence, they utilize the host PTM machinery to promote their survival.

Reports exist regarding the potential benefits of undertaking mobile radiography through side room windows. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact on image quality and exposure factors when undertaking such examinations. METHODS: A phantom based study was undertaken using a digital X-ray room. Control acquisitions, using a commercially available image quality test tool, were performed using standard mobile chest radiography acquisition factors. Image quality (physical and visual), incidence surface air kerma (ISAK), Exposure Index (EI) and Deviation Index (DI) were recorded. Image quality and radiation dose were further assessed for two additional (experimental) scenarios, where a side room window was located immediately adjacent to the exit port of the light beam diaphragm. The goal of experimental scenario one was to modify exposure factors to maintain the control ISAK. The goal of experimental scenario two was to modify exposure factors to maintain the control EI and DI. Dose and image quality data were compared between the three scenarios. RESULTS: To maintain the pre-window (control) ISAK (76 Gy), tube output needed a three-fold increase (90 kV/4 mAs versus 90 kV/11.25 mAs). To maintain EI/DI a more modest increase in tube output was required (90 kV/8 mAs/ISAK 54 Gy). Physical and visual assessments of spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio were indifferent between the three scenarios. There was a slight statistically significant reduction in contrast-to-noise ratio when imaging through the glass window (2.3 versus 1.4 and 1.2; P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Undertaking mobile X-ray examinations through side room windows is potentially feasible but does require an increase in tube output and is likely to be limited by minor reductions in image quality.

Due to the lack of availability of genetic counseling services in Northern Michigan prior to COVID-19, the utilization of genetic testing falls well below recommended guidelines. Methods: Patients diagnosed with breast cancer in 2019 were randomly selected from Ascension Michigan's Northern Ministries Tumor Registry. A retrospective chart review was conducted. For patients who met NCCN criteria, their medical records were used to determine if genetic testing was recommended and if genetic testing was completed. Univariate (Crosstabs and t-tests) and multivariate tests with logistic regression were used to identify significant associations between the variables of interest. Results: One hundred and two (102) patient charts were reviewed in this group; 55 (52.4%) were eligible by the NCCN guidelines for genetic testing. From this eligible subset of patients, only 29 were offered genetic testing, and only 21 were tested. The mean age of the patients offered genetic counseling was 56.2 years compared and 67.6 years in the group not offered counseling (p < 0.001).

We aimed to describe the early psychological impact of COVID-19 and its contributing factors in a large Spanish sample, globally and according to mental status (never mental disorder NMD, past mental disorder PMD, current mental disorder CMD). METHODS: An online questionnaire was conducted between 19 and 26 March, five days after the official declaration of alarm and the lockdown order. Data included sociodemographic and clinical information and the DASS-21 and IES questionnaires. We analysed 21 207 responses using the appropriate descriptive and univariate tests as well as binary logistic regression to identify psychological risk and protective factors. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant gradient in the psychological impact experienced in five domains according to mental status, with the NMD group being the least affected and the CMD group being the most affected. In the three groups, the depressive response was the most prevalent (NMD = 40.9%, PMD = 51.9%, CMD = 74.4%, F = 1011.459, P < 0.001). Risk factors were female sex and classification as a case in any psychological domain. Protective factors were younger age and ability to enjoy free time. Variables related to COVID-19 had almost no impact except for having COVID-19 symptoms, which was a risk factor for anxiety in all three groups.

It remains unclear whether models incorporating trends of digital searches lead to better predictions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between Google Trends searches of symptoms associated with COVID-19 and confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. We aim to develop predictive models to forecast the COVID-19 epidemic based on a combination of Google Trends searches of symptoms and conventional COVID-19 metrics. METHODS: An open-access web application was developed to evaluate Google Trends and traditional COVID-19 metrics via an interactive framework based on principal component analysis (PCA) and time series modeling. The application facilitates the analysis of symptom search behavior associated with COVID-19 disease in 188 countries. In this study, we selected the data of nine countries as case studies to represent all continents. PCA was used to perform data dimensionality reduction, and three different time series models (error, trend, seasonality; autoregressive integrated moving average; and feed-forward neural network autoregression) were used to predict COVID-19 metrics in the upcoming 14 days. The models were compared in terms of prediction ability using the root mean square error (RMSE) of the first principal component (PC1). The predictive abilities of models generated with both Google Trends data and conventional COVID-19 metrics were compared with those fitted with conventional COVID-19 metrics only. RESULTS: The degree of correlation and the best time lag varied as a function of the selected country and topic searched; in general, the optimal time lag was within 15 days. Overall, predictions of PC1 based on both search terms and COVID-19 traditional metrics performed better than those not including Google searches (median 1.56, IQR 0.90-2.49 versus median 1.87, IQR 1.09-2.95, respectively), but the improvement in prediction varied as a function of the selected country and time frame. The best model varied as a function of country, time range, and period of time selected. Models based on a 7-day moving average led to considerably smaller RMSE values as opposed to those calculated with raw data (median 0.90, IQR 0.50-1.53 versus median 2.27, IQR 1.62-3.74, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of digital online searches in statistical models may improve the nowcasting and forecasting of the COVID-19 epidemic and could be used as one of the surveillance systems of COVID-19 disease. We provide a free web application operating with nearly real-time data that anyone can use to make predictions of outbreaks, improve estimates of the dynamics of ongoing epidemics, and predict future or rebound waves.","output":"Forecasting the COVID-19 Epidemic by Integrating Symptom Search Behavior Into Predictive Models: Infoveillance Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has spurred the implementation of several public safety measures to contain virus spread, most notably socially distancing policies.

Racial/ethnic disparities in early-onset CRC have also grown more pronounced, because Black individuals have higher early-onset CRC incidence and poorer survival compared with White individuals. We describe the prevalence and burden of early-onset CRC among Africans in Nigeria and African Americans (AAs) in the United States. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified Black individuals diagnosed with a first primary CRC ages 18 to 49 years between 1989 and 2017 at Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital in Zaria, Nigeria (Nigerians), and in the United States (AAs) using the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute's SEER program of cancer registries. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate clinical and demographic differences between Nigerians and AAs with early-onset CRC, adjusted for age, sex, tumor site, and histology. RESULTS: A total of 5,019 Black individuals were diagnosed with early-onset CRC over the study period (379 Nigerians; 4,640 AAs). Overall, approximately one third of young Black patients were diagnosed with rectal tumors (35.8%). Nigerian individuals with early-onset CRC were eight-fold more likely to be diagnosed with rectal tumors (odds ratio [OR], 8.14; 95% CI, 6.23 to 10.62; P < .0001) and more likely to be diagnosed at younger ages (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.89; P < .0001) compared with young African Americans in adjusted models. CONCLUSION: Compared with AA individuals diagnosed with early-onset CRC, Nigerian individuals harbor distinct features of early-onset CRC. Additional investigation of the histopathologic and biologic heterogeneity of early-onset CRCs among Black individuals is critical for understanding racial disparities in susceptibility and outcomes, which may have implications for tailored early-onset CRC prevention, detection, and treatment strategies.","output":"Patterns of Early-Onset Colorectal Cancer Among Nigerians and African Americans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"He is acting as a paid consultant for Actelion, Biogen, IGES, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Roche, Sanofi, and the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Society.

The diagnosis requires treatment with anticoagulation that can have both high cost and high risk for bleeding and has traditionally been managed with an inpatient admission. Recent guideline updates from the American Society of Hematology have demonstrated that patients meeting certain criteria can be managed as an outpatient. A retrospective chart review of patients presenting for acute DVT in 2019 demonstrated 58.1% of patients who met criteria for outpatient management were admitted. In order to improve value of care for UF Health patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) for acute DVT, a multidisciplinary team consisting of physicians from the departments of Hematology and Emergency Medicine developed a step-by-step ED treatment pathway for the management of acute DVT based on evidenced-based guidelines. The project goal was to achieve less than a 25% admission rate for patient's meeting outpatient management criteria within 1 year. Methods: Recent American Society of Hematology anticoagulation management guidelines supporting outpatient management of DVT presented an opportunity to reduce cost to patients while maintaining safety and improving resource utilization and evidence-based practice. To identify patients that are safe for outpatient management, the HAS-BLED risk stratification tool was implemented. To improve both quality of outpatient treatment and patient compliance, recommended treatment options were updated to reflect current practice standards with an appropriate emphasis on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Finally, a standard documentation template was created for patients being discharged to reduce variation in post-discharge recommendations. A cause-and-effect diagram and interviews were utilized to determine the reasons for patient management decisions including disposition and choice of anticoagulation. These quality improvement tools were added to the ED treatment pathway, which was published in the standard location for similar clinical tools for ED clinicians at our institution. Furthermore, lectures were given at the Emergency Medicine residency conference to educate clinicians on the updates and answer questions. We subsequently reviewed charts of applicable ED encounters. A run chart was utilized to monitor admission and discharge rates over time. ED encounters with assigned ICD codes for acute and acute-on-chronic lower extremity DVT were reviewed for data collection. Outcomes: Chart review of ED patient encounters for acute DVT in 2019 demonstrated 255 cases. Of those, 93 patients were identified as meeting criteria for outpatient management. Only 41.9% (n=39) of patients who met criteria for outpatient management were discharged. Unexpectedly, 92% of all encounters did not document bleeding risk. Review of data from January through October 2020 demonstrated an overall decreased incidence of encounters for acute DVT. This is likely a reflection of decreased ED encounters in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over a 10-month period, 38 patients met criteria for outpatient management. Of these, 76.3% (n=29) of patients meeting criteria for outpatient management for DVT were discharged and 23.7% (N=9) were admitted. This demonstrates a significant improvement in admission rates (59.2% relative reduction) compared to a 58.1% admission rate in 2019 and met our goal of less than 25% admission rate. Furthermore, 89.7% (N=26) of patients who were discharged were prescribed direct oral anticoagulants. Similar to 2019, bleeding risk was documented in only 6.9% of discharged patients. This was an unexpected finding and while not the primary objective of the project, certainly demonstrates a significant opportunity for further care improvements. Conclusions: The next PDSA cycle will focus on appropriate use of bleeding risk stratification tools and documentation of bleeding risk. Of note, 37.3% of admitted patients who did not meet outpatient management criteria ere not discharged because of a concomitant pulmonary embolism. This may present an additional future opportunity for improving value of care for patients with different types of venous thromboembolism.

Emerging studies of PsyCap among school-age students have also shown preliminary, positive associations between PsyCap and student wellbeing. The present study is the first to examine PsyCap-HERO constructs and associations with both mental health symptoms and subjective wellbeing in school-aged children and adolescents (aged 9C14 years).

Measures of hope, efficacy, resilience, optimism, flourishing, anxiety, and depression previously well-validated in school samples were used. Significant associations between each HERO construct and flourishing, anxiety and depression symptoms in the expected direction were found, and importantly, the combination of HERO constructs was shown to be a stronger predictor of increased levels of student flourishing, and decreased levels of anxiety and depression symptoms, than individual HERO constructs. Findings indicate that student PsyCap may be a promising area of further investigation for schools, policymakers, clinicians and researchers looking to identify positive psychological resources in youth that may buffer poor mental health and promote wellbeing.","output":"Searching for the HERO in Youth: Does Psychological Capital (PsyCap) Predict Mental Health Symptoms and Subjective Wellbeing in Australian School-Aged Children and Adolescents?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report 2 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (COVID-19) in infants presenting with fever in the absence of respiratory distress who required hospitalization for evaluation of possible invasive bacterial infections.

One of these concerns the difficulty to model a complex system at a high resolution (fine-grained) level at which the spread can be simulated by taking into account individual features. Agent-based modeling usually needs to find an optimal trade-off between the resolution of the simulation and the population size. Indeed, modeling single individuals usually leads to simulations of smaller populations or the use of meta-populations. In this article, we propose a solution to efficiently model the Covid-19 spread in Lombardy, themost populated Italian region with about ten million people. In particular, the model described in this paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt in literature to model a large population at the single-individual level. To achieve this goal, we propose a framework that implements: i. a scale-free model of the social contacts combining a sociability rate, demographic information, and geographical assumptions; ii. a multi-agent system relying on the actor model and the High-Performance Computing technology to efficiently implement ten million concurrent agents. We simulated the epidemic scenario from January to April 2020 and from August to December 2020, modeling the government's lockdown policies and people's mask-wearing habits.

As such, this research presents an automated machine learning system for identifying individuals who may have come in contact with others infected with COVID-19 using sensor data transmitted through handheld devices. This paper describes the different approaches followed in arriving at an optimal solution model that effectually predicts whether a person has been in close proximity to an infected individual using a gradient boosting algorithm and time series feature extraction.","output":"TsFeX: Contact Tracing Model using Time Series Feature Extraction and Gradient Boosting (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXTE: Le prsent document ainsi que les constats et prises de position qu&#039;il nonce ont t rdigs en rponse  une interpellation du ministre de la Sant et des Services sociaux dans le contexte de l&#039;urgence sanitaire lie  la maladie  coronavirus (COVID-19) au Qubec L&#039;objectif est de raliser une recension sommaire de donnes dans la documentation publie et la littrature grise pour informer les dcideurs publics et les professionnels de la sant Vu la nature rapide de cette recension, les constats qui en dcoulent ne reposent pas sur une recherche exhaustive de la littrature et une valuation des tudes avec une mthode systmatique Dans les circonstances d&#039;une telle urgence de sant publique, l&#039;INESSS reste  l&#039;aff?t de toutes nouvelles donnes susceptibles de lui faire modifier sa position POSITION DE L&#039;INESSS: Malgr des donnes prcliniques encourageantes pour la thrapie passive par anticorps (plasma convalescent) pour le traitement de la COVID-19, les donnes disponibles  ce jour ne permettent pas d&#039;appuyer son utilisation gnralise chez les patients infects Des donnes supplmentaires d&#039;essais cliniques en cours de ralisation sont attendues -L&#039;incertitude entourant l&#039;efficacit et l&#039;innocuit de ces traitements ne soutient pas l&#039;usage gnralis du plasma convalescent chez les patients ayant un diagnostic de COVID-19, quel que soit le stade de la maladie, ou en prophylaxie -Tous les efforts devraient tre dploys pour intgrer dans des protocoles de recherche les patients ayant un diagnostic confirm qui recevront ce traitement PRSENTATION SOMMAIRE DE LA DEMANDE: La possibilit d&#039;utiliser l&#039;immunisation passive par anticorps  l&#039;aide de plasma convalescent pour traiter les personnes infectes par le virus de la COVID-19 a t souleve par certains cliniciens au Qubec, et ailleurs dans le monde, entra?nant des questions quant  son caractre prometteur MTHODOLOGIE: Questions d&#039;valuation : Est-ce que le caractre prometteur de la thrapie passive d&#039;anticorps par l&#039;administration de plasma convalescent est suffisant pour l&#039;ajouter  la liste des options thrapeutiques pour la COVID-19?

As the disease continues to spread rapidly, the development of prophylactic and therapeutic approaches is urgently required. Although some progress has been made in understanding the viral structure and invasion mechanism of coronaviruses that may cause severe cases of the syndrome, due to the limited understanding of the immune effects caused by SARS-CoV-2, it is difficult for us to prevent patients from developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis (PF), the major complications of coronavirus infection. Therefore, any potential treatments should focus not only on direct killing of coronaviruses and prevention strategies by vaccine development, but also on keeping in check the acute immune/inflammatory responses, resulting in ARDS and PF. In addition, potential treatments currently under clinical trials focusing on killing coronaviruses or on developing vaccines preventing coronavirus infection largely ignore the host immune response. However, taking care of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with ARDS and PF is considered to be the major difficulty. Therefore, further understanding of the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is extremely important for clinical resolution and saving medication cost. In addition to a breif overview of the structure, infection mechanism, and possible therapeutic approaches, we summarized and compared the hematopathologic effect and immune responses to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. We also discussed the indirect immune response caused by SARS and direct infection, replication, and destroying of immune cells by MERS-CoV. The molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection-induced lymphopenia or cytokine storm may provide some hint toward fight against SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus.

COVID-19 pathogenesis causes vascular-mediated neurological disorders via elusive mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells via the binding of viral Spike (S) protein to transmembrane receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Although brain pericytes were recently shown to abundantly express ACE2 at the neurovascular interface, their response to SARS-CoV-2 S protein is still to be elucidated. Using cell-based assays, we found that ACE2 expression in human brain vascular pericytes was increased upon S protein exposure. Pericytes exposed to S protein underwent profound phenotypic changes associated with an elongated and contracted morphology accompanied with an enhanced expression of contractile and myofibrogenic proteins, such as -smooth muscle actin (-SMA), fibronectin, collagen I, and neurogenic locus notch homolog protein-3 (NOTCH3). On the functional level, S protein exposure promoted the acquisition of calcium (Ca(2+)) signature of contractile ensheathing pericytes characterized by highly regular oscillatory Ca(2+) fluctuations. Furthermore, S protein induced lipid peroxidation, oxidative and nitrosative stress in pericytes as well as triggered an immune reaction translated by activation of nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-B) signaling pathway, which was potentiated by hypoxia, a condition associated with vascular comorbidities that exacerbate COVID-19 pathogenesis. S protein exposure combined to hypoxia enhanced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in immune cell activation and trafficking, namely macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). Using transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 that recognizes S protein, we observed that the intranasal infection with SARS-CoV-2 rapidly induced hypoxic/ischemic-like pericyte reactivity in the brain of transgenic mice, accompanied with an increased vascular expression of ACE2. Moreover, we found that SARS-CoV-2 S protein accumulated in the intranasal cavity reached the brain of mice in which the nasal mucosa is deregulated. Collectively, these findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 S protein impairs the vascular and immune regulatory functions of brain pericytes, which may account for vascular-mediated brain damage. Our study provides a better understanding for the mechanisms underlying cerebrovascular disorders in COVID-19, paving the way to develop new therapeutic interventions.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 deregulates the vascular and immune functions of brain pericytes via Spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The scientific community has come together in a mass mobilization to combat the public health risks of COVID-19, including efforts to develop a vaccine.

We designed a survey experiment in which a nationally representative sample of 3,133 adults in the USA stated their intentions to vaccinate themselves and their children for COVID-19. The factors that we varied across treatments were: the stated severity and infectiousness of COVID-19 and the stated source of the risk information (White House or the Centers for Disease Control). We find that 20% of people in the USA intend to decline the vaccine. We find no statistically significant effect on vaccine intentions from the severity of COVID-19. In contrast, we find that the degree of infectiousness of the coronavirus influences vaccine intentions and that inconsistent risk messages from public health experts and elected officials may reduce vaccine uptake. However, the most important determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy seem to be distrust of the vaccine safety (including uncertainty due to vaccine novelty), as well as general vaccine avoidance, as implied by not having had a flu shot in the last two years.

The step of reduction of Fe(III) to form Fe(II) governed the degradation rate of CBZ as PMS activation by Fe(II) was the dominant reaction to generate SO4?-, which was the major reactive oxidant in the system. Meanwhile, HQ was quickly transformed to BQ in the Fe(III)/PMS system and BQ acted as an electron shuttle to induce Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox cycle and accelerate PMS activation. Natural organic matter (NOM) bearing phenolic and quinone moieties played similar roles as HQ and BQ and fast CBZ degradation was also observed. Finally, two surface waters spiked CBZ were subjected to bench-scale experimentation to simulate coagulation/flocculation/sedimentation processes in water treatment plants. Compared to the conventional iron coagulation process, the PMS-amended iron coagulation process increased the removal percentage of CBZ by 50%-80%.

Here, we discover and characterize a fully human cross-reactive mAb, MW06, which binds to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and disrupts their interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. Potential neutralization activity of MW06 was observed against both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in different assays. The complex structure determination and epitope alignment of SARS-CoV-2 RBD/MW06 revealed that the epitope recognized by MW06 is highly conserved among SARS-related coronavirus strains, indicating the potential broad neutralization activity of MW06. In in vitro assays, no antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed for MW06. In addition, MW06 recognizes a different epitope from MW05, which shows high neutralization activity and has been in a Phase 2 clinical trial, supporting the development of the cocktail of MW05 and MW06 to prevent against future escaping variants. MW06 alone and the cocktail show good effects in preventing escape mutations, including a series of variants of concern, B.1.1.7, P.1, B.1.351, and B.1.617.1.

Patterns of infection are dictated by the cell type infected, but cell type-specific factors and how they impact tropism for specific cell types is poorly understood. Previous studies in primary endothelial cells showed that HCMV infection induces large multivesicular-like bodies (MVBs) that incorporate viral products, including dense bodies (DBs) and virions. Here we define the nature of these large vesicles using a recombinant virus where UL32, encoding the pp150 tegument protein, is fused in frame with green fluorescent protein (GFP, TB40/E-UL32-GFP). In fibroblasts, UL32-GFP-positive vesicles were marked with classical markers of MVBs, including CD63 and lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA), both classical MVB markers, as well as the clathrin and LAMP1. Unexpectedly, UL32-GFP-positive vesicles in primary human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) were not labeled by CD63, and LBPA was completely lost from infected cells. We defined these UL32-positive vesicles in endothelial cells using markers for the cis-Golgi (GM130), lysosome (LAMP1), and autophagy (LC3B). These findings suggest that UL32-GFP containing MVBs in fibroblasts are derived from the canonical endocytic pathway and takeover classical exosomal release pathway. However, UL32-GFP containing MVBs in HMVECs are derived from the early biosynthetic pathway and exploit a less characterized early Golgi-LAMP1-associated non- canonical secretory autophagy pathway. These results reveal striking cell-type specific membrane trafficking differences in host pathways that are exploited by HCMV, which may reflect distinct pathways for virus egress.ImportanceHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpesvirus that, like all herpesvirus, that establishes a life-long infection. HCMV remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised and HCMV seropositivity is associated with age-related pathology. HCMV infects many cells in the human host and the biology underlying the different patterns of infection in different cell types is poorly understood. Endothelial cells are important target of infection that contribute to hematogenous spread of the virus to tissues. Here we define striking differences in the biogenesis of large vesicles that incorporate virions in fibroblasts and endothelial cells. In fibroblasts, HCMV is incorporated into canonical MVBs derived from an endocytic pathway, whereas HCMV matures through vesicles derived from the biosynthetic pathway in endothelial cells.

The overarching goal of this ongoing project is to define stereotypical responses to surgical injury, with the translational purpose of identifying targetable pathways involved in healing and resilience, and variations indicative of aberrant peri-operative outcomes. METHODS Clinical data from the electronic medical record combined with large-scale biological data sets derived from blood, urine, fecal matter, and tissue samples are collected prospectively through the peri-operative period on patients undergoing fourteen surgeries chosen to represent a range of injury locations and intensities. Specimens are subjected to genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic assays to describe their genetic, metabolic, immunologic, and microbiome profiles, providing a multidimensional landscape of the human response to injury.

However, the physiological demands of singing and its intensity as a physical activity are not well understood. METHODS: We compared cardiorespiratory parameters while completing components of Singing for Lung Health sessions, with treadmill walking at differing speeds (2, 4 and 6 km/hour). RESULTS: Eight healthy adults were included, none of whom reported regular participation in formal singing activities. Singing induced acute physiological responses that were consistent with moderate intensity activity (metabolic equivalents: median 4.12, IQR 2.72-4.78), with oxygen consumption, heart rate and volume per breath above those seen walking at 4 km/hour. Minute ventilation was higher during singing (median 22.42 L/min, IQR 16.83-30.54) than at rest (11 L/min, 9-13), lower than 6 km/hour walking (30.35 L/min, 26.94-41.11), but not statistically different from 2 km/hour (18.77 L/min, 16.89-21.35) or 4 km/hour (23.27 L/min, 20.09-26.37) walking.

Methods: Two community-based population samples (including individuals randomly and nonrandomly selected for statewide testing, n= 8,214) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing in nonclinical settings. Each participant was tested for current (viral PCR) and past (antibody) infection in April or June of 2020. Before testing, participants provided demographic information and self-reported health status and tobacco behaviors (smoking, chewing, vaping/e-cigarettes). Using descriptive statistics and a bivariate logistic regression model, we examined the association between health status and use of tobacco with SARS-CoV-2 positivity on either PCR or antibody tests. Results: Compared to people with self-identified excellent or very good health status, those reporting good or fair health status had a higher risk of past or current infections. Positive smoking status was inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chewing tobacco was associated with infection and the use of vaping/e-cigarettes was not associated with infection.

Through its 2018-2023 Strategic Infrastructure Project Plan West Java Province has planned to build a Cultural Center in a Regency/City in West Java. In 2019 Subang and Sumedang Regency established a Cultural Center. However due to the COVID-19 pandemic local government and society cannot optimally use those cultural centers. This article also aims to determine other alternatives in improving the existing cultural center functions due to budget issues. The research methods used were normative juridical and sociological juridical methods. The collection of primary secondary and tertiary legal materials is used to analyze issues juridically. In addition, researchers also carried out field research in Subang Regency and interviews with the regional government of Sumedang Regency to complement the sociological aspects. The results show that legal arrangements at the national and regional levels have justified the development of a Cultural Center. To achieve maximum final results implementing instructions and technical instructions to utilize the Cultural Center is needed. In responding to budget reallocation, it is essential to consider the revitalization of cultural places in the community and build a new Cultural Center.

METHODS: Hospital records of 483 consecutive neonates who underwent surgical intervention between January 2013 and December 2017 were reviewed, and perioperative variables were recorded. RESULTS: We found that the prevalence of SSI was 87.5% when the body weight was less than 1500 g. When the operative age was between seven and 14 days, the probability of no SSI is about 93.9%. When the duration of the aortic cross-clamp was more than 60 min, the prevalence of SSI was 91.2%. The prevalence without SSI was 96.6% when the duration of DSC was less than 24 h. However, when the duration of DSC was more than 120 h, the prevalence of SSI was 88.9% (p = 0.000).

We described HTN treatment patterns in SLE, evaluated uncontrolled HTN according to Canadian and American guidelines and identified factors associated with uncontrolled HTN. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study, identifying all McGill Lupus Clinic registry patients with an annual visit between January 2017 and May 2019 who were taking HTN medications. We excluded those taking medications only for another indication (eg, Raynaud's). We determined the frequency of uncontrolled HTN according to Canadian and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines. Multivariate logistic regression (adjusted for age, sex and race/ethnicity) evaluated if uncontrolled HTN was more common with high body mass index (BMI), longer SLE duration, high disease activity, renal damage, multiple concomitant antihypertensives, prednisone and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. RESULTS: Of 442 patients with SLE, 108 were taking medications to treat HTN, and 38 took multiple medications concurrently. Angiotensin-receptor blockers were most common, followed by calcium channel blockers, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers. Among the 108 patients, 39.8% (n=43) had blood pressure (BP) >140/90 mm Hg, while 66.7% (n=72) had BP >130/80 mm Hg. In multivariate analyses, uncontrolled HTN (>130/80 mm Hg) was more likely in Caucasians (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.12 to 6.78) and patients with higher BMI (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.19). Patients with renal damage had better HTN control (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.97). We could not draw definitive conclusions regarding other variables. CONCLUSION: Caucasians and patients with higher BMI had more uncontrolled HTN. The negative association with renal damage is reassuring, as controlled BP is key for renal protection.","output":"Treatment patterns and control of hypertension in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Engaged research involves stakeholders as active partners in the research process, not just as research participants. Engaged dementia research can improve the relevance and quality of research, empower persons living dementia (PLWD) and family care partners, and acknowledge their expertise gained through lived experience. Conducting engaged research is challenging during COVID-19 when in-person interactions are difficult or impossible. The Dementia Lifestyle Intervention for Getting Health Together (DELIGHT) project used an online, engaged research approach to co-design the DELIGHT program, a 12-week program to support the health and well-being goals of PLWD and care partners. Here, we used mixed-methods to evaluate the DELIGHT co-design process, its alignment with an Authentic Partnership approach, and experiences, satisfaction, and suggestions for future online co-design processes. METHOD: The DELIGHT project engaged 29 people in the co-design process during Summer 2020, including PLWD, care partners, service/program providers, healthcare providers, and researchers. The co-design team met over six, 1.5-hour online meetings (via Zoom) to develop the program. Although the co-design process is on-going, evaluation focused on this first phase of the co-design process. A 17-item survey assessed alignment with an Authentic Partnerships approach. Focus groups and interviews used a semi-structured guide to assess experiences, satisfaction, and suggestions for future on-line co-design. RESULT: Surveys were completed by 11 co-design members, and 11 co-design members participated in interviews or focus groups (not all completed both). Initial analysis of survey results indicates co-design members felt respected and safe in the co-design process, felt their perspectives and opinions were valued, and valued the contributions of other members (100% agreed or strongly agreed). All survey respondents felt they gained knowledge and strategies for living well with dementia during the co-design process. All survey respondents also strongly agreed that the DELIGHT program, when implemented, will have a positive impact on PLWD and care partners.

IBV is among the most important pathogens in chickens, and it spreads rapidly among flocks. In addition to dozens of known serotypes, new viral variants have emerged due to the viral evolution and antigenic variation in IBVs. Therefore, the development of a sensitive, specific, and easily performed assay is crucial for the rapid detection and surveillance of IBV infections. A rapid and simple immunochromatographic strip (ICS) was developed in this study by employing monoclonal antibodies against spike and nucleocapsid proteins of IBV as the tracer and the capture antibody. The ICS showed high specificity in detecting IBV antigens, including several IBV genotypes and novel variants, as opposed to three other common avian respiratory viruses. The detection limit of the strip reached 10(4.4) 50% embryo-infective dose. Moreover, in the experimental chicken model, the strip test demonstrated consistency in detecting IBV with RT-PCR gene detection. Taken together, this antigen detection strip has the potential to serve as an on-farm rapid test for IBV; therefore, it may facilitate surveillance and control of the disease.","output":"A Novel Immunochromatographic Strip for Antigen Detection of Avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reaction of 2,3-O-isopropylidene-d-ribofuranosylamine with 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene afforded the crystalline 2,3-O-isopropylidene-N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-?-d-ribofuranosylamine (3) and a 1:1 crystalline complex of 2,3-O-isopropylidene-N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl--d-ribofuranosylamine and 2,3-O-isopropylidene-?-d-ribofuranose; controlled acidic hydrolysis of 3 afforded N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl--d-ribopyranosylamine and not the expected ?-d-furanosylamine derivative.

Still, since a reliable and consistent method to measure the evolution of contagion at international level is missing, a systematic analysis of the relationship between human mobility and virus spread has never been conducted. A notable exceptions are France and Italy, for which data on excess deaths, an indirect indicator which is generally considered to be less affected by national and regional assumptions, are available at department and municipality level, respectively. Using this information together with anonymised and aggregated mobile data, this study shows that mobility alone can explain up to 92% of the initial spread in these two EU countries, while it has a slow decay effect after lockdown measures, meaning that mobility restrictions seem to have effectively contribute to save lives. It also emerges that internal mobility is more important than mobility across provinces and that the typical lagged positive effect of reduced human mobility on reducing excess deaths is around 14-20 days. An analogous analysis relative to Spain, for which an IgG SARS-Cov-2 antibody screening study at province level is used instead of excess deaths statistics, confirms the findings. The same approach adopted in this study can be easily extended to other European countries, as soon as reliable data on the spreading of the virus at a suitable level of granularity will be available.

Vaccination to prevent COVID-19 is recommended, but data on the immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 vaccines for patients with solid tumours receiving systemic cancer treatment are scarce. Therefore, we aimed to assess the impact of immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and chemoimmunotherapy on the immunogenicity and safety of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna Biotech, Madrid, Spain) COVID-19 vaccine as part of the Vaccination Against COVID in Cancer (VOICE) trial. METHODS: This prospective, multicentre, non-inferiority trial was done across three centres in the Netherlands. Individuals aged 18 years or older with a life expectancy of more than 12 months were enrolled into four cohorts: individuals without cancer (cohort A [control cohort]), and patients with solid tumours, regardless of stage and histology, treated with immunotherapy (cohort B), chemotherapy (cohort C), or chemoimmunotherapy (cohort D). Participants received two mRNA-1273 vaccinations of 100 g in 05 mL intramuscularly, 28 days apart. The primary endpoint, analysed per protocol (excluding patients with a positive baseline sample [>10 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL], indicating previous SARS-CoV-2 infection), was defined as the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-specific IgG serum antibody response (ie, SARS-CoV-2-binding antibody concentration of >10 BAU/mL) 28 days after the second vaccination. For the primary endpoint analysis, a non-inferiority design with a margin of 10% was used. We also assessed adverse events in all patients who received at least one vaccination, and recorded solicited adverse events in participants who received at least one vaccination but excluding those who already had seroconversion (>10 BAU/mL) at baseline. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04715438. FINDINGS: Between Feb 17 and March 12, 2021, 791 participants were enrolled and followed up for a median of 122 days (IQR 118 to 128). A SARS-CoV-2-binding antibody response was found in 240 (100%; 95% CI 98 to 100) of 240 evaluable participants in cohort A, 130 (99%; 96 to >99) of 131 evaluable patients in cohort B, 223 (97%; 94 to 99) of 229 evaluable patients in cohort C, and 143 (100%; 97 to 100) of 143 evaluable patients in cohort D. The SARS-CoV-2-binding antibody response in each patient cohort was non-inferior compared with cohort A. No new safety signals were observed. Grade 3 or worse serious adverse events occurred in no participants in cohort A, three (2%) of 137 patients in cohort B, six (2%) of 244 patients in cohort C, and one (1%) of 163 patients in cohort D, with four events (two of fever, and one each of diarrhoea and febrile neutropenia) potentially related to the vaccination. There were no vaccine-related deaths. INTERPRETATION: Most patients with cancer develop, while receiving chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or both for a solid tumour, an adequate antibody response to vaccination with the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine is also safe in these patients. The minority of patients with an inadequate response after two vaccinations might benefit from a third vaccination.

The traditional GDP stood for the quantity of economic growth, and the green GDP, taking both the energy consumption and environmental pollution into account, was employed to represent the sustainability of economic development. We used a panel data of 143 countries and regions during the period from 1990 to 2014, and results showed that the elasticities of output with respect to human capital were greater compared to physical capital, while green GDP was significantly more sensitive to changes in human capital than the traditional GDP. In particular, considering the unbalanced distribution of economic growth among countries and regions, we employed the quantile regression model to explore the heterogeneous roles of physical and human capital in different stages of economic development, which evidenced not only the significance but also the stability of human capital. As national economic levels grew, countries became less dependent on physical capital, yet human capital maintained its outstanding role at different stages of economic development, particularly for the building of more sustainable economies.","output":"A Comparative Study of the Impacts of Human Capital and Physical Capital on Building Sustainable Economies at Different Stages of Economic Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 boosted healthcare digitalization and personalization in cardiology. However, understanding patient attitudes and engagement behaviors are essential to achieve successful acceptance and implementation of digital health technologies in personalized care. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand current and future trends in wearable device and telemedicine use in the cardiology clinic patient population, recognize patients attitude towards digital health before and after COVID-19, and identify potential socioeconomic and racial/ethnic differences in adoption of digital health tools in New Orleans patient population. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to Tulane Cardiology Clinic patients between September 2020 and January 2021. Basic demographical information, medical comorbidities, device usage, and opinions on digital health tools were collected. RESULTS: Survey responses from 299 participants (average age = 54 years, 50.8% female, 24.4% African American (AA)), showed that digital health use was more prevalent in younger, healthier, and more educated individuals. Wearables use was also higher among Caucasian patients compared to AA patients. Patients cited costs and technology knowledge as primary deterrents for using wearables, despite being more inclined to use wearables for disease monitoring (41%). While wearables use did not increase after COVID-19 (36.6% pre-COVID vs 35.4% post-COVID, p=0.77), telemedicine use rose significantly (10.8% pre-COVID19 vs. 24.3% during-COVID19, p<0.0001). Patients mostly noted telemedicines effectiveness in overcoming difficult healthcare access barriers. Additionally, most patients are in support of wearables and telemedicine either complementing or replacing routine tests and traditional clinical visits. CONCLUSION: Demographic and socioeconomic disparities negatively impact wearable health devices and telemedicine adoption within cardiovascular clinic patients. Although telemedicine use increased after COVID-19, this effect was not observed for wearables, reflecting significant economic and digital literacy challenges underlying wearables acceptance.","output":"A Cardiovascular Clinic Patients Survey to Assess Challenges and Opportunities of Digital Health Adoption During the COVID-19 Pandemic Digital Health Survey During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This was a national survey that determined the prevalence of depressive symptoms (depression thereafter) and its relationship with quality of life (QOL) in frontline clinicians working in psychiatric hospitals in China during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We sought to identify, collate, and summarise guidance for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in custodial settings in the first six months of 2020. We conducted a systematic search of peer-reviewed and grey literature, and manually searched relevant websites to identify publications up to 30 June 2020 outlining recommendations to prevent and/or control COVID-19 in custodial settings. We inductively developed a coding framework and assessed recommendations using conventional content analysis. RESULTS: We identified 201 eligible publications containing 374 unique recommendations across 19 domains including: preparedness; physical environments; case identification, screening, and management; communication; external access and visitation; psychological and emotional support; recreation, legal, and health service adaptation; decarceration; release and community reintegration; workforce logistics; surveillance and information sharing; independent monitoring; compensatory measures; lifting control measures; evaluation; and key populations/settings. We identified few conflicting recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: The breadth of recommendations identified in this review reflects the complexity of COVID-19 response in custodial settings. Despite the availability of comprehensive guidance early in the pandemic, important gaps remain in the implementation of recommended prevention and control measures globally, and in the availability of evidence assessing their effectiveness on reducing COVID-19 disease, impact on people in custody and staff, and implementation.

This study aims to evaluate if influenza vaccination in the 2019C2020 season had any effect on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection in a cohort of health workers. During the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave in Spain, between March and May 2020, a cohort of 11,201 health workers was highly tested by RT-qPCR and/or rapid antibody test when the infection was suspected. Later in June, 8665 of them were tested for total antibodies in serum. A total of 890 (7.9%) health workers were laboratory-confirmed for SARS-CoV-2 infection by any type of test, while no case of influenza was detected. The adjusted odds ratio between 2019C2020 influenza vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection was the same (1.07; 95% CI, 0.92C1.24) in both comparisons of positive testers with all others (cohort design) and with negative testers (test-negative design). Among symptomatic patients tested by RT-qPCR, the comparison of positive cases and negative controls showed an adjusted odds ratio of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.68C1.08).

This introductory chapter outlines the books contribution to studying the operation of gender in parliaments and situates it amongst contemporary gender and legislative studies approaches. The chapter sets out parliamentary ethnography as a promising approach to explore parliaments as gendered workplaces. This is because parliamentary ethnography can thicken explorations of inequalities and how power is exercised at the capillaries of parliaments.

In the current pandemic situation, a more rapid and high-throughput method is in growing demand. Here, we validated the performance of a new antigen test (LUMIPULSE) based on the chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay. A total of 313 nasopharyngeal swabs (82 serial samples from 7 infected patients, 231 individual samples from 4 infected patients and 215 non-infected individuals) were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) and then subjected to LUMIPULSE. We determined the cutoff value for antigen detection using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and compared the antigen test performance with that of RT-qPCR. Further, we compared the viral loads and antigen levels in serial samples from seven infected patients. When using RT-qPCR as the reference, the antigen test exhibited 55.2% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity with a 91.4% overall agreement rate (286/313). In specimens with > 100 viral copies and between 10 and 100 copies, the antigen test showed 100% and 85% concordance with RT-qPCR, respectively. This concordance declined with lower viral loads. In the serially followed patients, the antigen levels showed a steady decline along with viral clearance. This gradual decline was in contrast with the abrupt positive-to-negative and negative-to-positive status changes observed with RT-qPCR, particularly in the late phase of infection. In summary, the LUMIPULSE antigen test can rapidly identify SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with moderate to high viral loads and may be helpful for monitoring viral clearance in hospitalized patients.","output":"Comparison of Automated SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test for COVID-19 Infection with Quantitative RT-PCR using 313 Nasopharyngeal Swabs Including from 7 Serially Followed Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic meant that companies had to adapt quickly to survive the challenging scenario and avoid losing market share or even going bankrupt In this sense, employees dedicated to Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) activities within organizations played a key role in ensuring that the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) were properly implemented Even so, no studies were identified in the literature that investigated how the practices to combat COVID-19 improved the performance related to employee safety and occupational health This is what motivates the accomplishment of this work;evaluate how these practices improve safety and health-related performance For this, a survey of multinational companies was carried out and, together with this research, a model for structural equations was developed In the end, a correlation test was performed The main results showed that practices to combat COVID-19, such as the provision of sanitizers, the adoption of social distance, the creation of new work shifts, and the disinfection of workplaces were related to improvements in safety and health performance through the implementation of a risk management and biological risk mitigation program Meanwhile, the provision of emergency assistance has found stronger relationships with managerial and strategic actions ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd","output":"Performance evaluation of occupational health and safety in relation to the COVID-19 fighting practices established by WHO: Survey in multinational industries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel Covid-19 (Sars-CoV-2) is a leading acute respiratory tract infection in humans and respiratory disease COVID-19 has gained global resonance, and attempts are being made to classify the molecular characteristics and evolutionary background of this virus.

While the majority of those exposed have minor symptoms and recover with little morbidity, an estimated 500,000 people succumb to IAV-related complications each year worldwide. In these severe cases, an exaggerated inflammatory response, known as \\"cytokine storm\\", occurs which results in damage to the respiratory epithelial barrier and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Data from retrospective human studies as well as experimental animal models of influenza virus infection highlight the fine line between an excessive and an inadequate immune response, where the host response must balance viral clearance with exuberant inflammation. Current pharmacological modulators of inflammation, including corticosteroids and statins, have not been successful in improving outcomes during influenza virus infection. We have reported that the amplitude of the inflammatory response is regulated by Linear Ubiquitin Assembly Complex (LUBAC) activity and that dampening of LUBAC activity is protective during severe influenza virus infection. Therapeutic modulation of LUBAC activity may be crucial to improve outcomes during severe influenza virus infection, as it functions as a molecular rheostat of the host response.

An anonymous online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 2,254 full-time doctors/nurses in three Chinese provinces during 10/2020-11/2020. The prevalence of BICV was 75.1%/68.0% among nurses/doctors under the most optimum scenario of this study (free/80% effectiveness/rare mild side effects); it dropped to 64.6%/56.5% if it costed 600 Yuan (USD90).

We previously reported that it is also associated with a reduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and an increase in a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) activity in experimental hypertension. In addition, while multiple cells within the central nervous system have been involved in the development of neurogenic hypertension, the contribution of ADAM17 has not been investigated. OBJECTIVE To assess the clinical relevance of this ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding in hypertensive patients and further identify the cell types and signaling pathways involved in this process. METHODS AND RESULTS Using a mass spectrometry-based assay, we identified ACE2 as the main enzyme converting angiotensin II into angiotensin-(1-7) in human cerebrospinal fluid. We also observed an increase in ACE2 activity in the cerebrospinal fluid of hypertensive patients, which was correlated with systolic blood pressure. Moreover, the increased level of tumor necrosis factor- in those cerebrospinal fluid samples confirmed that ADAM17 was upregulated in the brain of hypertensive patients. To further assess the interaction between brain renin-angiotensin system and ADAM17, we generated mice lacking angiotensin II type 1 receptors specifically on neurons. Our data reveal that despite expression on astrocytes and other cells types in the brain, ADAM17 upregulation during deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertension occurs selectively on neurons, and neuronal angiotensin II type 1 receptors are indispensable to this process. Mechanistically, reactive oxygen species and extracellular signal-regulated kinase were found to mediate ADAM17 activation. CONCLUSIONS Our data demonstrate that angiotensin II type 1 receptors promote ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding in the brain of hypertensive patients, leading to a loss in compensatory activity during neurogenic hypertension.","output":"Clinical Relevance and Role of Neuronal AT1 Receptors in ADAM17-Mediated ACE2 Shedding in Neurogenic Hypertension."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has had asymmetrical spatial impacts across South Africa New evidence from the National Income Dynamics Study: Coronavirus Rapid Mobile (NIDS-CRAM) survey shows that the pandemic and lockdown reflex have magnified pre-existing divisions within cities Although COVID-19 has severely impacted the whole country, townships and informal settlements have proved more vulnerable than suburbs As South Africa was already one of the most unevenly developed countries in the world, COVID-19 has widened the gap between places, which face very different levels of risk and resilience","output":"COVID-19 amplifies urban inequalities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction COVID-19 has resulted in a global, social and economic disruptions, especially a widespread shortage in supplied and stress on the healthcare system.

We included participants aged 18C54 years with a negative SARS-CoV-2 antibody and PCR test, normal haematology and chemistry panels, a normal electrocardiogram and troponin concentration, negative pregnancy test if female, body-mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or less, and no modified vaccinia virus Ankara or poxvirus vaccine in the past 12 months. In the open-label cohort, 10  10(7) plaque-forming units (PFU; low dose), 10  10(8) PFU (medium dose), and 25  10(8) PFU (high dose) of COH04S1 were administered by intramuscular injection on day 0 and 28 to sentinel participants using a queue-based statistical design to limit risk. In a randomised dose expansion cohort, additional participants were randomly assigned (3:3:1), using block size of seven, to receive two placebo vaccines (placebo group), one low-dose COH04S1 and one placebo vaccine (low-dose COH04S1 plus placebo group), or two low-dose COH04S1 vaccines (low-dose COH04S1 group). The primary outcome was safety and tolerability, with secondary objectives assessing vaccine-specific immunogenicity. The primary immunological outcome was a four times increase (seroconversion) from baseline in spike-specific or nucleocapsid-specific IgG titres within 28 days of the last injection, and seroconversion rates were compared with participants who received placebo using Fisher's exact test. Additional secondary outcomes included assessment of viral neutralisation and cellular responses. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT046339466. FINDINGS: Between Dec 13, 2020, and May 24, 2021, 56 participants initiated vaccination.

Grade 3 fever was observed in one participant who received low-dose COH04S1 and placebo, and grade 2 anxiety or fatigue was seen in one participant who received medium-dose COH04S1. No severe adverse events were reported. Seroconversion was observed in all 34 participants for spike protein and 32 (94%) for nucleocapsid protein (p<00001 vs placebo for each comparison). Four times or more increase in SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies within 56 days was measured in nine of 17 participants in the low-dose COH04S1 group, all eight participants in the medium-dose COH04S1 group, and eight of nine participants in the high-dose COH04S1 group (p=00035 combined dose levels vs placebo).

Among the three RLRs encoded by the human genome, RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5, which contain N-terminal caspase recruitment domains, are activated upon the detection of viral RNAs in the cytoplasm of virus-infected cells. Activated RLRs induce downstream signaling via their interactions with mitochondrial antiviral signaling proteins and activate the production of type I and III interferons and inflammatory cytokines. Recent studies have shown that RLR-mediated signaling is regulated by interactions with endogenous RNAs and host proteins, such as those involved in stress responses and posttranslational modifications. Since RLR-mediated cytokine production is also involved in the regulation of acquired immunity, the deregulation of RLR-mediated signaling is associated with autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders. Moreover, RLR-mediated signaling might be involved in the aberrant cytokine production observed in coronavirus disease 2019. Since the discovery of RLRs in 2004, significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying the activation and regulation of RLR-mediated signaling pathways.

Clinical and experimental data have revealed a role for neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in COVID-19 disease. The mechanisms that drive thrombo-inflammation in COVID-19 are poorly understood. METHODS: We performed proteomic analysis and immunostaining of postmortem lung tissues from COVID-19 patients and patients with other lung pathologies. We further compared coagulation factor XII (FXII) and DNase activities in plasma samples from COVID-19 patients and healthy control donors and determined NET-induced FXII activation using a chromogenic substrate assay. FINDINGS: FXII expression and activity were increased in the lung parenchyma, within the pulmonary vasculature and in fibrin-rich alveolar spaces of postmortem lung tissues from COVID-19 patients. In agreement with this, plasmaaac acafajf?eFXII activation (FXIIa) was increased in samples from COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, FXIIa colocalized with NETs in COVID-19 lung tissue indicating that NETs accumulation leads to FXII contact activation in COVID-19. We further showed that an accumulation of NETs is partially due to impaired NET clearance by extracellular DNases as DNase substitution improved NET dissolution and reduced FXII activation in vitro.

Microorganisms that can spread by aerosol are considered a more challenging enemy than those that require direct body-to-body contact for transmission, due to the potential for infection of numerous people rather than a single individual. Additionally, disease containment is much more difficult to achieve for aerosolized viral pathogens than for pathogens that spread solely via direct person-to-person contact. Thus, aerobiology has become an increasingly necessary component for studying viral pathogens that are naturally or intentionally transmitted by aerosol.

Several efforts of modelling of the geo-temporal transmissibility of the virus have been undertaken, but none describes the incorporation of effect of seasonality, contact density, primary care and ICU bed capacity and behavioural risk reduction measures such as lockdowns into the simulation modeling for Pakistan. We use above variables to create a close to real data curve function for the active cases of covid-19 in Pakistan. Objective: The objective of this study was to create a new computational epidemiological model for Pakistan by implementing symptomatology, healthcare capacity and behavioural risk reduction mathematically to predict of Covid-19 case trends and effects of changes in community characteristics and policy measures. Methods: We used a modified version of SEIR model called SEIDRD (Susceptible - Exposed Latent - Diagnosed as Mild or severe - Recovered - Deaths). This was developed using Vensim PLE software version 8.0. This model also incorporated the seasonal and capacity variables for Pakistan and was adjusted for behavioural risk reduction measures such as lockdowns. Results: The SEIDRD model was able to closely replicate the active covid-19 cases curve function for Pakistan until now. It was able to show that given current trends, though the number of active cases are dropping, if the smart lockdown measures were to end, the cases are expected to show a rise from 28th August 2020 onwards reaching a second peak around 28th September 2020. It was also seen that increasing the ICU bed capacity in Pakistan from 4000 to 40000 will not make a significant difference in active case number. Another simulation for a vaccination schedule of 100000 vaccines per day was created which showed a decrease in covid cases in a slow manner over a period of months rather than days. Conclusion: This study attempts to successfully model the active covid-19 cases curve function of Pakistan and mathematically models the effect of seasonality, contact density, ICU bed availability and Lockdown measures. We were able to show the effectiveness of smart lockdowns and were also to predict that in case of no smart lockdowns, Pakistan can see a rise in active case number starting from 28th of August 2020.","output":"Covid-19 SEIDRD Modelling for Pakistan with implementation of seasonality, healthcare capacity and behavioral risk reduction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread exponentially worldwide. In Brazil, the number of infected people diagnosed has been increasing and, as in other countries, it has been associated with a high risk of contamination in healthcare teams. For healthcare professionals, the full use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is mandatory, such as wearing surgical or filtering facepiece class 2 (FFP2) masks, waterproof aprons, gloves, and goggles, in addition to training in care processes. A reduction in the number of face-to-face visits and non-essential elective procedures is also recommended. However, surgery should not be postponed in the case of the most essential elective indications (mostly associated with head and neck cancers). As malignant tumors of the head and neck are clinically time sensitive, neither consultations for these tumors nor their treatment should be postponed. Postponing surgical treatment can result in a change in the disease stage and alter an individual's chance of survival. In this situation, planning of all treatments must begin with the request for, in addition to routine examinations, a nasal swab polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 and chest computed tomography. Only if the results of these tests are positive or if fever or other symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 are present should the surgical procedure be postponed until the patient completely recovers. This is mandatory not only because of the risk of contamination of the surgical team but also because of the increased risk of postoperative complications and high risk of death. During this pandemic, the most effective safety measures are social distancing for the general public and the adequate availability and use of PPE in the healthcare field.

METHODS: A 17-question, web-based survey was administered to neurosurgeons worldwide through the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies and the Neurosurgery Cocktail from March 28 to April 5, 2020, by web link or e-mail invitation. Questions were divided into 3 subgroups: general information, health system organization, and institutional plans for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Collected data were initially elaborated using SurveyMonkey software. Country-specific data were extracted from the World Health Organization website. Statistical analysis was performed using R, version 3.6.3. RESULTS: Of the 446 respondents, most were from Italy (20%), India (19%), and Pakistan (5%). Surgical activity was significantly reduced in most centers (79%) and dedicated in-hospital routes were created for patients with SARS-CoV-2 (58%). Patient screening was performed only when there were symptoms (57%) and not routinely before surgery (18%). The preferred methods included a nasopharyngeal swab and chest radiograph. Health professionals were rarely screened (20%) and sometimes, even if SARS-CoV-2 positive, were asked to work if asymptomatic (26%). Surgical planning was changed in most institutions (92%), whereas indications were modified for nonurgent procedures (59%) and remained unchanged for subarachnoid hemorrhages (85%). CONCLUSIONS: Most neurosurgeons worldwide reported work reorganization and practices that respond to current international guidelines.

RDV exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against positive-sense RNA viruses, e.g., SARS-CoV-2 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and non-segmented negative-sense RNA viruses, e.g., Nipah virus (NiV), while several segmented negative-sense RNA viruses such as influenza (Flu) virus or Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) are not sensitive to the drug. The reasons for this apparent pattern are unknown. Here, we expressed and purified representative RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) and studied three biochemical parameters that have been associated with the inhibitory effects of RDV-triphosphate (TP): (i) selective incorporation of the nucleotide substrate RDV-TP, (ii) the effect of the incorporated RDV-monophosphate (MP) on primer extension, and (iii) the effect of RDV-MP in the template during incorporation of the complementary UTP. The results of this study revealed a strong correlation between antiviral effects and efficient incorporation of RDV-TP. Delayed chain-termination is heterogeneous and usually inefficient at higher NTP concentrations. In contrast, template-dependent inhibition of UTP incorporation opposite the embedded RDV-MP is seen with all polymerases. Molecular modeling suggests a steric conflict between the 1-cyano group of RDV-MP and conserved residues of RdRp motif F. We conclude that future efforts in the development of nucleotide analogues with a broader spectrum of antiviral activities should focus on improving rates of incorporation while capitalizing on the inhibitory effects of a bulky 1-modification.","output":"Efficient incorporation and template-dependent polymerase inhibition are major determinants for the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of remdesivir"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: India was quick to implement a complete lockdown to prevent the transmission of the novel coronavirus, which had a significant impact on the migrant labourers.

However, the term is frequently used in Europe where most countries have a no-fault malpractice system. The objectives of this systematic review were to explore the definition of the term 'defensive medicine' in European original medical literature and to identify the motives stated therein. DESIGN Systematic review. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase and Cochrane, 3 February 2020, with an updated search on 6 March 2021. METHODS Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, we reviewed all European original peer-reviewed studies fully or partially investigating 'defensive medicine'. RESULTS We identified a total of 50 studies. First, we divided these into two categories: the first category consisting of studies defining defensive medicine by using a narrow definition and the second category comprising studies in which defensive medicine was defined using a broad definition. In 23 of the studies(46%), defensive medicine was defined narrowly as: health professionals' deviation from sound medical practice motivated by a wish to reduce exposure to malpractice litigation. In 27 studies (54%), a broad definition was applied adding  or other self-protective motives. These self-protective motives, different from fear of malpractice litigation, were grouped into four categories: fear of patient dissatisfaction, fear of overlooking a severe diagnosis, fear of negative publicity and unconscious defensive medicine. Studies applying the narrow and broad definitions of defensive medicine did not differ regarding publication year, country, medical specialty, research quality or number of citations. CONCLUSIONS In European research, the narrow definition of defensive medicine as exclusively motivated by fear of litigation is often broadened to include other self-protective motives. In order to compare results pertaining to defensive medicine across countries, future studies are recommended to specify whether they are using the narrow or broad definition of defensive medicine.

As neighboring sentinel cells to blood vessels, mast cells have been associated with angiogenesis. Here we assess the direct contribution of mast cells to neovascularization at the ocular surface. METHODS: Corneal neovascularization was induced by placing a single figure-of-eight intrastromal suture 1a?mm from the limbus in mast cell-deficient (cKitW-sh), C57BL/6, and Balb/c mice. Corneas were harvested at 6a?h post-suture to quantify cKit+Fc?R1+ mast cells using flow cytometry and tear wash was collected within 6a?h to measure ?-hexosaminidase and tryptase. Neovascularization was assessed using slit-lamp biomicroscope and immunohistochemistry analysis of corneas harvested on day 4 post-suture. To investigate the effects of mast cells on blood vessel growth, mast cells were co-cultured with vascular endothelial cells (VECs), and tube formation and proliferation of VECs were measured. 2% cromolyn was administered locally to inhibit mast cell activation in vivo. RESULTS: Placement of corneal suture activates ocular surface mast cells which infiltrate into the cornea adjacent to new vessels. Mast cell-deficient mice develop significantly fewer new vessels following suture placement. Mast cells directly promote VEC proliferation and tube formation, partly through secreting high levels of VEGF-A. Pharmacological inhibition of mast cell activation results in significantly less corneal neovascularization.

The EUs activities in crisis management increased and became more decisive in March 2020 and, since then, they have been mainly related to the internal market and economic recovery as well as to coordinating health and research. In its crisis communication, the EC used a managerial framing by informing on crisis interventions and their costs, combined rhetoric of apologia with calls for solidarity and cooperation and promoted a renewal discourse by framing the crisis as an opportunity for modernisation and the emergence of a new powerful Europe. This frame of hope, however, was contrasted by controversy between member states in the European Council about the financing of recovery strategies.

DESIGN retrospective study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS for each vaccine recipient, demographic information and history of HPV vaccine uptake from the digital FVG Vaccination Registry updated as of 31.12.2018 were extracted. Numerator data comprised all doses allocated to FVG residents. Age-specific denominators were derived from the FVG census in each examined year. Coverage estimates for the year 2018 were also provided by number of doses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES coverage for a full course of HPV vaccine, defined as 2 doses in girls and boys younger than age 15 years but 3 doses in less young women. RESULTS In FVG 52,217 females had received >=1 dose since 2008 and 12,152 males since 2015. >=2-dose coverage in girls at 15 increased from 42% in 2009 to 76% in 2015 and slightly declined afterwards (69% in 2018). In 2008, 3-dose coverage was 65%, 74%, and 59% in females aged 16-17, 18-19, and 20-26 years, respectively. In the same year, 2-dose coverage in boys at 13 years was 54%, similar to the coverage in girls at 13 years (57%). CONCLUSIONS this paper shows the achievements of routine and catch-up HPV vaccination in FVG. While coverage in girls at 15 years of age peaked in 2015 and slightly diminished in subsequent years, the coverage in boys at 13 in 2018 had already approached the coverage in same-age girls (57%). On account of the signs of weakening in girls' coverage, campaigns in support to HPV vaccination must be repeated, especially in favour of the most cost-effective group, i.e., girls before 15 years of age. The heavy burden posed by the COVID-19 emergency on other prevention-related activities makes a better targeted use of HPV vaccination even more necessary.","output":"Coverage of HPV vaccination programme in Friuli Venezia Giulia Region (Northern Italy)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Demarcating childhood into two distinct and broad 10-year age bands of over and under age 10 is a disservice to our tween population (9C12 years), and may be overlooking our role in understanding the negative impacts of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) during a formative period of development.

The Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle is a management tool for continuous improvement of a business's products or processes. It can be applied to standardize nursing management and thus improve the nursing quality and increase the survival rate of patients. This study assessed the value of the PDCA cycle in standardizing nursing management in an intensive care unit (ICU) for patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS The status quo of the ICU was analyzed, and the relevant issues and countermeasures were proposed. The PDCA cycle was applied to standardize the nursing management in the ICU. RESULTS Nine measures were proposed and applied to improve the management of the COVID-19 ICU: defining the clean or contaminated areas, use of self-designed shoe storage cabinets, defining staff roles and responsibilities, establishing the staffing structure, staff training, placing items at fixed locations, improving shift handover, use of bulletin boards for listing key points, and use of reserved drugs cabinets. The virus contamination awareness, professional skills, awareness of duties and responsibilities, and quality and performance of nursing were remarkably improved 2 weeks after the implementation of the above countermeasures.

A prompt clearance of these apoptotic cells and debris by phagocytic cells, a process known as efferocytosis, is important in maintaining tissue homeostasis. Accordingly, impaired efferocytosis due to the defective clearance and disrupted stages can lead to a growing number of inflammation- and immune-related diseases. Although numerous studies have shown the mechanisms of efferocytosis, its role in disorders, such as non-tumor and tumor diseases, remains poorly understood. This review summarizes the processes and signal molecules in efferocytosis, and efferocytosis-related functions in non-tumor (atherosclerosis, lung diseases, etc.) and tumor diseases (breast cancer, prostate cancer, etc.), as well as describes the role of involved cytokines. Of note, there is a dual role of efferocytosis in the abovementioned disorders, and a paradoxical effect among non-tumor and tumor diseases in terms of inflammation resolution, immune response, and disease progression. Briefly, intact efferocytosis and cytokines promote tissue repair, while they contribute to tumor progression via tumor microenvironment and macrophage politzerization. Additionally, this review provides potential targets associated with TAM receptors and cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor &#945; - and CXCL5, suggesting potential novel therapeutic ways in treating diseases.","output":"Efferocytosis and Its Associated Cytokines: A Light on Non-tumor and Tumor Diseases?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2014, novel highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N2, H5N5, H5N6, and H5N8 viruses caused outbreaks in Asia, Europe, and North America.

MRI T1-mapping technique can quantitatively evaluate DMIF. PURPOSE: To evaluate of early DMIF in a type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) mouse model through 7.0 T MRI T1 mapping. STUDY TYPE: Prospective. ANIMAL MODEL: A total of 50 8-week-old C57Bl/6J male mice were divided into control (n = 20) and T1DM (n = 30) groups. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: A 7.0 T small animal MRI; gradient echo Look-Locker inversion recovery T1-mapping sequence; cine MRI. Scans were acquired in control and T1DM mice every 4 weeks until 24 weeks. ASSESSMENT: End-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), ejection fraction (EF), left ventricle (LV) mass, fractional shortening (FS), and E/A ratio. They were evaluated through echocardiography and cine MRI. The extracellular volume fraction (ECV) was calculated. Sirius Red staining was performed and calculated collagen volume fraction (CVF). STATISTICAL TESTS: Differences in ECV and CVF between two groups were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. The correlation between ECV and CVF was assessed using Pearson's correlations. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, a progressive decrease in FS, EF, and E/A ratio was observed in the T1DM group. Both ECV and CVF values gradually increased during diabetes progression. A significant increase in ECV and CVF values was observed at 12 weeks (ECV: 32.5%  1.6% vs. 28.1%  1.8%; CVF: 6.9%  1.8% vs. 3.3%  1.1%). ECV showed a strong correlation with CVF (r = 0.856).

Since then, known as COVID-19 disease, the responsible viral pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, has spread around the world in a pandemic. Decisions on how to deal with the crisis are often based on simulations of the pandemic spread of the virus. The results of some of these, as well as their methodology and possibilities for improvement, will be described in more detail in this paper in order to inform beyond the current public health dogma called \\"flatten-the-curve\\". There are several ways to model an epidemic in order to simulate the spread of diseases. Depending on the timeliness, scope and quality of the associated real data, these multivariable models differ in the value of used parameters, but also in the selection of considered influencing factors. It was exemplarily shown that epidemics in their course are simulated more realistically by models that assume subexponential growth. Furthermore, various simulations of the COVID-19 pandemic were presented in an European perspective, compared against each other and discussed in more detail. It is difficult to estimate how credible the simulations of the pandemic models currently are, so it remains to be seen whether the spread of the pandemic can be effectively reduced by the measures taken. Whether a model works well in reality is largely determined by the quality and scope of its underlying data. Past studies have shown that countermeasures are able to reduce reproduction numbers or transmission rates in epidemics.

We investigated the time of entry of swine influenza into the Finnish pig population. We also describe the molecular detection of two types of influenza A (H1N1) viruses in porcine samples submitted in 2009 and 2010. This retrospective study was based on three categories of samples: blood samples collected for disease monitoring from pigs at major slaughterhouses from 2007 to 2009; blood samples from pigs in farms with a special health status taken in 2008 and 2009; and diagnostic blood samples from pigs in farms with clinical signs of respiratory disease in 2008 and 2009. The blood samples were tested for influenza A antibodies with an antibody ELISA. Positive samples were further analyzed for H1N1, H3N2, and H1N2 antibodies with a hemagglutination inhibition test. Diagnostic samples for virus detection were subjected to influenza A M-gene-specific real-time RT-PCR and to pandemic influenza A H1N1-specific real-time RT-PCR. Positive samples were further analyzed with RT-PCRs designed for this purpose, and the PCR products were sequenced and sequences analyzed phylogenetically. RESULTS: In the blood samples from pigs in special health class farms producing replacement animals and in diagnostic blood samples, the first serologically positive samples originated from the period JulyCAugust 2008. In samples collected for disease monitoring, < 0.1%, 0% and 16% were positive for antibodies against influenza A H1N1 in the HI test in 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively. Swine influenza A virus of avian-like H1N1 was first detected in diagnostic samples in February 2009. In 2009 and 2010, the avian-like H1N1 virus was detected on 12 and two farms, respectively. The pandemic H1N1 virus (A(H1N1)pdm09) was detected on one pig farm in 2009 and on two farms in 2010. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our study, swine influenza of avian-like H1N1 virus was introduced into the Finnish pig population in 2008 and A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in 2009. The source of avian-like H1N1 infection could not be determined.

METHODS patients with confirmed COVID-19 seen at the emergency department of our hospital with recent measurements of 25(OH)D were recruited. We explored the association of vitamin D deficiency (VDD), defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 20 ng/mL, with a composite of adverse clinical outcomes. RESULTS we included 80 patients, of which 31 (39 %) presented the endpoint. VDD tended to predict an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 after adjusting for age, gender, obesity, cardiac disease, and kidney disease [OR 3.2 (95 % CI: 0.9-11.4), p = 0.07]. Age had a negative interaction with the effect of VDD on the composite outcome (p = 0.03), indicating that the effect was more noticeable at younger ages. Furthermore, male gender was associated with VDD and with severe COVID-19 at younger ages.

Some regions are reaching WHO goals, but transmission could rebound if strategies are discontinued without an epidemiological evaluation. For that, sensitive diagnostic methods to detect low intensity infections and localization of ongoing transmission are crucial. In this work, we estimated and compared the STH infection as obtained by different diagnostic methods in a low intensity setting. We conducted a cross-sectional study enrolling 792 participants from a district in Mozambique. Two stool samples from two consecutive days were collected from each participant. Samples were analysed by Telemann, Kato-Katz and qPCR for STH detection. We evaluated diagnostic sensitivity using a composite reference standard. By geostatistical methods, we estimated neighbourhood prevalence of at least one STH infection for each diagnostic method. We used environmental, demographical and socioeconomical indicators to account for any existing spatial heterogeneity in infection. qPCR was the most sensitive technique compared to composite reference standard: 92% (CI: 83%C 97%) for A. lumbricoides, 95% (CI: 88%C 98%) for T. trichiura and 95% (CI: 91%C 97%) for hookworm. qPCR also estimated the highest neighbourhood prevalences for at least one STH infection in a low intensity setting. While 10% of the neighbourhoods showed a prevalence above 20% when estimating with single Kato-Katz from one stool and Telemann from one stool, 86% of the neighbourhoods had a prevalence above 20% when estimating with qPCR. In low intensity settings, STH estimated prevalence of infection may be underestimated if based on Kato-Katz. qPCR diagnosis outperformed the microscopy methods. Thus, implementation of qPCR based predictive maps at STH control and elimination programmes would disclose hidden transmission and facilitate targeted interventions for transmission interruption.","output":"Towards soil-transmitted helminths transmission interruption: The impact of diagnostic tools on infection prediction in a low intensity setting in Southern Mozambique"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The exposure of wild carnivores to viral pathogens, with emphasis on parvovirus (CPV/FPLV), was assessed based on the molecular screening of tissue samples from 128 hunted or accidentally road-killed animals collected in Portugal from 2008 to 2011, including Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon, n = 99), red fox (Vulpes vulpes, n = 19), stone marten (Martes foina, n = 3), common genet (Genetta genetta, n = 3) and Eurasian badger (Meles meles, n = 4). A high prevalence of parvovirus DNA (63%) was detected among all surveyed species, particularly in mongooses (58%) and red foxes (79%), along with the presence of CPV/FPLV circulating antibodies that were identified in 90% of a subset of parvovirus-DNA positive samples. Most specimens were extensively autolysed, restricting macro and microscopic investigations for lesion evaluation. Whenever possible to examine, signs of active disease were not present, supporting the hypothesis that the parvovirus vp2 gene fragments detected by real-time PCR possibly correspond to viral DNA reminiscent from previous infections. The molecular characterization of viruses, based on the analysis of the complete or partial sequence of the vp2 gene, allowed typifying three viral strains of mongoose and four red foxs as feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV) and one stone martens as newCPV-2b type. The genetic similarity found between the FPLV viruses from free-ranging and captive wild species originated in Portugal and publicly available comparable sequences, suggests a closer genetic relatedness among FPLV circulating in Portugal. Although the clinical and epidemiological significance of infection could not be established, this study evidences that exposure of sympatric wild carnivores to parvovirus is common and geographically widespread, potentially carrying a risk to susceptible populations at the wildlife-domestic interface and to threatened species, such as the wildcat (Felis silvestris) and the critically endangered Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus).","output":"Snapshot of Viral Infections in Wild Carnivores Reveals Ubiquity of Parvovirus and Susceptibility of Egyptian Mongoose to Feline Panleukopenia Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The health system is facing a global pandemic due to coronavirus disease 2019.

Mutations on the Spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) are critical for the antibody resistance and infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 variants. In this study, we have used accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) simulations and free energy calculations to present a systematic analysis of the affinity and conformational dynamics along with the interactions that drive the binding between Spike protein RBD and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. We evaluate the impacts of the key mutation that occur in the RBDs Omicron and other variants in the binding with the human ACE2 receptor. The results show that S protein Omicron has stronger binding to the ACE2 than other variants. The evaluation of the decomposition energy per residue shows the mutations N440K, T478K, Q493R and Q498R observed in Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 provided a stabilization effect for the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2. Overall, the results demonstrate that faster spreading of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron may be correlated with binding affinity of S protein RBD to ACE2 and mutations of uncharged residues to positively charged residues such as Lys and Arg in key positions in the RBD.","output":"Assessment of mutations on RBD in the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Delta and Omicron variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this brief note written during a global pandemic, we consider some of the important ways this historical moment is altering the religious landscape, aiming our investigative lens at how religious institutions, congregations, and individuals are affected by the social changes produced by COVID-19.

Particularly important considerations include developing heuristic, innovative approaches for revealing ongoing changes to religion, as well as how religion continues to structure social life across a wide range of contexts, from the most intimate and personal to the most public and global. Although our note can only be indicative rather than exhaustive, we do suggest that the initial groundwork for reconsiderations might productively focus on several key analytical themes, including: Epidemiology, Ideology, Religious Practice, Religious Organizations and Institutions, as well as Epistemology and Methodology.

On the other hand, in addition to the main spread source (human contact) of SARS-CoV-2, consumers have started to think about whether foods are dangerous in terms of SARS-CoV-2 spread. The consumption of wild animals as well as the possible contamination of SARS-CoV-2 in fresh and frozen foods have caused concern and increased awareness among consumers. A heating process >70C is being suggested to eliminate viral contamination risk. Cutting tools, slicing machines, and food-contact surfaces including stainless steel, aluminum, or glass must be regularly sanitized. The sous vide cooking method, which is based on cooking under vacuum and with pH treatments in the range of 3 and 10, could be advised in this risky period for decreasing contamination risk in food. Also, recent studies have shown that nanotechnology applications such as nanoparticles could be used to combat the SARS-CoV-2 spread, which is 50C200nm in size. Another suggested technique is cold plasma technology that could damage the protein structure of the virus. Besides these techniques, it is important to boost the immune system. In this regard, recent researches have revealed the importance of honey consumption (1g/kg per person/day), intake of vitamins, minerals like selenium, and -3 fatty acids.","output":"Chapter 12 An overview of food safety and COVID-19 infection nanotechnology and cold plasma applications, immune-boosting suggestions, hygienic precautions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: Evidence linking outdoor air pollution with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) incidence and mortality is largely based on ecological comparisons between regions that may differ in factors such as access to testing and control measures that may not be independent of air pollution concentrations. Moreover, studies have yet to focus on key mechanisms of air pollution toxicity such as oxidative stress. Objectives: To conduct a within-city analysis of spatial variations in COVID-19 incidence and the estimated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lung lining fluid attributable to fine particulate matter (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter a2.5 m [PM2.5]). Methods: Sporadic and outbreak-related COVID-19 case counts, testing data, population data, and sociodemographic data for 140 neighborhoods were obtained from the City of Toronto. ROS estimates were based on a mathematical model of ROS generation in lung lining fluid in response to iron and copper in PM2.5. Spatial variations in long-term average ROS were predicted using a land-use regression model derived from measurements of iron and copper in PM2.5. Data were analyzed using negative binomial regression models adjusting for covariates identified using a directed acyclic graph and accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Measurements and Main Results: A significant positive association was observed between neighborhood-level ROS and COVID-19 incidence (incidence rate ratio = 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.15 per interquartile range ROS). Effect modification by neighborhood-level measures of racialized group membership and socioeconomic status was also identified.

RESULTS: Intubation and extubation generated small particles (< 5 m) in mean concentrations 12 times greater than background noise (p < 0.001). The mean particle concentrations during endonasal access were 4.5 times greater than background (p = 0.01).

Identifying individuals whose infection can potentially become severe is critical to control the case fatality rate of COVID-19. However, knowledge of symptoms that are prognostic of COVID-19 severity is lacking. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to identify symptoms prognostic of COVID-19 infection severity. METHODS: We analyzed documented symptoms, including fever, cough, fatigue, expectoration, sore throat, chest distress, headache, diarrhea, rhinorrhea, stuffed nose, nausea, vomiting, muscle or joint ache, shortness of breath, and their associations with disease severity using a case series, including 655 confirmed cases from January 23 to February 5, 2020 in Henan Province, China. We also analyzed the influence of individual characteristics, including age, gender, and comorbidities, on symptoms with prognostic value. RESULTS: Fatigue (95% CI 0.141 to 0.334, P<.001), expectoration (95% CI 0.107 to 0.305, P<.001) and stuffed nose (95% CI -0.499 to -0.082, P=.006) were identified as the prognostic symptoms of COVID-19 patients from the multivariate analysis. Fever occurred in 603/655 (92.1%) of the patients but was not associated with disease severity. Fatigue accounted for 184/655 (28.1%) of the patients and was linearly associated with infection severity with statistical significance. Expectoration occurred in 169/655 (25.8%) patients in the cohort and was the sole prognostic factor for patients with cardiovascular complications, including hypertension. Shortness of breath, chest distress, muscle or joint ache, and dry cough, which occurred in 33 (5%), 83 (12.7%), 78 (11.9%), and 276 (42.1%) of the 655 patients, respectively, were significantly enriched among patients classified as severe. Stuffed nose and nausea were associated with favorable disease severity, especially among male patients. More female than male patients were documented as having muscle or joint ache. Headache was most enriched in patents aged 15 to 39 years, followed by those aged 40 to 64 years, with statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue and expectoration are signs of severe COVID-19 infection. Shortness of breath, chest distress, muscle or joint ache, and dry cough are prevalent in severe patients. Expectoration is commonly present in older individuals and patients with cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension. Shortness of breath is prognostic of severe infection in male patients.

The current perception threshold (CPT), which was measured by Neurometer at 2000, 250 and 5 Hz, the level of homocysteine, Vitamin B12 and folic acid in plasma, were compared with those of sex- and age-matched healthy controls (HCs). RESULTS: Current perception threshold was higher at 250 Hz (p < .05) and 5 Hz (p < .05) in the LELD group than the NOLD, SELD, and control group. CPT was lower at 5 Hz in the NOLD than in the HCs group (p < .05). The CPT of the more affected side of PD patients was positively correlated with H-Y stage at 5 Hz current stimulation (r = .42, p = .01).

Studies consisting of fundamentally different designs have been labelled as home-based, making searching for relevant literature challenging and time consuming. This issue has been further highlighted by an increased demand for these programmes following the COVID-19 pandemic and associated government-imposed lockdowns. Purpose: To examine what specifically constitutes home-based exercise by: (1) developing definitions for a range of terms used when reporting exercise and physical activity programmes and (2) providing examples to contextualise these definitions for use when reporting exercise and physical activity programmes. Methods: A literature search was undertaken to identify previous attempts to define home-based exercise programmes. A working document, including initial definitions and examples were developed, which were then discussed between six experts for further refinement. Results: We generated definitions for universal key terms within three domains (and subdomains) of programme design: location (home-based, community/centre-based, or clinical setting), prescription (structured or unstructured) and delivery (supervised, facilitated, or unsupervised). Examples for possible combinations of design terms were produced.

Access to digital communications remains uneven, but the online environment provides an alternative, and at times a potentially preferable, research space. As Covid-19 has interrupted and disrupted the dominant assumption that qualitative research must be conducted in person, this paper outlines possibilities and reservations of online interpersonal methods. Though the standard ethical considerations of qualitative research hold true, we argue that these are necessary, but often inadequate, in the contexts of conducting online synchronous interpersonal research. Through centring relational and reflexive practice, we consider the associated pragmatic, methodological and ethical domains from feminist and virtualCmaterial positional perspectives. Unpacking the complexities and possibilities of researching digital environments, we present six guiding principles to inform ethically responsive, methodologically robust and pragmatically feasible approaches to conducting online interpersonal qualitative research.

The microarray dataset GSE265566 was employed to determine the expression of CHEK1 in CCA tissues. The relationship of miR-15a-5p with CHEK1 was analyzed using bioinformatics tools and dual-luciferase reporter assay. The particle size of HUCMSCs-exo was detected by scanning electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. The cellular and tumorous phenotypes were assessed through flow cytometry, CCK-8 assay, Transwell assay and the in vivo tumor xenograft experiments. CHEK1 was predicated to be markedly elevated in CCA. miR-15a-5p targeted CHEK1 and downregulated the expression of CHEK1. HUCMSCs-exo activated cell apoptosis but repressed the proliferative, invasive, and migratory potentials of CCA cells. After miR-15a-5p was silenced, HUCMSCs-exo presented an opposite effect in regulating CCA. Overexpression of miR-15a-5p promoted apoptosis but suppressed malignancy and tumorigenicity of CCA cells as well as EMT through downregulating CHEK1.

The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) primarily affects the respiratory system, so radiological diagnosis has been shown to be necessary. Chest computed tomography (CT) is to be shown the best modality in suspected COVID-19 cases for initial evaluation because CT findings may be present before the onset of symptoms. The aim of this study was to show different CT imaging features or patterns in COVID-19 patients with a different time course and disease severity. Methods. This prospective cohort study analysed 330 patients (the average age was 52.37 +/- 15.36) with confirmed COVID-19 via laboratory testing. During hospitalization, all patients included in the study underwent chest CT in order to assess the extent of changes in their lungs. COVID-19 patients, with a different time course and disease severity, were classified into four categories: lung, bronchial, pleural and mediastinal changes. Based on the time interval between the onset of symptoms and performed CT scan, all patients were divided into three groups: group 1 (CT scans done <= 1 week after symptom onset);group 2 (from > 1 to 2 weeks after symptom onset);group 3 (from > 2 weeks after symptom onset). In order to monitor the distribution of changes in the lungs more accurately, bilateral lungs were divided into 12 'lung zones. Each zone was assigned a CT score. Total severity score was calculated by summing the scores for each zone. Results. In 93.6% patients with COVID-19, the CT findings were positive. About 92.1% patients had multiple lesions. The lesions were bilateral in 87.6% of patients, localized both peripheral and centrally in 63.3% of patients, and occurred more frequently in posterior areas (93%), as well as in lower lung zones (91.2%). The average total severity score was 11.00 (7.00-16.00). The most common CT findings in all patients were the ground-glass opacities (97.7%), reticular pattern (91.3%), consolidation (71.5%) and fibrotic streaks (63.8%). In the group 1, changes on CT were found in 80.0%, in the group 2 in 95.0%, and in the group 3 in 99.4% of the patients. Conclusion. CT is proven to be a very important diagnostic method in COVID-19 patients, and together with clinical and laboratory findings, gives a complete picture of the patient's condition and contributes significantly to decision-making for further treatment.","output":"CT appearance in the 330 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Serbia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Little is known about the risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular disease after influenza infection in younger adults.

Methods We prospectively enrolled all patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in our ED from March 9, 2020 to April 4, 2020. We abstracted medical history, physical examination findings, and the clinical probability of COVID-19 (low, moderate, high) rated by emergency physicians depending on their clinical judgment. We assessed diagnostic accuracy of these characteristics for COVID-19 by calculating positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+/LR-).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional, retrospective analysis of a single-provider outpatient clinic across multiple satellites, consecutive patients returning for intravitreal injections (IVIs) of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor or corticosteroids were identified as delayed or undelayed during a six-week study interval during the COVID-19 pandemic that closely following a mandated period of prohibited elective encounters. A delayed encounter was defined as having a follow-up interval exceeding 33% of the recommended cycle. Patients seen for IVIs during the corresponding six-week interval a year previously were identified for study as pre-COVID-19 controls. Main outcome measures included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) assessment based on findings of intraretinal or subretinal fluid consistent with new or recurrent neovascular events. RESULTS: The study included 183 eyes of 144 patients who underwent IVI-based care from June 18, 2020, through August 7, 2020, compared to 193 eyes of 154 patients injected during the corresponding interval 1 year before. There were 62 eyes of 46 patients seen in the study period later than scheduled (among 144 patients of 183 eyes in total), which represented a larger proportion of delayed patients compared to the previous year (31.9% vs. 14.9%, p<0.0005). Considering the patterns from the control group, the attributed delay due to COVID-19 was 15.0% of patients. The delayed return eyes had a greater decline in BCVA (3 letters), higher rates of worsened OCT results (48%), and prompted reduction in previously prescribed injection intervals (p<0.02).

During the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19, as various anthropogenic activities are restricted, high-frequency ambient noise level has been observed to be reduced on a worldwide scale. The continuous waveform data at dense broadband seismic stations from ChinArray in eastern North China provides a good opportunity to study the temporal and spatial patterns of the ambient noise level in the region, and to further study the influencing factors, such as the topography and the population density. In this study, we calculated the average power spectral density of ambient noise at each station 90 days around the Spring Festival in 2019 and in 2020, analyzed the noise level at different stations through normal times, Spring Festivals, epidemic control period, and recovery period, and studied the influencing factors of the noise level. We found that normally high-frequency (1-10 Hz) ambient noise correlates well with the surrounding sedimentary thickness: The noise level is higher when the surrounding sedimentary layer is thicker and vice versa. It correlates moderately with local population density and is time-varying due to anthropogenic activities. During the Spring Festival in 2019 and in 2020, and the epidemic control period after the Spring Festival in 2020, the reduction extent of the noise level correlates moderately with both the sedimentary thickness and population density;the ambient noise level reduces more significantly to the south of 40 N than to the north of it in the study region.

Assessing the diagnostic performance of thorax CT in mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients was the purpose of our study. METHODS: Mildly symptomatic and clinically stable, suspected COVID-19 patients scanned with Thorax CTs between March 11, 2020, and April 13, 2020, were included in this study. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, positive and negative predictive values, and the respective accuracies were calculated for diagnostic purposes. RESULTS: Among the 1119 patients enrolled in our study, abnormal thorax CT scans were 527 out of which 363/527 (68.9%) had typical CT features for COVID-19. According to analysis of typical COVID findings, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negative predictive value, and the accuracy of Thorax CTs with were 51.45%, 86.07%, 78.24%, 64.55%, and 68.99%, respectively. When typical CT findings and atypical CT findings were combined for the statistical analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy observed 68.84%, 74%, and 71.49%. CONCLUSION: Diagnosing pneumonia can be challenging in mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients since the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction test results, when compared with symptoms are not always evident.

Our study which included the largest number of patients among all other similar studies indicates that not only typical but also atypical CT findings should be considered for an accured diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"Diagnostic performance of thorax CT in mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients: The importance of atypical CT findings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of severe acute respiratory virus (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by respiratory symptoms with serious consequences, mainly associated with pneumonia and extreme ARDS.

In early 2020, we saw an increase in panic buying as a response to a real and/or perceived lack of resources due to COVID-19. Although panic buying has a long history, there is a lack of literature to provide a psychological understanding of the phenomenon. During the early days of COVID-19 clients presented with fear and uncertainty. These negative emotions were, in part, a response to a real shortage of basic supplies. However, the panic response led to behaviors that, for some individuals, resulted in atypical buying patterns. From a therapeutic perspective, one can consider behavioral and psychodynamic explanations and interventions, and how this impacts the associated behaviors. This article will focus on psychodynamic understandings of panic buying as a response to events that result in negative emotions. By providing a psychodynamic understanding of panic buying, authors hope to contribute to the therapy of clients presenting with related behaviors and their associated negative affect.","output":"Understanding Panic Buying Through an Integrated Psychodynamic Lens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The identification of CD4+ T cell epitopes is instrumental for the design of subunit vaccines for broad protection against coronaviruses.

Most PA programs have shifted towards a video conference (VC) format, but this modality has been noted to flatten the social experience which is fundamental for lasting behavior change. Virtual reality (VR) is now designed for immersion and place-presence and may be better suited for instilling a feeling of social connection, which will likely improve physical function. The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences in physical function after a 4-week in-home VR or VC based PA intervention. Low-active adults (66.84.8 years) were randomized to VR (n=5) or VC (n=4) based PA counselling and instructed to find activities that were intrinsically motivating. VR participants were asked to select pre-approved available active games in addition to enjoyable real-world activities. ANCOVA models were used to explore group differences in six-minute walk distances across time. Results are reported using ^2 effect sizes based on the small sample size. After controlling for baseline values, the ANCOVA models revealed a moderate-to-large magnitude effect for distance traveled during the six-minute walk test (^2=.10). Additionally, the VR group participants walked 42.63 meters further, which approaches a clinically meaningful difference. These promising early findings suggest there is value to exploring the impact of VR-delivered, group-mediated activity promotion on physical functioning in older adults. Future research should investigate aspects of VR that promote increased social connection and physical function in the older adult population.","output":"The Effect of a Virtual Reality Delivered Physical Activity Intervention on the Physical Function of Older Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wood and wood-based composites are key engineering materials that can be successfully designed and manufactured with predetermined exploitation properties, making them suitable for a wide range of applications and end uses [...].","output":"New Challenges in Wood and Wood-Based Materials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the appearance of COVID-19 in China last December 2019, Italy was the first European country to be severely affected by the outbreak. The first diagnosis in Italy was on February 20, 2020, followed by the establishment of a light and a tight lockdown on February 23 and on March 8, 2020, respectively. The virus spread rapidly, particularly in the North of the country in the Padan Plain area, known as one of the most polluted regions in Europe. Air pollution has been recently hypothesized to enhance the clinical severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, acting through adverse effects on immunity, induction of respiratory and other chronic disease, upregulation of viral receptor ACE-2, and possible pathogen transportation as a virus carrier. We investigated the association between air pollution and subsequent COVID-19 mortality rates within two Italian regions (Veneto and Emilia-Romagna). We estimated ground-level nitrogen dioxide through its tropospheric levels using data available from the Sentinel satellites of the European Space Agency Copernicus program before the lockdown. We then examined COVID-19 mortality rates in relation to the nitrogen dioxide levels at three 14-day lag points after the lockdown, namely March 8, 22 and April 5. Using a multivariable negative binomial regression model, we found an association between nitrogen dioxide and COVID-19 mortality. Although ecological data provide only weak evidence, these findings indicate an association between air pollution levels and COVID-19 severity.","output":"Associations between mortality from COVID-19 in two Italian regions and outdoor air pollution as assessed through tropospheric nitrogen dioxide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The practices of head and neck surgical oncologists must evolve to meet the unprecedented needs placed on our health care system by the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic.

One measure, arrival quarantine, has not been studied as a modern military disease prevention strategy. This study aimed to determine the effect of a 14-day arrival quarantine on symptomatic COVID-19 testing. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study compared symptomatic COVID-19 testing among all trainees who entered Basic Military Training between March 17, 2020, and April 17, 2020, before the implementation of universal arrival COVID-19 testing, during their first 2 weeks in arrival quarantine compared to the rest of their training. Furthermore, symptomatic COVID-19 testing in the last 5 weeks of training in those who completed arrival quarantine was compared to testing in the last 5 weeks for trainees who arrived between February 16, 2020, and March 16, 2020, and did not undergo arrival quarantine. Nominal variables were compared by chi-square test, and continuous variables were compared by Mann-Whitney U test. This study was approved as a public health surveillance project by the 59th Medical Wing Institutional Review Board. RESULTS: Five thousand five hundred and seventy-six trainees started training between February 16, 2020, and April 17, 2020, with 2,573 trainees undergoing an arrival quarantine compared to 3,003 trainees who did not. Trainees who underwent arrival quarantine had higher rates of COVID-19 testing while in arrival quarantine (10.5 tests per 1,000 trainee-weeks vs. 2.3, P &#8804; .001) and higher rates of concomitant influenza testing (74% vs. 38%, P = .001) compared to after they completed quarantine. Trainees that completed quarantine had less symptomatic COVID-19 testing after day 14 of training (2.3 tests per 1,000 trainee-weeks vs. 14.3, P &#8804; .001) and influenza testing (38% vs. 74%, P = .001) compared to trainees that did not undergo arrival quarantine. CONCLUSION: Arrival quarantine appears to be an effective non-pharmaceutical intervention associated with fewer symptomatic COVID-19 tests, especially after completion of quarantine.","output":"Effect of Arrival Quarantine on Subsequent COVID-19 Testing in a Cohort of Military Basic Trainees"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak that emerged at the end of 2019 has affected more than 58 million people with more than 1.38 million deaths and has had an incalculable impact on the world .

Due to the serological and genomic diversity of VTEC, methods of detection for VTEC in food samples require detection of verotoxin or its gene vt (also known as stx ). The current taxonomy of vt identifies three vt1 (a,c,d) and seven vt2 (a to g) subtypes. PCR detection of vt is convenient and rapid, but protocols may not detect all currently identified variants or subtypes of vt . The Health Canada Compendium of Analytical Methods for the analysis of food for VTEC is MFLP-52. MFLP-52 includes a VT Screening PCR that is used to determine the presumptive presence of VTEC by the detection of vt in food enrichments, and to differentiate VTEC from other isolates. The VT Screening PCR was developed prior to the establishment of the current vt taxonomy. An evaluation of VT Screening PCR for detection of the ten established vt -subtypes was performed and it was discovered that the method could not detect subtypes vt1d and vt2f . Additional primers and a modified protocol were developed and the modified VT Screening PCR was tested against an inclusivity panel of 50 VTEC strains, including representatives of ten vt -subtypes, and an exclusivity panel of 30 vt negative E. coli from various sources, to ensure specificity. The reliability of MFLP-52 with the modified VT Screening PCR was assessed by analysis of four priority food matrices (ground beef, lettuce, cheese and apple cider) inoculated with a VTEC strain at 2 to 5 CFU per 25 g.

Nearly half of attendances to this ED are over the age of 65 years and there are over 80 nursing homes in the catchment area. A pilot study in January 2021 showed that nursing home attendances increased significantly during the third wave of COVID-19 with many of these attendances potentially avoidable and suitable for optimised care in the nursing home. The primary objective of this quality improvement project was to enhance the older persons care and experience when presenting to ED or being reviewed in the community with symptoms and signs of COVID-19. Secondary aims were reduced nursing home attendances to ED and subsequent admissions from these attendances. METHODS: A guideline was constructed based on the RCEM standard for Quality Care for Older People and using the HSE guidelines for managing COVID-19 in nursing home patients. The guideline was introduced to staff and implemented in ED and via the EDITH service. RESULTS: Two PDSA cycles were undertaken post guideline implementation. There were substantial improvements in the frequency of discussion and documentation of advanced directives with increased numbers of patients being discharged directly back to the nursing home or treated in the nursing home using the guideline. There was a decrease in the number of nursing home attendances throughout the project. CONCLUSION: This successful QIP shows the importance of manging older patients appropriately, while considering their wishes. Post-COVID work should centre on managing all older patients with optimised treatment and considering how they will benefit most from their attendance to ED.","output":"186 OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT OF COVID-19 IN NURSING HOME PATIENTS: A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT IN AN IRISH UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function V(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(O,[["render",V]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"doctor/60.md","filePath":"doctor/60.md"}'),R={name:"doctor/60.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
