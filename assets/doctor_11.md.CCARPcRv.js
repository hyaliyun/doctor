Collecting such datasets is time-consuming and expensive. Until now, very few annotated COVID-19 imaging datasets are available. Although self-supervised learning enables us to bootstrap the training by exploiting unlabeled data, the generic self-supervised methods for natural images do not sufficiently incorporate the context. For medical images, a desirable method should be sensitive enough to detect deviation from normal-appearing tissue of each anatomical region;here, anatomy is the context. We introduce a novel approach with two levels of self-supervised representation learning objectives: one on the regional anatomical level and another on the patient-level. We use graph neural networks to incorporate the relationship between different anatomical regions. The structure of the graph is informed by anatomical correspondences between each patient and an anatomical atlas. In addition, the graph representation has the advantage of handling any arbitrarily sized image in full resolution. Experiments on large-scale Computer Tomography (CT) datasets of lung images show that our approach compares favorably to baseline methods that do not account for the context. We use the learnt embedding to quantify the clinical progression of COVID-19 and show that our method generalizes well to COVID-19 patients from different hospitals.

As of September 12, 2020, it has turned into an epidemic outbreak with more than 29 million confirmed cases and around 1 million reported deaths worldwide. It has created an urgent need to monitor and forecast COVID-19 spread behavior to better control this spread. Among all the popular models for COVID-19 forecasting, statistical models are receiving much attention in media. However, statistical models are showing less accuracy for long term forecasting, as there is high level of uncertainty and required data is also not sufficiently available. In this paper, we propose a comparative analysis of deep learning models to forecast the COVID-19 outbreak as an alternative to statistical models. We propose a new Attention-based encoder-decoder model, named Attention-Long Short Term Memory (AttentionLSTM). LSTM based neural network layer architecture incorporates the idea of fine-grained attention mechanism i.e., attention on hidden state dimensions instead of hidden state vector itself, which is capable of highlighting the importance and contribution of each hidden state dimension. It helps in detection on crucial temporal information, resulting in a highly interpretable network. Additionally, we implement a learnable vector embedding for time. As, time in a vector representation can be easily added with many architectures. This vector representation is called Time2Vec. We have used COVID-19 data repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University to assess the proposed model's performance.

Participants were 882 Spanish community-dwelling adults over 60 years of age. Sociodemographic characteristics, characteristics related to the coronavirus, self-perceived health, family function, avoidance, depression and anxiety were analyzed. Data suggest a buffering effect of family function on anxiety and depression during the pandemic. Furthermore, being unmarried or a female, greater fear of COVID-19, worse self-perceived health, greater avoidance, and worse family function were associated with higher levels of anxiety. Likewise, greater fear of COVID-19, poorer self-perceived health, greater avoidance, and poorer family function, were associated with greater depression.

Like other tourist destinations, the tourist villages are also forced to close all their activities. Inevitably, they have suffered many losses, and thousands of residents have lost their jobs. But in the midst of uncertainty, the tourist villages still have a way to survive and show resilience. Resilience both individually and organisationally will always be formed in and through communicative processes that enhance the ability to create a new normal. The important issue is how communication can improve the resilience of individuals and groups of rural tourism actors during the Covid-19 pandemic. This research was conducted in Nglanggeran Village, Yogyakarta. Yogyakarta is one of the priority tourism destinations in Indonesia and now has around 150 tourist villages. By using Buzzanells communication theory of resilience framework, the data of the research were collected through in-depth interviewing with a number of tourist village actors in Nglanggeran Village, Yogyakarta Province. They were analysed by using Creswell's data analysis spiral, consisting of reading-memoing, describing-classifying, interpreting, and representing-visualising stages.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The Pipeline was implanted in a total of 45 patients (mean age, 58 years; M:F=10:35) with 47 large/giant or fusiform aneurysms. We retrospectively evaluated the characteristics of the treated aneurysms, the periprocedural events, morbidity and mortality, and the early outcomes after Pipeline implantation. RESULTS The aneurysms were located in the internal carotid artery (ICA) cavernous segment (n=25), ICA intradural segment (n=11), vertebrobasilar trunk (n=8), and middle cerebral artery (n=3). Procedure-related events occurred in 18 cases, consisting of incomplete expansion (n=8), shortening-migration (n=5), transient occlusion of a jailed branch (n=3), and in-stent thrombosis (n=2). Treatment-related morbidity occurred in two patients, but without mortality. Both patients had modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores of 2, but had an improved mRS score of 0 at 1-month follow-up. Of the 19 patients presenting with mass effect, 16 improved but three showed no changes in their presenting symptoms. All patients had excellent outcomes (mRS, 0 or 1) during the follow-up period (median, 6 months; range, 2-30 months). Vascular imaging follow-up (n=31, 65.9%; median, 3 months, range, 1-25 months) showed complete or near occlusion of the aneurysm in 24 patients (77.4%) and decreased sac size in seven patients (22.6%).

SUMMARY: A retrospective chart review of 8 adults on warfarin admitted to Michigan Medicine with COVID-19 infection was conducted and reported as a case series. Outcomes of interest were difference in average daily dose of warfarin prior to admission (PTA) and while inpatient (IP), warfarin sensitivity, time in therapeutic range (TTR), confirmed or suspected thromboembolic event, any major or clinically significant bleeding episodes, and in-hospital mortality. IP average daily warfarin doses were lower when compared to PTA average daily doses [1.3 mg (1.3) vs. 6.2 mg (4.1)]. The mean percentage decrease in dose was 68.8% (23) and the mean absolute dose difference was 4.8 mg (4.3). Mean IP percentage tests in range was 30.8% (24.6) and mean IP warfarin sensitivity was 4.2 (3.8), both of which differed from PTA TTR and warfarin sensitivity for those with data available (n = 3, n = 6, respectively).

On average, the participants completed 67% (34.4/51.5 days) of all active daily assessments and 74% (38/51.5 days) of all passive measures. Furthermore, all 23 participants completed the 3 required visits with the research team. Predictive correlations were found between self-reported mood and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score at follow-up, self-reported anxiety and EDPS, and sleep quality and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. CONCLUSIONS: Using ecological momentary assessment to track daily symptoms of postpartum depression using a wearable device was largely endorsed as acceptable and clinically useful by participants and the study clinician and could be an innovative solution to increase care access during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"App-Based Ecological Momentary Assessment to Enhance Clinical Care for Postpartum Depression: Pilot Acceptability Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: A simple, patient-specific biomechanical model (PSBM) is proposed in which the main surgical tools and actions can be simulated, which enables clinicians to evaluate different strategies for an optimal surgical planning. A prospective and comparative clinical study was performed to assess early clinical and radiological results. METHODS: From January 2019 to July 2019, a PSBM was created for every operated acetabular fracture (simulation group). DICOM data were extracted from the pre-operative high-resolution CT scans to build a 3D model of the fracture using segmentation methods. A PSBM was implemented in a custom software allowing a biomechanical simulation of the surgery in terms of reduction sequences. From July 2019 to December 2019, every patient with an operated for acetabular fracture without PSBM was included in the standard group. Surgery duration, blood loss, radiological results and per-operative complications were recorded and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were included, 10 in the simulation group and 12 in the standard group. The two groups were comparable regarding age, time to surgery, fracture pattern distribution and surgical approaches. The mean operative time was significantly lower in the simulation group: 113 min  33 (60-180) versus 184  58 (90-260), p = 0.04. The mean blood loss was significantly lower in the simulation group, p = 0.01. No statistical significant differences were found regarding radiological results (p = 0.16). No per-operative complications were recorded. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that pre-operative planning in acetabular surgery based on a PSBM results in a shorter operative time and a reduction of blood loss during surgery. This study also confirms the feasibility of PSBM planning in daily clinical routine.

The relative contribution of viral transmission via fomites is still unclear. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to survive on inanimate surfaces for several days, yet the factors that determine its survival on surfaces are not well understood. Here we combine microscopy imaging with virus viability assays to study survival of three bacteriophages suggested as good models for human respiratory pathogens: the enveloped Phi6 (a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2), and the non-enveloped PhiX174 and MS2. We measured virus viability in human saliva microdroplets, SM buffer, and water following deposition on glass surfaces at various relative humidities (RH). Although saliva microdroplets dried out rapidly at all tested RH levels (unlike SM that remained hydrated at RH  57%), survival of all three viruses in dry saliva microdroplets was significantly higher than in water or SM. Thus, RH and hydration conditions are not sufficient to explain virus survival, indicating that the suspended medium, and association with saliva components in particular, likely affect physicochemical properties that determine virus survival. The observed high virus survival in dry saliva deposited on surfaces, under a wide range of RH levels, can have profound implications for human public health, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Virus survival in evaporated saliva microdroplets deposited on inanimate surfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an unprecedented upheaval within global healthcare systems and resulted in the temporary pausing of the National Health Service (NHS) Scotland Cervical Screening Programme. With several months of backlogs in appointments, there has not only been a reduction in primary samples being taken for human papilloma virus (HPV) testing but there have also been fewer women referred to colposcopy for investigation and treatment of precancerous or cancerous changes as a result. Encouraging uptake for cervical screening was always a priority before the pandemic, but it is even more important now, considering that the fears and barriers to screening that women may have are now exacerbated by COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: This article explores the impact of the pandemic on the uptake of cervical screening within NHS Ayrshire & Arran and evaluates potential strategies to improve uptake now and in future such as self-sampling and telemedicine. METHODS: This article presents evidence-based literature and local health board data relating to cervical screening during the pandemic. RESULTS: Human papilloma virus self-sampling carried out by the woman in her home has been shown to improve uptake, especially in non-attenders, whilst maintaining a high sensitivity and, crucially, reducing the need for face-to-face contact. Increased education is key to overcoming barriers women have to screening and telemedicine can strengthen engagement with women during this time.

Our study demonstrated that mixtures of natural antimicrobials, such AuraShield L, can prevent in vitro viral infection of cell cultures. Secondly, in vivo, the efficiency of vaccination was improved by preventing secondary viral infections through a mechanism involving significant increases in SCFA production and increased IgA levels.

Reports from China and Italy suggest that risk factors for severe disease include older age and the presence of at least one of several underlying health conditions (3,4). U.S. older adults, including those aged 65 years and particularly those aged 85 years, also appear to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19-associated outcomes; however, data describing underlying health conditions among U.S. COVID-19 patients have not yet been reported (5).

We compared the response of human and bat cells to poly(I:C), a viral double-stranded RNA surrogate. We measured transcripts for several inflammatory, interferon and interferon stimulated genes using quantitative real-time PCR and observed that human and bat cells both, when stimulated with poly(I:C), contained higher levels of transcripts for interferon beta than unstimulated cells. In contrast, only human cells expressed robust amount of RNA for TNF, a cell signaling protein involved in systemic inflammation.

METHODS Using a retrospective, nonexperimental design, we sought to compare characteristics of Appalachian rural and urban children younger than 21 years enrolled in the Medicaid hospice benefit. Descriptive statistics were calculated on the demographic, hospice, and clinical characteristics of children from Appalachia. Comparisons were calculated using Pearson 2 for proportions and the Student t test for means. RESULTS Less than half of the 1788 Appalachian children admitted to hospice care resided in rural areas (40%). Compared with children in urban areas of Appalachia, rural children were significantly younger (8 years vs 9.5 years) and more often had a complex chronic condition (56.0% vs 35.1%) and comorbidities (38.5% vs 17.0%) with technology dependence (32.6% vs 17.0%). Children in rural Appalachian were commonly from communities in the southern region of Appalachia (27.9% vs <10.0%), with median household incomes <$50,000/year (96.7% vs 22.4%). Significant differences were present in clinical care between rural and urban Appalachian children. Rural children had longer lengths of stay in hospice care (38 days vs 11 days) and were less likely to use the emergency department during hospice admission (19.0% vs 43.0%). These children more often visited their primary care provider (49.9% vs 31.3%) and sought care for symptoms from nonhospice providers (18.1% vs 10.0%) while admitted to hospice. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that children admitted to hospice care in rural versus urban Appalachia have distinct characteristics. Rural children are admitted to hospice care with significant medical complexities and reside in areas of poverty. Hospice care for rural children suggests a continuity of care with longer hospice stays and fewer transitions to the emergency department; however, the potential for care fragmentation is present, with frequent visits to primary care and nonhospice providers for symptom management. Understanding the unique characteristics of children in Appalachia may be essential for advancing knowledge and care for these children at the end of life.

Identification of this subgroup of patients was crucial for early aggressive intervention to improve survival. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether computer tomography (CT) - derived measurements of body composition such as myosteatosis indicating fat deposition inside the muscles could be used to predict the risk of transition to severe illness in patients with initial diagnosis of mild COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection presenting initially as having the mild common-subtype illness were retrospectively recruited between January 21, 2020 and February 19, 2020. CT-derived body composition measurements were obtained from the initial chest CT images at the level of the twelfth thoracic vertebra (T12) and were used to build models to predict the risk of transition. A myosteatosis nomogram was constructed using multivariate logistic regression incorporating both clinical variables and myosteatosis measurements. The performance of the prediction models was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve including the area under the curve (AUC). The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by discrimination, calibration curve, and decision curve. RESULTS: A total of 234 patients were included in this study. Thirty-one of the enrolled patients transitioned to severe illness. Myosteatosis measurements including SM-RA (skeletal muscle radiation attenuation) and SMFI (skeletal muscle fat index) score fitted with SMFI, age and gender, were significantly associated with risk of transition for both the training and validation cohorts (P < 0.01). The nomogram combining the SM-RA, SMFI score and clinical model improved prediction for the transition risk with an AUC of 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75 to 0.95] for the training cohort and 0.84 [95% CI, 0.71 to 0.97] for the validation cohort, as compared to the nomogram of the clinical model with AUC of 0.75 and 0.74 for the training and validation cohorts respectively. Favorable clinical utility was observed using decision curve analysis. CONCLUSION: We found CT-derived measurements of thoracic myosteatosis to be associated with higher risk of transition to severe illness in patients affected by COVID-19 who presented initially as having the mild common-subtype infection.

Anosmia/ageusia (i.e. loss of smell/loss of taste) was reported less frequently (16%) than other symptoms by HCWs with positive assays, but was associated with more than a seven-fold multivariate-adjusted odds of a positive test: OR = 7.21 (95% CI: 2.95-17.67). Of 509 HCWs with initial negative SARS-CoV-2 assays, nine had symptom progression and positive re-tests, yielding an estimated negative predictive value of 98.2% (95% CI: 96.8-99.0%) for the exclusion of clinically relevant COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom and temperature reports are useful screening tools for predicting SARS-CoV-2 assay results in HCWs. Anosmia/ageusia, fever, and myalgia were the strongest independent predictors of positive assays. The absence of symptoms or symptoms limited to nasal congestion/sore throat were associated with negative assays.","output":"COVID-19 symptoms predictive of healthcare workers' SARS-CoV-2 PCR results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health threat. Smoking and smoking-related lung diseases are risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection. This study investigated whether low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan results affected the success of 1-year smoking cessation. The Gyeonggi Southern Smoking Support Center performed the residential smoking cessation program from January to December 2018. During the program, LDCT was performed on 292 participants; 6 months later, follow-up via telephone or visit was conducted. Among the 179 participants who succeeded in smoking cessation for 6 months, telephone follow-up was conducted to determine whether there was a 12-month continuous smoking cessation. In order to evaluate the association between LDCT results and 12-month continuous abstinence rate (CAR), logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The CARs at 6 and 12 months were 61.3% and 31.5%, respectively. Indeterminate or suspicious malignant lung nodules were associated with a higher 12-month CAR (OR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.15C7.98), whereas psychiatric history was associated with a lower 12-month CAR (OR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.03C0.15).

To examine the role of CCL2 during virus infection, we infected mice transgenically expressing CCL2 in the central nervous system (CCL2 Tg) with an attenuated neurotropic coronavirus (rJ2.2 strain of mouse hepatitis virus). Infection of wild-type mice with rJ2.2 results in mild acute encephalitis, followed by a nonlethal, chronic demyelinating disease. Proinflammatory innate and adaptive immune responses mediate virus clearance. In marked contrast, CCL2 Tg mice infected with rJ2.2 ineffectively cleared virus and rapidly succumbed to the infection. CCL2 Tg mice mounted a dysregulated immune response, characterized by augmented accumulation of regulatory Foxp3(+)CD4(+) T cells and of nitric-oxide- and YM-1-expressing macrophages and microglia, suggestive of mixed M1/M2 macrophage activation. Further, macrophages from infected CCL2 Tg brains relative to non-Tg controls were less activated/mature, expressing lower levels of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II), CD86, and CD40. Collectively, these results show that persistent CCL2 overexpression establishes and sustains an immunological milieu that is both inflammatory and immunosuppressive and predisposes mice to a defective immune response to a minimally lethal virus.","output":"Transgenic CCL2 expression in the central nervous system results in a dysregulated immune response and enhanced lethality after coronavirus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The overload of healthcare systems around the world and the danger of infection have limited the ability of researchers to obtain sufficient and reliable data on psychopathology in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

Early data suggest elevated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, but relationships to disease phenotype and downstream regulators of inflammation in the Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) are unknown. We aimed to determine the relationship between RAS gene expression relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung with disease characteristics in COPD, and the regulation of newly identified SARS-CoV-2 receptors and spike-cleaving proteases, important for SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We quantified gene expression using RNA sequencing of epithelial brushings and bronchial biopsies from 31 COPD and 37 control subjects. RESULTS: ACE2 gene expression (log2-fold change (FC)) was increased in COPD compared to ex-smoking (HV-ES) controls in epithelial brushings (0.25, p = 0.042) and bronchial biopsies (0.23, p = 0.050), and correlated with worse lung function (r = - 0.28, p = 0.0090). ACE2 was further increased in frequent exacerbators compared to infrequent exacerbators (0.51, p = 0.00045) and associated with use of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) (0.50, p = 0.0034), having cardiovascular disease (0.23, p = 0.048) or hypertension (0.34, p = 0.0089), and inhaled corticosteroid use in COPD subjects in bronchial biopsies (0.33, p = 0.049).

However, the AGTR1:2 ratio was increased in COPD subjects compared with HV-ES controls, log2FC of 0.57 (p = 0.0051).

How to best deliver behavioral recommendations and health outcomes in messaging is an important issue. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to disaggregate the effects of gain-framed and loss-framed messages on cancer prevention and detection behaviors and intentions and attitudes, which has the potential to inform cancer control programs. METHODS: A search of three electronic databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed) was conducted for studies published between January 2000 and December 2020. After a good agreement achieved on a sample by two authors, the article selection (=0.8356), quality assessment (=0.8137), and data extraction (=0.9804) were mainly performed by one author. The standardized mean difference (attitude and intention) and the odds ratio (behaviors) were calculated to evaluate the effectiveness of message framing (gain-framed message and loss-framed message). Calculations were conducted, and figures were produced by Review Manager 5.3. RESULTS: The title and abstract of 168 unique citations were scanned, of which 53 were included for a full-text review. A total of 24 randomized controlled trials were included, predominantly examining message framing on cancer prevention and detection behavior change interventions. There were 9 studies that used attitude to predict message framing effect and 16 studies that used intention, whereas 6 studies used behavior to examine the message framing effect directly. The use of loss-framed messages improved cancer detection behavior (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64-0.90; P=.001), and the results from subgroup analysis indicated that the effect would be weak with time. No effect of framing was found when effectiveness was assessed by attitudes (prevention: SMD=0.02, 95% CI C0.13 to 0.17; P=.79; detection: SMD=C0.05, 95% CI C0.15 to 0.05; P=.32) or intentions (prevention: SMD=C0.05, 95% CI C0.19 to 0.09; P=.48; detection: SMD=0.02, 95% CI C0.26 to 0.29; P=.92) among studies encouraging cancer prevention and cancer detection. CONCLUSIONS: Research has shown that it is almost impossible to change people's attitudes or intentions about cancer prevention and detection with a gain-framed or loss-framed message. However, loss-framed messages have achieved preliminary success in persuading people to adopt cancer detection behaviors.

As a result, many applications are memory bound, i.e., they are bottlenecked by the movement of data from main memory to compute units. One way to address this issue is through data prefetching, which relies on accurate prediction of memory accesses. While recent deep learning models have performed well on sequence prediction problems, they are far too heavy in terms of model size and inference latency to be practical for data prefetching. Here, we propose extremely compact LSTM models that can predict the next memory access with high accuracy. Prior LSTM based work on access prediction has used orders of magnitude more parameters and developed one model for each application (trace). While one (specialized) model per application can result in more accuracy, it is not a scalable approach. In contrast, our models can predict for a class of applications by trading off specialization at the cost of few retraining steps at runtime, for a more generalizable compact meta-model. Our experiments on 13 benchmark applications demonstrate that three compact meta-models can obtain accuracy close to specialized models using few batches of retraining for majority of the applications.","output":"MemMAP: Compact and Generalizable Meta-LSTM Models for Memory Access Prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research uncovers the impact of a multifaceted crisis on consumers' immediate shopping behaviors, short\\\\term financial spending, and long\\\\term shopping and spending responses.

This study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse the association between cognitive impairment and medication non-adherence in stroke. METHODS A systematic literature search of longitudinal and cross-sectional studies of adults with any stroke type, which reported on the association between any measure of non-adherence and cognitive impairment, was carried out according to PRISMA guidelines. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were the primary measure of effect. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Bias Methods Group's Tool to Assess Risk of Bias in Cohort Studies, with evidence quality assessed according to the GRADE approach. We conducted sensitivity analyses according to measure of cognitive impairment, measure of medication adherence, population, risk of bias and adjustment for covariates. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO. RESULTS From 1,760 titles and abstracts, we identified 9 studies for inclusion. Measures of cognitive impairment varied from dementia diagnosis to standardised cognitive assessments. Medication adherence was assessed through self-report or administrative databases. The majority of studies were of medium risk of bias (n = 6); two studies had low risk of bias. Findings were mixed; when all studies were pooled, there was no evidence of an association between cognitive impairment and medication non-adherence post-stroke [OR (95% CI): 0.85 (0.66, 1.03)]. However, heterogeneity was substantial [I2 = 90.9%, p < .001], and the overall evidence quality was low.

As almost all higher organisms, Ips acuminatus harbours a microbiome, although the role of most members of its microbiome is not well understood. As part of a work in which we analysed the bacterial diversity associated to Ips acuminatus, we isolated the strain Arthrobacter sp. IA7. In order to study its potential role within the bark beetle holobiont, we sequenced and explored its genome and performed a pan-genome analysis of the genus Arthrobacter, showing specific genes of strain IA7 that might be related with its particular role in its niche. Based on these investigations, we suggest several potential roles of the bacterium within the beetle. Analysis of genes related to secondary metabolism indicated potential antifungal capability, confirmed by the inhibition of several entomopathogenic fungal strains (Metarhizium anisopliae CCF0966, Lecanicillium muscarium CCF6041, L. muscarium CCF3297, Isaria fumosorosea CCF4401, I. farinosa CCF4808, Beauveria bassiana CCF4422 and B. brongniartii CCF1547). Phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA gene, six concatenated housekeeping genes (tuf-secY-rpoB-recA-fusA-atpD) and genome sequences indicated that strain IA7 is closely related to A. globiformis NBRC 12137T but forms a new species within the genus Arthrobacter; this was confirmed by digital DNA-DNA hybridization (37.10%) and average nucleotide identity (ANIb) (88.9%). Based on phenotypic and genotypic features, we propose strain IA7T as the novel species Arthrobacter ipsi sp. nov.

We sought to explore the impact of lockdown on glycaemia and whether this is sustained following easing of restrictions. METHODS: Retrospective, observational analysis in adults and children with type 1 diabetes attending a UK specialist centre, using real-time or intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring. Data from the following 28-day time periods were collected: (i) pre-lockdown; (ii) during lockdown; (iii) immediately after lockdown; and (iv) a month following relaxation of restrictions (coinciding with Government-subsidised restaurant food). Data were analysed for times in glycaemic ranges and are expressed as median (IQR). RESULTS: 145 adults aged 35.5 (25.8C51.3) years with diabetes duration of 19.0 (7.0C29.0) years on multiple daily injections of insulin (60%) and continuous insulin infusion (40%) were included. In adults, % time in range (70-180mg/dL) increased during lockdown (60.2 (45.2C69.3)%) compared to pre-lockdown (56.7 (43.5C65.3)%; p<0.001). This was maintained in the post-lockdown time periods. Similarly, % time above range (>180mg/dL) reduced in lockdown compared to pre-lockdown (p = 0.01), which was sustained thereafter. In children, no significant changes to glycaemia were observed during lockdown.

Despite a nationwide mask mandate in Kenya during the pandemic, proper masking remained low in Siaya County. We conducted a pilot study with the Siaya County Ministry of Health to improve mask adoption within Ugunja subcounty, and present initial findings on mask usage effects. Methods: The study took place across 72 villages in Ugunja subcounty, which were randomly assigned to receive: (i) free mask and education on mask usage; (ii) only education on mask usage; or (iii) no mask or education by community health workers. A role model intervention was also cross-randomized across half of the villages, along with SMS messages reinforcing a variety of messages around masking. The intervention was administered in January 2021. Data collection was done via phone survey and direct observation of mask usage. Findings: Preliminary analysis of the pilot study suggests providing free face masks may improve compliance, particularly in settings with higher COVID-19 risks. Two weeks to three months after the intervention, the free mask and education arm increased directly-observed correct mask usage by 3.1 percentage points (95% confidence interval 1.9, 6.0) on a control mean of 6.8 percent.

BACKGROUND Patients in cardiogenic shock with severe MR have a poor prognosis in the setting of conventional medical therapy. Because of its favorable safety profile, TMVr is being increasingly used as an acute therapy in this population, though its efficacy remains unknown. METHODS A multicenter, collaborative, patient-level analysis was conducted. Patients with cardiogenic shock and moderate to severe (3+) or severe (4+) MR who were not surgical candidates were treated with TMVr. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality Secondary outcomes included 90-day mortality, heart failure (HF) hospitalization, and the combined event rate of 90-day mortality and HF hospitalization following dichotomization by TMVr device success. RESULTS Between January 2011 and February 2019, 141 patients across 14 institutions met the inclusion criteria. In-hospital mortality occurred in 22 patients (15.6%), at 90 days in 38 patients (29.5%), and at one year in 55 patients (42.6%). Median length of hospital stay following TMVr was 10 days (interquartile range: 6 to 20 days). HF hospitalization occurred in 26 patients (18.4%) at a median of 73 days (interquartile range: 26 to 546 days). When stratified by TMVr procedural results, successful TMVr reduced rates of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13 to 0.98; p = 0.04), 90-day mortality (HR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.78; p = 0.01), and the composite of 90-day mortality and HF hospitalization (HR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.90; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS TMVr may improve short- and intermediate-term mortality in high-risk patients with cardiogenic shock and moderate to severe MR.

It is therefore prudent to continue designing and testing vaccines against this pathogen. In this article we computationally designed two candidate vaccines, one monopeptide and one multipeptide, using a technique involving optimizing lambda-superstrings, which was introduced and developed by our research group. We tested the monopeptide vaccine, thus establishing a proof of concept for the validity of the technique. We synthesized a peptide of 22 amino acids in length, corresponding to one of the candidate vaccines, and prepared a dendritic cell (DC) vaccine vector loaded with the 22 amino acids SARS-CoV-2 peptide (positions 50-71) contained in the NTD domain (DC-CoVPSA) of the Spike protein. Next, we tested the immunogenicity, the type of immune response elicited, and the cytokine profile induced by the vaccine, using a non-related bacterial peptide as negative control. Our results indicated that the CoVPSA peptide of the Spike protein elicits noticeable immunogenicity in vivo using a DC vaccine vector and remarkable cellular and humoral immune responses. This DC vaccine vector loaded with the NTD peptide of the Spike protein elicited a predominant Th1-Th17 cytokine profile, indicative of an effective anti-viral response. Finally, we performed a proof of concept experiment in humans that included the following groups: asymptomatic non-active COVID-19 patients, vaccinated volunteers, and control donors that tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. The positive control was the current receptor binding domain epitope of COVID-19 RNA-vaccines. We successfully developed a vaccine candidate technique involving optimizing lambda-superstrings and provided proof of concept in human subjects. We conclude that it is a valid method to decipher the best epitopes of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to prepare peptide-based vaccines for different vector platforms, including DC vaccines.","output":"First computational design using lambda-superstrings and in vivo validation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Covid-19 is now global concern and widely spread to the world due to high mortality among the nations we tried to evaluate the efficacy of methylprednisolone pulse in COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory failure.

METHODS Within a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial with independent clinical event adjudication and angiographic and wound core laboratories 358 CLI patients were randomized 2:1 to IA-DEB or PTA. The 2 coprimary efficacy endpoints through 12 months were clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) and late lumen loss (LLL). The primary safety endpoint through 6 months was a composite of all-cause mortality, major amputation, and CD-TLR. RESULTS Clinical characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. Significant baseline differences between the IA-DEB and PTA arms included mean lesion length (10.2 cm vs. 12.9 cm; p = 0.002), impaired inflow (40.7% vs. 28.8%; p = 0.035), and previous target limb revascularization (32.2% vs. 21.8%; p = 0.047).

METHODS Using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, clinical data of patients who underwent elective open and laparoscopic surgery (lap) for diverticulitis from 2002 to 2007 were collected and analyzed. Patients who underwent emergent surgery were excluded. RESULTS A total of 124,734 patients underwent elective surgery for diverticulitis: open, 110,172 (88.3%); lap, 14,562 (11.7%). The overall intraoperative complication rate was significantly lower in the laparoscopy group (0.63% vs. 1.15%, P < 0.01). However, there was no significant difference observed in ureteral injury between groups (open, 0.17%; lap, 0.12%, P = 0.15). All evaluated postoperative complications (ileus, abdominal abscess, leak, wound infection, bowel obstruction, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, respiratory failure, venous thromboembolism) were significantly higher for the open procedures. The laparoscopy group had a shorter mean hospital stay (lap, 5.06 days; open, 6.68 days, P < 0.01) and lower total hospital charges (lap, $36,389; open, $39,406, P < 0.01) than the open group. Also, mortality was four times higher in the open group (open, 0.54%; lap, 0.13%, P < 0.01).

AIMS: We conducted a qualitative study with individual semi-structured interviews with MHPs, as part of a wider feasibility study. METHOD: Participants were mental health professionals (therapists and supervisors) from two UK NHS sites delivering manualised behavioural activation for young people. Data were analysed with an inductive followed by deductive approach, applying the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to understand key influences on practice change. Identified domains were mapped onto possible behaviour change techniques (BCTs) to support implementation, using the Theory and Techniques Tool (TTT). RESULTS: Nine MHPs were interviewed. Thirteen of fourteen TDF domains were relevant, including perceived professional identity, beliefs about own capabilities and perceived positive or negative consequences of using manualised behavioural activation, social influences, memory and attention, and environmental resources. Fourteen theory-linked BCTs were identified as possible strategies to help clinicians overcome barriers (e.g. integrating behavioural practice/rehearsal, prompts and persuasive communications within training, and supervision).

The lack of single, comprehensive, national STEMI registry complicates our ability to improve STEMI outcomes in particular for high-risk STEMI subsets such as cardiac arrest (CA) and/or cardiogenic shock (CS). OBJECTIVES: To address this need, the Midwest STEMI Consortium (MSC) was created as a collaboration of 4 large, regional STEMI care systems to provide a comprehensive, multicenter, and prospective STEMI registry without any exclusionary criteria. METHODS: The MSC is a collaboration of 4 large, regional STEMI care systems: Iowa Heart Center in Des Moines, IA; Minneapolis Heart Institute Foundation in Minneapolis, MN; Prairie Heart Institute in Springfield, IL; and The Christ Hospital in Cincinnati, OH. Each has similar standardized STEMI protocol and together include 6 percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)-capable hospitals and over 100 non-PCI-capable hospitals. Each center had a prospective database that was transferred to a data coordinating center to create the multicenter database. The comprehensive database includes traditional risk factors, cardiovascular history, medications, time to treatment data, detailed angiographic characteristics, and short- and long-term clinical outcomes up to 5-year for myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Ten-year mortality rates were assessed by using national death index.

Various policies and mechanisms have been put in place in an attempt to maintain national geographical coverage with access points while increasing the financial viability of the network. One such mechanism is represented by the six official criteria for access to post offices, expressed as a percentage of the UK population living within one mile, three miles, and six miles of a post office. The method for calculating compliance with these access criteria is not published. Nor will any granular results be published, but only an annual statement that the criteria are being met. This article examines geographical and temporal access to post offices in order to understand the territorial coverage of the network and the impact this has on the provision of basic banking services. The area under investigation is Wales, for which we are reviewing the Government's official access criteria. Through the Post Office Ltd website, we are collecting up-to-date information on the locations and opening hours of post offices in Wales. In addition, a detailed population grid is combined with calculated areas of equidistant geographical access, called isochrones, to determine the number of people who have access to the post office network. The isochrones are based on the Welsh road network and are calculated for different travel modes and thresholds using a powerful routing engine.

Although the molecular consequences of SUMO attachment are difficult to predict, the underlying principle of SUMOylation is altering inter- and/or intramolecular interactions of the modified substrate, changing localization, stability, and/or activity. Unsurprisingly, many different pathogens have evolved to exploit the cellular SUMO modification system due to its functional flexibility and far-reaching functional downstream consequences. Although the extensive knowledge gained so far is impressive, a definitive conclusion about the role of SUMO modification during virus infection in general remains elusive and is still restricted to a few, yet promising concepts. Based on the available data, this review aims, first, to provide a detailed overview of the current state of knowledge and, second, to evaluate the currently known common principles/molecular mechanisms of how human pathogenic microbes, especially viruses and their regulatory proteins, exploit the host cell SUMO modification system.","output":"Human pathogens and the host cell SUMOylation system."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the huge spike in the COVID-19 cases across the globe and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test remains a key component for rapid and accurate detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The dissemination of misleading information regarding the efficacy of certain drugs or substances for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 has been the major contributing factor for this phenomenon. Alongside with the increase in self-medication behavior, the inherent risks to this act such as drugCdrug interactions, adverse events, drug toxicity, and masking of symptoms have also increased. Self-medication in the context of COVID-19 has led to drug misuse leading in some cases to the development of fatal adverse drug reactions. It is important that during this ongoing pandemic drugs with potential clinical efficacy against COVID-19 are adequately analyzed regarding their efficacy, safety, and monitoring. The aim of this review is to describe the available evidence regarding the efficacy, safety, and monitoring of the drugs and substances that have been shown to be frequently used for self-medication in patients with COVID-19 (hydroxychloroquine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ivermectin, azithromycin, vitamins, aspirin, and chlorine dioxide) to adequately characterize their risks, safe use, monitoring strategies, and to reinforce the concept that these substances should not be used for self-medication and require a medical prescription. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Drug safety of frequently used drugs and substances for self-medication in COVID-19 Dissemination of information about potential COVID-19 treatments has led individuals to self-medicate and expose themselves to risks such as drugCdrug interactions, side effects, antibiotic resistance, and misdiagnosis. There is a need to review the medical literature to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drugs and substances commonly used by the population for the treatment and prevention of SARS CoV-2 infection. In this review, we included drugs that are frequently used for self-medication and commonly advertised such as ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, chlorine dioxide, azithromycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, among others. A brief introduction of the drug and its mechanism of action, followed by a summary of the efficacy in COVID-19 and safety, will be described for each drug in order to promote their responsible use.","output":"Drug safety of frequently used drugs and substances for self-medication in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Apart from causing a global pandemic, COVID-19 has also affected many industries worldwide, causing the economic position of businesses to weaken.

METHODS: We conducted a study involving adults (50 years of age) with Covid-19Clike illness who underwent molecular testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We assessed 41,552 admissions to 187 hospitals and 21,522 visits to 221 emergency departments or urgent care clinics during the period from January 1 through June 22, 2021, in multiple states. The patients vaccination status was documented in electronic health records and immunization registries. We used a test-negative design to estimate vaccine effectiveness by comparing the odds of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinated patients with those among unvaccinated patients. Vaccine effectiveness was adjusted with weights based on propensity-for-vaccination scores and according to age, geographic region, calendar time (days from January 1, 2021, to the index date for each medical visit), and local virus circulation. RESULTS: The effectiveness of full messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination (14 days after the second dose) was 89% (95% confidence interval [CI], 87 to 91) against laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to hospitalization, 90% (95% CI, 86 to 93) against infection leading to an ICU admission, and 91% (95% CI, 89 to 93) against infection leading to an emergency department or urgent care clinic visit. The effectiveness of full vaccination with respect to a Covid-19Cassociated hospitalization or emergency department or urgent care clinic visit was similar with the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines and ranged from 81% to 95% among adults 85 years of age or older, persons with chronic medical conditions, and Black or Hispanic adults. The effectiveness of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was 68% (95% CI, 50 to 79) against laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to hospitalization and 73% (95% CI, 59 to 82) against infection leading to an emergency department or urgent care clinic visit. CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 vaccines in the United States were highly effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospitalization, ICU admission, or an emergency department or urgent care clinic visit.

METHODS: Participants from two Swiss organisations, aged 18-65 years and working from home during the lockdown (n = 69) were included. Baseline data collected in January 2020 before the lockdown (office work) were compared with follow-up data in April 2020 during lockdown (working from home). The primary outcome of NP was assessed with a measure of intensity and disability. Secondary outcomes were quality of workstation ergonomics, number of work breaks, and time spent working at the computer. Two linear mixed effects models were fitted to the data to estimate the change in NP. RESULTS: No clinically relevant change in the average NP intensity and neck disability was found between measurement time points. Each working hour at the computer increased NP intensity by 0.36 points (95% CI: 0.09 to 0.62) indicating strong evidence. No such effect was found for neck disability. Each work break taken reduced neck disability by 2.30 points (95% CI: - 4.18 to - 0.42, evidence). No such effect was found for NP intensity. There is very strong evidence that workstation ergonomics was poorer at home. CONCLUSION: The number of work breaks and hours spent at the computer seem to have a greater effect on NP than the place of work (office, at home), measurement time point (before COVID-19, during lockdown) or the workstation ergonomics.

Machine learning processes were used to generate, train and validate a decision tree model. RESULTS: A list of 132 939 resolved COVID-19 cases was used. The notification rates and case fatality rates were higher among males (145.67 per 100 000 and 2.46%, respectively). Most COVID-19 cases were clustered among people of working age, and older cases had higher case fatality rates. The majority of cases were from the National Capital Region (590.20 per 100 000), and the highest case fatality rate (5.83%) was observed in Region VII.

ME/CFS is a debilitating condition, often triggered by viral and bacterial infections, leading to years-long debilitating symptoms including profound fatigue, postexertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive deficits, and orthostatic intolerance. Some are skeptical that either ME/CFS or long COVID-19 involves underlying biological abnormalities. However, in this review, we summarize the evidence that people with acute COVID-19 and with ME/CFS have biological abnormalities including redox imbalance, systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation, an impaired ability to generate adenosine triphosphate, and a general hypometabolic state. These phenomena have not yet been well studied in people with long COVID-19, and each of them has been reported in other diseases as well, particularly neurological diseases. We also examine the bidirectional relationship between redox imbalance, inflammation, energy metabolic deficits, and a hypometabolic state. We speculate as to what may be causing these abnormalities.

A structural equation model is developed and tested. In both cities, common determinants of neighborhood satisfaction are found to be the proximity to city center, neighborhood perceived safety, and place attachment, whereas common determinants of neighborhood happiness are found to be neighborhood perceived safety, neighborhood perceived quietness, neighborhood social cohesion, place attachment, and lower neighborhood density. Important differences between the two cities were also observed. Numerous local amenities seem to positively contribute to urban livability in Thessaloniki, but not in Oslo.

TNC is transiently expressed in the heart during embryonic development, but is rarely detected in normal adults; however, its expression is strongly up-regulated with inflammation. Although neither TNC-knockout nor -overexpressing mice show a distinct phenotype, disease models using genetically engineered mice combined with in vitro experiments have revealed multiple significant roles for TNC in responses to injury and myocardial repair, particularly in the regulation of inflammation. In most cases, TNC appears to deteriorate adverse ventricular remodeling by aggravating inflammation/fibrosis. Furthermore, accumulating clinical evidence has shown that high TNC levels predict adverse ventricular remodeling and a poor prognosis in patients with various heart diseases. Since the importance of inflammation has attracted attention in the pathophysiology of heart diseases, this review will focus on the roles of TNC in various types of inflammatory reactions, such as myocardial infarction, hypertensive fibrosis, myocarditis caused by viral infection or autoimmunity, and dilated cardiomyopathy.

The aim of this pilot study was to determine IAQ in elementary schools different in their internal and external characteristics, in settings of COVID-19 epidemics. Methods: IAQ parameters: fine particulate matter (PM2,5) mass concentration, CO2 concentration, temperature and relative humidity were measured in parallel in four elementary schools/classrooms during October (non-heating season) and four months (including holiday in January) of heating season. IAQ parameters were measured in settings of anti-epidemic restrictions (13 students in classroom, frequent ventilation). Results: During October, except in one school, PM2,5 concentrations were below the upper recommended value (25g/m ), but started rising in all schools in the heating season. The highest concentrations of PM2,5 were registered in two schools with closed or shortly opened windows. CO2 concentrations were mostly in the recommended range (up to 1000ppm) except in the school with constantly closed windows and in three schools in February when concentrations were higher. Except in one, the same school, and in January, both temperature and relative humidity were out of the recommended range (24,0 27,0C in non-heating;20,0 24,0C in heating season;and 45 55%), with temperature mainly above and relative humidity mainly below it in three schools. The largest deviation in temperature and relative humidity were registered in urban schools. Registered differences may be explained by different internal and external characteristics. Original paper Conclusion: Despite anti-epidemic restrictions, most of the measured IAQ parameters were out of the recommended values in heating season. In addition, further deterioration of IAQ could be expected if all students had been presented in the classroom. Finally, to assure a healthy school environment in heating season, further optimisation of both indoor and outdoor conditions is needed in both pandemic and non-pandemic settings.","output":"School children exposure to low indoor air uality in classrooms during covid-19 pandemic: Results of a pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in substantial and widespread changes to many prenatal (e.g., maternal stress) and postnatal (e.g., socialization) factors contributing to early child development.

Molecular clock-based hypothesis testing suggests the divergence between HSV-1 and the African great ape simplexviruses likely represents a codivergence event between humans and gorillas. The simplexviruses infecting African great apes subsequently experienced multiple cross-species transmission events over the past 3 My, the most recent of which occurred between humans and bonobos around 1 Ma.

Design/Methodology/Approach: The methodology was based on the methods of analysis and logical construction, the basics of descriptive statistics (to determine the phenomenon of debt), as well as the basic approach typical of the heuristic method. Findings: Despite the development of methods of assessing the financial condition, practice very often confirms that the primary direction of assessing the financial condition is the ability to absorb debt. This approach forces a search for an answer to the question, can the individual debt ratio (IWZ) be a measure that answers the question about the financial condition of local government units? Practical Implications: The IDR applied in Poland seems to be an effective instrument for controlling the debt of local government units. The structure of this indicator allows, on the one hand, systemic control of the debt of the entire public finance sector, and, on the other hand, it is flexibly adapted to the specificity and level of affluence of a given entity. Therefore, it is worth promoting such solutions in individual European Union countries as an effective tool for limiting LGU's uncontrolled debt. Originality/Value: Results of the study reflect that IDR concerns the possibility of debt service, but it cannot be a measure of financial condition, because in local government units there are liabilities not only classified as debt obligations. The omission of these obligations and their impact on the financial condition makes the information value of IDR imperfect and incomplete.

METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, single-dose study, 225 adult patients with acute sore throat were randomly assigned to receive either one AMC/DCBA Warm lozenge (n = 77), one AMC/DCBA Cool lozenge (n = 74) or one unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge (matched for size, shape and demulcency; n = 74). After baseline assessments, patients received their assigned lozenge and completed four rating assessments at 11 timepoints from 1 to 120 minutes post dose. Analgesic properties were assessed by comparing severity of throat soreness and sore throat relief ratings. Difficulty in swallowing, throat numbness, functional, sensorial and emotional benefits were also assessed. RESULTS: Both the AMC/DCBA Warm and AMC/DCBA Cool lozenge induced significant analgesic, functional, sensorial and emotional effects compared with the unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge. Sore throat relief, improvements in throat soreness and difficulty in swallowing, and throat numbness were observed as early as 1-5 minutes, and lasted up to 2 hours post dose. Sensorial benefits of warming and cooling associated with the AMC/DCBA Warm and AMC/DCBA Cool lozenge, respectively, were experienced soon after first dose, and in the case of the latter, it lasted long after the lozenge had dissolved. Emotional benefits of feeling better, happier, less distracted and less frustrated were reported in those taking either of the AMC/DCBA throat lozenge variants, with no differences in adverse events compared with the unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge.

Methods One-hundred nasopharyngeal samples were collected from 47 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, and 200 samples were collected from healthy donners. We measured the SARS-CoV-2 antigen and nucleic acid using Lumipulse Presto SARS-CoV-2 Ag and the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Detection Kit, respectively. Results The sensitivity and specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen test were 75.7% (56/74) and 96.0% (192/200), respectively. The concordance rate in the positive group between the antigen and nucleic acid tests was 66% (66/100). In addition, the correlation coefficient between the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 antigen and the level of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 0.74. There were 19 discrepant samples in which SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected without SARS-CoV-2 antigen. There was significant difference between the discrepant and matched samples in terms of the time since symptom onset: the 19 discrepant samples were collected a median of 33 days after onset, while the 55 matched samples were collected a median of 19 days after onset. In addition, the 19 discrepant samples were collected from patients who were immune against SARS-CoV-2.

The primary endpoint was 30-day clinical recovery, which was defined as no oxygen requirement or referral after recovery. RESULTS: A total of 66 patients were evaluated, including 33 patients in the dexamethasone (Dexa) group and 33 patients in the dexamethasone plus tocilizumab (DexaToci) group. The DexaToci group showed a statistically significant benefit in 30-day clinical recovery, compared to the Dexa group (p=0.024). In multivariable analyses, peak FiO(2) within 3 days and tocilizumab combination were consistently significant for 30-day recovery (all p<0.05).

METHODS: A mixed method, sequential explanatory design was employed. This article reports the first phase of the study, in which an online questionnaire was administered, consisting of items relating to perceived acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, sustainability, and uptake of MECC HCS. Barriers and facilitators to MECC HCS delivery were additionally explored and mapped to the Theoretical Domains Framework. RESULTS: Seventy-one professionals responded, including 15 physiotherapists supporting people with MSK conditions. Across professional groups, MECC HCS was found to be highly acceptable, appropriate, and feasible. A significant interaction between perceived sustainability of MECC HCS and the location in which professionals worked was observed. Physiotherapists reported using their MECC HCS at least daily; however, there were discrepancies between the number of their patients they believed could benefit from behaviour change intervention, and the number to whom they reported actually delivering MECC HCS. Perceived barriers and facilitators to MECC HCS implementation mapped mostly to Environmental Context and Resources on the Theoretical Domains Framework. CONCLUSIONS: The Wessex model of MECC is a promising brief or very brief intervention for physiotherapists supporting individuals with musculoskeletal conditions. Barriers associated with the sustainability of the intervention within organisations must be addressed in order to enhance future implementation. Further rollout of this intervention may be beneficial for meeting the goals of the NHS and Public Health England in prevention of chronic MSK conditions and promotion of musculoskeletal health.","output":"How useful is the Making Every Contact Count Healthy Conversation Skills approach for supporting people with musculoskeletal conditions?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most recent emerging infectious diseases have been zoonotic in origin.

Following initial screening, suspect samples were subject to quantitative or semi\\\\ quantitative confirmation analysis by LC\\\\MS/MS. RESULTS: The total number of violations reported was 534 (1.01% of the total number of specimens analysed). The total number of violations reported in Thoroughbred horses was 210 while the total number of violations reported in Quarter Horses was 324. The percentage of total violations was %0.59 for all the specimens analysed in Thoroughbred horses while this percentage was %1.9 for all the specimens analysed in Quarter Horses during this 5\\\\year period.

First, we investigate the velocity distribution and the temperature-kinetic energy relationship associated with the isokinetic Nos-Hoover family of methods, showing how they depend on the number of thermostats attached to each atomic degree of freedom. Second, we investigate the performance of these methods in the calculation of solvation free energies, the determination of which is often key for understanding the partition of a chemical species among distinct environments. We show how one can extract this property from canonical (constant-NVT) simulations and compare the result to experimental data obtained at a specific pressure. Finally, we demonstrate that large time steps can, in fact, be used to improve the efficiency of these calculations and that attaching multiple thermostats per degree of freedom is beneficial for effectively exploring the configurational space of a molecular system.","output":"Molecular Dynamics with Very Large Time Steps for the Calculation of Solvation Free Energies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On March 14, 2020, the Spanish Government declared a state of alarm to face the health emergency situation caused by the rapid evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recently, whole body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) has emerged as a more time-efficient alternative to traditional resistance training (RT). However, the effects of WB-EMS compared to RT on cardiometabolic health in obese metabolic syndrome (MetS) patients performed during CR are still unclear. In total, 118 obese MetS patients (52.7  11.8 years, BMI: 38.1  6.9 kg/m(2)) undergoing CR over 12 weeks (aim: ?500 kcal deficit/day) were randomly allocated to either WB-EMS, single-set RT (1-RT), 3-set RT (3-RT) or an inactive control group (CON). Primary outcome was MetS severity (MetS z-score). Secondary outcomes were body composition, muscle strength and quality of life (QoL). All groups significantly reduced body weight (~3%) and fat mass (~2.6 kg) but only 1-RT and 3-RT preserved skeletal muscle mass (SMM). All exercise groups increased muscle strength in major muscle groups (20C103%). However, only the two RT-groups improved MetS z-score (1-RT: ?1.34, p = 0.003; 3-RT: ?2.06, p < 0.001) and QoL (1-RT: +6%, p = 0.027; 3-RT: +12%, p < 0.001), while WB-EMS and CON had no impact on these outcomes.

A random\\\\effects meta\\\\analysis was performed to compare disease severity and mortality rates of COVID\\\\19 patients in physically active and inactive cases. Twelve studies involving 1,256,609 patients (991,268 physically active and 265,341 inactive cases) with COVID\\\\19, were included in the pooled analysis. The overall meta\\\\analysis compared with inactive controls showed significant associations between PA with reduction in COVID\\\\19 hospitalisation (risk ratio (RR) = 0.58, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.46C0.73, P = 0.001), ICU admissions (RR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.52C0.81, P = 0.001) and mortality (RR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.38C0.59, P = 0.001).

As the number of cases continues to rise, we aim to assess how the coronavirus pandemic has affected our service and adherence to AUGIS guidelines. METHOD: We retrospectively analysed all adult admissions with radiologically confirmed AC from defined 2-month periods (pre-pandemic (PP), wave-1 (W1) and wave-2 (W2)) at an acute general surgical service without dedicated hot gallbladder lists where the prevalence of coronavirus has remained high throughout. Primary outcome was rate of index admission (acute) cholecystectomy. RESULTS: 93 patients were included in total (PP 35, W1 33, W2 24). Demographic details were similar across all groups. Tokyo grade I (mild) cholecystitis was more commonly admitted PP (63.9% versus 48.5% and 50.0%). Conservative management was trialed in 91.7%, 100.0% and 62.5% and failed in 18.2%, 21.2% and 21.1%. Cholecystectomy rates were 13.9%, 12.1% and 29.2%. Increased use of CT in W1 has returned to PP imaging pattern in W2. 30-day readmission rates were 5.6%, 18.2% and 4.2%.

Through group chat functions, modern communication platforms provide the opportunity for synchronous online discussions to occur in parallel with didactic presentations. We sought to qualitatively characterize the content, nature, and educational uses of synchronous online discussions occurring during weekly academic conferences and to assess the attitudes of lecturers and audience members towards these discussions. Methods: Transcripts of synchronous online discussions occurring from 7/1/20 to 12/31/20 were qualitatively analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Initial themes were identified by the primary author. Following a preliminary coding by the study authors, the themes were iteratively refined to arrive at a final coding strategy. Each months transcripts were coded by 2 study authors. When there was disagreement between coders, the primary author made a final coding determination. Following the study period, a survey distributed to residents and faculty assessed attitudes towards the synchronous online discussions. Results: The qualitative analysis of the transcripts identified 2352 coded messages. The final coding schema can be seen in Figure 1. Of 1720 identified content codes, the most commonly identified themes were cultural communications (40.8%) and knowledge sharing (39.0%). Within the broader theme of knowledge sharing, participants were most likely to share individual practice experience (366/671 codes). Statements with uncited data/evidence (113 codes) occurred in similar frequency to sharing of academic resources (137 codes). Questions directed towards other members of the audience (48.8% of questions) were only slightly less common than questions directed to the lecturer (51.2% of questions). There were 56 respondents to the survey (30 residents, 25 faculty, 1 fellow). Of the 44 respondents that had presented didactics, 54.5% (24/44) identified that it was challenging to keep up with the synchronous online discussion. From the perspective of the audience, 82.1% (46/56) felt it was easy to keep up with the discussion. Presenters of didactics felt identifying a member of the audience as a surrogate was the easiest means to keep up with the discussion (75%, 33/44 presenters). Audience members agreed that they were much more likely to ask a question in a synchronous online discussion as opposed to speaking out loud (71.4%, 40/56). Conclusions: Weekly academic conferences are a critical component of residency education, enabling not only the acquisition of knowledge but also the social sharing of knowledge/experiences developing of robust communities of practice. Our qualitative analysis found that cultural communication occurred with near equal frequency to knowledge sharing and that sharing of individual practice experiences was more common than sharing of academic resources. These synchronous online discussions may make it more likely for audience members to ask questions of each other or the lecturer but keeping up with the discussion was challenging for lecturers.

In particular, micro-mobility, an emerging mode of urban transport, is profoundly shaped by this crisis. However, there is limited research devoted to understanding the rapidly evolving trip patterns of micro-mobility in response to COVID-19. To fill this gap, we analyze the changes in micro-mobility usage before and during the lockdown period exploiting high-resolution micro-mobility trip data collected in Zurich, Switzerland. Specifically, docked bike, docked e-bike, and dockless e-bike are evaluated and compared from the perspective of space, time and semantics. First, the spatial and temporal analysis results uncover that the number of trips decreased remarkably during the lockdown period. The striking difference between the normal and lockdown period is the decline in the peak hours of workdays. Second, the origin-destination flows are used to construct spatially embedded networks. The results suggest that the origin-destination pairs remain similar during the lockdown period, while the numbers of trips between each origin-destination pair is reduced due to COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the semantic analysis is conducted to uncover the changes in trip purpose. It is revealed that the proportions of Home, Park, and Grocery activities increase, while the proportions of Leisure and Shopping activities decrease during the lockdown period.

Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionally impacted by HIV and stimulant use, the co-occurrence of which heightens HIV transmission risk and undermines the national treatment as prevention efforts for ending the HIV epidemic. There is a paucity of information regarding the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the substance use and HIV medication adherence of this key vulnerable population - MSM who use stimulants and are living with HIV. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this qualitative study was to identify ways in which the coronavirus pandemic has affected the stimulant use and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among a sample of MSM living with HIV. METHODS: Two focus groups were conducted in August 2020 via HIPAA-compliant video-conferencing technology. Potential participants from a suitable research participant registry at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University were invited and screened for study participation based on inclusion criteria. A semi-structured interview guide was followed. A general inductive approach was used to analyze the data. Findings in two general areas of interest, the impact of COVID-19 on stimulant use and ART adherence, emerged directly from the raw data. RESULTS: A total of 12 ethnically diverse participants over the age of 25 took part in the study. Results were heterogeneous in terms of the effects of the pandemic on both stimulant use and ART adherence among MSM living with HIV. Some men indicated increased or sustained stimulant use and ART adherence and others reported decreased stimulant use and ART adherence. Reasons for these behavioral changes ranged from concerns about their own health and that of their loved ones to challenges brought about by the lack of daily structure during the lockdown phase of the pandemic and emotion regulation difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had differential impact on stimulant use and ART medication adherence among MSM living with HIV. The reasons for behavioral change identified by this study may be salient intervention targets to support ART medication adherence and lower stimulant use among MSM in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as beyond.","output":"The Beat Goes On: Stimulant Use and HIV in the Era of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) is a pandemic infectious disease caused by novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus\\\\2 (SARS CoV\\\\2).

AIM: To assess effectiveness of wearing face masks in the community to prevent respiratory disease, and recommend improvements to this evidence base. METHODS: We systematically searched Scopus, Embase and MEDLINE for studies evaluating respiratory disease incidence after face-mask wearing (or not). Narrative synthesis and random-effects meta-analysis of attack rates for primary and secondary prevention were performed, subgrouped by design, setting, face barrier type, and who wore the mask. Preferred outcome was influenza-like illness. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) quality assessment was undertaken and evidence base deficits described. RESULTS: 33 studies (12 randomised control trials (RCTs)) were included. Mask wearing reduced primary infection by 6% (odds ratio (OR): 0.94; 95% CI: 0.75C1.19 for RCTs) to 61% (OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.32C2.27; OR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.18C0.84 and OR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.45C0.85 for cohort, caseCcontrol and cross-sectional studies respectively). RCTs suggested lowest secondary attack rates when both well and ill household members wore masks (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.48C1.37). While RCTs might underestimate effects due to poor compliance and controls wearing masks, observational studies likely overestimate effects, as mask wearing might be associated with other risk-averse behaviours. GRADE was low or very low quality. CONCLUSION: Wearing face masks may reduce primary respiratory infection risk, probably by 6C15%. It is important to balance evidence from RCTs and observational studies when their conclusions widely differ and both are at risk of significant bias.

METHODS Three hundred seventy eight (378) patients with hip (174) and knee (204) osteoarthritis undergoing total joint arthroplasty (174 THA-204 TKA) were assessed pre- and post-operatively (6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months) using the Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D10). The patients' satisfaction with the results of total joint arthroplasty was also assessed. Differences were analyzed using general linear model for repeated measures. RESULTS The one-year response rate was 97 % for THA and 90 % for TKA. WOMAC and CES-D10 scores improved significantly after one year for both THA and TKA (P < 0.0001). The improvement in WOMAC total score was significantly greater for TKA patients (P < 0.0001 at 12 months). WOMAC pain and stiffness improved earlier for THA (6 weeks), while TKA had equivalent improvements at 3 and 6 months respectively. Both THA/TKA displayed significant improvement of WOMAC function at 3 months but TKA had greater improvement. Age, body mass index, residence, education and social support were not significant predictors of quality of life after total joint arthroplasty.

METHODS: Fifteen healthy males (age 31  5 years) participated in: (a) reference sleep (~ 9.5 h) with no HIIE (RS), (b) RS and HIIE (RSX), and (c) APSD and HIIE (SSX). HIIE was performed in 3:2 min intervals at 90% and 40% of VO2 reserve. FMD was assessed the night before (D1), the morning of the next day (D2), 1 h (1hrPE) and 4 h post HIIE (4hrPE).

The high technicalities of nasopharyngeal sampling and molecular assays, as well as scarce resources of reagents, limit our testing capabilities. Several strategies failed, to date, to fully alleviate this testing process (e.g. saliva sampling or antigen testing on nasopharyngeal samples). We assessed the clinical performances of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (N-antigen) ELISA detection in serum or plasma using the COVID-19 Quantigene R (AAZ, France) assay. METHODS: Performances were determined on 63 sera from 63 non-COVID patients and 227 serum samples (165 patients) from the French COVID and CoV-CONTACT cohorts with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 142 serum (114 patients) obtained within 14 days after symptoms' onset. RESULTS: Specificity was 98.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 95.3 to 100). Sensitivity was 79.3% overall (180/227, 95% CI, 74.0 to 84.6) and 93.0% (132/142, 95% CI, 88.7 to 97.2) within 14 days after symptoms onset. 91 included patients had a sera and nasopharyngeal swabs collected in the same 24 hours. Among those with high nasopharyngeal viral loads, i.e. Ct value below 30 and 33, only 1/50 and 4/67 tested negative for N-antigenemia, respectively. Among those with a negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR, 8/12 presented positive N-antigenemia;the lower respiratory tract was explored for 6 of these 8 patients, showing positive RT-PCR in 5 cases. CONCLUSION: This is the first evaluation of a commercially available serum N-antigen detection assay. It presents a robust specificity and sensitivity within the first 14 days after symptoms onset.

The expression of rCDVNP in Star strain (mean 300&#956;g/mL, purified) was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis by using His-Tag monoclonal antibodies.

In summary, our findings demonstrated that rCDVNP is antigenic since CDV positive dog sera recognized the protein in vitro. Additionally, the rCDVNP proved to be immunogenic in hens being possible to isolate a high concentration of specific IgY antibodies from the egg yolk.

With the global epidemic dynamics becoming more and more serious, the prediction and analysis of the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 has become an important task. We develop an artificial neural network (ANN) for modeling of the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19. The confirmed cases and deaths data are collected from January 20 to November 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). By introducing root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R), and mean absolute error (MAE), statistical indicators of the prediction model are verified and evaluated. The size of training and test confirmed cases and death base employed in the model is optimized. The best simulating performance with RMSE, R, and MAE is realized using the 7 past days' cases as input variables in the training and test dataset. And the estimated R are 0.9948 and 0.9683, respectively. Compared with different algorithms, experimental simulation shows that trainbr algorithm has better performance than other algorithms in reproducing the amount of the confirmed cases and deaths. This study shows that the ANN model is suitable for predicting the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 in the future. Using the ANN model, we also predict the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 from June 5, 2020 to November 11, 2020.

The primary outcome assessed was requirement of hospitalization. Data was obtained from a retrospective review of electronic health records within a New Jersey USA multi-hospital network. We compared outcomes in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with those who did not applying a multivariable logistic model with propensity matching. RESULTS: Among 1274 outpatients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection 7.6% were prescribed hydroxychloroquine. In a 1067 patient propensity matched cohort, 21.6% with outpatient exposure to hydroxychloroquine were hospitalized, and 31.4% without exposure were hospitalized.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-stranded RNA betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. Expanding virus populations, as that of SARS-CoV-2, accumulate a number of narrowly shared polymorphisms imposing a confounding effect on traditional clustering methods. In this context, approaches that reduce the complexity of the sequence space occupied by the SARS-CoV-2 population are necessary for a robust clustering. Here, we proposed the subdivision of the global SARS-CoV-2 population into sixteen well-defined subtypes by focusing on the widely shared polymorphisms in nonstructural (nsp3, nsp4, nsp6, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14) cistrons, structural (spike and nucleocapsid) and accessory (ORF8) genes.

Rotaviruses are divided into 10 serogroups (A-J) and each group is based on genetic properties of major structural protein VP6. We designed a novel VP6 sequence optimization to increase the expression level of this protein. Numerous factors such as codon adaptation index, codon pair bias, and guanine-cytosine content were adapted based on Escherichia coli codon usage. In addition, the ribosome binding site (RBS) of pET-15b was redesigned by the RBS calculator and the secondary structure of VP6 messenger RNA was optimized in the whole length of the coding sequence. Various factors including isopropyl beta-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) concentration, temperature, and induction time were analyzed for the optimization of the best expression in E. coli by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting. The recombinant VP6 (rVP6) protein was purified by the Ni-sepharose and then the hyperimmune sera were generated against rVP6 in rabbits. Among three different temperatures, IPTG concentrations, and postinductions, the level of rVP6 was higher at 37C, 1 mM of IPTG, and 8 h, respectively. Also, the high expression level of rVP6 was obtained in the insoluble aggregate form (43.8 g/L). After purification, the yield of rVP6 was 10.83 g/L. The rVP6 specific antiserum was confirmed by both immunofluorescent and western blotting. The versatile sequence optimization was the reason to produce a high level of rVP6 compared to other reports and can potentially apply to produce cheaper commercial kits to diagnose serological tests and new rotavirus vaccines.","output":"Advanced sequence optimization for the high efficient yield of human group A rotavirus VP6 recombinant protein in Escherichia coli and its use as immunogen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High-throughput molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be enabled by group testing in which pools of specimens are screened, and individual specimens tested only after a pool tests positive Several labs have recently published examples of pooling strategies applied to SARS-CoV-2 specimens, but overall guidance on efficient pooling strategies is lacking Therefore we developed a model of the efficiency and accuracy of specimen pooling algorithms based on available data on SAR-CoV-2 viral dynamics For a fixed number of tests, we estimate that programs using group testing could screen 2 to 20 times as many specimens compared to individual testing;increase the total number of true positive infections identified;and improve the positive predictive value of results We compare outcomes that may be expected in different testing situations and provide general recommendations for group testing implementation A free, publicly-available web calculator is provided to help inform laboratory decisions on SARS-CoV-2 pooling algorithms","output":"Group Testing for Sars-Cov-2 to Enable Rapid Scale-Up of Testing and Real-Time Surveillance of Incidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A proper vaccination against avian influenza viruses in chicken can significantly reduce the risk of human infection. Egypt has the highest number of recorded humans highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)-H5N1 infections worldwide despite the widespread use of homologous vaccines in poultry. Enhancing H5N1 vaccine efficacy is ultimately required to better control HPAI-H5N1. The aim of this study is to boost chicken immunity by combined with inactivated HPAI-H5N1 with selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs). The chickens groups 1C3 were fed diets supplemented with SeNPs concentrations (0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg) for 3 weeks and then vaccinated (inactivated HPAI-H5N1). while groups 4,5 and 6 were fed with SeNPs free diets and administered with 0.5 ml of the vaccine combined with 0.02, 0.06, and 0.1 mg/dose of SeNPs and then all groups were challenged with homologous virus 3 weeks post-vaccination (WPV). Group 7, 8 were used as control positive and negative respectively. At 4, 5, and 6 WPV, antibody titer was considerably higher in the group fed a meal supplemented with 1 mg SeNPs/kg. In contrast, both methods of SeNPs supplementation significantly increased the Interleukin 2 (IL2), Interleukin 6 (IL6), and Interferon  (IFN) expressions in the blood cells in a dose-dependent manner, with a higher expression observed in the group that was vaccinated with 0.1 mg/dose. After the challenge, all groups that received SeNPs via diet or vaccines dose showed significant reduction in viral shedding and milder inflammation in lung, trachea, spleen, and liver in addition to higher expression of IL2, IL6, and IFN, with the highest expression observed in the group that was vaccinated with 0.1 mg/dose compared the plain vaccinated group. The groups of 1 mg SeNPs/kg and combined vaccinated with 0.1 mg/dose showed the best vaccine efficacy. However, the group vaccinated with 0.1 mg/dose showed the earliest reduction in viral shedding. Overall, SeNPs supplementation in the diet and the administration of the vaccine formula with SeNPs could enhance vaccine efficacy and provide better protection against HPAI-H5N1 in chickens by enhancing cellular immunity and reducing inflammation. We recommend using SeNPs as a vaccine combination or feeding with diet to increase the immunity and vaccine efficacy against H5N1.","output":"Selenium nanoparticles enhance the efficacy of homologous vaccine against the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus in chickens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been associated with dramatic increases in substance use, as marked by increased alcohol, nicotine and cannabis sales.

Substance use, and especially inhalational drug use, increases the likelihood of both transmission and severe infection. Youth are especially vulnerable to substance use and have increased risk of long-term problems. These outcomes highlight the need for greater access to substance use treatment.

Major research streams over the last decades investigated either satisfaction with offices in relation to physical comfort, or how layout decisions influenced interaction and collaboration in the workplace with a focus on open-plan offices. Rather little is known on the effect a workplace layout (such as its openness) has on perceptions of staff regarding teamwork, focused work and perceived productivity. We aim to close this gap by taking a differential approach which appreciates detailed variations within open-plan offices. Not every corner of an office is the same, so the question arises whether satisfaction with workspace differs depending on where someone is sitting. Bringing results of a staff survey in the UK headquarters of a global technology company together with a detailed analysis of spatial qualities at desks based on isovist and visual field analysis, we find that staff are less likely to rate their workplace environment favorably when they have higher numbers of desks within their own field of vision; and when they are facing away from the room with a relatively larger area behind their back compared to the area surrounding them. Aspects of teamwork that are negatively affected include sharing information with others, as well as team identity and cohesion. Focused work (concentration) and working productively are impacted even more so with the largest effect sizes throughout. These findings highlight the relevance of investigating detailed spatial qualities of micro-locations in workplace layouts.

Laboratory experiments were conducted on a 2D-sandbox and numerical simulations were performed using the SEAWAT code. Four cases were investigated, including a homogeneous case and three cases, where the top layer thickness (Wtop) was equal to 0.2H, 0.33H and 0.5H, respectively, where H was the aquifer thickness. The experimental and numerical results show that the toe length decreases linearly with increasing the thickness of the TLK layer. The results also suggest that lowering the permeability of the upper part of the aquifer causes faster saltwater removal process. The sensitivity analysis shows that decreasing the top layer permeability causes further reduction of the intrusion length. Nonetheless, the results evidence that this method yields relatively little reduction of the saline water intrusion length if the upper layer thickness is inferior or equal to a fifth of the total aquifer thickness, regardless of the permeability value of the top layer. The field-scale modelling results demonstrate that the performance of the TLK layer weakens noticeably as the hydraulic gradient decreases. The results show that the TLK layer achieved a maximum saltwater wedge reduction of 31% in the case where Wtop = 0.75H, which means that lowering the permeability of three fourths of the aquifer thickness only induced a toe length reduction by nearly a third of its original length. In addition to providing a quantitative analysis of SWI dynamics in bi-layered coastal aquifers, this study questions the performance and practicality of the artificial reduction of the upper aquifer permeability as a countermeasure for seawater intrusion control.","output":"The impact of a low-permeability upper layer on transient seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Parallel cascade selection molecular dynamics (PaCS-MD) is a rare-event sampling method that generates transition pathways between a reactant and product. To sample the transition pathways, PaCS-MD repeats short-time MD simulations from important configurations as conformational resampling cycles.

In a ligand-concentrated environment, where multiple ligand copies are randomly arranged around the target protein, LB-PaCS-MD allows for the frequent sampling of ligand binding pathways. To select the important configurations, we specified the center of mass (COM) distance between each ligand and the relevant binding site of the target protein, where snapshots generated by the short-time MD simulations were ranked by their COM distance values. From each cycle, snapshots with smaller COM distance values were selected as the important configurations to be resampled using the short-time MD simulations. By repeating conformational resampling cycles, the COM distance values gradually decreased and converged to constants, meaning that a set of ligand binding pathways toward the target protein was sampled by LB-PaCS-MD. To demonstrate relative efficiency, LB-PaCS-MD was applied to several proteins, and their ligand binding pathways were sampled more frequently than conventional MD simulations.","output":"Ligand Binding Path Sampling Based on Parallel Cascade Selection Molecular Dynamics: LB-PaCS-MD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A young male infant was referred to the emergency department with apparent acute sepsis.

To estimate the proportion of the general population willing to get COVID-19 vaccination and to identify factors, ie, the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, and WHO Regions contributing to the willingness rate, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis compliant with PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Methods A search of the existing relevant literature was conducted by means of Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, Registers, and other sources in order to identify studies published between November 2019 and April 2021. A total of 19 studies from 11 countries that satisfied the inclusion criteria (ie, studies exclusively on the general population, and participants aged 16 years and above) were retrieved. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I2 statistic, and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and the Egger's test. A meta-analysis and a meta-regression analysis were conducted using STATA 16.1 software. Results The pooled rate of willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine among the general population was calculated to be 60.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 51.5, 68.4). Meta-analyses showed, on the one hand, that the highest pooled willingness to get vaccinated was 73% (95% CI = 62.3, 84.1) in the studies of countries with 1000-4000 COVID-19 cases per million population and, on the other, that the same measure was 71% (95% CI = 53.2, 89.1) in countries reporting >400 COVID-19 deaths per million population. The acceptance rates also varied in different WHO regions of the world.

It describes how risk was understood and why decisions were made on key elements of the plan, including trigger points, risk prioritisation and mitigation, and the location and design of points of distribution of water rations for the public. Reflecting upon the authors experience and interviews with senior City officials who worked on the drought disaster planning and response, the paper extracts five key lessons learnt that have since been applied during the COVID-19 pandemic: (i) the need for cross-functional planning and response skills, (ii) the need for integrated, up-to-date and scale-appropriate data;(iii) the importance of scenario-based simulations, communication and rapid costing to enable the rapid scaling-up of a response;(iv) the value of being able to use outsourced expert capacity effectively;and (v) the application of previously used disaster management and planning experience to build resilience in cities. These lessons, captured in a visual framework, help reflect on capabilities required for responding to future city-scale disasters. The paper provides an informative case study for other cities and risk managers, and will be particularly useful for global South contexts that face drought and other slow-onset disasters, most recently illustrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. ? 2021 The Authors","output":"Managing city-scale slow-onset disasters: Learning from Cape Town's 2015C2018 drought disaster planning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to spread throughout the world, more and more information about the pandemic has been shared publicly on social media.

Home spirometers were distributed as part of objective patient assessment. Our aim was to assess patient satisfaction with the telehealth service in CF multidisciplinary clinic via online survey. Methods: All patients of the CF service were invited to complete an online survey designed to assess satisfaction with telehealth, which was undertaken through the consumer organization Cystic Fibrosis South Australia. A quantitatively driven concurrent mixed-methods design was chosen, with statistical analysis using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows v.26 and coding of unstructured responses to generate themes for thematic analysis. Results: To date 57 from a cohort of 160 patients (35.6%) completed the survey, with some item non-responses. 37/57 (64.9%) of participants were aged 35yo, 42/53 (80.7%) had 2 telehealth appointments, and 46/53 (86.7%) found it easy/very easy to access. 18/48 (37.5%) of participants had problems with audio/visual dropout. Despite this 48/52 (92.3%) felt satisfied or very satisfied that the CF team were engaged in their care via telehealth, with just under half utilizing a home spirometer at the time of the survey. 38/50 (76%) found that telehealth was more convenient than an in-person appointment with significant time saved. The thematic analysis added context and depth to analysis of the quantitative data by identification of six key themes of convenience, ease of access, maintaining the therapeutic relationship, comprehensive care, safety, and patient centred care.

We assessed the role of metabolomic profiling in improving T2D risk prediction beyond conventional risk factors. Methods: NMR-metabolomic profiling was undertaken on baseline plasma samples in 65,684 UK Biobank participants without diabetes and not taking lipid-lowering medication. Cox regression yielded adjusted hazard ratios for the associations of 143 individual metabolic biomarkers (including lipids, lipoproteins, fatty acids, amino acids, ketone bodies and other low molecular weight metabolic biomarkers) and 11 metabolic biomarker principal components (PCs) (accounting for 90% of total variance in individual biomarkers) with incident T2D. These 11 PCs were added to established models for T2D risk prediction, and measures of risk discrimination (c-statistic) and reclassification (continuous net reclassification improvement [NRI], integrated discrimination index [IDI]) were assessed. Findings: During median 11.9 (IQR 11.1-12.6) years' follow-up, 1719 participants developed T2D. After accounting for multiple testing, 118 metabolic biomarkers showed independent associations with T2D risk (false discovery rate controlled p<0.05), of which 103 persisted after additional adjustment for HbA1c. Overall, 10 metabolic biomarker PCs were independently associated with T2D. Addition of PCs to the established risk prediction model (including age, sex, parental history of diabetes, body mass index and HbA1c) improved T2D risk prediction as assessed by the c-statistic (increased from 0.802 [95% CI 0.791-0.812] to 0.830 [0.822-0.841]), continuous NRI (0.44 [0.38-0.49]), and relative (15.0% [10.5%-20.4%]) and absolute (1.5 [1.0-1.9]) IDI.

Fluorine-18 fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) performed 3 weeks later revealed an FDG uptake in those swollen lymph nodes and in the novel lymphadenopathy in the left axilla and left subclavicular regions. Both biopsy specimens from the right supraclavicular and hilar lymph nodes revealed only multiple small granulomas with multinucleated giant cells without malignancy, consistent with sarcoidosis. The left axilla and subclavicular lymphadenopathy detected by the FDG-PET subsequently spontaneously regressed. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The coincidental occurrence of VAHL and lymphadenopathy in sarcoidosis patients could cause diagnostic confusion especially in those with breast cancer.

We assessed methodological quality using critical appraisal skills programme tools. We adopted a segregated approach to mixed-methods synthesis. In a final step, we attributed combined results to one of four qualitative themes: prevalence and severity; contributing factors; impacts on quality of life; and assessment and management. Prevalence of fatigue ranged from 13.8 to 80.9%. Short Form Health Survey-36 vitality scores were commonly used as a marker of fatigue. Vitality scores reached a nadir approximately one month following ICU discharge (mean (SD) 56.44 (32.30); 95%CI 52.92-59.97). They improved over time but seldom reached reference population scores. Associated biological, disease-related and psychological factors included age, poor pre-morbid status, sleep and psychological disturbance. Qualitative data highlight the profound negative impact of fatigue on survivors' quality of life. Survivors seldom had any information provided on the potential impact of fatigue.

Quarantine and phytosanitary procedures have been established by many countries around the world to minimize seed-borne pest spread by screening export and import consignments of germplasm. The effectiveness of these time-consuming and cost-intensive procedures depends on the knowledge of pest distribution, availability of diagnostic tools for seed health testing, qualified operators, procedures for inspection, and seed phytosanitation. This review describes a unique multidisciplinary approach used by the CGIAR Germplasm Health Units (GHUs) in ensuring phytosanitary protection for the safe conservation and global movement of germplasm from the 11 CGIAR genebanks and breeding programs that acquire and distribute germplasm to and from all parts of the world for agricultural research and food security. We also present the challenges, lessons learned, and recommendations stemming from the experience of GHUs, which collaborate with the national quarantine systems to export and distribute about 100,000 germplasm samples annually to partners located in about 90 to 100 countries. Furthermore, we describe how GHUs adjust their procedures to stay in alignment with evolving phytosanitary regulations and pest risk scenarios. In conclusion, we state the benefits of globally coordinated phytosanitary networks for the prevention of the intercontinental spread of pests that are transmissible through plant propagation materials.","output":"Phytosanitary Interventions for Safe Global Germplasm Exchange and the Prevention of Transboundary Pest Spread: The Role of CGIAR Germplasm Health Units"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prediction of the environmental conditions in megacities is considered, taking account of highways.

Healthcare providers were forced to expand capacity to provide care to the surging number of symptomatic COVID-19 patients, while maintaining a fully operating service for all non-COVID patients. The recent literature suggesting an overall decrease in acute ischemic stroke admissions as well as total number of endovascular treatments will be reviewed. Although the underlying reasons therefore remain the matter of debate, it seems that the imposed restrictions, requiring social distancing, and stopping all nonessential services, have led to a higher threshold for patients to seek medical attention, in particular in those with less severe symptoms. Thus, raising public awareness on the importance of strokes and transient ischemic attacks is even more important in the light of the current situation to avoid serious healthcare, economic consequences, and limit long term morbidity.

Despite increases in facility-based childbirth, gaps in quality of care at facilities have limited reductions in maternal deaths. Infrequent physiologic monitoring of women around childbirth is a major gap in care that leads to delays in life-saving interventions for women experiencing complications. METHODS: We will conduct a type-2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study over 12 months to evaluate using a wireless physiologic monitoring system to detect and alert clinicians of abnormal vital signs in women for 24 h after undergoing emergency cesarean delivery at a tertiary care facility in Uganda. We will provide physiologic data (heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature and blood pressure) to clinicians via a smartphone-based application with alert notifications if monitored women develop predefined abnormalities in monitored physiologic signs. We will alternate two-week intervention and control time periods where women and clinicians use the wireless monitoring system during intervention periods and current standard of care (i.e., manual vital sign measurement when clinically indicated) during control periods. Our primary outcome for effectiveness is a composite of severe maternal outcomes per World Health Organization criteria (e.g. death, cardiac arrest, jaundice, shock, prolonged unconsciousness, paralysis, hysterectomy). Secondary outcomes include maternal mortality rate, and case fatality rates for postpartum hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, and sepsis. We will use the RE-AIM implementation framework to measure implementation metrics of the wireless physiologic system including Reach (proportion of eligible women monitored, length of time women monitored), Efficacy (proportion of women with monitoring according to Uganda Ministry of Health guidelines, number of appropriate alerts sent), Adoption (proportion of clinicians utilizing physiologic data per shift, clinical actions in response to alerts), Implementation (fidelity to monitoring protocol), Maintenance (sustainability of implementation over time). We will also perform in-depth qualitative interviews with up to 30 women and 30 clinicians participating in the study.

Methods Our research program implemented the following: 1. Staff wore masks, disposable gowns, face shields and gloves when with subjects. 2. Subjects were asked if they tested positive or were experiencing COVID symptoms; upon entry their temperature was measured, and hand sanitizer used. 3. Disinfecting was expanded to all scanner room surfaces in contact with humans between each visit. 4. Only 1 subject was allowed in the research office at a time. Staff, when possible, remained > 6 feet away from other persons. As part of a study evaluating total body DXA, community dwelling volunteers completed a self-administered health care delivery preference survey from Dec 2020 to May 2021.

A total BBS score of less than 45 indicates an enhanced risk of multiple falls. Multivariate logistic regression models were performed to elucidate factors associated with post-operative BBS score. RESULTS: A significant difference in mean pre- and post-operative BBS scores were noted (49.3  6.4 vs. 52.2  4.7) (p < 0.05).

The study objective was to identify barriers to decision aid use in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) within a behavior change model to inform an implementation strategy. METHODS: Perspectives from Canadian health care providers (HCPs) and patients living with RA were obtained on an early RA decision aid and on perceived facilitators and barriers to decision aid implementation. Data were collected through semistructured interviews, transcribed, and then analyzed by inductive thematic analysis. The lessons learned were then mapped to the behavior change wheel COM\\\\B system (C = capability, O = opportunity, and M = motivation interact to influence B = behavior) to inform key elements of a national implementation strategy. RESULTS: Fifteen HCPs and fifteen patients participated. The analysis resulted in five lessons learned: 1) paternalistic decision\\\\making is a dominant practice in early RA, 2) patients need emotional support and access to educational tools to facilitate participation in shared decision\\\\making (SDM), 3) there are many logistical barriers to decision aid implementation in current care models, 4) flexibility is necessary for successful implementation, and 5) HCPs have limited interest in further training opportunities about decision aids. Implementation recommendations included the following: 1) making the decision aids directly available to patients (O) and providing SDM education (C/M), 2) creating an SDM rheumatology curriculum (C/O/M), 3) using decision coaches or patient partners as peer support (C/O/M), 4) linking decision aids to living rheumatology guidelines (M), and 5) designing trials of patient decision aid/SDM interventions to evaluate patient\\\\important outcomes (O/M).

Recent collative studies have indicated the role of activation of Abl and Abl-related genes in solid tumors; further terming the Abl kinases as molecular switches which promote proliferation, tumorigenesis, and metastasis. The up-regulated Abl-kinase expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) and the role of Abl tyrosine kinase activity in the Matrigel invasion of CRC cells have cemented its significance in CRC advancement. Therefore, the requisite of identifying small molecules which serve as Abl selective inhibitors and designing anti-Abl therapies, particularly for CRC tumors, has driven this study. Curcumin has been touted as an effective inhibitor of cancer cells; however, it is limited by its physicochemical inadequacies. Hence, we have studied the behavior of heterocyclic derivatives of curcumin via computational tools such as pharmacophore-based virtual screening, molecular docking, free-energy binding, and ADME profiling. The most actively docked molecule, 3,5-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methylstyryl)-1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamide, was comparatively evaluated against Curcumin via molecular dynamics simulation using Desmond, Schr?dinger. The study exhibited the improved stability of the derivative as compared to Curcumin in the tested protein pocket and displayed the interaction bonds with the contacted key amino acids. To further establish the claim, the derivatives were synthesized via the mechanism of cyclization of Curcumin and screened in vitro using SRB assay against human CRC cell line, HCT 116. The active derivative indicated an IC(50) value of 5.85 M, which was sevenfold lower as compared to Curcumins IC(50) of 35.40 M. Hence, the results base the potential role of the curcumin derivative in modulating Abl-kinase activity and in turn may have potential therapeutic value as a lead for CRC therapy.

As the pandemic has progressed, evidence has emerged reconfirming the value of human milk and the importance of protecting and supporting breastfeeding, especially the initiation of lactation. However, it is clear that COVID-19 has changed the clinical care paradigm around breastfeeding and lactation support and, as such, it is imperative that practices adapt and evolve to maintain the emphasis on lactation support. We participated in a round table conference aiming to rescue and develop protocols and practices that support breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic. One key area to target will be to maximize the use of the antenatal period. The early identification of lactation risk factors together with the development of person-centered methods to deliver breastfeeding information and education to parents-to-be will be critical. In addition, the establishment of a hospital culture that values breastfeeding and prioritizes the use of human milk will be integral for the motivation of health care professionals. That culture will also support active management of the initiation of lactation and the development of a 'back-up plan' toolkit to support the mother experiencing lactation difficulties. Post-discharge support will also be crucial with the development of both in-person and virtual lactation support programs, in particular for the immediate post-discharge period to benefit mothers who experience an early discharge process. These measures will allow for a new, adapted framework of practice that acknowledges the current COVID-19 paradigm and maintains the emphasis on the need to protect and support breastfeeding and the use of human milk.","output":"Updating Clinical Practices to Promote and Protect Human Milk and Breastfeeding in a COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"First Person is a series of interviews with the first authors of a selection of papers published in Disease Models & Mechanisms, helping early-career researchers promote themselves alongside their papers.

We aimed to find whether the characteristics of dental care provided to children at the Department of Pediatric Dentistry at Hadassah medical center, Jerusalem, Israel, differed between the periods, before COVID-19 outbreak, during the lockdown period and during the period that followed it. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed computerized records of patients who visited the pediatric dental clinic at three different periods: pre-lockdown period, lockdown period, and post-lockdown period. Results: Nine-hundred and forty-nine children were included in the study; most of them were healthy children between 3 and 6 years old. During lockdown, all scheduled appointments except for treatments under general anesthesia and deep sedation were canceled due to the government's restrictions; the frequency of treatments with non-pharmacological behavior management, general anesthesia or deep sedation was higher than in the previous or subsequent periods and the use of inhaled/conscious sedation was significantly lower. During lockdown most of the children were diagnosed with dentoalveolar abscess (32.3%), compared to 14 and 21% at the previous or subsequent periods, respectively (P < 0.001). Treatments combination during lockdown included more extractions, pulpectomies and pulp extirpation and less permanent restorations (P < 0.001).

RESULTS: The willingness to be vaccinated was about 67% and increased with the proportion of peers and acquaintances who were willing to be vaccinated and had trust in the Robert Koch Institute; willingness was higher in members of a risk group, and in cases where there was an expectation of dangerous consequences of an infection. Experience with infection among the respondents or in peer-groups increased the willingness to be vaccinated. Men had a higher willingness to be vaccinated. The willingness to be vaccinated increased consistently with the level of formal education (with the exception of people with a technical college entrance qualification).

It presents a unique therapeutic dilemma, as anticoagulation with heparin alone is insufficient to address the imbalance in fibrinolysis. And while the use of fibrinolytic agents could limit the disease severity, it is often associated with bleeding complications. There is a need for biomarkers that will guide the timely stratification of patients into those who may benefit from both anticoagulant and fibrinolytic therapies. PATIENT CONCERNS: All 3 patients presented with shortness of breath along with comorbidities predisposing them to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. One patient (Patient 3) also suffered from bilateral deep venous thrombosis. DIAGNOSES: All 3 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and were eventually diagnosed with respiratory failure necessitating intubation. INTERVENTIONS: All 3 patients required mechanical ventilation support, 2 of which also required renal replacement therapy. All 3 patients were also placed on anticoagulation therapy. OUTCOMES: In Patients 1 and 2, the initial D-dimer levels of 0.97ag/ml fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU) and 0.83ag/ml FEU were only slightly elevated (normal <0.50ag/ml FEU). They developed rising D-dimer levels to a peak of 13.21ag/ml FEU and >20.0ag/ml FEU, respectively, which dropped to 1.34ag/ml FEU 8 days later in Patient 1 and to 2.94ag/ml on hospital day 13 in Patient 2. In Patient 3, the D-dimer level on admission was found to be elevated to >20.00ag/ml FEU together with imaging evidence of thrombosis. And although he received therapeutic heparin infusion, he still developed pulmonary embolism (PE) and his D-dimer level declined to 5.91ag/ml FEU. Despite \\"improvement\\" in their D-dimer levels, all 3 patients succumbed to multi-system organ failure. On postmortem examination, numerous arterial and venous thromboses of varying ages, many consisting primarily of fibrin, were identified in the lungs of all patients. LESSONS: High D-dimer levels, with subsequent downtrend correlating with clinical deterioration, seems to be an indicator of fibrinolysis suppression.

This is an enveloped virus having a positive sense, single-stranded RNA genome; like the two earlier viruses SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus. COVID-19 is unique in that, in the severe case, it has the propensity to affect multiple organs, leading to multiple organ distress syndrome (MODS), and causing high morbidity and mortality in the extreme case. In addition, comorbidities like age, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and its complications, obesity, are risk factors for severe COVID-19. It turns out that a most plausible, simple, single explanation for this propensity for MODS is the pivotal involvement of the vascular endothelium (VE). This is a consequence of the fact that the VE seamlessly connects all the entire vascular bed in the body, thus linking all the target organs (heart, lungs, kidney, liver, brain) and systems. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to hyper-inflammation yielding uncontrolled production of a mixture of cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, oxidative stress, acute phase proteins (e.g., C-reactive protein), and other pro-inflammatory substances. In the extreme case, a cytokine storm is created. Displacement of the virus bound to the VE, and/or inhibition of binding of the virus, would constitute an effective strategy for preventing COVID-19. In this regard, the acetone-water extract of the leaf of the Neem (Azadirachta indica) plant has been known to prevent the adherence of malaria parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs) to VE; prevent cytoadherence of cancer cells in metastasis; and prevent HIV from invading target T lymphocytes. We therefore hypothesize that this Neem leaf acetone-water extract will prevent the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the VE, and therefore be an effective therapeutic formulation against COVID-19. It is therefore advocated herein that this extract be investigated through rigorous clinical trials for this purpose. It has the advantages of being (i) readily available, and renewable in favour of the populations positioned to benefit from it; (ii) simple to prepare; and (iii) devoid of any detectable toxicity.","output":"Anti-COVID-19 Potential of Azadirachta indica (Neem) Leaf Extract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 remains a serious disruption to human health, social, and economic existence.

This problem emerged in Lombardy, the Italian region where the pandemic exacted the heaviest toll. Study aims were to assess mental health of HW in Lombardy after the peak of COVID-19 related hospitalizations, through the joint evaluation of PTSD and positive mental health; and to explore the potential role of positive mental health in PTSD development. METHODS: HW completed an online survey including demographic and work-related information; PTSD Checklist for DSM-5; Mental Health Continuum Short-Form. Analyses comprised calculation of percentages of participants meeting a provisional PTSD and mental health diagnosis (flourishing, moderate, languishing); a binary logistic regression with demographics, work-related features, and positive mental health as predictors, and provisional PTSD diagnosis as outcome. RESULTS: Out of 653 participants, 39.8% received a provisional PTSD diagnosis; 33.4% reported flourishing, 57.7% moderate, and 8.9% languishing mental health. Regression analysis highlighted that women vs. men, nurses vs. technical/rehabilitation HW, frontline vs. second-line workers and languishing vs. moderately mentally healthy HW were more likely to receive a provisional PTSD diagnosis, whereas flourishing participants were more likely not to receive it. No role emerged for job seniority. LIMITATIONS: Self-reported PTSD scores, stress symptoms related to COVID-19 considered as a global stressor, cross-sectional study design. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest the potential usefulness of supporting vulnerable HW categories during massive disease outbreaks through emergency-focused professional training and psychological intervention addressing both positive mental health promotion and PTSD prevention.","output":"The relationship between post-traumatic stress and positive mental health symptoms among health workers during COVID-19 pandemic in Lombardy, Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More than 800,000 people in North America suffer a stroke each year, with ischemic stroke making up the majority of these cases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS In-house seasonal and pandemic influenza-specific polymerase chain reaction assays were introduced and/or developed at the Molecular Diagnosis Centre (MDC) at the National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore. These assays have been used to test all samples received from in-patients, out-patients, staff and visitors for suspected pandemic influenza A/H1N1/2009 infection. RESULTS Prior to the arrival of the pandemic A/H1N1/2009 virus in Singapore at the end of May 2009, seasonal influenza A/H3N2 predominated in this population, with very little seasonal influenza A/H1N1 and B viruses detected. Within about 1 month of its arrival in Singapore (mainly during June to July 2009), this pandemic virus rapidly displaced seasonal influenza A/H3N2 to become the predominant strain in the Singaporean population served by MDC/NUH. CONCLUSIONS Realtime molecular techniques have allowed the prompt detection of different influenza subtypes during this current pandemic, which has revealed the displacement/replacement of previously circulating seasonal subtypes with A/H1N1/2009. Although some of this may be explained by immunological cross-reactivity between influenza subtypes, more studies are required.","output":"Tracking the emergence of pandemic Influenza A/H1N1/2009 and its interaction with seasonal influenza viruses in Singapore."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study we estimated the environmental burden of eating away from home based on emission factors of food recipes consumed in different regions and countries within the United Kingdom.

As its neighbouring countries, Spain and France, it has been heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We estimated SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the entire country by universal serological testing under a lockdown environment. METHODS: A total of 77,543 inhabitants of Andorra were invited to participate in the study. From 4-28 May, 2020, two cross sectional serological surveys were conducted using a rapid serological test (nCOV IgG/IgM) on a finger prick blood sample in 59 drive-through or walk-through checkpoints, all over Andorra. We calculated seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and analysed the main sociodemographic factors associated with being seropositive. FINDINGS: 70,494 inhabitants (90.9% of the population) participated in at least one survey. Overall seroprevalence was 11.0%. The most affected age groups were those over 90 years old (15.2%) and 80-89 (13.8%), followed by adults 50-59 (13.6%) and adolescents 10-19 (13.7%). Most seropositive participants, 6,061 (95.1%), were asymptomatic before the surveys. The multivariable analysis showed that the odds of being seropositive was higher among seasonal workers (OR 2.41; 95% CI 1.07-5.45) or in the population living in La Massana region, a popular ski-related area (OR 2.66; 95% CI 2.44-2.89). A higher seroprevalence was observed in those familiar nuclei with greater numbers of cohabitants: 18% in families with 6 household members or more; 13% in medium size families (3/4/5 people) and 12% in small size (1 to 2 people) nuclei. INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the population of Andorra was high during the first wave of the pandemic. Seasonal workers and inhabitants based in La Massana presented a higher seroprevalence. Mass antibody screening allows to identify infection hotspots and should contribute to the design of tailored interventions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Andorra.

When caring for patients with tracheostomy, speech-language pathologists have significant exposure to mucosal surfaces, secretions, and aerosols that may harbor the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This tutorial provides guidance on practices for safely performing patient evaluation and procedures, thereby reducing risk of infection. Method Data were collated through review of literature, guidelines, and consensus statements relating to COVID-19 and similar high-consequent infections, with a focus on mitigating risk of transmission to health care workers. Particular emphasis was placed on speech-language pathologists, nurses, and other allied health professionals. A multinational interdisciplinary team then analyzed findings, arriving at recommendations through consensus via electronic communications and video conference. Results Reports of transmission of infection to health care workers in the current COVID-19 pandemic and previous outbreaks substantiate the need for safe practices. Many procedures routinely performed by speech-language pathologists have a significant risk of infection due to aerosol generation. COVID-19 testing can inform level of protective equipment, and meticulous hygiene can stem spread of nosocomial infection. Modifications to standard clinical practice in tracheostomy are often required. Personal protective equipment, including either powered air-purifying respirator or N95 mask, gloves, goggles, and gown, are needed when performing aerosol-generating procedures in patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection. Conclusions Speech-language pathologists are often called on to assist in the care of patients with tracheostomy and known or suspected COVID-19 infection.

We applied multiple regression models to evince any changes in the aforementioned questionnaire scores during and after lockdown with respect to the scores before lockdown. Students reported on average worse depressive symptoms during lockdown than 6 months before isolation (median increase in the BDI-2 score +2; IQR = -3, 6; ? = 0.09  0.03, p = 0.005), with students without any established diagnosis of psychopathology being affected the most. The regression models predict that 86.2% (IQR = 67.9, 91.4%) of students would not experience a clinically significant worsening of symptoms, while approximately 6% of our target population could develop more severe depressive symptoms. This study supports the view that depressive symptomatology may be aggravated during lockdown, but also highlights that after the lifting of lockdown any changes quickly vanished, as the BDI-2 scores were not different from the ones reported before lockdown.","output":"Students' mental health problems before, during, and after COVID-19 lockdown in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the Brazilian healthcare system, resulting in deferral of elective cardiac procedures and avoidance of medical care due to social distancing We aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on hospital admissions and death rates associated with coronary events in a Brazilian large-scale private health system Methods From March 18 - Sep 30, 2020 we evaluated the administrative database of UNIMED-BH, a cooperative Brazilian private insurance, with over 1 25 million clients from a large urban center We collected data from admissions in all owned and accredited hospitals related to urgent and elective coronary events (acute coronary syndromes, coronary interventions, clinical management of coronary artery disease and invasive diagnostic procedures) Admissions in 2020 were compared to the 2-year historical series (2018, 2019), and rates/100,000 were calculated considering the mean covered population Outcomes were assessed until October 15th, 15 days after the last enrollment Results In the 196-day period, the number of coronary admissions in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were, respectively, 2,789, 3,519 and 2,348, and patients had a median age of 67 [58-76] years, being 59% men The mean length of hospital stay was 6 79 3 days, and 27% had &gt;1 admission in 3 years The adjusted rates of admissions were 221, 278 and 184/100,000 clients, resulting in a significant 26% (95% CI 22 - 30) reduction in 2020 compared to the historical series (p&lt;0 001) The reduction was more pronounced from March to May (36%) - when social isolation started - compared to the peak of the pandemic (June to September, 19%) In-hospital mortality was also significantly higher in 2020 (5 4%, 95% CI 4 5 - 6 4) compared to 2018/2019 (3 6%, 95% CI 3 2 - 4 1), p&lt;0 001, despite the similar age (67 [57-76) vs 67 [58-76], p=0 15) and length of hospital stay (6 98 9 vs 6 79 5 days, p=0 43) Conclusion There was a significant decrease in admissions due to coronary events during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, in parallel with increased in-hospital mortality Deferral of elective procedures and avoidance of medical care possibly resulted in delayed presentation and unfavorable outcomes","output":"Reduction in Hospital Admissions Associated with Coronary Events during the Covid-19 Pandemic in the Brazilian Private Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen Introduccin: Se informa que la mayora de los ni?os afectados por SARS-CoV-2 cursan asintomticos y que en ellos la mortalidad por COVID-19 es baja; en Mxico se desconoce la informacin al respecto en este grupo de la poblacin.

We compared the effectiveness and safety of cold infusions (CI) and nasopharyngeal cooling (NPC) for cooling induction in stroke patients. METHODS A prospective, open-label, randomised (1:1), single-centre pilot trial with partially blinded safety endpoint assessment was conducted at the neurointensive care unit of Heidelberg University. Intubated stroke patients with an indication for therapeutic cooling and an intracranial pressure (ICP)/temperature brain probe were randomly assigned to CI (4C, 2L at 4L/h) or NPC (60L/min for 1 h). Previous data suggested a maximum decrease of tympanic temperature for CI (2.1L within 35 min) after 52 min. Therefore the study period was 1 hour (15 min subperiods I-IV). The brain temperature course was the primary endpoint. Secondary measures included continuous monitoring of neurovital parameters and extracerebral temperatures. Statistical analysis based on repeated-measures analysis of variance. RESULTS Of 221 patients screened, 20 were randomized within 5 months. Infusion time of 2L CI was 33  4 min in 10 patients and 10 patients received NPC for 60 min. During active treatment (first 30 min), brain temperature decreased faster with CI than during NPC (I: -0.31  0.2 versus -0.12  0.1C, P = 0.008; II: -1.0  0.3 versus -0.49  0.3C, P = 0.001). In the CI-group, after the infusion was finished, the intervention no longer decreased brain temperature, which increased after 3.5  3.3 min. Oesophageal temperature correlated best with brain temperature during CI and NPC. Tympanic temperature reacted similarly to relative changes of brain temperature during CI, but absolute values slightly differed. CI provoked three severe adverse events during subperiods II-IV (two systolic arterial pressure (SAP), one shivering) compared with four in the NPC-group, all during subperiod I (three SAP, one ICP). Classified as possibly intervention-related, two cases of ventilator failure occurred during NPC. CONCLUSIONS In intubated stroke patients, brain cooling is faster during CI than during NPC. Importantly, contrary to previous expectations, brain cooling stopped soon after CI cessation. Oesophageal but neither bladder nor rectal temperature is suited as surrogate for brain temperature during CI and NPC. Several severe adverse events in CI and in NPC demand further studying of safety. TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01573117.

Health-care settings have taken advantage of this growth and are maximizing its potential by introducing these technologies in their service delivery. These technologies have been applied to various settings such as training of health workers, screening patients, and care delivery. This chapter explores five major areas benefitting from these emerging technologies: (1) community outreach, challenging stigma, and spreading awareness, (2) youth mental health, (3) mental health in humanitarian settings, (4) clinical care and frontline health workers, and (5) technology for severe mental disorders. We close the chapter with a discussion of broad ethical considerations in LMICs, highlighting risks pertaining to misinformation, victimization, and widening health inequities.

To clarify the state of ventilation in ultrasonic exam rooms, as an index of ventilation rate, the carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in our exam rooms was measured. Methods We measured the CO2 concentration in each exam room before the examination and 0-15 minutes after end of the exam. The subjects were 70 cases (abdomen: 24, breast: 16, neck: 16, and musculoskeletal: 14). In infant cases, one parent accompanied the patient during the examination. Results The highest CO2 concentration was 2261 ppm, observed after the breast examination. In all cases, the CO2 concentration in the exam room was highest immediately after the examination or two minutes after. Almost all cases had recovered to within 120% of the pre-examination CO2 concentrations within 15 minutes after the examination. The average CO2 concentration after ultrasonography was significantly higher for breast examinations than others. Conclusions Even in a hospital with modern ventilation equipment, the CO2 concentration in the ultrasound room was high after the exam and it takes 15 minutes to recover to the pre-exam state.

Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) can improve exercise capacity and QoL in individuals with chronic lung disease; however, evidence on the effect of PR for patients with post-COIVD-19 was scarce. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of PR on lung impairment for patients with post-COVID-19. METHODS: Five databases were searched for all the published trials of PR for patients with post-COVID-19 from 2019 to October 2021. Data were extracted using a standardized form. The risks of bias of included studies were assessed using the Cochrane risk of the bias assessment tool. Data were synthesized where possible; otherwise, qualitative analysis was done. RESULTS: Among 6,000 retrieved studies, 3 studies with 233 patients after COVID-19 were included. The pooled estimate of PR effect on 6-min walk test (6-MWT) (50.41, 95% CI 34.34 to 66.48; p < 0.0001) was in favor of the experiment group with clinical importance. It is found that PR could improve the symptom of dyspnea and QoL; however, its effect on pulmonary function test was inconsistent across studies. The risk of bias of included studies varied, with major concerns on the risk of blinding of participants and interventions performers. CONCLUSION: The review showed that PR could improve exercise capacity measured by 6-MWT among patients with mild-to-moderate lung impairment after COVID-19. The interpretation of effects on lung function, dyspnea, and QoL should be cautious due to inadequate and conflicting data reported across studies.

We previously reported the directed differentiation of human PSCs into epidermal stem and progenitor cells (ESPCs) and 3D epidermis to model the inherited syndrome Fanconi anemia (FA), wherein epidermal cell-junctional defects discovered using this system were validated in patient populations. Here, we describe in detail the corresponding protocol for generating PSC-derived keratinocytes using a distinct, normal PSC line (209.2 PSC). METHODS AND RESULTS Our approach modifies previous protocols to minimize spontaneous cell death and terminal differentiation, eliminate cell stress-inducing keratinocyte selection steps, and reduce total protocol duration and cost. Independent donor-derived PSC lines were converted into ESPCs through the addition of relevant morphogens and a ROCK inhibitor. Results for the 209.2 PSC line highlight consistencies in 2D and also variable features in 3D epidermis compared to the previously published FA-PSC lines. 209.2 PSC-derived ESPCs exhibited a basal cell phenotype while maintaining the capacity to form epidermal organotypic rafts with morphology consistent with fetal epidermis. Transcriptional analyses demonstrated 209.2 ESPCs express epidermis-selective markers and not early endoderm markers, thus supporting an immature stage of p63+ epidermal development. CONCLUSIONS This protocol provides an accelerated path for the generation of human ESPCs and 3D epidermal models to study normal epidermal development and homeostasis, elucidate mechanisms of epidermal disease pathogenesis, and provides a platform for developing personalized therapies.","output":"Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into epidermal stem and progenitor cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This commentary excerpts from the research report A threat to public safety: policing, racism and the Covid-19 pandemic, carried out by the Centre on the Dynamics of Ethnicity (CoDE) and published by the Institute of Race Relations in September 2021.

Although scientific articles on this largest social move are scanty, it resulted in benefiting the deteriorated environment to revive back. Many environmental indices such as lowering NO2 and CO2 emissions and reduction in particulate matters in air as a result of less human activities have led to clean air and pollution free water in many countries. Undoubtedly, the world was experiencing pollution in several countries due to mainly human activities including urbanization, industrialization, fossil fuel exhaustion etc. Under such situation a special (natural) a protective measure was awaited to fix environmental issues.

Although 10C20% of patients with COVID-19 have severe symptoms, little is known about the risk factors related to the aggravation of COVID-19 symptoms from asymptomatic or mild to severe disease states. METHODS: This retrospective study included 211 patients who were asymptomatic or with mild presentations of COVID-19. We evaluated the differences in demographic and clinical data between the cured (discharged to home) and transferred (aggravated to severe-stage COVID-19) groups. RESULTS: A multivariate logistic analysis showed that body temperature, chills, initial chest X-ray findings, and the presence of diabetes were significantly associated with predicting the progression to severe stage of COVID-19 (p < 0.05). The odds ratio of transfer in patients with COVID-19 increased by 12.7-fold for abnormal findings such as haziness or consolidation in initial chest X-ray, 6.32-fold for initial symptom of chills, and 64.1-fold for diabetes.

In other models, aortic stiffness is improved after the reduction of inflammation. We aimed to evaluate the mid- and long-term effects of COVID-19 on vascular and cardiac autonomic function. The primary outcome was aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV). METHODS: The cross-sectional Study-1 included 90 individuals with a history of COVID-19 and 180 matched controls. The longitudinal Study-2 included 41 patients with COVID-19 randomly selected from Study-1 who were followed-up for 27 weeks. RESULTS: Study-1: Compared with controls, patients with COVID-19 had higher aPWV and brachial PWV 12 to 24 (but not 25-48) weeks after COVID-19 onset, and they had higher carotid Young's elastic modulus and lower distensibility 12 to 48 weeks after COVID-19 onset. In partial least squares structural equation modeling, the higher the hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) at hospitalization was, the higher the aPWV 12 to 48 weeks from COVID-19 onset (path coefficient: 0.184; P=0.04). Moreover, aPWV (path coefficient: -0.186; P=0.003) decreased with time. Study-2: mean blood pressure and carotid intima-media thickness were comparable at the end of follow-up, whereas aPWV (-9%; P=0.01), incremental Young's elastic modulus (-17%; P=0.03), baroreflex sensitivity (+28%; P=0.049), heart rate variability triangular index (+15%; P=0.01), and subendocardial viability ratio (+12%; P=0.0110-4) were significantly improved. There was a trend toward improvement in brachial PWV (-6%; P=0.14) and carotid distensibility (+18%; P=0.05). Finally, at the end of follow-up (48 weeks after the onset of COVID-19) aPWV (+6%; P=0.04) remained significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 than in control subjects.

Despite this, it has one of the lowest vaccination rates globally and contributes to the largest pool of under-vaccinated children in the world. Why is the vaccination rate low in India? This paper explores the importance of historical events in shaping current vaccination practices in India. We examine India's aggressive family planning program implemented during the emergency rule in the 1970s, under which millions of individuals were sterilized forcefully. We find that greater exposure to the forced sterilization policy has negative effects on the current vaccination rate. We also find that institutional delivery and antenatal care are currently low in states where policy exposure was high. Together, the evidence suggests that the forced sterilization policy had a persistent effect on current health-seeking behavior in India.","output":"Why is the Vaccination Rate Low in India?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has potential to disrupt and burden the mental health care system, and to magnify inequalities experienced by mental health service users. METHODS: We investigated staff reports regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in its early weeks on mental health care and mental health service users in the UK using a mixed methods online survey. Recruitment channels included professional associations and networks, charities, and social media. Quantitative findings were reported with descriptive statistics, and content analysis conducted for qualitative data. RESULTS: 2,180 staff from a range of sectors, professions, and specialties participated. Immediate infection control concerns were highly salient for inpatient staff, new ways of working for community staff. Multiple rapid adaptations and innovations in response to the crisis were described, especially remote working. This was cautiously welcomed but found successful in only some clinical situations. Staff had specific concerns about many groups of service users, including people whose conditions are exacerbated by pandemic anxieties and social disruptions; people experiencing loneliness, domestic abuse and family conflict; those unable to understand and follow social distancing requirements; and those who cannot engage with remote care. CONCLUSION: This overview of staff concerns and experiences in the early COVID-19 pandemic suggests directions for further research and service development: we suggest that how to combine infection control and a therapeutic environment in hospital, and how to achieve effective and targeted tele-health implementation in the community, should be priorities.

However, it was not known whether the same coding mechanisms apply when using electrical stimulation, which recruits a different spectrum of afferents. Here, we demonstrate that the predictions of the burst gap coding model for frequency perception apply to burst stimuli delivered with electrical pulses, re-emphasising the importance of the temporal structure of spike patterns in neural processing and perception of tactile stimuli. Reciprocally, the electrical stimulation data confirm that the results observed with mechanical stimulation do indeed depend on neural processing mechanisms in the central nervous system, and are not due to skin mechanical factors and resulting patterns of afferent activation.","output":"Temporal patterns in electrical nerve stimulation: Burst gap code shapes tactile frequency perception."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the criminal justice activism of tennis star Naomi Osaka as it evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding matters of police violence and racial justice.

One in five tuberculosis (TB) deaths occurs in individuals who have contracted human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, other risk factors play a role in its morbidity pattern. Therefore, descriptions of these comorbidities between TB, HIV, and other risk factors such as diabetes are needed. Method A retrospective, descriptive study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of TB and its relationship with some risk factors (HIV, diabetes, race, ethnicity, end-stage renal disease, post-organ transplant, recent contact with active TB, and other non-HIV immunosuppressive conditions) using data from three South Florida counties (Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach) from 2010 to 2019 retrieved from the CDCs Report of Verified Case of Tuberculosis (RVCT). Results A total of 2437 cases of TB were reported between 2010 and 2019. There was approximately a 14% positive rate among the three counties for HIV. In contrast, 47% of the individuals with active TB in all three counties were also diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. An average of 25% of the active TB cases in these counties had a concurrent immunosuppressive condition other than HIV. Known contact with another active TB case was an identified risk factor in 18%, 17%, and 29% of reported TB cases in Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties, respectively. Discussion The HIV status of patients with TB in these three counties was predominantly negative, in contrast to initial theories. The presence of diabetes mellitus was associated with a diagnosis of TB or latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) within the studied population. Conclusion Screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), compliance, and promotion of LTBI management in newly diagnosed and uncontrolled diabetics may be a successful prevention strategy for this high-risk group.","output":"Analysis of Some Risk Factors of Active Tuberculosis in Three South Florida Counties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is posing a great challenge worldwide.

The maternal mortality ratio increased from 669 in 2004 against 782 in 2011, an increase of almost 17%. The 2004 and 2011 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) also showed that the systematization of antenatal care consultations and the reduction of disparities in the utilization of prenatal health services have an important role in reducing maternal mortality. OBJECTIVE: This study attempts to understand the dynamics of inequalities linked to the demand for antenatal care as well as its determinants between 2004 and 2011. METHOD: The mother, child and of the newborn health data from the 2004 DHS and 2011 have been used. The design of these two surveys was an area sampling, the two-stage sampling. The target population for this study was women of reproductive age [15-49 years of age] who had had at least one live birth in the five years preceding the survey. In order to solve the problem, the concentration curve method, a multiple component analysis and a multilevel analysis were used. RESULTS: The study showed that disparities in demand for antenatal services did exist in 2004 and 2011. However, the level of these disparities remained the same during the two reference periods. In addition, the determinants of these disparities are the region of residence, the level of education of the woman and the level of education of the husband, the level of well-being of the woman and the sex of the household head.

It examines prominent concepts of mental health and their relationship to wellbeing, setting this in a discussion of 'mentally healthy' schools, mental health in special educational needs and whole-school approaches. This analysis shows how the relationship between mental health and wellbeing has not been adequately worked out, using this as the basis for arguing for the dual-factor mental health model which separates mental illness/disorder from wellbeing as two related dimensions. The paper then translates the dual-factor model into a two-dimensional framework that represents the distinctive but related aims of school education (wellbeing promotion) and mental health services (preventing, coping, helping mental health difficulties). This framework involves a complex conception of wellbeing, with schools playing an important role in promoting wellbeing (beyond emotional wellbeing), tiered models and establishing school-wide social emotional learning. It is about a whole-school curriculum approach that involves considering what is to be learned and how it is taught.

Wars inflict particularly severe damage to productivity, while financial crises also lead to substantial losses, especially accompanied by a rapid build-up of debt. The greater frequency of natural disasters, especially climate disasters, means that they have the largest aggregate impact on productivity, as natural disasters have occurred most often and their frequency has doubled since 2000. Global adverse events can have large sustained negative effects on productivity through dislocating labor, tightening of credit, disrupting value chains, and decreasing innovation.

Furthermore, some insectivorous bat species may be important reservoirs of SARS coronavirus, whereas Ebola virus has been detected in some megachiropteran fruit bats. Thus far, European bat lyssavirus (EBLV) is the only zoonotic virus that has been detected in bats in Europe. New zoonotic viruses may emerge from bat reservoirs and known ones may spread to a wider geographical range. To assess future threats posed by zoonotic viruses of bats, there is a need for accurate knowledge of the factors underlying disease emergence, for an effective surveillance programme, and for a rapid response system. In Europe, primary efforts should be focussed on the implementation of effective passive and active surveillance systems for EBLVs in the Serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus, and Myotis species (i.e., M. daubentonii and M. dasycneme). Apart from that, detection methods for zoonotic viruses that may emerge from bats should be implemented. Analyses of data from surveillance studies can shed more light on the dynamics of bat viruses, (i.e., population persistence of viruses in bats). Subsequently, studies will have to be performed to assess the public health hazards of such viruses (i.e., infectivity and risk of infection to people).

It is currently unclear how water in the LNP core interacts with the mRNA and to what extent the degradation prone sites of mRNA are protected through a coat of ionizable cationic lipids. To improve the stability of mRNA-LNP vaccines, optimization of the mRNA nucleotide composition should be prioritized.

There are significant gaps in the current understanding of whether SARS-CoV-2 attacks the CNS directly or through activation of the peripheral immune system and immune cell infiltration. Although the modality of neurological impairments associated with COVID-19 has not been thoroughly investigated, the latest studies have observed that SARS-CoV-2 induces neuroinflammation and may have severe long-term consequences. Here we review the literature on possible cellular and molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced-neuroinflammation. Activation of the innate immune system is associated with increased cytokine levels, chemokines, and free radicals in the SARS-CoV-2-induced pathogenic response at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). BBB disruption allows immune/inflammatory cell infiltration into the CNS activating immune resident cells (such as microglia and astrocytes).

Qualitative data revealed that increases in cannabis and alcohol use were largely attributed to changes in employment and staying at home resulting in fewer impediments and boredom. Themes of loneliness and utilization of various coping strategies were more pronounced among those who increased cannabis and/or alcohol use. For some, increases in cannabis/alcohol use were temporary until participants adjusted to a new normal or embraced more adaptive coping strategies.

The impact of the virus has worsened the difficulties already confronting residents of the fast-growing cities of the developing world already suffering from many challenges, such as inadequate housing, growing poverty, poor urban environmental management, and high levels of unemployment and underemployment. As authorities introduced restrictive measures to curb the spread of the virus, the low-income people appear to be affected by the measures more than the high-income groups. One of the interventions municipal and national leaders have introduced are limitations to movements, commonly known as lock downs. Together with these lock downs has been closures of spaces where low-income vendors and other informal traders operate. How are low-income urban residents being affected by these restrictive measures? Using field observations, newspaper reports and interviews with traders as well as key informants the article examines the changing typology of informal trade under the lockdown conditions. A key finding of the study is that under a restricted trading environment, the means for carrying bulky stock and a quick get-away is giving advantage to traders on wheels. Bringing wares to sites and traveling back home now requires own transport. The well-to-do traders are replacing poor vendors. ? 2021 The Author(s).

However, a bottleneck remains in the poor understanding of the parameters that correlate with endosomal escape versus cytotoxicity. To address this problem, we compared the endosomal distribution of six LNP-mRNA formulations of diverse chemical composition and efficacy, similar to those used in mRNA-based vaccines, in primary human adipocytes, fibroblasts, and HeLa cells. Surprisingly, we found that total uptake is not a sufficient predictor of delivery, and different LNPs vary considerably in endosomal distributions. Prolonged uptake impaired endosomal acidification, a sign of cytotoxicity, and caused mRNA to accumulate in compartments defective in cargo transport and unproductive for delivery. In contrast, early endocytic/recycling compartments have the highest probability for mRNA escape. By using super-resolution microscopy, we could resolve a single LNP-mRNA within subendosomal compartments and capture events of mRNA escape from endosomal recycling tubules. Our results change the view of the mechanisms of endosomal escape and define quantitative parameters to guide the development of mRNA formulations toward higher efficacy and lower cytotoxicity.","output":"Endosomal escape of delivered mRNA from endosomal recycling tubules visualized at the nanoscale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) are considered valuable for regenerative therapy. Although glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) is known to play a critical role in cell differentiation, its mechanism of the odontogenic differentiation of hDPSCs remains unclear. This study was conducted to investigate the effect and underlying mechanisms of GLUT1 on odontogenic differentiation of hDPSCs. hDPSCs was treated with phloretin (Phl), a GLUT1 inhibitor. The impact of GLUT1 on the odontogenic differentiation of hDPSCs was analysed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, alizarin-red staining, and western blotting. Glucose uptake by hDPSCs was significantly inhibited by Phl treatment. Overall, inhibition of GLUT1 upregulated the expression of DSPP, DMP1, RUNX2, and OCN and increased the formation of mineralised nodules on odontogenic induction of hDPSCs. The levels of phosphorylated mTOR and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K) were increased after GLUT1 inhibition and decreased by an mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin, Rapa) during the odontogenic induction of hDPSCs. Moreover, mTOR suppression decreased the expression of the genes described above and formation of mineralised nodules. These results suggest that inhibition of GLUT1 promoted the odontogenic differentiation of hDPSCs via the mTORC1-p70S6K axis, providing a foundation for further application of hDPSCs in regenerative therapy.","output":"The GLUT1-mTORC1 axis affects odontogenic differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to understand the experiences of advanced practice nurses (APNs) in the UK during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in relation to safety, shortages and retention. DESIGN: A cross-sectional, mixed-methods survey. SETTING: APNs in any UK setting. PARTICIPANTS: The survey was sent to an existing UK-wide cohort of APNs. 124 APNs responded (51%). RESULTS: UK-based APNs in this study reported shortages of staff (51%) and personal protective equipment (PPE) (68%) during the first 3 months of the coronavirus outbreak. Almost half (47%) had considered leaving their job over the same 3 months. Despite difficulties, there were reports of positive changes to working practice that have enhanced care. CONCLUSION: UK APNs report COVID-19-related shortages in staff and equipment across primary and secondary care and all regions of the UK. Shortages of PPE during a pandemic are known to be a factor in the development of mental health sequelae as well as a risk factor for increased turnover and retention issues. Half of APNs surveyed were considering a change in job. The UK risks a further crisis in staff morale and retention if this is not acknowledged and addressed.

The most commonly applied therapeutic intervention in cardiac rehabilitation is Schultzs autogenic training, which has proven to be of little efficacy in reducing depression and anxiety disorders. At the same time, a growing number of scientific reports have been looking at the use of virtual reality (VR) to treat mental health problems. This study aimed at assessing the efficacy of virtual therapy in reducing levels of depression, anxiety, and stress in female CVD patients. Materials and Methods: The study included 43 women who were randomly divided into two groups: experimental group (N = 17), where eight-week cardiac rehabilitation was enhanced with VR-based therapeutic sessions, and control group (N = 26), where the VR therapy was replaced with Schultzs autogenic training. Mental state parameters were measured using the Perception of Stress Questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: In the experimental group, the sole parameter which failed to improve was HADS-Anxiety, which remained at the baseline level. In the control group, there was a deterioration in nearly all tested parameters except for HADS-Depression. Statistically significant differences in the efficacy of rehabilitation were recorded in relation to the level of stress in the sub-scales: emotional tension (p = 0.005), external stress (p = 0.012), intrapsychic stress (p = 0.023) and the generalized stress scale (p = 0.004).

To date, no reliable biomarker is available with high significance and specificity for non-invasive detection of UBC. This study aimed to identify a CD44-linked microRNAs (miRNAs) (miR-9, miR-34a, miR-203) for non-invasive diagnosis of bladder cancer from other urinary tract malignancies. The expression of CD44-linked miRNAs was examined in serum, urine, and tissue specimens of Indian UBC patients (N = 25). For this purpose, healthy subjects (N = 25) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (N = 10) patients were taken as controls. The relative expression of miRNAs was analyzed in serum, urine, and tissue samples using real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The diagnostic potential of these miRNAs was accessed by plotting ROC curve. Increased miR-9 expression was observed in serum of UBC patients than healthy and BPH controls. In UBC patients, miR-34a expression was lower than healthy controls but non-significant as compared to BPH. miR-203 expression was considerably higher in serum of UBC patients but non-significant as compared to BPH controls. miR-203 was found to be considerably higher in urine samples from UBC patients as compared to BPH and healthy controls. The diagnostic potential of these miRNAs was evaluated using the ROC curve. Higher miR-203 levels in the urine of Indian UBC patients demonstrate its non-invasive diagnostic ability out of the three miRNAs studied.

The thermal image captured from the thermal camera is used to determine the potential people in the image (of the massive crowd in a city), which might have COVID-19, based on the temperature recorded. An efficient hybrid approach for a face recognition system is proposed to detect the people in the image having high body temperature from infrared images captured in real-time. Also, a face mask detection scheme is introduced, which detects whether a person has a mask on the face or not. The schemes performance evaluation is done using various machine learning and deep learning classifiers. We use the edge computing infrastructure (onboard sensors and actuators) for data processing to reduce the response time and real-time analytics and prediction.

Objective: This mixed-method study examined perceived public attitudes, personal beliefs, practice and stress toward facemask wearing as a preventive measure against COVID-19 among international University students from Hong Kong studying in the United Kingdom (UK) in the early stage (JanuaryCMarch 2020) of the pandemic. Methods: Our study included 2 parts: (i) an exponential, non-discriminative snowball sampling strategy was used to recruit 91 Chinese students studying in the UK to complete an online questionnaire survey, and (ii) online Zoom focus group interviews were conducted with 16 students who completed the online survey to gain an in-depth understanding of their experiences and coping methods during the pandemic. Results: Of the 91 students, 92.3% reported the UK public did not view facemask wearing as a preventive measure. 98.9% believed facemask wearing was an effective preventive measure, but 56% wore facemasks more than half of the time when out in public. 50.5% had internal conflicts of stress both when wearing and not wearing facemasks, which was more common in females than males [(62.5 vs. 31.5%), P = 0.004, Relative Risk (RR): 1.99 (1.17, 3.38)]. 61.5% reported public prejudiced attitudes against facemask wearing, also more common in females than males (71.4 vs. 45.7%), P = 0.02, RR: 1.56 (1.05, 2.32).

Abdominal closure complications are strongly associated with suture technique and material, in addition to other factors related to the patient and type of surgery performed. The traditional technique is to place the fascia sutures 1 cm apart and at least 1 cm away from the fascia edge. A Swedish study described a new technique of placing the sutures 5 mm apart and 5 mm away from the fascia edge, resulting in lower rates of abdominal wound complications. This study has a number of limitations. There is a need for improved quality evidence to convince the surgical community to change the closure technique of abdominal wounds aiming to reduce morbidity, which is exemplified in incisional hernias and other various postop complications. METHODS: This is a 1:1 randomized, controlled, patient- and assessor-blinded, parallel design, superiority trial, with a primary endpoint of incisional hernia at 1 year. The study will be conducted at AUBMC over a 3-year period. Patients planned for a non-emergent midline laparotomy for general surgery or vascular procedure will be randomized to either fascia closure technique. In order to detect a drop of 12% in the incidence of incisional hernia, with 80% power and an alpha of 0.05, we will need to recruit 114 patients per arm. After adjusting for loss to follow-up, target recruitment is 274 subjects. We will compare both arms for the primary, secondary, and exploratory outcomes, using chi-square or t test as appropriate. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression will be done. DISCUSSION: This trial will assess postop complications following abdominal midline wound closures via two different suturing techniques. This trial will generate evidence-based conclusions that will allow surgeons to assess the role of a new abdominal closure technique in decreasing short- and long-term postoperative complications, for a commonly performed procedure.

Health information systems (HIS) support the collection and use of health related data. However, HIS focus on reporting and are unfit to support decisions. Since data tools are paper-based in most primary healthcare settings, we have produced an innovative Paper-based Health Information System in Comprehensive Care (PHISICC) using a human-centred design approach. We are carrying out a cluster randomised controlled trial in three African countries to assess the effects of PHISICC compared with the current systems. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Study areas are in rural zones of C?te dIvoire, Mozambique and Nigeria. Seventy health facilities in each country have been randomly allocated to using PHISICC tools or to continuing to use the regular HIS tools. We have randomly selected households in the catchment areas of each health facility to collect outcomes data (household surveys have been carried out in two of the three countries and the end-line data collection is planned for mid-2021). Primary outcomes include data quality and use, coverage of health services and health workers satisfaction; secondary outcomes are additional data quality and use parameters, childhood mortality and additional health workers and clients experience with the system. Just prior to the implementation of the trial, we had to relocate the study site in Mozambique due to unforeseen logistical issues. The effects of the intervention will be estimated using regression models and accounting for clustering using random effects. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics committees in C?te dIvoire, Mozambique and Nigeria approved the trials. We plan to disseminate our findings, data and research materials among researchers and policy-makers. We aim at having our findings included in systematic reviews on health systems interventions and future guidance development on HIS.

The objective of this study was to use the digital image processing method to identify alveolar lesions in the lungs of rats submitted to chronic 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) inhalation exposure. We used forty adult male Wistar rats. The rats were divided into four groups: control group (CG), low concentration group (LCG), medium concentration group (MCG), and high concentration group (HCG). In a 6-month exposure period, we used two boxes connected to ultrasonic nebulizers for herbicide spraying. After this period, the rats were euthanized for the collection and study of lung tissue. For each image, counts of injuries and blisters were performed automatically using a methodology based on digital image processing techniques. For analysis of the results, an electronic database (Excel?) was created. We used the Pearson method for correlation analysis; values of p <0.05 were considered significant. In the evaluation of healthy alveoli, we recorded positive and significant correlations between analysis from a pathologist and computational analysis. In the evaluation of injured alveoli, we recorded a positive but non-significant correlation between analysis from a pathologist and computational analysis. These results show the effectiveness of digital image processing when evaluating alveolar integrity.","output":"Digital image processing: a useful tool in the analysis of lung injuries caused by chronic inhalation of agricultural herbicides"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Flavonoids are natural products widely recognized for their plurality of applications such as antiviral, antiproliferative, antitumor activities and, antioxidant properties.

There have been few previous studies conducted among Chinese populations on the correlations between loneliness, self-rated health, and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and their association with demographic characteristics. In this study, data were collected using quota sampling through survey interviews. Older people living in representative districts were recruited. Of the participants, 60.1% rated their health as average and 58.1% showed a high level of loneliness. IADL and self-rated health (SRH) were found to be moderately positively correlated, with r = 0.357, p < 0.001. A low negative correlation was found between the level of loneliness and IADL, with r = ?0.276; and SRH, with r = ?0.288, p < 0.05.

OBJECTIVE To measure the inspiratory pressure in mechanically ventilated patients suitable for weaning to determine the point at which the P(Imax) is achieved within 60 seconds of observation, and analyze factors associated with P(Imax) values. METHODS Measurement of P(Imax) was accomplished with a digital vacuometer with a unidirectional valve, which allows only exhalation (P(ImaxUV)). With this technique, values are registered and stored, remaining accessible whenever necessary. All patients were on mechanical ventilation, and met the criteria recommended by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society in 2007 to undergo weaning trial. RESULTS Eighty-four from the 87 enrolled patients completed the test. No patients reached the P(ImaxUV) in the first 20 seconds of observation. P(ImaxUV) was achieved between 20.1 and 40 seconds in 12 patients (14.0%), and between 40.1 and 60 seconds in 72 cases (86.0%). In a multivariate analysis model in which age, sex, days of mechanical ventilation, APACHE score, and respiratory drive (measured as airway-occlusion pressure 0.1 s after the start of inspiratory flow [P(0.1)]) were included, only age (P = .006) and P(0.1) (P = .003) were significantly associated with the values of P(ImaxUV). CONCLUSIONS Within an observation period of 60 seconds, the majority of patients reached the maximal inspiratory peak between 40.1 and 60 seconds. Older patients were found to have lower P(ImaxUV) values, whereas higher values for P(0.1) strongly correlated with higher P(ImaxUV) values.

Healthcare providers are at an increased risk for contracting the disease due to occupational exposure and require appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 respirators.

It has been postulated that patients with allergic rhinitis experience more pronounced symptoms and pathophysiology during URI than individuals without allergy. These observations have provided limited insight into the pathogenesis of URI in allergic patients. To better define these relationships several groups of investigators have examined the effect of experimental virus infection on volunteers with and without allergic rhinitis and with and without asthma. Lemanski et al. showed that Rhinovirus 16 (RV16) was able to modify bronchial hyperreactivity and late phase allergic asthmatic reactions. Calhoun et al. demonstrated that RV16 potentiated airway inflammation after segmental allergen bronchoprovocation in allergic subjects. Experimental RV16 infection also provoked a modest increase in histamine responsiveness accompanied by a modest increase in bronchial and intranasal lymphocytes and eosinophils. Yet, experimental RV16 infection did not trigger asthma or changes in spirometry or changes in bronchial reactivity to histamine or bradykinin in normal subjects. Studies in our laboratories using experimental Rhinovirus 39 (RV39) infection did not alter pulmonary measurements or methacholine responses in normal healthy allergic subjects. These results were surprising, as enhanced WBC histamine release was observed in the same RV39\\\\infected allergic subjects and was similar to that observed in RV16 infection described by others. The RV39\\\\infected allergic subjects also showed acute increases in serum IgE as well as changes of cellular immune parameters. Bardin et al. described more severe nasal symptoms as well as increased nasal albumin in allergic rhinitis subjects experimentally infected with RV16. However, allergic subjects infected with RV39 did not show a physiologic hyper\\\\responsiveness during a nonallergy season. Analysis of nasal secretions during RV39 infection did show more vascular permeability in allergic subjects. Experimental infection with RV39 and Influenza A has provoked eustachian tube obstruction, otitis media and rarely acute otitis. These studies of volunteers experimentally infected with virus suggest that atopy alone does not predispose to more severe symptoms but combining URI with allergen exposure enhanced allergen\\\\induced inflammation. Recent studies implicate cytokines as participants in these virus\\\\provoked responses. Increases in nasal lavage concentrations of IL\\\\6 were found during experimental URIs caused by RV39, Influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus and coincide with peaks in symptomatology and pathophysiology. Moreover, IL\\\\6 applied directly to the nasal mucosa in noninfected allergic subjects reproduced symptoms of rhinitis. Other studies have shown that IL\\\\10 secretion from peripheral blood white cells was impaired in allergic subjects after experimental infection with Influenza A.

Since there is no specific and effective treatment; early diagnosis and optimal isolation of the patient are of vital importance. Real-time polymerase chain reaction-based (RT-PCR) analyses do not achieve sufficient sensitivity in the diagnosis of the disease. METHODS: The data from 2217 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 between March 2020 and June 2020 and hospitalized or discharged with home isolation were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic data, comorbidities, PCR results, initial computed tomography (CT), laboratory values, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)/Lymphocyte ratio, initial treatments and last status were recorded. The diagnostic sensitivity of LDH/Lymphocyte ratio, which is the main purpose of the study, was analyzed statistically. RESULTS: In order to test the effectiveness of LDH/Lymphocyte ratio for COVID-19 for diagnostic purposes, CT results were considered as gold standard. The area under the curve (AUC) was found to be 0.706 (p < 0.001; cut-off > 0.06) (Sensitivity: 76.4, specificity: 59.60). For the evaluation of LDH/Lymphocyte ratio in terms of survival, AUC was found to be 0.749 (p < 0.001; cut-off > 0.21) (Sensitivity: 70.59, specificity: 73.88). CONCLUSION: Studies based on radiological findings have demonstrated that CT involvement has higher sensitivity.

Outcomes included the system usability scale, the patient enablement instrument (PEI), change in subjective symptoms (numerical rating scales), percentage adherence to prescribed exercise, and a semi-structured interview on utility. A significant reduction was found in symptoms of vertigo/dizziness (p < 0.004), imbalance (p < 0.002), oscillopsia (p < 0.04), and anxiety (p < 0.02) after use. System usability scores were high for both clinicians (mean 85/100) and participants (mean 82.7/100) and high enablement was reported (mean PEI 6.5/12). Overall percentage adherence to the exercise prescription was highly variable and ranged from 4 to 78% when measured digitally.

Due to the large number of infected patients and heavy labor for doctors, computer-aided diagnosis with machine learning algorithm is urgently needed, and could largely reduce the efforts of clinicians and accelerate the diagnosis process. Chest computed tomography (CT) has been recognized as an informative tool for diagnosis of the disease. In this study, we propose to conduct the diagnosis of COVID-19 with a series of features extracted from CT images. To fully explore multiple features describing CT images from different views, a unified latent representation is learned which can completely encode information from different aspects of features and is endowed with promising class structure for separability. Specifically, the completeness is guaranteed with a group of backward neural networks (each for one type of features), while by using class labels the representation is enforced to be compact within COVID-19/community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and also a large margin is guaranteed between different types of pneumonia. In this way, our model can well avoid overfitting compared to the case of directly projecting highdimensional features into classes. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms all comparison methods, and rather stable performances are observed when varying the number of training data.","output":"Diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) with Structured Latent Multi-View Representation Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Are new technologies in the medicine sector a driver to support the development of a society 5.0?

METHODS This is an analysis of data from 983 cases of type VII laparoscopic hysterectomy performed from September 1996 through August 2010. Demographic and surgical data were stratified by uterine weight (range 14-3,131 g) less than 250 g (n = 720) and 250 g or more (n = 263). Analyses were done by Pearson's (2), Wilcoxon rank-sum, and Kruskal-Wallis tests with significance set at 2-sided (p <.05). Outcomes examined include estimated blood loss, skin-to-skin operative time, complications (non-reoperative and reoperative), and duration of hospital stay. Estimated blood loss, skin-to-skin operative time, and length of hospital stay were further analyzed using backwards, stepwise, multivariable, linear regression to control for and identify independent predictors affecting these outcomes. Baseline demographic data were included in the multivariable model. Only covariates that were significant in both multivariable and univariable analyses are presented as statistically significant. DESIGN A case-controlled, retrospective study (Canadian Task Force Classification II-2). RESULTS Median operating time varied by uterine weight, with a shorter duration of surgery in patients with uteri less than 250 g at 97 minutes (range 29-330), and patients with uteri greater than 250 g at 135 minutes (range 45-345) (p <.001). Median estimated blood loss was also less in patients with uteri less than 250 g at 50 mL, (range 0-1400), than in patients with uteri weighing 250 g or more, at 150 mL, (range 0-2100) (p <.001). There was no significant difference by uterine weight in median duration of hospital stay of 1 day (range 0-13), total complication rate (7.0%), reoperative complications (3.7%), or non-reoperative complications (3.4%). Duration of surgery, volume of blood lost, and length of hospital stay all decreased with the surgeon's increasing experience.

METHODS Three independent reviewers searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and other sources between January 2000 and December 2020 for eligible published and unpublished studies in English and extracted data. Primary outcomes were caries increment, plaque levels, gingival health, reported frequency and/or amount of free sugars intake and oral hygiene behaviour. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane criteria. RESULTS Eight cluster RCTs met the inclusion criteria and had substantial heterogeneity. Three trials assessed caries increment and one found significant reductions in the intervention group. Another trial found similar benefits, but these were limited to children from high socioeconomic groups. The third trial found an increase in dental caries in the intervention group. Three studies reported significant reductions in plaque scores and improvements in gingival health with modest effects. Interventions delivered by peers (at adolescence) or with parents' involvement (at pre-adolescence) showed significant reductions in plaque scores compared to those delivered by dentists or teachers only. Most interventions showed significant improvements in self-reported behaviours. CONCLUSIONS There is limited evidence of clinical benefit to dental health from school-based behavioural interventions. There is a need to conduct well-designed trials of behavioural interventions that are theory-derived and include environmental elements (e.g. supervised toothbrushing).

The disease burden has been heterogeneous across regions of the world, with Americas leading in cumulative cases and deaths, followed by Europe, Southeast Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, Africa and Western Pacific. Initial responses to COVID-19 also varied between governments, ranging from proactive containment to delayed intervention. Understanding these variabilities allow high burden countries to learn from low burden countries on ways to create more sustainable response plans in the future. METHODS: This study used a mixed-methods approach to perform cross-country comparisons of pandemic responses in the United States (US), Brazil, Germany, Australia, South Korea, Thailand, New Zealand, Italy and China. These countries were selected based on their income level, relative COVID-19 burden and geographic location. To rationalize the epidemiological variability, a list of 14 indicators was established to assess the countries' preparedness, actual response, and socioeconomic and demographic profile in the context of COVID-19. RESULTS: As of 1 April 2021, the US had the highest cases per million out of the nine countries, followed by Brazil, Italy, Germany, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and China. Meanwhile, Italy ranked first out of the nine countries' total deaths per million, followed by the US, Brazil, Germany, Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, China and Thailand. The epidemiological differences between these countries could be explained by nine indicators, and they were 1) leadership, governance and coordination of response, 2) communication, 3) community engagement, 4) multisectoral actions, 5) public health capacity, 6) universal health coverage, 7) medical services and hospital capacity, 8) demography and 9) burden of non-communicable diseases. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic manifests varied outcomes due to differences in countries' vulnerability, preparedness and response. Our study rationalizes why South Korea, New Zealand, Thailand, Australia and China performed better than the US, Italy and Brazil. By identifying the strengths of low burden countries and weaknesses of hotspot countries, we elucidate factors constituting an effective pandemic response that can be adopted by leaders in preparation for re-emerging public health threats.","output":"The heterogeneity of the COVID-19 pandemic and national responses: an explanatory mixed-methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We aim to describe the demographics, clinical presentation, hospital course, and severity of pediatric inpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with an emphasis on healthy, immunocompromised, and chronically ill children. METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of hospitalized children aged younger than 22 years with COVID-19 infection at Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center at Northwell Health. Cases were identified from patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms who underwent a nucleic acid amplification-based test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were identified. The median age was 10.3 years (interquartile range, 1.4 months to 16.3 years), with 48% of patients older than 12 years and 29% of patients younger than 60 days of age. Fever was present in 86% of patients, lower respiratory symptoms or signs in 60%, and gastrointestinal symptoms in 62%. Thirty-five percent of patients required ICU care. The white blood cell count was elevated in severe disease (P = .0027), as was the C-reactive protein level (P = .0192), compared with mild and moderate disease. Respiratory support was required in 34% of patients. Severity was lowest in infants younger than 60 days of age and highest in chronically ill children; 79% of immunocompromised children had mild disease. One death was reported.

The pandemic is historic in scope and precedent given its emergence in an increasingly digital era. Importantly, there have been concerns about the accuracy of COVID-19 case counts due to issues such as lack of access to testing and difficulty in measuring recoveries. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to detect and characterize user-generated conversations that could be associated with COVID-19-related symptoms, experiences with access to testing, and mentions of disease recovery using an unsupervised machine learning approach. METHODS: Tweets were collected from the Twitter public streaming application programming interface from March 3-20, 2020, filtered for general COVID-19-related keywords and then further filtered for terms that could be related to COVID-19 symptoms as self-reported by users. Tweets were analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning approach called the biterm topic model (BTM), where groups of tweets containing the same word-related themes were separated into topic clusters that included conversations about symptoms, testing, and recovery. Tweets in these clusters were then extracted and manually annotated for content analysis and assessed for their statistical and geographic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 4,492,954 tweets were collected that contained terms that could be related to COVID-19 symptoms. After using BTM to identify relevant topic clusters and removing duplicate tweets, we identified a total of 3465 (<1%) tweets that included user-generated conversations about experiences that users associated with possible COVID-19 symptoms and other disease experiences. These tweets were grouped into five main categories including first- and secondhand reports of symptoms, symptom reporting concurrent with lack of testing, discussion of recovery, confirmation of negative COVID-19 diagnosis after receiving testing, and users recalling symptoms and questioning whether they might have been previously infected with COVID-19. The co-occurrence of tweets for these themes was statistically significant for users reporting symptoms with a lack of testing and with a discussion of recovery. A total of 63% (n=1112) of the geotagged tweets were located in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: This study used unsupervised machine learning for the purposes of characterizing self-reporting of symptoms, experiences with testing, and mentions of recovery related to COVID-19. Many users reported symptoms they thought were related to COVID-19, but they were not able to get tested to confirm their concerns. In the absence of testing availability and confirmation, accurate case estimations for this period of the outbreak may never be known.

Three main groups of strategies are: the use of solubilizers (change in pH, complexation and the use cosolvents/surfactants); incorporation of the drugs into a carrier nanosystem; modifications of the molecules themselves (use of salts or hydrophilic prodrugs). The use of high amounts of cosolvents and/or surfactants and pH decrease below 4 usually lead to local adverse effects, such as nasal and upper respiratory tract irritation. Cyclodextrins and (many) different carrier nanosystems, on the other hand, could be safer for intranasal administration at reasonably high concentrations, depending on selected excipients and their dose. While added attributes such as enhanced permeation, sustained delivery, or increased direct brain transport could be achieved, a great effort of optimization will be required. On the other hand, hydrophilic prodrugs, whether co-administered with a converting enzyme or not, can be used at very high concentrations, and have resulted in a fast prodrug to parent drug conversion and led to high brain drug levels.

Oklahoma will long be remembered by Indigenous Nations as one of the most powerful judicial statements in the history of federal Indian law: On the far end of the Trail of Tears was a promise. McGirt is a landmark United States Supreme Court decision that rejects Oklahomas century-long presumption that no Indian reservations remained in present-day Oklahoma. Acting on that presumption, Oklahoma had long exercised civil and criminal jurisdiction over most of the State, including Indians and non-Indians alike.In reaffirming the reservation boundaries of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, the Court rejected Oklahomas exercise of criminal jurisdiction over a major crime committed by an Indian within Indian country. The implications of the McGirt decision are potentially far-reaching and will likely extend to both criminal and civil jurisdiction of federal, state, local, and tribal governments. The reaffirmed reservations of the similarly situated Five Tribes collectively span half of the state of Oklahoma. This article explores one aspect of the potential civil jurisdictional implications of McGirt: the sovereign power of taxation. We include a detailed analysis of what has changed, and what remains the same for purposes of federal, tribal, state, and local taxing authority.McGirt is heralded as ushering in substantial changes for the eastern half of Oklahoma. However, in order for the Five Tribes to fully realize all treaty-based promises, the McGirt decision must lead to more than just increased criminal justice system responsibilities for the federal and tribal governments. The promise Justice Gorsuch highlights was not simply an empty promise of geographic boundaries, it also included a permanent homeland with fully functioning tribal governments, including the power of taxation. With the reaffirmation of reservation boundaries and the reassumption of many governmental responsibilities, the Five Tribes must necessarily have the power to raise meaningful revenue to govern. If the Five Tribes and Oklahoma play their collective economic cards right, big change could come in the form of positive economic outcomes. Economists predict, or at least hope for, a post-COVID economic revival for rural communities in Americas heartland. To assist in this economic revival, the Five Tribes reservations could serve as laboratories for the formulation of economic development strategies that could serve as blueprints for other parts of rural America. For that to happen in eastern Oklahoma, McGirt will need to live up to its full potential, becoming much more than an overturned criminal conviction from inside Indian country. This article suggests several law and policy choices available to the Five Tribes, including how to maximize tax incentives to grow the reservation population base and support a diverse economy through small business and enterprise scale development. The article includes a call to action for tribal governments to formulate long-term economic strategies that will take advantage of tax attributes that attach to the various reaffirmed reservations. In conclusion, the article suggests possible compact arrangements with other Indigenous nations and with Oklahomas state and local governments. If the challenge of sovereignty is accepted, the Five Tribes have an opportunity to reconfirm and expand government powers that have been denied them for over a century, including the power to make the same sovereign tax choices afforded other sovereigns worldwide.","output":"A Wealth of Sovereign Choices: Tax Implications of McGirt v.

Papers have been selected in accordance with the predefined criteria. As a result, a total of 59 articles have been determined for the search criteria and the findings obtained were analyzed. Most frequently used research trends and methods on service quality in logistics have been identified. In addition, the most frequently used LSQ dimensions and factors have been reviewed. Moreover, the most frequently used service quality approaches and measurement models have been analyzed. The results received from systematic literature review have been composed and dimensions have been identified. Semi-structured interviews with LSPs and customers of LSPs in Germany-based companies have been conducted to strengthen the findings gained from systematic literature review. 5 LSQ dimensions and 24 factors have been formed with the help of semi-structured interviews. This paper represents the basis for further research for empirical studies and can be used as a guideline for quality management practices in logistics applications and transport.","output":"Assessment of logistics service quality dimensions: a qualitative approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 alpha variant shedding and immune responses at the nasal mucosa remain poorly characterised. METHODS: We measured infectious viral release, antibodies and cytokines in 426 PCR+ nasopharyngeal swabs from individuals harboring non-alpha or alpha variants. FINDINGS: With both lineages, viral titers were variable, ranging from 0 to >10(6) infectious units. Rapid antigenic diagnostic tests were positive in 94% of samples with infectious virus. 68 % of individuals carried infectious virus within two days after onset of symptoms. This proportion decreased overtime. Viable virus was detected up to 14 days. Samples containing anti-spike IgG or IgA did not generally harbor infectious virus. Ct values were slightly but not significantly lower with alpha. This variant was characterized by a fast decrease of infectivity overtime and a marked release of 13 cytokines (including IFN-b, IP-10 and IL-10). INTERPRETATION: The alpha variant displays modified viral decay and cytokine profiles at the nasopharyngeal mucosae during symptomatic infection.

In particular, health workers have been forced to change their activities both for the different needs of patients and for preventive measures against the spread of the virus. This study is aimed at comparing the urgent psychiatric consultations (UPC) performed at the outpatient Mental Health Center (MHC) of Modena during the coronavirus outbreak period, from 1 March to 31 August 2020, with the same period in 2019. We retrospectively collected in a database the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who required UPC in the MHC during the 6-month observation periods in both 2019 and 2020. Data were statistically analyzed. We analyzed 656 urgent psychiatric consultations in 2019 and 811 in 2020, requested by 425 patients in 2019 and 488 in 2020, respectively. In the pandemic period, we observed an increase in the total and daily number of UPC which were more frequently required by patients in care at local outpatient services in comparison with the previous period. During 2020, an increased number of UPC was carried out remotely and the outcome was more frequently represented by discharge at home, avoiding hospitalization as much as possible. In the course of the coronavirus pandemic, MHC had to face an increased demand for clinical activity especially from the most clinically and socially vulnerable patients, who more frequently required UPC in outpatient psychiatric services.","output":"Urgent Psychiatric Consultations at Mental Health Center during COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Logistics is a sector which is continuously growing, due to globalization, as well as the current situation caused by the Covid In this article, an application to recognize boxes is described The characteristics are extracted with the goal of identify the opening side of the box by using computer vision techniques This goal has been achieved considering the dimensions, as well as, the position in the space of the box Those characteristics were obtained processing 2D and 3D images Then, this information has been classified by using a decision tree based on the human knowledge The probability of each of the six faces to be the opening side is obtained This article is a base to develop in the future an application in which the humanoid robot TEO is capable to learn the optimal way to find the opening of boxes and bimanipulate them to be opened in an automated system ? 2021 Universitat Politecnica de Valencia All rights reserved","output":"Principios bsicos para el desarrollo de una aplicacin de bi-manipulacin de cajas por un robot humanoide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19, caused by the 2019-nCoV infection) in December 2019 is one of the most severe public health emergencies since the founding of People's Republic of China in 1949.

We characterized the peripheral blood B cell immunophenotype and plasma antibody responses in 40 recovered non-hospitalized COVID-19 subjects that were enrolled as donors in a convalescent plasma treatment study. We observed a significant negative correlation between the frequency of peripheral blood memory B cells and the duration of symptoms for convalescent subjects.

Memory B cell frequency was significantly correlated with both IgG1 and IgM responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). IgM+ memory, but not switched memory, directly correlated with virus-specific antibody responses, and remained stable over time.

We compared the safety and reliability of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with transcranial Doppler (TCD) for cerebral monitoring. Methods This single-center, retrospective review was conducted on patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) using selective shunt-based TCD or NIRS at Daegu Catholic University Medical Center from November 2009 to June 2016. Postoperative complications were the primary outcome, and the distribution of risk factors between the 2 groups was compared. Results The medical records of 74 patients (45 TCD, 29 NIRS) were reviewed. The demographic characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. One TCD patient died within the 30-day postoperative period. Postoperative stroke (n=4, p=0.15) and neurologic complications (n=10, p=0.005) were only reported in the TCD group. Shunt usage was 44.4% and 10.3% in the TCD and NIRS groups, respectively (p=0.002). Conclusion NIRS-based selective shunting during CEA seems to be safe and reliable for monitoring cerebral perfusion in terms of postoperative stroke and neurologic symptoms.

Moreover, mice with targeted mutation of the Sirpa gene that renders it non-functional were more susceptible to infection with the New World arenaviruses Junn virus vaccine strain Candid 1 and Tacaribe virus, but not MLV or mNoV. All SIRPA-inhibited viruses have in common the requirement for trafficking to a low pH endosomal compartment. This was clearly demonstrated with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, which was only inhibited by SIRPA in cells in which it required trafficking to the endosome. Similar to its role in phagocytosis inhibition, SIRPA decreased virus internalization but not binding to cell surface receptors. We also found that increasing SIRPA levels via treatment with IL-4 led to even greater anti-viral activity.

However, the data from developing countries is limited. AIM: To evaluate psychological morbidity, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), fatigue, and perceived stigma among patients with COVID-19 after recovery from the acute phase of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: In a cross-sectional online survey, 206 adult patients (age>18 years), recovered from COVID-19 infection completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), 4 items self-designed questionnaire evaluating cognitive deficits and self-designed questionnaire to evaluate perceived stigma. Additionally, they completed the information about demographic and clinical information. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and PTSD in the study sample was 24.8 %, 23.8 %, and 30 % respectively. About three-fifths of the participants (61.2 %) had at least one fatigue symptom as per the FSS with the mean FSS score being 32.10  15.28. About one-fourth of the participants (23.7 %) reported feeling confused and always feeling mentally foggy, and 38 % of patients reported experiencing at least one cognitive problem. The level of felt stigma related to self was seen in 31.1 %, 20 % reported stigma related to family, and 50 % reported stigma in relation to neighbors and society. Those reporting higher PTSD scores had higher anxiety and depressive scores, reported more fatigue and stigma, and had a higher level of cognitive deficits. A higher fatigue score was also associated with higher anxiety, depression, and cognitive deficits. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that a significant proportion of patients after recovery from COVID-19 experience psychological morbidities, fatigue, cognitive problems, and stigma.

The mechanisms of coronavirus transmission and dissemination in the human body determine the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. An important problem is the possibility that viral particles overcome tissue barriers such as the intestine, respiratory tract, blood-brain barrier, and placenta. In this work, we will 1) consider the issue of endocytosis and the possibility of transcytosis and paracellular trafficking of coronaviruses across tissue barriers with an emphasis on the intestinal epithelium; 2) discuss the possibility of antibody-mediated transcytosis of opsonized viruses due to complexes of immunoglobulins with their receptors; 3) assess the possibility of the virus transfer into extracellular vesicles during intracellular transport; and 4) describe the clinical significance of these processes.

We investigated the role of the cellular response on the expression and antigenicity of DNA vaccines using a plasmid DNA construct expressing luciferase. Repeated intramuscular administration led to diminished luciferase expression, suggesting a role for immune mediated clearance of expression. To investigate the role of cell trafficking, we used the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulator, FTY720 (Fingolimod) which traps lymphocytes within the lymphoid tissues. When lymphocyte trafficking was blocked with FTY720, DNA transgene expression was maintained at a constant level for a significantly extended time period. Both continuous and staggered administration of FTY720 prolonged transgene expression. However, blocking lymphocyte egress during primary transgene administration did not result in an increase of transgene expression during secondary administration. Interestingly, there was a disconnect between transgene expression and immunogenicity, as increasing expression by this approach did not enhance the overall immune response. Furthermore, when FTY720 was administered alongside a DNA vaccine expressing the HIV gp140 envelope antigen, there was a significant reduction in both antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses. This indicates that the developing antigen-specific cellular response clears DNA vaccine expression but requires access to the site of expression in order to develop an effective immune response.","output":"Blocking T cell egress with FTY720 extends DNA vaccine expression but reduces immunogenicity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although the COVID-19 pandemic exposes frontline caregivers to severe prolonged stresses and trauma, there has been little clarity on how healthcare organisations can structure support to address these mental health needs. This article translates organisational scholarship on professionals working in organisations to elucidate why traditional approaches to supporting employee mental health, which often ask employees to seek assistance from centralised resources that separate mental health personnel from frontline units, may be insufficient under crisis conditions. We identify a critical but often overlooked aspect of employee mental health support: how frontline professionals respond to mental health services. In high-risk, high-pressure fields, frontline professionals may perceive mental health support as coming at the expense of urgent frontline work goals (ie, patient care) and as clashing with their central professional identities (ie, as expert, self-reliant ironmen/women). FINDINGS: To address these pervasive goal and identity conflicts in professional organisations, we translate the results of a multiyear research study examining the US Armys efforts to transform its mental health support during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We highlight parallels between providing support to frontline military units and frontline healthcare units during COVID-19 and surface implications for structuring mental health supports during a crisis. We describe how an intentional organisational design used by the US Army that assigned specific mental health personnel to frontline units helped to mitigate professional goal and identity conflicts by creating personalised relationships and contextualising mental health offerings. CONCLUSION: Addressing frontline caregivers mental health needs is a vital part of health delivery organisations response to COVID-19, but without thoughtful organisational design, well-intentioned efforts may fall short. An approach that assigns individual mental health personnel to support specific frontline units may be particularly promising.","output":"Structuring mental health support for frontline caregivers during COVID-19: lessons from organisational scholarship on unit-aligned support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With limited US federal leadership on closing and re-opening strategies to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, cities and states were left to enact their own policies.

The research was conducted based on the keywords \\"Coronavirus,\\" \\"COVID-19,\\" and \\"quarantine.\\" The references of the papers were also reviewed to find the ones not found in the databases. The guidelines published by reputable organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were used in this study. RESULTS Although quarantine is applied as an important and primary solution in the outbreak of epidemics, in cases of pandemics, it may not be free of negative effects on individuals and public health. However, because of the need to reopen and restart social and economic activities, some changes should be made in lifestyles and work activities. Using cyberspace and telework can be helpful. As the findings showed, COVID-19 bubbles can be used to restore social communications.

METHODS: To identify the most effective molecule out of a panel of 15 in silico designed siRNAs, an in vitro screening system based on vectors expressing SARS-CoV-2 genes fused with the firefly luciferase reporter gene and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells was used. The most potent siRNA, siR-7, was modified by Locked nucleic acids (LNAs) to obtain siR-7-EM with increased stability and was formulated with the peptide dendrimer KK-46 for enhancing cellular uptake to allow topical application by inhalation of the final formulation - siR-7-EM/KK-46. Using the Syrian Hamster model for SARS-CoV-2 infection the antiviral capacity of siR-7-EM/KK-46 complex was evaluated. RESULTS: We identified the siRNA, siR-7, targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) as the most efficient siRNA inhibiting viral replication in vitro. Moreover, we showed that LNA-modification and complexation with the designed peptide dendrimer enhanced the antiviral capacity of siR-7 in vitro.

METHODS: This prospective study was conducted between June 2011 and December 2013. Consecutive children with PPE/PE complicating community acquired pneumonia, who required diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis were included. Blood and pleural fluid samples for microbiological cultures were collected. Molecular methods were applied to identify Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and respiratory viruses in pleural fluid. RESULTS: The study group included 64 children, median age 4 (1C15). Seven of 64 (10.9%) blood cultures and 11 of 64 (17.2%) pleural fluid cultures revealed bacterial growth. The most common bacteria detected was S. pneumoniae (13 blood and pleural fluid samples from 11/64 (17.2%) children).

Identify home-based primary and palliative care practice adaptations to maintain care for homebound patients during the COVID-19 surge Original Research Background Much COVID-19 research focuses on care in institutional settings, but less is known about the care experiences of homebound patients receiving home-based primary and palliative care in the community. Before COVID-19, these patients faced high symptom burden, multiple comorbidities, and high mortality. Research Objectives To describe characteristics and care experiences of patients in a home-based medical care (HBMC) practice who died during New York City's (NYC) spring COVID-19 surge through a mixed-methods, retrospective electronic medical record (EMR) review. Methods We analyzed EMRs for all HBMC patients who died in the initial COVID-19 wave in NYC (March 1-June 30, 2020). We developed an abstraction tool to collect service-related measures (eg, phone calls, televisits), household and clinical characteristics (eg, dementia status), and clinical notes on key disruptions including those related to family caregiving, paid caregiving, medical supplies, and hospice. Results During the study period 112 patients died, twice the practice's usual monthly deaths. Thirty percent died from confirmed or suspected COVID-19, 73% died at home, and 46% were enrolled in hospice. Medical and service disruptions included medication shortages, delayed hospice enrollment, and suspension of nursing and hospice visits due to personal protective equipment and staff shortages. Caregivers experienced difficulties with long-distance care and frustration over service disruptions. HBMC providers adapted by conducting outreach via phone and telehealth and leveraging relationships with partners such as hospice and medical equipment vendors. Hospital restrictions and fear of infection increased caregivers and providers commitment to keeping patients at home at the end of life. Conclusion Disruptions in family caregiving and health services such as hospice during COVID-19 complicated the dying experience. HBMC providers were an important bridge between caregivers and supportive community and medical resources.

The mechanism of UAO in unconscious subjects shares many similarities with that of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), especially the hypotonic upper airway seen during rapid eye movement sleep. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) via nasal mask is more effective at maintaining airway patency than a full face mask in patients with OSA. We hypothesized that CPAP via nasal mask and ventilation (nCPAP) would be more effective than full face mask CPAP and ventilation (FmCPAP) for unconscious subjects, and we tested our hypothesis during induction of general anesthesia for elective surgery. METHODS In total, 73 adult subjects requiring general anesthesia were randomly assigned to one of four groups: nCPAP P0, nCPAP P5, FmCPAP P0, and FmCPAP P5, where P0 and P5 represent positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 0 and 5 cm H2O applied prior to induction. After apnea, ventilation was initiated with pressure control ventilation at a peak inspiratory pressure over PEEP (PIP/PEEP) of 20/0, then 20/5, and finally 20/10 cm H2O, each applied for 1 min. At each pressure setting, expired tidal volume (Vte) was calculated by using a plethysmograph device. RESULTS The rate of effective tidal volume (Vte > estimated anatomical dead space) was higher (87.9% vs. 21.9%; P<0.01) and the median Vte was larger (6.9 vs. 0 mL/kg; P<0.01) with nCPAP than with FmCPAP. Application of CPAP prior to induction of general anesthesia did not affect Vte in either approach (nCPAP pre- vs. post-; 7.9 vs. 5.8 mL/kg, P = 0.07) (FmCPAP pre- vs. post-; 0 vs. 0 mL/kg, P = 0.11).

Here, we describe an improved approach to preparing native rCVN from Escherichia coli more efficiently. A fusion gene consisting of cvn and sumo (small ubiquitin-related modifier) and a hexahistidine tag was constructed according to the codon bias of the host cell. This small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-fused CVN is expressed in the cytoplasm of E. coli in a folded and soluble form (>30% of the total soluble protein), yielding 3 to 4 mg of native rCVN from 1 g of wet cells to a purity up to 97.6%. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis showed that the purified rCVN was an intact and homogeneous protein with a molecular weight of 11,016.68 Da. Potent antiviral activity of rCVN against herpes simplex virus type 1 and human immunodeficiency virus type 1/IIIB was confirmed in a dose-dependent manner at nanomolar concentrations.

Randomized controlled trials and non-randomized controlled trials of COVID-19 were considered. Patient condition was classified as common, severe, or critical. Interventions included traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. We excluded trials that involved discharged patients, psychological intervention, and complications of COVID-19. The general information and outcomes, outcome measurement instruments, and measurement times were extracted. The results were analyzed by descriptive analysis. Results: In all, 19 registry platforms were searched. A total of 97 protocols were selected from among 160 protocols for the first search. For protocols of traditional Chinese medicine clinical trials, 76 outcomes from 16 outcome domains were reported, and almost half (34/76, 44.74%) of the outcomes were reported only once;the most frequently reported outcome was time taken for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA to become negative.

The purpose of this study is to explore how commonly utilized antiretroviral therapy (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine [TDF/3TC] and atazanavir/ritonavir [ATV/r]) influence plasma and intracellular concentrations of remdesivir. METHODS: This is an open-label, randomized, fixed sequence single intravenous dosing study to assess pharmacokinetic interactions between remdesivir and TDF/3TC (Study A, crossover design) or TDF/3TC plus ATV/r (Study B). Healthy volunteers satisfying study entry criteria will be enrolled in the study and randomized to either Study A; N=16 (Sequence 1 or Sequence 2) or Study B; N=8. Participants will receive standard adult doses of antiretroviral therapy for 7 days and a single 200mg remdesivir infusion administered over 60 min. Pharmacokinetic blood sampling will be performed relative to the start of remdesivir infusion; predose (before the start of remdesivir infusion) and 30 min after the start of remdesivir infusion. Additional blood samples will be taken at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h after the end of remdesivir infusion. DISCUSSION: This study will characterize the pharmacokinetics of remdesivir from a typical African population in whom clinical use is anticipated.

METHODS: The German notification system includes the publication of vaccine supply shortages reported by marketing authorisation holders (MAH), information on the availability of alternative vaccine products, guidance for physicians providing vaccinations and an unavailability reporting tool to monitor regional distribution issues. AIM: This study provides a retrospective analysis of supply issues and measures in the context of European and global vaccine supply constraints. RESULTS: between October 2015 and December 2020, the 250 notifications concerned all types of vaccines (54 products). Most shortages were caused by increased demand associated with immigration in Germany in 2015 and 2016, new or extended vaccine recommendations, increased awareness, or changes in global immunisation programmes. Shortages of a duration up to 30 days were mitigated using existing storage capacities. Longer shortages, triggered by high demand on a national level, were mitigated using alternative products and re-allocation; in a few cases, vaccines were imported. However, for long lasting supply shortages associated with increased global demand, often occurring in combination with manufacturing issues, few compensatory mechanisms were available. Nevertheless, only few critical incidents were identified: (i) shortage of hexavalent vaccines endangering neonatal immunisation programmes in 2015;(ii) distribution issues with influenza vaccines in 2018; and (iii) unmet demand for pneumococcal and influenza vaccines during the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic.

On the other hand, the structure of diffusion appears as either expansion or relocation. The geographical context of health and disease can be conceived as epidemiological landscapes or landscapes of exposure. These are dynamic, i.e., their contents and extensions will change over time. The epidemiological transition might appear as a spatial diffusion of diseases, but is rather the outcome of changing ecological preconditions for disease and disease determinants. Increasing spatial connectivity has radically altered the routes and speed of diffusion. Global and local environmental changes alter the prospects for health.

We selected all symptomatic children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were proxy-reported at least weekly, within two timeframes: 28 December 2020 to 6 May 2021 (Alpha (B.1.1.7), the main UK circulating variant) and 26 May to 8 July 2021 (Delta, the main UK circulating variant), with all children unvaccinated (as per national policy at the time). We assessed illness profiles (symptom prevalence, duration, and burden), hospital presentation, and presence of long (28 day) illness, and calculated odds ratios for symptoms presenting within the first 28 days of illness. Results: 694 (276 younger (5C11 years), 418 older (12C17 years)) symptomatic children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with Alpha infection and 706 (227 younger and 479 older) children with Delta infection. Median illness duration was short with either variant (overall cohort: 5 days (IQR 2C9.75) with Alpha, 5 days (IQR 2C9) with Delta). The seven most prevalent symptoms were common to both variants.

We aimed to compare mortality rates and outcome measures of disease severity in obese vs non-obese patients admitted with viral pneumonia. Methods Adult patients admitted with viral pneumonia were selected from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of 2016 and 2017. The arms were stratified based on the presence of a secondary discharge diagnosis of obesity. The primary outcome was inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes included sepsis, acute respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, and pulmonary embolism. Results and interpretation In total, 89,650 patients admitted with viral pneumonia were analyzed, and 17% had obesity. There was no significant difference in mortality between obese and non-obese patients (aOR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.705 - 1.362, p < 0.001). Compared to non-obese patients, obese patients had higher adjusted odds of developing acute hypoxic respiratory failure (aOR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.255 - 1.513, p < 0.001), acute respiratory distress syndrome (aOR: 2.29, 95% CI: 1.554 - 3.381, p < 0.001), need for mechanical ventilation (aOR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.236 - 1.819, p < 0.001), and pulmonary embolism (aOR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.024 - 2.788, p = 0.040).

Microaggressions and other forms of mistreatment can increase stress levels and depression and negatively impact academic performance. To increase student performance, retention, and wellness, mitigating microaggressions is needed to promote an inclusive culture. METHODS: We designed this workshop as a framework to think critically about microaggressions, how they impact the health professions academic environment, and how administrators, faculty, and students can promote inclusion excellence. The workshop included a presentation discussing microaggression theory, seven cases describing microaggressions in the health professions education environment, and discussion and facilitator guides. Cases were based on prior research conducted by the primary author and upon interactions authors shared from their professional experience. Participants completed pre- and postsurveys. RESULTS: During six workshops at three different institutions, 138 out of 190 participants (73% response rate), including nursing and medicine faculty, students, and leadership, completed the pre- and postsurveys. Pre- and posttraining measurements found statistically significant improvements in participants' knowledge of the impact of microaggressions, self-efficacy in responding to microaggressions, and commitment to being an active bystander in the face of microaggressions.

However, the effect of smoking on disease manifestations and cytokine levels of patients with SLE is unclear. This study compared characteristics of patients with SLE across smoking status, and determined the association of smoking with serum cytokine levels. METHOD: A cross-sectional study of patients with SLE (n=99) during a research visit in which smoking status was ascertained. Smoking status was compared across classification criteria (American College of Rheumatology Classification Criteria for SLE (ACR97)), disease activity (SLE Disease Activity Index), autoantibody levels, accrued damage (Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/ACR Damage Index), and circulating concentrations of serum interferon-gamma (IFN-), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, B cell-activating factor (BAFF), tumour necrosis factor-alpha, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1), MIP-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1. Linear regression models determined the association between smoking and cytokine levels, adjusting for age and sex, clinical characteristics (model 1), and anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-10 and TGF- 1) and regulatory (IL-1) cytokines (model 2). RESULTS: Among patients with SLE (97.9% ANA+; mean 48.48 years old; 86.9% female; mean 10 years of disease duration), 35.4% (n=35 of 99) were smoking (an average of 7 cigarettes/day for 24 years). Smokers had increased odds of prevalent ACR97 malar rash (OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.23 to 9.34) and mucosal ulcers (OR 3.31, 95% CI 1.36 to 8.05). Smokers had more arthritis (OR 3.19, 95% CI 1.19 to 8.60), migraine (OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.07 to 7.44), Raynauds phenomenon (OR 5.15, 95% CI 1.95 to 13.56) and increased non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use (OR 6.88, 95% CI 1.99 to 23.72). Smoking associated with 27% increased BAFF levels (95% CI 6% to 48%) and 42% decreased IFN- levels (95% CI ?79% to ?5%) in model 2. CONCLUSION: In patients with SLE, smoking independently associated with increased BAFF and decreased IFN- levels, and an increased frequency of arthritis, migraine and Raynauds phenomenon. Smoking cessation is advisable to reduce systemic inflammation, reduce disease activity and improve host defence.","output":"Smoking associates with increased BAFF and decreased interferon- levels in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the rapid spread of COVID-19, how to deal with the public opinion caused by COVID-19 epidemic situation and correctly guide public emotion has become an urgent problem to be solved.

This mixed-method study examined the changing role of older adult walking groups in North East Scotland around the first lockdown and how restrictions impacted members well-being. Three consecutive surveys were posted or emailed to members of the Grampian 50+ Network over summer 2020, with questions about social contact, loneliness, well-being, physical activity, public health messages, help-seeking behavior, and socio-demographics. 346 members completed the June survey, with 268 (83%) returning the follow-up survey in July, and 258 (80%) in August. Twenty participants (selection criteria - gender and geographic location) participated in repeated semi-structured interviews. Participants were, on average, 727 years old (range: 58-90), retired (94%), and women (80%). Participants reported missing in-person interaction from not regularly meeting with their walking group. Groups adapted to stay-at-home measures by using technology (i.e. videoconferencing/text/email/telephone) to maintain relationships. Easing restrictions required groups to modify format, location and size. Concerns about safe transport, mask-wearing, maintaining social distance (2m/6ft), and potential lack of socialisation emerged as barriers for future engagement. While, participants generally expressed confidence in the Scottish Governments pandemic response and public health messaging, they expressed dissatisfaction that over-70s were grouped together. Findings suggest that these walking group members fared well and were adaptive in response to the pandemic.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and protective effects of nesfatin in IR damage developing in liver. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-four male Wistar-Albino rats were divided to three groups which contained eight rats in all groups. The rats were subjected to 30 minutes of hepatic pedicule occlusion followed by 2h of reperfusion to induce I/R damage. Nesfatin1 (10 g/ kg) was administered, 30 min prior to ischemia and immediately before the reperfusion period. RESULTS: The findings showed that while the blood levels of AST, ALT and LDH were markedly elevated in the I/R group, they returned to normal levels upon treatment in the Nesfatin group. While IL-1 &#945;, IL-1?, IL-6, TNF-&#945; and IFN- ?3 levels in blood and tissue were lower after therapy in the Nesfatin group compared to the I/R group, statistically significant decreases were only noted in IL-1?, IL-6, TNF-&#945; and IFN- ?3 levels. TAS levels increased in the treatment group, while upon nesfatin treatment statistically significant decreases were noted in TOS and OSI levels. Histopathological investigations also showed statistically significant decreases in Bax and Caspase-3 staining intensity and the number of stained cells in the Nesfatin group.

Understanding the profession's role and how midwives can be integrated into health systems is essential in creating evidence-informed policies. Our objective was to develop a theoretical framework of how political system factors and health systems arrangements influence the roles of midwives within the health system. METHODS A critical interpretive synthesis was used to develop the theoretical framework. A range of electronic bibliographic databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, Global Health database, HealthSTAR, Health Systems Evidence, MEDLINE and Web of Science) was searched through to 14 May 2020 as were policy and health systems-related and midwifery organisation websites. A coding structure was created to guide the data extraction. RESULTS A total of 4533 unique documents were retrieved through electronic searches, of which 4132 were excluded using explicit criteria, leaving 401 potentially relevant records, in addition to the 29 records that were purposively sampled through grey literature. A total of 100 documents were included in the critical interpretive synthesis. The resulting theoretical framework identified the range of political and health system components that can work together to facilitate the integration of midwifery into health systems or act as barriers that restrict the roles of the profession. CONCLUSIONS Any changes to the roles of midwives in health systems need to take into account the political system where decisions about their integration will be made as well as the nature of the health system in which they are being integrated. The theoretical framework, which can be thought of as a heuristic, identifies the core contextual factors that governments can use to best leverage their position when working to improve sexual and reproductive health and rights.","output":"A critical interpretive synthesis of the roles of midwives in health systems."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection is frequently associated with thromboembolic complications.

Several markers have been found to be associated with the disease severity in COVID-19 patients. However, the established markers only display modest prognostic power individually and better markers are urgently needed. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of S100A12, a prominent marker gene for bacterial infection, in the prognosis of disease severity in COVID-19 patients. To ensure the robustness of the association, a total of 1695 samples from 14 independent transcriptome datasets on sepsis, influenza infection and COVID-19 infection were examined. First, it was demonstrated that S100A12 was a marker for sepsis and severity of sepsis. Then, S100A12 was found to be a marker for severe influenza infection, and there was an upward trend of S100A12 expression as the severity level of influenza infection increased. As for COVID-19 infection, it was found that S100A12 expression was elevated in patients with severe and critical COVID-19 infection. More importantly, S100A12 expression at hospital admission was robustly correlated with future quantitative indexes of disease severity and outcome in COVID-19 patients, superior to established prognostic markers including CRP, PCT, d-dimer, ferritin, LDH and fibrinogen. Thus, S100A12 is a valuable novel prognostic marker for COVID-19 severity and deserves more attention.","output":"A single transcript for the prognosis of disease severity in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Pharmacotherapy prophylaxis embedded in Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS?) protocols is largely unknown because data related to agent choice, dosing, timing, and duration of treatment currently are not collected in the ERAS Interactive Audit System (EIAS?).

Materials and methods The records of 250 randomly-selected adult patients that underwent elective colorectal (CR) and gynecologic/oncology procedures (GO) at an ERAS? site in North America were abstracted using REDCap. In addition to descriptive statistics, bivariate associations between categorical variables were compared. Results Rates of SSI, VTE, & PONV were 3.3%, 1.1%, and 53.6%, respectively. Mean length of stay (LOS) for CR was 6.9 days and for GO, 3.5 days (p < 0.001). The most common antibiotic prophylaxis was one-time combination cefazolin 2 g and metronidazole 500 mg between 16 and 30 min preoperatively after chlorhexidine skin preparation.

These differences are likely due to gender-specific behaviors, genetic and hormonal factors, and sex differences in biological pathways related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several social, behavioral and comorbid factors are implicated in the generally worse outcomes in men as compared with women. Underlying biological sex differences and their effects on COVID-19 outcomes, however, have received less attention. The present review summarizes the available literature regarding proposed molecular and cellular markers of COVID-19 infection, their associations with health outcomes, and any reported modification by sex. Biological sex differences characterized by such biomarkers exist within healthy populations and also differ with age- and sex-specific conditions, such as pregnancy and menopause. In the context of COVID-19, descriptive biomarker levels are often reported by sex, but data pertaining to the effect of patient sex on the relationship between biomarkers and COVID-19 disease severity/outcomes are scarce. Such biomarkers may offer plausible explanations for the worse COVID-19 outcomes seen in men. There is the need for larger studies with sex-specific reporting and robust analyses to elucidate how sex modifies cellular and molecular pathways associated with SARS-CoV-2. This will improve interpretation of biomarkers and clinical management of COVID-19 patients by facilitating a personalized medical approach to risk stratification, prevention, and treatment.","output":"COVID-19 and Sex Differences: Mechanisms and Biomarkers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Synthetic glucocorticoids such as Dexamethasone (Dex) are widely prescribed drugs used to treat a variety of human diseases including auto-immune disorders, asthma, cancer, and COVID-19. The transcriptional response to glucocorticoids is elicited by the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR), which enters the nucleus upon Dex treatment and interacts with thousands of enhancer elements throughout the genome. We recently demonstrated that the Dex response in human breast cancer cells is highly heterogeneous and that individual cells have unique transcriptional responses to Dex. To examine whether this heterogeneity arises from differential utilization of distinct GR-bound enhancers, we focused on the Dex response at the DNA Damage Inducible Transcript 4 (DDIT4) gene. Using a variety of genomic techniques, we identified four GR binding sites (GBSs) 18-30kb upstream of the DDIT4 TSS with differential patterns of chromatin accessibility, histone acetylation, SWI/SNF recruitment, and enhancer RNA (eRNA) transcription. To determine whether these GBSs had unique requirements for DDIT4 transcription, we used CRISPR-CAS9 to generate homozygous deletions of each site. Using ChIP-seq, 4C-seq, single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH), and RT-PCR, we demonstrated GR binding to these GBSs was independent and each GBS deletion had unique effects on DDIT4 and eRNA transcription, local histone acetylation, and chromatin looping. Deletion of any of the first three GBSs resulted in delayed and/or decreased induction of DDIT4 transcription whereas deletion of the fourth GBS resulted in significant upregulation of both DDIT4 and eRNA transcription. Thus, three of the GBSs acted as enhancers of DDIT4 expression while the fourth functioned as a suppressor. Strikingly, smFISH also revealed that these enhancers contributed to cellular heterogeneity, as deleting the GBSs altered the frequency and amplitude of DDIT4 transcription across cell populations. Taken together, these results demonstrate that individual GBSs uniquely contribute to cell-to-cell heterogeneity within the transcriptional response of DDIT4 to Dex. Furthermore, they underscore the possibility that targeted modification of individual GBSs could be utilized to tailor custom, patient-specific strategies for the treatment of human diseases.","output":"Differential Activity and Utilization of Glucocorticoid Receptor Binding Sites Yields Transcriptional Heterogeneity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Indirect evidence suggests that the effects of testosterone on fat mass in men are dependent on aromatization to estradiol (E2). However, no controlled study has assessed the effects of E2 in the absence of testosterone. Design: Six-month randomized, placebo-controlled trial with the hypothesis that men randomized to E2 would reduce their fat mass. Methods: Seventy-eight participants receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer were randomized to 0.9 mg of 0.1% E2 gel per day, or matched placebo. Dual x-ray absorptiometry body composition was measured at baseline, month 3, and month 6. The primary outcome was total fat mass. Results: Serum E2 increased in the estradiol group over 6 months compared to placebo, and mean-adjusted difference (MAD) was 207 pmol/L (95% CI: 123-292), P < 0.001. E2 treatment changed total fat mass, MAD 1007 g (95% CI: 124-1891), but not significantly, so P = 0.09. There were other consistent non-significant trends toward increased proportional fat mass, MAD 0.8% (95% CI: 0.0-1.6), P= 0.15; gynoid fat, MAD 147 g (95% CI: 2-293), P = 0.08; visceral fat, 53 g (95% CI: 1-105) P = 0.13; and subcutaneous fat, MAD 65 g (95% CI: 5-125), P = 0.11.

Method: A web-based closed questionnaire via the Survey Monkey platform captured reported COVID-19 self-isolation patterns in the dental team. Results: : A total of 3,309 responses were collected. 2,888 (87.3%) responses contained valid data. 26.8% of respondents reported self-isolating.

Although induced pluripotent (hiPSCs) and orbital fat-derived stem cells (OFSCs) hold great promise for corneal epithelial (CE) reconstruction, no study to date has evaluated the capacity of decellularized corneas (DCs) to support the attachment and differentiation of these cells into CE-like cells.

DCs successfully supported the adhesion and survival of hiPSCs and OFSCs. The OFSCs cultured under differentiation conditions could not express the CE markers, TP63, KRT3, PAX6, and KRT12, while the hiPSCs gave rise to cells expressing high levels of these markers. RT-qPCR data suggested that the DCs provided an inductive environment for CE differentiation of hiPSCs, supporting the expression of PAX6 and KRT12 without the need for any soluble induction factors.

The interest in anti-coronavirus drug development has been limited so far and effective methods to prevent or treat coronavirus infections in humans are still lacking. Urgent action is needed to fight this fatal coronavirus infection by reducing the number of infected people along with the infection contagiousness and severity. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak several weeks ago, we observe in GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neurosciences (Sainte-Anne hospital, Paris, France) a lower prevalence of symptomatic and severe forms of COVID-19 infections in psychiatric patients (4 %) compared to health care professionals (14 %). Similar observations have been noted in other psychiatric units in France and abroad. Our hypothesis is that psychiatric patients could be protected from the severe form of COVID-19 by their psychotropic treatments. Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a phenothiazine derivative widely used in clinical routine in the treatment of acute and chronic psychoses. This first antipsychotic medication has been discovered in 1952 by Jean Delay and Pierre Deniker at Sainte-Anne hospital. In addition to its antipsychotic effects, several in vitro studies have also demonstrated a CPZ antiviral activity via the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Recently, independent studies revealed that CPZ is an anti-MERS-CoV and an anti-SARS-CoV-1 drug. In comparison to other antiviral drugs, the main advantages of CPZ lie in its biodistribution: (i) preclinical and clinical studies have reported a high CPZ concentration in the lungs (20--200 times higher than in plasma), which is critical because of the respiratory tropism of SARS-CoV-2; (ii) CPZ is highly concentrated in saliva (20-60 times higher than in plasma) and could therefore reduce the contagiousness of COVID-19; (iii) CPZ can cross the blood-brain barrier and could therefore prevent the neurological forms of COVID-19. METHODS: In this context, we will test the hypothesis that CPZ could decrease the unfavorable evolution of COVID-19 infection in oxygen-requiring patients without the need for intensive care, but also reduce the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2. At this end, we designed a pilot, phase III, multicenter, single blind, randomized controlled therapeutic trial. Efficacy of CPZ will be assessed according to clinical, biological and radiological criteria. The main objective is to demonstrate a shorter Time To Response (TTR) to treatment in the CPZ + standard-of-care (CPZ + SOC) group, compared to the SOC group. Response to treatment is defined by a reduction of at least one level of severity on the WHO-Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (WHO-OSCI). The secondary objectives are to demonstrate in the CPZ + SOC group, compared to the SOC group: A) superior clinical improvement; B) a greater decrease in the biological markers of viral attack by SARS-CoV-2 (PCR, viral load); C) a greater decrease in inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP and lymphopenia); D) a greater decrease in parenchymal involvement (chest CT) on the seventh day post-randomization; E) to define the optimal dosage of CPZ and its tolerance; F) to evaluate the biological parameters of response to treatment, in particular the involvement of inflammatory cytokines. Patient recruitment along with the main and secondary objectives are in line with WHO 2020 COVID-19 guidelines. CONCLUSION: This repositioning of CPZ as anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity offers an alternative and rapid strategy to alleviate the virus propagation and the infection severity and lethality. This CPZ repositioning strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps, can save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easy to manage side effects. Indeed, CPZ is an FDA-approved drug with an excellent tolerance profile, prescribed for around 70 years, in psychiatry but also in clinical routine in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, in advanced cancer and also to treat headaches in various neurological conditions. The broad spectrum of CPZ treatment - including antipsychotic, anxiolytic, antiemetic, antiviral, immunomodulatory effects along with inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and modulation of blood-brain barrier - is in line with the historical French commercial name for CPZ, i.e. LARGACTIL, chosen as a reference to its 'LARGe ACTion' properties. The discovery of those CPZ properties, as for many other molecules in psychiatry, is both the result of serendipity and careful clinical observations. Using this approach, the field of mental illness could provide innovative therapeutic approaches to fight SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Repositionnement de la chlorpromazine dans le traitement du COVID-19: tude reCoVery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged to be the reason behind the COVID-19 pandemic.

Br., in terms of its binding affinity by targeting COVID-19 main protease (M(pro)) using computational analysis. Molecular docking analysis was performed using PyRx software. The ADMET and drug-likeness properties of the top 10 compounds showing binding affinity greater than or equal to ? 8.0 kcal/mol were analysed using pkCSM and DruLiTo, respectively. Based on the docking studies, it was confirmed that Rutin and Plebeiosides B were the most potent inhibitors of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 with the best binding affinities of ? 9.1 kcal/mol and ? 8.9 kcal/mol, respectively. Further, the two compounds were analysed by studying their biological activity using the PASS webserver. Molecular dynamics simulation analysis was performed for the selected proteinCligand complexes to confirm their stability at 300 ns. MM-PBSA provided the basis for analyzing the affinity of the phytochemicals towards M(pro) by calculating the binding energy, and secondary structure analysis indicated the stability of protease structure when it is bound to Rutin and Plebeiosides B. Altogether, the study identifies Rutin and Plebeiosides B to be potent M(pro) inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.

Recent studies confirm that natural selection is the dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, which favors mutations that strengthen viral infectivity. We demonstrate that vaccine-breakthrough or antibody-resistant mutations provide a new mechanism of viral evolution. Specifically, vaccine-resistant mutation Y449S in the spike (S) protein receptor-bonding domain (RBD), which occurred in co-mutation [Y449S, N501Y], has reduced infectivity compared to the original SARS-CoV-2 but can disrupt existing antibodies that neutralize the virus. By tracing the evolutionary trajectories of vaccine-resistant mutations in over 1.9 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we reveal that the occurrence and frequency of vaccine-resistant mutations correlate strongly with the vaccination rates in Europe and America. We anticipate that as a complementary transmission pathway, vaccine-resistant mutations will become a dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution when most of the world's population is vaccinated. Our study sheds light on SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission and enables the design of the next-generation mutation-proof vaccines and antibody drugs.","output":"The evolution of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 evolution revealing vaccine-resistant mutations in Europe and America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Originated by an individual capacity, organizational ambidexterity represents how organizations do two different things equally well (i.e., efficiency and flexibility, adaptability and alignment, integration and responsiveness, or exploration and exploitation). The versatility of the ambidexterity concept allows using it to test multiple research questions from various perspectives. It explains that in the last decades, the research in organizational ambidexterity has been exponentially rising. The authors argued that the proliferation of papers represents a consolidation stage of any phenomenon. Therefore, in this development cycle, the two possibilities maybe its decline or re-focus along new lines. Although the publication pattern focused on strategic management journals, it does not mean that organizational ambidexterity is only observed in established and mature organizations' strategies. Several entrepreneurial organizations have been born (e.g., new ventures) or have rejuvenated (i.e., established ventures with an entrepreneurial orientation) by implementing and developing an organizational ambidexterity capacity. This study is motivated by the apparent unrepresentativeness of organizational ambidexterity in entrepreneurship studies. Therefore, (a) we look back to the past 15 years of published research by focusing on the contribution of organizational ambidexterity to the fields of management studies and entrepreneurship studies;and (b) we look forward to the research in organizational ambidexterity by inspiring the analysis of ambidexterity's role in the current scenarios (social, economic, technological, environmental) in management and entrepreneurship studies. Based on this review and analysis, we show the underrepresentation of entrepreneurship in the published ambidexterity literature until the last decade (the 2010s). Motivated by this insight, we provoke the discussion about how the concept of ambidexterity, characterized by managing a double tension simultaneously, is a potential ingredient in the entrepreneurial decision-making process of individuals, teams, organizations, and eco-systems agents. We encourage new research lines that help refresh the analysis of ambidexterity in the entrepreneurship field and re-thinking its contribution to the reconciliation process between management, innovation, and entrepreneurship fields. Furthermore, several implications to managers, entrepreneurial organizations, and entrepreneurs emerge from this study. Concretely, we encourage them to consider this approach as a way of thinking to face the current social, economic, and health problems that we are living in due to the COVID-19 pandemic effects.","output":"Ambidexterity and Entrepreneurship Studies: A Literature Review and Research Agenda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease of the lung caused by the bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and is the second leading cause of mortality from an infectious agent after SARS-CoV-2. Mtb is an opportunistic pathogen that benefits from a compromised immune system and is particularly deadly in HIV patients. New therapies targeting TB are necessary due to an increase in multi-drug resistant strains. Our collaborators at Texas Southern University identified novel bacterial methionine aminopeptidase (MtMetAP1) inhibitors. Genetic knockout studies support the lethality of the deletion of MtMetAP1 in Mtb. Further studies support the existence of an ortholog in Homo sapiens (HsMetAP1) that performs similar essential functions. Although these novel inhibitors are known to be effective against Mtb, their cytotoxicity in mammalian cells has yet to be established. We hypothesize that there will be low levels of cytotoxicity in cancerous and primary lung cell lines at varying concentrations of the MetAP novel inhibitor, UST-001. Using flow cytometry via a MUSE? Cell Count and Viability Kit, the cytotoxicity of UST-001 was assayed in H1299 cancer cells. The H1299 cells were exposed to concentrations of UST-001 ranging from 0.1M to 750M for 48 hours at 37and 5% CO2. Three negative controls were included in each replicate: DMSO (carrier), pure media, and Isoniazid (INH). INH is a common clinically effective TB treatment. The viability of H1299 cells was still over 60% at the highest inhibitor concentration tested. Trypan Blue Assays were performed on the same H1299 cells at each concentration and the controls, which corroborated flow cytometry results. In establishment of a dose-response curve, our data showed that at UST-001 concentrations below 100 M, induced little to no cell death and cell viability of 90% or higher. Since cancerous cells have higher mitotic rates and more repair pathways, we hypothesize that we will be able to establish an IC50 curve in non-cancerous Mlg-2908 lung fibroblast cells at higher concentrations. Current flow cytometry testing on Mlg-2908 cells, using the same protocol as the H1299 cells, shows cell viability of 89% or higher in 0.1 M to 10 M UST-001 concentrations. Since cancerous cells have higher mitotic rates and more repair pathways, we hypothesize that we will be able to establish an IC50 curve in Mlg-2908 cells at higher concentrations. Further studies using a Muse Annexin V apoptosis assay will focus on the UST-001 mechanism of cell death.

Guidance is therefore needed regarding use of agents with potential activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in pediatrics. METHODS: A panel of pediatric infectious diseases physicians and pharmacists from 18 geographically diverse North American institutions was convened. Through a series of teleconferences and web-based surveys, a set of guidance statements was developed and refined based on review of best available evidence and expert opinion. RESULTS: Given the typically mild course of pediatric COVID-19, supportive care alone is suggested for the overwhelming majority of cases. The panel suggests a decision-making framework for antiviral therapy that weighs risks and benefits based on disease severity as indicated by respiratory support needs, with consideration on a case-by-case basis of potential pediatric risk factors for disease progression. If an antiviral is used, the panel suggests remdesivir as the preferred agent. Hydroxychloroquine could be considered for patients who are not candidates for remdesivir or when remdesivir is not available. Antivirals should preferably be used as part of a clinical trial if available. CONCLUSIONS: Antiviral therapy for COVID-19 is not necessary for the great majority of pediatric patients. For those rare children who develop severe or critical disease, this guidance offer an approach for decision-making regarding antivirals, informed by available data.

METHODS: All spontaneous suspected ADR reports due to HCQ in COVID-19 patients submitted to the ADR monitoring of a tertiary care hospital were included. Additionally, a survey was designed for active surveillance of ADRs among healthcare professionals (HCPs) who were on prophylaxis with HCQ. The ADRs were analyzed to determine severity, causality and preventability using Hartwig Scale, WHO-UMC scale and modified Schumock and Thornton criterion respectively. RESULTS: Sixty-four ADR reports were received from COVID-19 patients. A total of 78 ADRs were reported by 49 HCPs who were on HCQ prophylaxis.

METHOD: We used Wave one (April 2020) of the Understanding Society UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) COVID-19 study, with linkage to baseline mental health data from the UKHLS annual survey (January 2017- December 2018). Analysis was based on adults aged 18-65 who were employees in January/February 2020 (n=8,708), with psychological distress assessed using the GHQ-12. Logistic regression examined the mental health impact of reduced working and reasons for the reduction. RESULTS: Forty two percent of employees reported reduced working by April 2020, with 22% furloughed. There was no evidence of an association between reduced working per se and psychological distress in the fully adjusted model (OR=1.06, 95%CI 0.91-1.23). Those permanently laid-off (less than 1% of employees) were most vulnerable to adverse mental health effects in the early months of the pandemic (OR=3.60, 95%CI 1.55-8.37).

A time-to-event analysis revealed that admission after policy implementation was associated with a significantly longer time to first do not resuscitate/do not intubate/comfort care order (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6-3.1; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Policies restricting family presence may lead to longer ICU stays and delay decisions to limit treatment prior to death. Further policy evaluation and programs enabling access to family-centered care and palliative care during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic are imperative.","output":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 Policy Restricting Family Presence May Have Delayed End-of-Life Decisions for Critically Ill Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The fatal outcomes by COVID-19 are accompanied by cytokine storm syndrome, and thereby it is reported that disease severity is dependent on the cytokine storm syndrome. This cytokine storm can be assessed by evaluating the serum ferritin levels. The objective of this study was to assess the activities of serum ferritin and treatment outcomes among COVID-19 patients who were treated with dexamethasone and vitamin C. Materials and methods A single-center, prospective, observational study was conducted among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from July 2020 to August 2020. The diagnosis was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging of the lungs. Serum ferritin levels were compared with the treatment outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients who were treated with dexamethasone and vitamin C. Results A total of 50 COVID-19 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 41.70 years. The recovery rate (94%) was remarkably high and is a good sign of COVID 19 treatment with vitamin C and dexamethasone as key modalities. The mean serum ferritin levels among recovered and expired patients were 478.81 ng/ml and 1410 ng/ml, respectively.

We developed a protocol for individualization of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and tidal volume (V(T)) utilizing EIT-derived information on recruitability, overdistension and alveolar cycling. The aim of this study was to assess whether the EIT-based protocol allows individualization of ventilator settings without causing lung overdistension, and to evaluate its effects on respiratory system compliance, oxygenation and alveolar cycling. METHODS: 20 patients with ARDS were included. Initially, patients were ventilated according to the recommendations of the ARDS Network with a V(T) of 6 ml per kg predicted body weight and PEEP adjusted according to the lower PEEP/FiO(2) table. Subsequently, ventilator settings were adjusted according to the EIT-based protocol once every 30 min for a duration of 4 h. To assess global overdistension, we determined whether lung stress and strain remained below 27 mbar and 2.0, respectively. RESULTS: Prospective optimization of mechanical ventilation with EIT led to higher PEEP levels (16.5 [14C18] mbar vs. 10 [8C10] mbar before optimization; p = 0.0001) and similar V(T) (5.7  0.92 ml/kg vs. 5.8  0.47 ml/kg before optimization; p = 0.96). Global lung stress remained below 27 mbar in all patients and global strain below 2.0 in 19 out of 20 patients. Compliance remained similar, while oxygenation was significantly improved and alveolar cycling was reduced after EIT-based optimization. CONCLUSIONS: Adjustment of PEEP and V(T) using the EIT-based protocol led to individualization of ventilator settings with improved oxygenation and reduced alveolar cycling without promoting global overdistension.

Achieving high levels of vaccination coverage is key to this approach, and requires knowledge of user satisfaction levels. Thus, the objective of this work was to determine the levels of satisfaction with the COVID-19 vaccination program among vaccinated school workers.MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study which included the staff from educational centres invited for vaccination over 4 days at the Hospital General University Hospital of Alicante. The survey included sociodemographic variables, 13 questions on satisfaction with the vaccination program, and one open question for further suggestions. Satisfaction was calculated globally for each question and specifically by employing Student t -tests;the association between each variable and a high level of satisfaction was analysed with Chi-squared tests. Results Of 9,869 professionals invited, 9,261 attended the appointment;5,756 were offered the possibility of participating in this survey and 2,989 (51.9%) accepted. The highest overall scores were assigned to the treatment patients received at the registration point and the care they received from nurses during the vaccination. The aspect for which the lowest levels of satisfaction were registered was for the information received prior to vaccination.

The authors reveal how sigma ligands may reduce the symptoms, complications, and deaths resulting from SARS-CoV-2 and offer insights on those patient cohorts that may benefit most from these drugs. Expert opinion: Drugs with sigma affinity potentially offer protection against the most severe symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 via interactions with the sigma-1 receptor. Agonists of the sigma-1 receptor may provide protection of the mitochondria, activate mitophagy to remove damaged and leaking mitochondria, prevent ER stress, manage calcium ion transport, and induce autophagy to prevent cell death in response to infection.","output":"Drugs that offer the potential to reduce hospitalization and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection: The possible role of the sigma-1 receptor and autophagy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Prolonged controlled mechanical ventilation depresses diaphragmatic efficiency. Assisted modes of ventilation should improve it. We assessed the impact of pressure support ventilation versus neurally adjusted ventilator assist on diaphragmatic efficiency. METHOD Patients previously ventilated with controlled mechanical ventilation for 72 hours or more were randomized to be ventilated for 48 hours with pressure support ventilation (n =12) or neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (n = 13). Neuro-ventilatory efficiency (tidal volume/diaphragmatic electrical activity) and neuro-mechanical efficiency (pressure generated against the occluded airways/diaphragmatic electrical activity) were measured during three spontaneous breathing trials (0, 24 and 48 hours). Breathing pattern, diaphragmatic electrical activity and pressure time product of the diaphragm were assessed every 4 hours. RESULTS In patients randomized to neurally adjusted ventilator assist, neuro-ventilatory efficiency increased from 27  19 ml/V at baseline to 62  30 ml/V at 48 hours (p <0.0001) and neuro-mechanical efficiency increased from 1  0.6 to 2.6  1.1 cmH2O/V (p = 0.033). In patients randomized to pressure support ventilation, these did not change. Electrical activity of the diaphragm, neural inspiratory time, pressure time product of the diaphragm and variability of the breathing pattern were significantly higher in patients ventilated with neurally adjusted ventilatory assist.

The multi-agency partnership wanted to understand the views of service users and impact on CYP of the shift to predominantly remote interactions with the LAC medical and nursing teamObjectivesTo understand the service user perspective of Looked After Children in an East London Borough during the COVID 19 pandemic, including views on virtual consultation. This was with a view to optimising the service for the future.MethodsThe LAC Health team, in partnership with the local authority and Children in Care Council, conducted a virtual focus group with Looked After Children. The CYP were members of the Children in Care Council and volunteered to participate. The age range of participants was 8 to 17 years. The group was conducted using the video-conferencing platform Zoom. It was facilitated by paediatricians, nurses, and a patient participation lead. CYP were divided into break-out groups, and a virtual brainstorming tool was also used. The participants were asked about where and how they access health information, how they prefer to interact with the healthcare team, and what they felt had been positive and negative about how their service has been adapted during the current pandemic, as well as their hopes for the future service. The session lasted 1 hour.ResultsThe following themes were extracted from the discussion:Most participants said their carer was their first port of call for health advice. Some participants also used technology such as search engines and apps for health queries.While most felt the paediatric teams main role was to look after their physical health, some also mentioned the importance of their human connection with the healthcare team.All the participants said that, given the choice, they would prefer to have face to face appointments.Attitudes to telephone versus video appointments varied;some felt that being able to see their healthcare workers was very important to the interaction, but others found video calls uncomfortable. Poor internet access was mentioned as a barrier to using online video platforms for consultations.ConclusionsThe wellbeing of vulnerable CYP has been of particular concern amongst health and social care workers during the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK.

There is thus an urgent need to test, and an ethical imperative, to test, modify or refine medications or healthcare plans that could reduce patient morbidity, lower healthcare costs or strengthen healthcare systems. METHODS: Conceptual review. DISCUSSION: Although some allocation principles seem better than others, no single moral principle allocates interventions justly, necessitating combining the moral principles into multiprinciple allocation systems. The urgency notwithstanding, navigating ethical challenges related to conducting corona virus disease (COVID-19) clinical trials is mandatory, in order to safeguard the safety and welfare of research participants, ensure autonomy of participants, reduce possibilities for exploitation and ensure opportunities for research participation. The ethical challenges to can be categorized as challenges in allocation of resources for research; challenges of clinical equipoise in relation to the research questions; challenges of understanding disclosed information in potential participants; and challenges in obtaining informed consent. CONCLUSION: To navigate these challenges, stakeholders need a delicate balance of moral principles during allocation of resources for research. Investigators need to apply information processing theories to aid decision-making about research participation or employ acceptable modifications to improve the informed consent process.

Many single-use devices are not designed to be thoroughly cleaned. Interlocking design features inherent to LigaSure? vessel sealing devices may prevent thorough cleaning and promote accumulation of human tissue that cannot be removed. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare industry reprocessed and new LigaSure? vessel sealing devices for organic material. METHODS A total of 168, 84 new and 84 reprocessed, vessel sealing devices were disassembled and inspected for the presence of residual organic matter using visual, microscopic, and chemical analysis. Devices were randomized and test conductors blinded to group membership. Devices were aseptically disassembled and sent through visual inspection. Next, devices were either examined using light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or exposed to a solution that luminesces in the presence of hemoglobin. Additionally, 165 reprocessed devices were sent to a 3rd party lab for sterility testing via direct immersion culture for 14 days. RESULTS Significant amounts of remnant organic material (C, N, O, S, Na, P) were observed with 81/84 reprocessed and 0/84 new devices failing inspection protocols. When tested for the presence of hemoglobin, only 1/12 reprocessed devices passed inspection. SEM of reprocessed devices revealed residues with liquid patterns and diffuse soiling with foreign material. Sterility testing of reprocessed devices revealed a sterility level < 6-3. CONCLUSIONS The abundance of material resembling human tissue observed on reprocessed VSDs suggests inadequate cleaning prior to sterilization. Atomic and morphological analyses of the remnant materials suggest that bacterial biofilms could also be present. Additionally, surface degradation and release of reinforcing glass fibers from the device were observed. Devices designed for single use can harbor significant amounts of remnant material that likely interfere with the sterilization process.","output":"Assessing organic material on single-use vessel sealing devices: a comparative study of reprocessed and new LigaSure? devices."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims Opioid dependence has high risks and opioid substitution treatment (OST) improves outcomes and reduces deaths.

Method Health Research Authority approval for Randomized Controlled Trial of Telemedicine versus Face-to-Face (control) appointments in large semi-rural community addictions service (2500km2) using a modified Hub-and-Spoke (outreach). Adult opioid dependent patients prescribed OST and attending outreach clinics recruited. Participants received two consultations in group. Telemedicine delivered using Skype-for-business videoconferencing. Patients attended outreach clinic, where an outreach worker undertook drug testing and telemedicine conducted via the outreach workers laptop.

Two themes for reasons for recommending the service were;1. Convenience (reduced travel, reduced travel time and reduced travel costs) and 2. Supportive Staff (including listening, caring and good support). One patient mentioned it is a convenient way to communicate with medical staff, saving time and effort. Regarding Telemedicine appointments, most participants responded that the timing of telemedicine appointments was good (n = 26;87%), given enough information (n = 30;100%), enough privacy (n = 28;93%), enough time to talk (n = 30;100%), involved as much as they wanted (n = 25;83%), given advice on keeping well (n = 28;93%), and NHS staff were friendly and helpful (n = 29;97%). No participants thought they were treated unfairly. When asked what went well, patient themes were: 1. Everything and 2. Communication (including listening and explaining). One patient stated Everything better, telemedicing good, heard it well, everything improved this year. In terms of what the service could do better, there were no issues identified.

DESIGN: An explorative qualitative study comprising two virtual focus group discussions (FGDs) with 12 trial team members and 32 in-depth participant interviews (N=44). Data were collected via telephone calls for in-depth interviews or Zoom for FGDs and manually analysed by inductive content analysis. SETTING: Fourteen private security companies in two Uganda districts. PARTICIPANTS: Members of the clinical trial study team, and men working in private security companies who undertook workplace-based HIV testing. RESULTS: The key themes for participants experiences were: 'challenges in accessing HIV treatment and care, and prevention services', 'misinformation' and 'difficulty participating in research activities'. The effects on HIV treatment and prevention resulted from; repercussions of the COVID-19 restrictions, participants fear of coinfection and negative experiences at health facilities. The difficulty in participating in research activities arose from: fear of infection with COVID-19 for the participants who tested HIV negative, transport difficulties, limited post-test psychosocial support and lack of support to initiate pre-exposure prophylaxis. The key study team reflections focused on the management of the clinical trial, effects of the local regulations and government policies and the need to adhere to ethical principles of research. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the need to organise different forms of HIV support for persons living with HIV during a pandemic. Additionally, the national research regulators and ethics committees or review boards are strongly urged to develop policies and guidelines for the continuity of research and clinical trials in the event of future shocks. Furthermore, this study calls on the appropriate government agencies to ensure public and researchers' preparedness through continuing education and support.

This, in turn, has a pivotal effect on the population's mental health. The aimof this study is to initially investigate the psychological effects of the new COVID-19 pandemic onsecondary school teachers, who in addition to the general aggravation take on the burden of forcedabstinence from their regular work duties and the simultaneous need to adapt themselves to the unprecedentedprocess of distance learning. This is a cross-sectional study in secondary school teachersand was conducted using simple random sampling at the beginning of the pandemic in Greece. Thex2 test was used to examine associations between psychological and other variables. 34% of teacherswere found to feel anxious and very anxious during the pandemic, while only 8% of teachers exhibitsevere depressive emotions. It is also clear that the educators as a professional group are predominantlypossessed by optimism about the outcome of the pandemic, as 71.5% was placed in the higherlevels of the relevant scale. Female gender was found to have a positive correlation to feelings of fear,depression, and a negative correlation to optimism. Furthermore, a negative correlation between theteachers' high educational level and their feelings of optimism emerged from the data. This optimismmay well be related with the large acceptance of the measures taken by the government to curb theexpansion of the pandemic. Finally, it was found that distance teaching, which was abruptly and unpreparedlyimplemented by educators on account of the pandemic, was not a major concern.

Objective: To report practice patterns for common ocular complaints during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic among comprehensive ophthalmology practices in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, 40 private practices and 20 university centers were randomly selected from 4 regions across the US. Data were collected on April 29 and 30, 2020. Interventions: Investigators placed telephone calls to each ophthalmology practice office. Responses to 3 clinical scenarios-refraction request, cataract evaluation, and symptoms of a posterior vitreous detachment-were compared regionally and between private and university centers. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary measure was time to next appointment for each of the 3 scenarios. Secondary measures included use of telemedicine and advertisement of COVID-19 precautions. Results: Of the 40 private practices, 2 (5%) were closed, 24 (60%) were only seeing urgent patients, and 14 (35%) remained open to all patients. Of the 20 university centers, 2 (10%) were closed, 17 (85%) were only seeing urgent patients, and 1 (5%) remained open to all patients. There were no differences for any telemedicine metric. University centers were more likely than private practices to mention preparations to limit the spread of COVID-19 (17 of 20 [85%] vs 14 of 40 [35%]; mean difference, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.26-0.65; P < .001). Private practices had a faster next available appointment for cataract evaluations than university centers, with a mean (SD) time to visit of 22.1 (27.0) days vs 75.5 (46.1) days (mean difference, 53.4; 95% CI, 23.1-83.7; P < .001).

Mobile health apps are being used for these purposes; however, their effects on health outcomes have been mixed. OBJECTIVE This study aims to summarize the evidence of rigorously evaluated health-related apps on health outcomes and explore the effects of features present in studies that reported a statistically significant difference in health outcomes. METHODS A literature search was conducted in 7 databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Global Index Medicus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews). A total of 5 reviewers independently screened and extracted the study characteristics. We used a random-effects model to calculate the pooled effect size estimates for meta-analysis. Sensitivity analysis was conducted based on follow-up time, stand-alone app interventions, level of personalization, and pilot studies. Logistic regression was used to examine the structure of app features. RESULTS From the database searches, 8230 records were initially identified. Of these, 172 met the inclusion criteria. Studies were predominantly conducted in high-income countries (164/172, 94.3%). The majority had follow-up periods of 6 months or less (143/172, 83.1%). Over half of the interventions were delivered by a stand-alone app (106/172, 61.6%). Static/one-size-fits-all (97/172, 56.4%) was the most common level of personalization. Intervention frequency was daily or more frequent for the majority of the studies (123/172, 71.5%). A total of 156 studies involving 21,422 participants reported continuous health outcome data. The use of an app to modify behavior (either as a stand-alone or as part of a larger intervention) confers a slight/weak advantage over standard care in health interventions (standardized mean difference=0.38 [95% CI 0.31-0.45]; I2=80%), although heterogeneity was high. CONCLUSIONS The evidence in the literature demonstrates a steady increase in the rigorous evaluation of apps aimed at modifying behavior to promote health and manage disease. Although the literature is growing, the evidence that apps can improve health outcomes is weak. This finding may reflect the need for improved methodological and evaluative approaches to the development and assessment of health care improvement apps.

These sounds can lead to potential negative welfare outcomes if not managed correctly in zoos or in the open ocean. Current wild regulations are based on generally broad taxa-based hearing thresholds, but there is movement to take other contextual factors into account, partially informed by researchers familiar with work in zoological settings. In this spirit, we present more nuanced future directions for the evaluation of acoustic welfare in both wild and managed-care settings, with suggestions for how research in both domains can inform each other as a means to address the paucity of research available on this topic, especially in managed-care environments. ABSTRACT: Cetaceans are potentially at risk of poor welfare due to the animals natural reliance on sound and the persistent nature of anthropogenic noise, especially in the wild. Industrial, commercial, and recreational human activity has expanded across the seas, resulting in a propagation of sound with varying frequency characteristics. In many countries, current regulations are based on the potential to induce hearing loss; however, a more nuanced approach is needed when shaping regulations, due to other non-hearing loss effects including activation of the stress response, acoustic masking, frequency shifts, alterations in behavior, and decreased foraging. Cetaceans in managed-care settings share the same acoustic characteristics as their wild counterparts, but face different environmental parameters. There have been steps to integrate work on welfare in the wild and in managed-care contexts, and the domain of acoustics offers the opportunity to inform and connect information from both managed-care settings and the wild. Studies of subjects in managed-care give controls not available to wild studies, yet because of the conservation implications, wild studies on welfare impacts of the acoustic environment on cetaceans have largely been the focus, rather than those in captive settings. A deep integration of wild and managed-care-based acoustic welfare research can complement discovery in both domains, as captive studies can provide greater experimental control, while the more comprehensive domain of wild noise studies can help determine the gaps in managed-care based acoustic welfare science. We advocate for a new paradigm in anthropogenic noise research, recognizing the value that both wild and managed-care research plays in illustrating how noise pollution affects welfare including physiology, behavior, and cognition.","output":"Cetacean Acoustic Welfare in Wild and Managed-Care Settings: Gaps and Opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose C The aims of this chapter are twofold C first, to develop an understanding of the ways in which primary historical data come to be transformed across generations of popular science histories of emerging epidemics; and second, to develop an understanding of the ways in which those transformations impact on our ability to know what really happened during those epidemics. Approach C The chapter begins with a rhetorical analysis of one particularly influential account of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Therein, we learn that the race to discover the outbreak's aetiology was tainted by scientific malpractice; that an esteemed Chinese microbiologist, Dr. Hong, apparently promoted his own, patently false, aetiological discovery, stifled debate on the matter and, in doing so, held the international response to the outbreak back by a number of weeks.

The knowledge of this dysregulated immune response is not well explained. One hypothesis is that the response of macrophages and neutrophils to infection is disproportionate, resulting in overproduction of cytokines and activation of neutrophils leading to the most severe complications of infection, including the production of multiple microthrombi and endothelial damage. Aim of the study: To evaluate the activation levels of macrophage biomarkers as well as indicators of the development of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) in the first phase of infection in hospitalized patients with COVID19. Patients and Methods: We selected dry blood spot from a total of 60 previously identified SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects. Plasma samples were provided by the Aragon Health System Biobank's collection and were extracted within 5 days of symptom onset. Plasma from 60 healthy controls were used to stablish the control range for NETosis determination. The study was authorized by the Ethics Committee of the Aragon Health System and complies with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR 2016/679) and LO 3/2018. Demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, follow-up during hospitalization, associated comorbidities, and thrombotic complications were obtained from the database. Chitotriosidase activity (ChT), YKL40 chitinase and CCL18/PARC cytokine were measured as markers of macrophage activation. Myeloperoxidase (MPO), Neutrophil Elastase (NE), and S100A8/S100A9 Heterodimer (MPR) were immuno-quantified, levels of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) were measured as well as the presence of DNAsases by fluorimetry as indicators of Netosis. For the comparative analysis, we stratified patients by age groups and disease severity and used the Mann-Whitney U test for statistical comparison, considering a p-value < 0.05 as statistically significant. Results : A statistically significant increase in ChT (p=0.032) and CCL18/PARC (p=0.0001) was observed in the patients group. A comparative study with clinical variables and other inflammation markers as ferritin, D-dimer will be shown upon acceptance. Concerning NET markers, we found a statistically significant increase in MPO, NE, and MRP in COVID-19 patients (p=0.0001; p=0.0290; p=0.0001 respectively), as well as a statistically significant decrease in DNAsa (p=0.0001). No differences in cfDNA levels were observed. The table shows the median (quartile1-quartile3) for each marker in the control group and in the patient group. Conclusions : In this study, biomarkers of macrophage activation do not appear to be more sensitive than the indicators of inflammation in routine clinical practice (ferritin, D-dimer).

Nothing like the Covid-19 pandemic had ever been seen or experienced in this lifetime. Schools, restaurants, businesses, etc., life as we know it closed with fear of catching or spreading Covid-19. Healthcare, including surgeries, were not immune and were frozen. This put not only the health of patients in jeopardy (as delay in care occurred and/or complications) but put the healthcare system in financial limbo. Objective of Project ? To find a way to get surgeries (in particular), but also healthcare back into operational status again. ? To find a way to create a safe environment for not only the patients but the staff. Ease the fear that is associated with spreading/catching Covid-19. Process of Implementation In May 2020, with little than two weeks notice, we created a workflow process for a Drive Thru Covid-19 test site for elective surgical patients. All patients having elective surgery would be required to undergo Covid-19 nasal swab testing to determine if they were Covid-19 negative/positive, prior to their surgeries. All positive patients cases were postponed- stopping Covid-19 from entering the Pre-OP, OR, and PACU areas. As time progressed and the drive thru showed it successes, we have expanded our service to over fifteen different service lines throughout our health system. Statement of Successful Practice The Covid 19 Drive Thru was almost an overnight success. Prior to its implementation, our surgeries at Kennestone were down over 30% during April 2020 (compared to April 2019). After six weeks of introducing the drive thru, surgeries were back up to normal volume (per 2019). Because of the success of surgeries being back in full operation, over thirteen other service lines (plus employees) began to come to the drive thru as well. As of Oct 2020, we have tested over 10,000 patients/employees in the Covid-19 drive thru. Implications for Advancing the Practice of Perianesthesia Nursing Perianesthesia nurses were the core team to identify, create, and execute the Covid 19 drive thru. It was the nurses, that hospital leadership, staff, and providers looked to, to help reopen surgeries (and be there for our patients needs).

We designed subunit vaccine candidates using self-assembling ferritin nanoparticles displaying one of two multimerized SARS-CoV-2 spikes: full-length ectodomain (S-Fer) or a C-terminal 70 amino-acid deletion (SC-Fer). Ferritin is an attractive nanoparticle platform for production of vaccines and ferritin-based vaccines have been investigated in humans in two separate clinical trials. We confirmed proper folding and antigenicity of spike on the surface of ferritin by cryo-EM and binding to conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies. After a single immunization of mice with either of the two spike ferritin particles, a lentiviral SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus assay revealed mean neutralizing antibody titers at least 2-fold greater than those in convalescent plasma from COVID-19 patients. Additionally, a single dose of SC-Fer elicited significantly higher neutralizing responses as compared to immunization with the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) monomer or spike ectodomain trimer alone. After a second dose, mice immunized with SC-Fer exhibited higher neutralizing titers than all other groups. Taken together, these results demonstrate that multivalent presentation of SARS-CoV-2 spike on ferritin can notably enhance elicitation of neutralizing antibodies, thus constituting a viable strategy for single-dose vaccination against COVID-19.","output":"A single immunization with spike-functionalized ferritin vaccines elicits neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New approaches are needed to educate university students about urban sustainability challenges In particular, students need opportunities to learn the importance of integrating not just biophysical issues (e g climate change, pollution, loss of biodiversity, etc ), but how these issues are related to societal issues (e g racism, poverty, access to health care, etc ) To this end, we created a course that uses a comparative, study abroad approach, focusing on the cities of Rochester, NY (USA) and Malmo, Sweden Students are provided with numerous scaffolded opportunities to learn from each other, from local experts, and from faculty and students abroad An assessment of learning outcomes in the course revealed that students who completed the study abroad portion of the course integrated more key topics into their final projects (x = 3 93  0 22) than students who took the same course, but did not go abroad due to the global pandemic in 2020 (x =2 13  0 40;p = 0 004) A survey of students also illustrated that the exposure to a new culture and ideas was key in changing how they thought about environmental problems ? 2020","output":"Integrating multiple perspectives in an urban ecology course"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), may present with a myriad of clinical manifestations and complications.

The heterotrophic bacterium Cupriavidus pinatubonensis JMP134 contains several enzymes involved in sulfur oxidation, but how these enzymes work together to oxidize sulfide in the bacterium has not been studied. Using gene-deletion and whole cell assays, we determined that the bacterium uses sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase to oxidize sulfide to polysulfide, which is further oxidized to sulfite by persulfide dioxygenase. Sulfite spontaneously reacts with polysulfide to produce thiosulfate. The Sox system oxidizes thiosulfate to sulfate. Flavocytochrome c sulfide dehydrogenase enhances thiosulfate oxidation by the Sox system, but couples with the Sox system for sulfide oxidation to sulfate in the absence of sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase. Thus, C. pinatubonensis JMP134 contains a main pathway and a contingent pathway for sulfide oxidation.Importance We establish a new pathway of sulfide oxidation with thiosulfate as a key intermediate in Cupriavidus pinatubonensis JMP134. The bacterium mainly oxidizes sulfide by using sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase, persulfide dioxygenase, and the Sox system with thiosulfate as a key intermediate. Although the purified and reconstituted Sox system oxidizes sulfide, its rate of sulfide oxidation in C. pinatubonensis JMP134 is too low to be physiologically relevant.

The above-mentioned development has accelerated the research related to optimal allocation of logistics centres considering the last-mile distribution. Unfortunately, the theoretical mathematical model that finds an optimal urban logistics centre location based on the matrix of distance, number, and weight of shipments is not applicable in most cities.

The presented methodology can be applied not only when deciding on the appropriate location of the city logistics centre, but also at optimizing the vehicle routing problem. Taking into account the urban logistics sustainability and the e-commerce growth, it was analysed whether the suggested location of urban logistics centre is feasible to provision examined facilities using electric vehicles.

Although antigenic mimicry has been proposed as a major mechanism by which viruses could trigger the development of such diseases, it is not easy to understand how widely different viruses might induce these blood autoimmune diseases by this sole mechanism. In mice infected with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), or mouse hepatitis virus, and treated with anti-erythrocyte or anti-platelet monoclonal autoantibodies at a dose insufficient to induce clinical disease by themselves, the infection sharply enhances the pathogenicity of autoantibodies, leading to severe anemia or thrombocytopenia. This effect is observed only with antibodies that induce disease through phagocytosis. Moreover, the phagocytic activity of macrophages from infected mice is increased and the enhancing effect of infection on autoantibody-mediated pathogenicity is strongly suppressed by treatment of mice with clodronate-containing liposomes. Finally, the disease induced by LDV after administration of autoantibodies is largely suppressed in animals deficient for gamma-interferon receptor. Together, these observations suggest that viruses may trigger autoantibody-mediated anemia or thrombocytopenia by activating macrophages through gamma-interferon production, a mechanism that may account for the pathogenic similarities of multiple infectious agents.","output":"Enhancement of autoantibody pathogenicity by viral infections in mouse models of anemia and thrombocytopenia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Small world network models have been effective in capturing the variable behaviour of reported case data of the SARS coronavirus outbreak in Hong Kong during 2003.

Despite widely varying replication vesicle diameters, the resulting two rings of membrane interaction sites constrain the vesicle neck to a highly uniform shape. Labeling protein A with a His-tag that binds 5-nm Ni-nanogold allowed cryo-EM tomography mapping of the C terminus of protein A to the apical lobe, which correlates well with the predicted structure of the C-proximal polymerase domain of protein A.

Since its outbreak in 2020, the SARS CoV-2 has represented an important challenge for the physicians due to its well known respiratory sequelae. To date, the role of SARS-CoV-2 infection on organs and systems other than lungs and respiratory tract remains less clear. In particular, it remains to be investigated whether the reproductive system can be affected by the SARS-CoV-2 in the long term-period or, in alternative, drugs used to treat COVID-19 might impact the reproductive systems and, in turn, fertility. What is known is that SARS-Cov-2 binds to target cells of host through different receptors including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), neuropilin-1, AXL and antibody-Fc?R complexes. ACE2 physiologically regulates both the expression of angiotensin II (Ang II) as well as Ang-(1-7) to exerts its physiological functions. The reproductive system abundantly expresses ACE2 and produces Ang-(1-7), starting from precursors which are locally generated or derived from systemic circulation. Ang-(1-7) plays an important role of stimulus to the growth and maturation of ovarian follicle as well as to ovulation. Also human endometrium expresses Ang-(1-7), mainly during the post-ovulatory phase. Animal and human observational studies demonstrated that Ang-(1-7) is involved in the maternal immune response to pregnancy and its deficiency is associated with a defective placenta development.

Significant patient surges have caused severe resource allocation challenges in personal protective equipment, medications, and staffing. The virus produces bilateral lung infiltrates causing significant oxygen depletion and respiratory failure thus increasing the need for ventilators. The patients who require ventilation are often requiring prolonged ventilation and depleting hospital resources. Tracheostomy is often utilized in patients requiring prolonged ventilation, and early tracheostomy in critical care patients has been shown in some studies to improve a variety of factors including intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, ventilation weaning, and decreased sedation medication utilization. In a patient surge setting, as long as adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) is available to minimize spread to healthcare workers, early tracheostomy may be a beneficial management of these patients. Decreasing sedative medication utilization may help prevent shortages in future waves of infection and improve patient-provider communication as patients are more alert. Tracheostomy care is easier than endotracheal intubation and may have decreased viral aerosolization risk, particularly if repeat intubation is necessary after a weaning trial. Additionally, tracheostomy patients can be monitored with less staff, decreasing total healthcare worker exposure to infection. To manage risk of exposure, coordination of ventilation controlled by an anesthesiologist or a critical care physician with a surgeon during the procedure can minimize aerosolization to the team. Risk management and resource allocation is of the utmost importance in any global crisis and procedures must be appropriately planned and benefits to patients, as well as minimized exposure to healthcare providers, must be considered. Early tracheostomy could be a beneficial procedure for severe SARS-CoV-2 patients to minimize long-term virus aerosolization and exposure for healthcare workers while decreasing sedation, allowing for earlier transfer out of the ICU, and improving hospital resource utilization.","output":"Tracheostomy and Improvement in Utilization of Hospital Resources During SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic Surge."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Protozoan parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii, Giardia duodenalis, and Cryptosporidium spp., can be transmitted to humans via accidental consumption of contaminated water, fresh produce and foodstuffs.

METHODS: An international, cross-sectional study was conducted in 41 countries. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms, derived from the validated Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2). Multivariable logistic regression identified factors associated with mental health outcomes. Inter-country differences were also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 2527 responses were received, from 41 countries, including China (n = 1213; 48.0%), UK (n = 891; 35.3%), and USA (n = 252; 10.0%).

MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty consecutive patients with symptomatic gallbladder lithiasis were qualified for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LCh) using one 10/11 mm umbilical port, one 5 mm right suprapubic port and two minilaparoscopic, disposable, no-port graspers. There were 26 women and 14 men, with the mean age 56 (17-72) years and with the average body mass index 28 (18-33) kg/m(2). CO2 Veress 15 mm Hg pneumoperitoneum was performed after transumbilical incision, and the first 10/11 mm port was inserted at the beginning for the 5 mm laparoscope and finally for typical instruments. Next under camera control, a 5 mm trocar was inserted in the right 'bikini line'. To this port the laparoscope was relocated from the umbilicus, and under its control two minilaparoscopic, disposable, non-port graspers were introduced after small, 2 mm skin incisions in the right anterior axillary line and in the right mesogastrium to catch the gallbladder. Next through the umbilical port, using typical instruments, the cystic duct and artery were dissected, clipped and cut. The gallbladder was removed through the umbilical port whole. RESULTS There was no conversion to open cholecystectomy. In 5 cases drainage of the gallbladder lodge was necessary through a 5 mm port in the right bikini line. The time of the intervention ranged from 90 min during the introduction of the new method to 50 min for the last procedures. No postoperative complications were observed, and all patients were discharged at the same time as after conventional LCh.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine if there was any change in daily steps, an important component of daily physical activity, and examine risk factors for frequent low daily steps during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We used data collected from the Step Study, a population-based longitudinal study of walking activity among residents aged 40 years in Changsha, China. Daily steps were collected via a smartphone linked to WeChat, a social networking platform. We plotted mean daily steps and the prevalence of low daily steps (1500 steps/day) 30 days before (reference period) and 30 days after (epidemic period) January 21, 2020 (date of the first COVID-19 case diagnosed in Changsha), and compared it with the same corresponding period from 2019. We examined the association of risk factors with the prevalence of frequent low daily steps (1500 steps/day for 14 days) using logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 3544 participants (mean age 51.6 years; n=1226 females, 34.6%), mean daily steps dropped from 8097 to 5440 and the prevalence of low daily steps increased from 3% (2287/76,136 person-day) to 18.5% (12,951/70,183 person-day) during the reference and epidemic periods, respectively. No such phenomenon was observed during the corresponding period in 2019. Older age (P for interaction=.001) and female sex (P for interaction<.001) were both associated with a higher prevalence of frequent low daily steps and were more pronounced during the epidemic period. More education was associated with a lower prevalence of frequent low daily steps during the reference period but not the epidemic period (P for interaction=.34). Body mass index or comorbidity were not associated with frequent low daily steps during either period. CONCLUSIONS: Daily steps of Changsha residents aged 40 years dropped significantly during the COVID-19 period, especially among older adults and females. Although successful physical distancing, measured by the rapid downward trend in daily step counts of residents, played a critical role in the containment of the COVID-19 epidemic, our findings of an increase in the prevalence of frequent low daily steps raise concerns about unintended effects on physical activity.","output":"Physical Distancing Measures and Walking Activity in Middle-aged and Older Residents in Changsha, China, During the COVID-19 Epidemic Period: Longitudinal Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tissue-resident immune cells stably localize in tissues largely independent of the circulatory system. While initial studies have focused on the recognition of CD8 (+) tissue-resident memory T (CD8 T (RM)) cells, it is now clear that numerous cell types such as CD4 (+) T cells, gd T cells, innate lymphoid cells and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells form stable populations in tissues. They are enriched at the barrier surfaces and within non-lymphoid compartments. They provide an extensive immune network capable of sensing local perturbations of the bodys homeostasis. This positioning enables immune cells to positively influence immune protection against infection and cancer but paradoxically also augment autoimmunity, allergy and chronic inflammatory diseases. Here, we highlight the recent studies across multiple lymphoid immune cell types that have emerged on this research topic and extend our understanding of this important cellular network. In addition, we highlight the areas that remain gaps in our knowledge of the regulation of these cells and how a deeper understanding may result in new ways to target these cells to influence disease outcome and treatments.","output":"Tissue-resident lymphocytes: weaponized sentinels at barrier surfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduo/Objetivos: Entre as IRAS, a Pneumonia associada  ventilao mecanica (PAV)  considerada a infeco nosocomial com risco de vida mais frequente em UTI, somados  capacidade de resistncias dos microrganismos temos um grande empecilho ao tratamento dos pacientes.

Such coding is usually done manually in hospitals but could potentially be automated to improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical coding. Recent studies on deep learning for automated medical coding achieved promising performances. However, the explainability of these models is usually poor, preventing them to be used confidently in supporting clinical practice. Another limitation is that these models mostly assume independence among labels, ignoring the complex correlation among medical codes which can potentially be exploited to improve the performance. We propose a Hierarchical Label-wise Attention Network (HLAN), which aimed to interpret the model by quantifying importance (as attention weights) of words and sentences related to each of the labels. Secondly, we propose to enhance the major deep learning models with a label embedding (LE) initialisation approach, which learns a dense, continuous vector representation and then injects the representation into the final layers and the label-wise attention layers in the models. We evaluated the methods using three settings on the MIMIC-III discharge summaries: full codes, top-50 codes, and the UK NHS COVID-19 shielding codes. Experiments were conducted to compare HLAN and LE initialisation to the state-of-the-art neural network based methods. HLAN achieved the best Micro-level AUC and $F_1$ on the top-50 code prediction and comparable results on the NHS COVID-19 shielding code prediction to other models. By highlighting the most salient words and sentences for each label, HLAN showed more meaningful and comprehensive model interpretation compared to its downgraded baselines and the CNN-based models.

Despite an increasing number of reports on false-negative and false-positive RDT results, there is a lack of systematic quality control activities for RDTs deployed in malaria surveillance programs. Our study provides a larger scale comparative evaluation of RDTs used in the 2018 Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) conducted on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea. We conducted a molecular analysis by extraction of nucleic acids from 1,800 negative and 1,065 positive RDTs followed by qPCR analysis. These results were combined with a dataset collected in a comprehensive questionnaire from each MIS participant. Of the 2,865 RDTs that were collected in 2018 on Bioko Island and analysed in our study, 4.7% had a false-negative result. These false-negative RDT results were associated with low parasite density infections. In a substantial proportion of samples, we identified masked pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletions in which at least one P. falciparum strain carried a gene deletion. Among all positive RDTs analysed, 28.4% were tested negative by qPCR and therefore considered to be false-positive. Analysing the questionnaire data collected from the participants, this high proportion of false-positive RDT results could be explained by PfHRP2 antigen persistence after recent malaria treatment. We conclude that malaria surveillance depending solely on RDTs needs well-integrated quality control procedures assessing the extend and impact of reduced sensitivity and specificity of RDTs on malaria control programs.","output":"Analysis of nucleic acids extracted from rapid diagnostic tests reveals a significant proportion of false positive test results associated with recent malaria treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic left a deep mark in the health systems around the globe, leading to an important change in the way we intend the access to the healthcare and its fruition. Hospitals faced something unexpected, and they underwent a deep change and so did orthopaedic activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In A. Gemelli University hospital new protocols were adopted for the safe management of patients affected by SARS-CoV-2. Among these patients, six had to be treated also for orthopaedic problems. The management of these patients, from the admission in the Emergency Room (E.R). to the operating room (O.R.), followed the protocols we developed for the coronavirus crisis. RESULTS: Four among the six patients underwent surgical treatments. Two of them showed a change of their clinical status, due to a worsening of COVID-19 symptoms, so the surgical option was postponed. All of them were admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit, rather than the Orthopaedic and Traumatology Unit, in order to provide the best measures to prevent the spread of the contagion and to ensure the best treatment for COVID-19. No O.R. staff was infected by SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: More studies are needed to provide a higher statistical significance to the safety measures taken in order to contrast the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Surgical Room. Orthopaedic surgeons are more exposed to the contagion due to the particular tools set they use.

The primary aim of this work is to determine how cancer risk perceptions and provider communication behaviors, in addition to known demographic factors, influence the uptake of both cervical and CRC screening or a single screen among women in southeast Michigan. METHODS: Fourteen health services and communication behavior questions were adapted from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) and administered to a multiethnic sample of adults in southeast Michigan. The outcome variable was self-reported up-to-date cervical cancer and/or CRC screening as defined by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Demographic and cancer risk/communication behavior responses of the four screening populations (both tests, one test, no tests) were analyzed with multinomial regression for all comparisons. RESULTS: Of the 394 respondents, 54% were up to date for both cervical and CRC screening, 21% were up to date with only cervical cancer screening and 12% were up to date for only CRC screening. Of the 14 risk perception and communication behavior questions, only Did your primary care physician (PCP) involve you in the decisions about your health care as much as you wanted? was significantly associated with women having both screens compared to only cervical cancer screening (aOR 1.67; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.57). The multivariate model showed age, and Middle East and North African (MENA) ethnicity and Black race, in addition to PCP-patient dyad decision-making to be associated with the cancer screenings women completed. CONCLUSIONS: Optimizing PCP-patient decision-making in health care may increase opportunities for both cervical cancer and CRC screening either in the office or by self-sampling.

Sleep disturbances are complex and caused by several factors and are difficult to treat. There is a need for more robust and systematic studies dealing with sleep disturbances in older people with dementia. The aim of this study was to investigate effects from robot-assisted (Paro) group activity on sleep patterns in nursing home (NH) residents with dementia. DESIGN: A cluster randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Special care units in 10 NH in Norway. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 60 participants over 65 years with dementia were recruited. Thirty participants were recruited to the intervention group and 30 participants to the control group. INTERVENTION: Participants participated in group activity with Paro for 30 minutes twice a week over 12 weeks or in control group (treatment as usual). MEASUREMENTS: Sleep-wake patterns were assessed objectively by 7 days of wrist actigraphy before and after the intervention. Data were collected between March 2013 and September 2014. Data were analyzed using mixed models. RESULTS: Positive effects on change in sleep were found in the intervention group as compared with the control group. The intervention group increased percentage of sleep efficiency, increased the amount of total sleep time and reduced number of nocturnal awakenings. In addition, a significant effect was found in reduced awakenings after sleep onset. CONCLUSIONS: Social stimulation through engaging group activity could contribute to improved sleep in people with dementia in NH. Increased sleep efficiency and total sleep time, in addition to fewer night awakenings, affect central indicators of good sleep quality across the life span. Improved sleep quality will also affect quality of life and comorbidities in vulnerable groups.

Many of these viruses are highly pathogenic to humans however bats remain asymptomatic. The mechanism by which bats control viral replication is unknown. Here we utilize an integrated approach of proteomics informed by transcriptomics to compare the response of immortalized bat and human cells following infection with the highly pathogenic bat-borne Hendra virus (HeV). RESULTS: The host response between the cell lines was significantly different at both the mRNA and protein levels. Human cells demonstrated minimal response eight hours post infection, followed by a global suppression of mRNA and protein abundance. Bat cells demonstrated a robust immune response eight hours post infection, which led to the up-regulation of apoptosis pathways, mediated through the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL). HeV sensitized bat cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, by up-regulating death receptor transcripts. At 48 and 72 hours post infection, bat cells demonstrated a significant increase in apoptotic cell death. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to comprehensively compare the response of bat and human cells to a highly pathogenic zoonotic virus. An early induction of innate immune processes followed by apoptosis of virally infected bat cells highlights the possible involvement of programmed cell death in the host response. Our study shows for the first time a side-by-side high-throughput analysis of a dangerous zoonotic virus in cell lines derived from humans and the natural bat host.

Methods: SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR in aerosols collected by non-powered cold traps. SARS-CoV-2 spreading kinetics and indoor hotspots could be identified in isolation units and at public places within a high-endemic area.

During the early phase of the pandemic, several large outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in food manufacturing plants resulting in deaths and economic loss, with approximately 15% of personnel diagnosed as asymptomatic for COVID-19. Spread by asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals has been implicated in large outbreaks of COVID-19. In March 2020, we assisted in implementation of environmental monitoring programs for SARS-CoV-2 in zones 3 and 4 of 116 food production facilities. All participating facilities had already implemented measures to prevent symptomatic personnel from coming to work. During the study period, from 17 March to 3 September 2020, 1.23% of the 22,643 environmental samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that infected individuals were actively shedding virus. Virus contamination was commonly found on frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs, handles, table surfaces, and sanitizer dispensers. Most processing plants managed to control their environmental contamination when they became aware of the positive findings. Comparisons of positive test results for plant personnel and environmental surfaces in one plant revealed a close correlation.

The pandemic has resulted in social distancing, travel restrictions, decreased trade, high unemployment, commodity price decline, and financial stress that has impacted the global economy. Since December 2020, a massive vaccination campaign is undergoing in every country on the planet to protect against SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination is the cheapest health-care interventions that can save more lives than any other drugs or therapies. Some of the common diseases of the twentieth century including smallpox and polio are seldom reported due to intense vaccination programs that eradicated it. Smallpox is completely eradicated globally; whereas, polio is confined to only a couple of countries. Vaccination has not only improved the health of man but also improved food security by preventing diseases in farm animals and aquacultured fish. Awareness of the principles of immunology and novel vaccines has led to effective vaccination strategies. Climate change could lead to generation of new strains of infectious microorganisms that would require development of novel vaccines. Recent years have seen the increase in incidence of brain-eating amoeba and flesh-eating bacteria (necrotizing fasciitis). There are no vaccines for these diseases. Though vaccination programs have eradicated several diseases and increased the quality of life, there are several diseases that have no effective vaccines. Currently there are no vaccines for cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases, as well as infectious diseases like tuberculosis, AIDS, and parasitic diseases including malaria. Spontaneous evolution of pathogenic microorganisms may lead to pandemics that impact the health of not only humanity but also other animals. Hence, the challenge to vaccinologists is the development of novel vaccines and vaccination strategies within limited time period and using minimum resources.

METHOD: A national survey was performed among all 148 hospitals providing CRC services. Information was collected about changes in referrals, diagnostic, staging and therapeutic procedures, as well as whether there was access to a 'cold site' (a hospital facility free of COVID-19). Clinicians in each hospital were also asked to give the 'single most important lesson learned' about keeping services safe and effective. RESULTS: Full responses were received from 123 (83%) hospitals, and information about 'cold sites' was available for 146 (99%). Eighty hospitals (54%) had access to a 'cold site' and this was increased in regions with higher COVID-19 infection rates (p <0.001). Of the 123 responding hospitals, 105 (85%) indicated that referrals of patients with suspected CRC had dropped by at least 30%, and 69 (56%) indicated that treatment plans were altered in at least 50% of CRC patients. However, 'cold site' availability protected the capacity for diagnostic colonoscopy (p = 0.013) and CRC resection (p = 0.010). Many 'lessons learned' highlighted the importance of adequate structural service organization, often mentioning 'cold sites' and regional coordination as examples, good communication and triage of patients based on clinical urgency.

However, health proposal repetition and its perceived efficacy also influence the behavior intention toward the proposal, which has not yet been confirmed in the COVID-19 context. The present study examined whether the extended parallel process model (EPPM) could be generalized to a naturalistic context like the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we explored how repetition of a health proposal is involved with the EPPM. In this study, two groups of participants were exposed to the same health proposal related to COVID-19, where one group was exposed once and another group twice. Participants then filled out a questionnaire consisting of items concerning behavior intention and adapted from the Risk Behavior Diagnosis Scale. Structural equation modeling was used to determine the multivariate associations between the variables. Although the results showed that behavior intention is predicted by perceived efficacy, no significant influence of perceived threat was detected.

Different European countries have committed to vaccination strategies with variable population inoculation rates. We sought to investigate the extent to which the COVID-19 vaccination strategies, inoculation rate, and COVID-19 outcome differ between Cyprus and Malta. Data were obtained from the Ministry of Health websites and COVID-19 dashboards, while vaccination data were obtained from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control until mid-June, 2021. Comparative assessments were performed between the two countries using Microsoft(?) Excel for Mac, Version 16.54. Both islands took part in the European Unions advanced purchase agreement and received their first batch of vaccines on 27 December 2020. The positivity rate and mortality between December and June differs between the two countries (average positivity rate Cyprus 1.34, Malta 3.37 p  0.01; average mortality Cyprus 7.29, Malta 9.68 p  0.01). Both the positivity rate and mortality for Cyprus declined due to strict public health measures and vaccination roll-out in early January (positivity rate by 95% and mortality by 58%). In contrast, for Malta, there was a sharp increase (64% p  0.01) with almost no public health restrictions in place and soaring cases during the Christmas and Carnival period until March, when lockdown measures were re-introduced. A distinctive difference between Cyprus and Malta in positivity rate (14 per 100,000 population; p  0.01) can also be observed between January and mid-April 2021. However, from April onwards it is evident that the positivity rate and mortality decline (positivity rate Cyprus by 82%, Malta by 95%; mortality Cyprus by 90%, Malta by 95%, p  0.01, respectively) in both countries as the vaccination roll-outs progressed, covering about 58.93% of the Maltese population, while Cyprus had fully inoculated about 38.03% of its population. The vaccine strategies and vaccination rates were similar for both countries; yet Malta had the fastest vaccine roll-out. Reluctancy to get vaccinated, significant differences in the vaccination appointment scheduling system, and the freedom of vaccination choice for the citizens in Cyprus may have contributed to a delayed vaccination roll-out.

Serologic testing was performed at 3, 6, and 9 months after COVID-19 vaccination using the Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike enzyme immunoassay (range <0.4 to >2500 U/mL [positive 0.8]), which tests for antibodies against the spike protein's receptor-binding domain (RBD). Results In March 2021, 45 LVAD patients (80% HeartMate 3) were enrolled and 24 (53%) received Pfizer vaccines, 17 (38%) Moderna, and 4 (9%) J&J at a median duration of LVAD support of 34 months (1-114). Most were male (89%) and white non-Hispanic (71%) persons with median age 62 years (23-78); 26 (58%) had diabetes, 16 (36%) had chronic kidney disease (CKD), and 3 (7%) were on immunosuppressive medications. Median absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) at the time of their vaccine was 1.26 K/uL (0.54-3.41). All patients developed a detectable anti-RBD antibody after vaccination, which began to wane after 3 months. The median anti-RBD IgG titers were 1132 U/mL, 360 U/mL, and 286 U/mL at 3, 6, and 9 months, respectively, post-vaccination (Figure). Age > 60 years, ALC < 1.5 K/uL, and history of CKD were associated with lower median anti-RBD IgG titers at 3, 6, and 9 months. Moderna vaccine recipients had the highest and J&J the lowest anti-RBD IgG titers at 3-months. In the 9-month study period, there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events or breakthrough COVID-19 infections.

The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a considerable mental strain on frontline healthcare workers (HCWs). Although a number of studies have reported on burnout during the peak of the pandemic, few studies have analyzed it after the pandemic temporally subsided. This study aimed to identify which intervention or support was helpful to reduce the physical and mental burden during the pandemic. Methods. An online cross-sectional survey of HCWs from June 15 to July 6, 2020, was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Tokyo, Japan. Demographic characteristics, results of the Japanese version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey, types of anxiety and stress, changes in life and work after the peak of the pandemic, and types of support aimed at reducing the physical or mental burden, were determined. Results. Out of 672 HCWs, 149 (22.6%) met the overall burnout criteria. Figure 1 showed the comparison of what helped reduce their physical and mental burden between the burnout group and the non-burnout group. After adjusted by the potential covariates, burnout was more prevalent in women (OR, 3.11;95% CI, 1.45-6.67;p = .003), and had heightened anxiety due to unfamiliarity with PPE (OR, 1.98;95% CI, 1.20-3.27;p=.007).

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown of the Danish society, pregnant women were considered to be at increased risk, and access to antenatal care changed. METHODS On 8 April 2020A, a questionnaire was sent to 332 pregnant women previously sampled by general practitioners in two Danish regions. The women were contacted via secured e-mail (e-Boks), and questionnaires were returned until 6 May. RESULTS The questionnaire was returned by 257 women (77%). More than half believed that they were at a high risk of infection with COVID-19, and a third of the women were concerned about the risk of serious disease - especially for their unborn child. Almost 90% isolated at home most of the time. The majority were worried about possible consequences of the pandemic for antenatal care, but very few had actually missed a scheduled preventive consultation with their general practitioner, and only 15% had missed an appointment with their midwife. The majority of the women preferred normal consultations and found no added safety in shifting the consultation from the normal clinical setting.

IBD or Gumboro disease leads to high rates of morbidity and mortality of infected animals and is responsible for major economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. IBD is characterized by a massive loss of IgM-bearing B lymphocytes and the destruction of the bursa of Fabricius. The molecular bases of IBDV pathogenicity are still poorly understood; nonetheless, an exacerbated cytokine immune response and B cell depletion due to apoptosis are considered main factors that contribute to the severity of the disease. Here we have studied the role of type I interferon (IFN) in IBDV infection. While IFN pretreatment confers protection against subsequent IBDV infection, the addition of IFN to infected cell cultures early after infection drives massive apoptotic cell death. Downregulation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), or nuclear factor B (NF-B) expression drastically reduces the extent of apoptosis, indicating that they are critical proteins in the apoptotic response induced by IBDV upon treatment with IFN-. Our results indicate that IBDV genomic dsRNA is a major viral factor that contributes to the triggering of apoptosis. These findings provide novel insights into the potential mechanisms of IBDV-induced immunosuppression and pathogenesis in chickens.IMPORTANCE IBDV infection represents an important threat to the poultry industry worldwide. IBDV-infected chickens develop severe immunosuppression, which renders them highly susceptible to secondary infections and unresponsive to vaccination against other pathogens. The early dysregulation of the innate immune response led by IBDV infection and the exacerbated apoptosis of B cells have been proposed as the main factors that contribute to virus-induced immunopathogenesis. Our work contributes for the first time to elucidating a potential mechanism driving the apoptotic death of IBDV-infected cells upon exposure to type I IFN. We provide solid evidence about the critical importance of PKR, TNF-, and NF-B in this phenomenon. The described mechanism could facilitate the early clearance of infected cells, thereby aiding in the amelioration of IBDV-induced pathogenesis, but it could also contribute to B cell depletion and immunosuppression. The balance between these two opposing effects might be dramatically affected by the genetic backgrounds of both the host and the infecting virus strain.","output":"Exacerbated Apoptosis of Cells Infected with Infectious Bursal Disease Virus upon Exposure to Interferon Alpha."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"George F Winter gives an overview of the impact of the coronavirus on healthcare workers and pregnant women [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of British Journal of Midwifery is the property of Mark Allen Holdings Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"COVID-19: what are the physical and mental challenges?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Amid the increasing number of pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, there is a need for a quick and easy method to obtain a non-invasive sample for the detection of this novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to investigate the potential use of saliva samples as a non-invasive tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: From 27 March to 4 April, 2020, we prospectively collected saliva samples and a standard nasopharyngeal and throat swab in persons seeking care at an acute respiratory infection clinic in a university hospital during the outbreak of COVID-19. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed, and the results of the two specimens were compared. RESULTS: Two-hundred pairs of the samples were collected. Sixty-nine (34.5%) patients were male, and the median (interquartile) age was 36 (28-48) years. Using nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR as the reference standard, the prevalence of COVID-19 diagnosed by nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR was 9.5%.

METHOD: In this study, we investigated the suitability of 70(o)C dry heat and microwave-generated steam (MGS) for reprocessing of FFP2/N95-type respirators, and Type-II surgical face masks. S. aureus was used as surrogate as it is less susceptible than enveloped viruses to chemical and physical processes. RESULTS: We observed >4 log(10) reductions in the viability of dry S. aureus treated by dry heat for 90 minutes at 70C and >6 log(10) reductions by MGS in 90 seconds. After 3 reprocessing cycles, neither process was found to negatively impact the bacterial or NaCl filtration efficiency of the respirators that were tested. However, MGS was incompatible with Type-II surgical masks tested, as we confirmed that bacterial filtration capacity was completely lost following reprocessing. MGS was observed to be incompatible with some respirator types due to arcing observed around some types of metal nose clips and by loss of adhesion of clips to the mask. CONCLUSION: Considering the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, we propose a reprocessing PPE/face mask workflow for use in medical areas.","output":"Dry heat and microwave generated steam protocols for the rapid decontamination of respiratory personal protective equipment in response to COVID-19-related shortages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To explore public knowledge, understanding of public health recommendations, perceptions, and trust in information sources related to COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of central Pennsylvanian adults evaluated self-reported knowledge, and a convergent, mixed methods design was used to assess beliefs about recommendations, intended behaviors, perceptions, and concerns related to infectious disease risk, and trust of information sources. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 5,948 adults. The estimated probability of correct response for the basic knowledge score, weighted with confidence, was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.79-0.80). Knowledge was significantly higher in patients with higher education and nonminority race. While the majority of respondents reported that they believed following CDC recommendations would decrease the spread of COVID-19 in their community and intended to adhere to them, only 65.2% rated social isolation with the highest level of belief and adherence. The most trusted information source was federal public health websites (42.8%). Qualitative responses aligned with quantitative data and described concerns about illness, epidemiologic issues, economic and societal disruptions, and distrust of the executive branch's messaging. The survey was limited by a lack of minority representation, potential selection bias, and evolving COVID-19 information that may impact generalizability and interpretability. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge about COVID-19 and intended adherence to behavioral recommendations were high. There was substantial distrust of the executive branch of the federal government, however, and concern about mixed messaging and information overload. These findings highlight the importance of consistent messaging from trusted sources that reaches diverse groups.","output":"Knowledge, Perceptions, and Preferred Information Sources Related to COVID-19 Among Central Pennsylvania Adults Early in the Pandemic: A Mixed Methods Cross-Sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective In Taiwan, the overall incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is 15.74 per 100,000 person-years, the mortality rate is 57.8%, and its overall prevalence in the intensive care unit (ICU) is 10.4%.

An essential determinant of the virus spread is a series of individual decisions, such as wearing face masks in public space. Those decisions depend on trade-offs between costs (or benefits) and risks, and beliefs are key to explain these. METHODS: We elicit beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic during lockdown in France by means of surveys asking French citizens about their belief of the infection fatality ratio (IFR) for COVID-19, own risk to catch the disease, risk as perceived by others, and expected prevalence rate. Those self-assessments were measured twice during lockdown: about 2 weeks after lockdown started and about 2 weeks before lockdown ended. We also measured the quality of these beliefs with respect to available evidence at the time of the surveys, allowing us to assess the calibration of beliefs based on risk-related socio-demographics. Finally, comparing own risk to expected prevalence rates in the two successive surveys provides a dynamic view of comparative optimism with respect to the disease. RESULTS: The risk perceptions are rather high in absolute terms and they increased between the two surveys. We found no evidence for an impact of personal experience with COVID-19 on beliefs and lower risk perceptions of the IFR when someone in the respondents family has been diagnosed with a disease. Answers to survey 1 confirmed this pattern with a clear indication that respondents were optimistic about their chances to catch COVID-19. However, in survey 2, respondents revealed comparative pessimism. CONCLUSION: The results show that respondents overestimated the probabilities to catch or die from COVID-19, which is not unusual and does not necessarily reflect a strong deviation from rational behavior. While a rational model explains why the own risk to catch COVID-19 rose between the two surveys, it does not explain why the subjective assessment of the IFR remained stable. The comparative pessimism in survey 2 was likely due to a concomitant increase in the respondents perceived chances to catch the disease and a decreased expected prevalence rate.","output":"Beliefs and Risk Perceptions About COVID-19: Evidence From Two Successive French Representative Surveys During Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In High Performance Computing, it is common to deal with substantial computing resources, and the use of a Resource Management System (RMS) becomes fundamental.

COVID-19 racial discrimination was positively associated with depressive symptoms, and this association did not vary between Chinese Americans and other Asian subgroups. Communications with a spouse/partner buffered the mental burden of racial discrimination. Those who shared their experience in online ethnic communities displayed stronger depressive symptoms than who did not.

Importantly, ICAC can be subtyped into a medial or intimal pattern that may differentially influence the effect of EVT in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Methods- All 500 patients included in the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical trial of Endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke in the Netherlands) were evaluated. Volume (mm3) and location pattern (tunica intima or tunica media) of ICAC could be determined on baseline noncontrast computed tomography in 344 patients. Functional outcome at 90 days was assessed with the modified Rankin Scale. Next, we investigated the association of ICAC volume and pattern with functional outcome using adjusted ordinal logistic regression models. Effect modification by EVT was assessed with an interaction term between treatment allocation and ICAC aspect. Results- We found evidence for treatment effect modification by ICAC pattern ( P interaction=0.04). Patients with predominantly medial calcification had better functional outcome with EVT than without this treatment (adjusted common odds ratio, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.23-4.39), but we observed no effect of EVT in patients with predominantly intimal calcifications (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.40-1.68).

Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is an important health parameter and CRF-measures are advocated in routine health evaluations. CRF associates with CVD risk, and exercise modalities such as high intensity interval training (HIIT) can increase CRF and mitigate CVD risk factors. In IJD, exercise is rarely used in CVD risk management and the cardioprotective effect of HIIT is unclear. Furthermore, the clinical applicability of HIIT to primary care settings is largely unknown and warrants investigation. The primary aim is to assess the effect of a HIIT programme on CRF in patients with IJD. Second, we will evaluate the effect of HIIT on CVD risk and disease activity in patients with IJD, feasibility of HIIT in primary care and validity of non-exercise algorithms to detect change in CRF. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: ExeHeart is a single-blinded, randomised controlled trial. Sixty patients with IJD will be recruited from the Preventive Cardio-Rheuma clinic at Diakonhjemmet Hospital, Norway. Patients will be assigned to receive standard care (relevant lifestyle advice and cardio-preventive medication) or standard care plus a 12-week HIIT intervention by physiotherapists in primary care. HIIT sessions will be prescribed at 90%C95% of peak heart rate. Outcomes include CRF (primary outcome), CVD risk factors, anthropometric measures, disease activity and patient-reported outcomes related to pain, fatigue, disease, physical activity and exercise and will be assessed at baseline, 3 months (primary endpoint) and 6 months postbaseline.

Coronaviruses have been known for 60 years. They are usually responsible for the induction of mild respiratory signs in humans. However, since 2002, the bat-borne virus started to induce fatal epidemics according to WHO reports. In this year, the first serious human coronavirus epidemic (severe acute respiratory syndrome; SARS) occurred (China, 8098 cases, 774 deaths [9.5% of the cases] in 17 countries). The case fatality was higher in elderly patients above 60 years and reached 50% of the cases. SARS epidemic was followed 10 years later by the emergence of the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) in Saudi Arabia (in 2012, 2260 cases, 803 deaths [35.5% of the cases] in 27 countries). Finally, in December 2019, a new epidemic in Wuhan, China, (corona virus disease 2019, COVID-19) emerged and could spread to 217 countries infecting more than 86,255,226 cases and killing 1,863,973 people by the end of 2020. There are many reasons why bats are ideal reservoir hosts for viral diseases such as the tolerance of their immune system to the invading viruses for several months. They can actively shed the viruses, although they develop no clinical signs (will be discussed in details later in the review). Bats were directly or indirectly involved in the three previous coronavirus epidemics. The indirect transmission takes place via intermediate hosts including civet cats for SARS and dromedary camels in the case of MERS. Although bats are believed to be the source of COVID-19 pandemic, direct pieces of evidence are still lacking. Therefore, coronaviruses' role in epidemics induction and the epidemiological role of bats are discussed. The current work also presents different evidence (phylogenetic data, animal experiments, bats artificial infection studies, and computerized models of SARS-CoV2 evolution) that underline the involvement of bats in the epidemiology of the pandemic.","output":"Coronaviruses in humans and animals: the role of bats in viral evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1 Jobu Hospital for Respiratory Diseases, Japan B Back ground & Aims b : The purpose was to determine whether there was a change in people's levels of physical activity and to examine the factors associated with a decline in physical activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Network analysis offers a potential new framework to conceptualize a complex network of symptomCsymptom interactions, and the network structure is analyzed to reveal the core characteristics. However, no previous study examined the network structure of SI symptoms. Thus, this study aimed to elucidate characteristics and compare sex differences of SI symptom networks in the general population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1491 participants from China were recruited from 30 May to 17 June, 2021. SI symptoms were assessed by using the Sleep Inertia Questionnaire (SIQ). The network structures were estimated and compared using network analytic methods in the R version 4.1.1. RESULTS: Centrality properties analysis of the expected influence suggested that symptoms of Feel sleepy, Groggy, fuzzy or hazy mind, and Dread starting your day exerted greatest influences. The weighted adjacency matrix revealed that the Dread starting your day and Anxious about the upcoming day edge showed the strongest connection (edge weight value = 0.70).

They also provide significant ecosystem services, by supporting secondary production and fisheries. Phytoplankton biomass and diversity have been identified by the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) as Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs), properties that need to be monitored to better understand and predict the ocean system. Phytoplankton identification and enumeration relies on the skills and expertise of highly trained taxonomic analysts. The training of new taxonomic analysts is intensive and requires months to years of supervised training before an analyst is able to independently and consistently apply identification skills to a sample. During the COVID-19 pandemic, access to laboratories was greatly restricted and social distancing requirements prevented supervised training. However, access to phytoplankton imaging technologies such as the Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB), FlowCam, and PlanktoScope, combined with open online taxonomic identification platforms such as EcoTaxa, provided a means to continue monitoring, research, and training activities remotely when in-person activities were restricted. Although such technologies can not entirely replace microscopy, they have a great potential for supporting an expansion in taxonomic training, monitoring, surveillance, and research capacity. In this paper we highlight a set of imaging and collaboration tools and describe how they were leveraged during laboratory lockdowns to advance research and monitoring goals. Anecdotally, we found that the use of imaging tools accelerated the training of new taxonomic analysts in our phytoplankton analysis laboratory. Based on these experiences, we outline how these technologies can be used to increase capacity in taxonomic training and expertise, as well as how they can be used more broadly to expand research opportunities and capacity.","output":"Imaging Technologies Build Capacity and Accessibility in Phytoplankton Species Identification Expertise for Research and Monitoring: Lessons Learned During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PAM) pathway is a key regulator of tumor therapy resistance. We investigated M2698, an oral p70S6K/AKT dual inhibitor, in patients with advanced cancer who failed standard therapies. METHODS: M2698 was administered as monotherapy (escalation, 15-380 mg daily; food effect cohort, 240-320 mg daily) and combined with trastuzumab or tamoxifen. RESULTS: Overall, 101 patients were treated (M2698, n = 62; M2698/trastuzumab, n = 13; M2698/tamoxifen, n = 26). Patients were predominantly aged < 65 years, were female, had performance status 1 and were heavily pretreated. There was a dose- and concentration-dependent inhibition of pS6 levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumor tissue. M2698 was well tolerated; the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were gastrointestinal, abnormal dreams and fatigue (serious, attributed to M2698: monotherapy, 8.1%; M2698/trastuzumab, 7.7%; M2698/tamoxifen, 11.5% of patients). The recommended phase 2 doses of M2698 were 240 mg QD (monotherapy), 160 mg QD (M2698/trastuzumab) and 160 mg QD/240 mg intermittent regimen (M2698/tamoxifen). In the monotherapy cohort, 27.4% of patients had stable disease at 12 weeks; no objective response was noted. The median progression-free survival (PFS) durations in patients with PAM pathway alterations with and without confounding markers (KRAS, EGFR, AKT2) were 1.4 months and 2.8 months, respectively.

As to malaria, among the classic vaccine targets, the Apical membrane antigen (AMA-1) was proven to have important B cell epitopes that can induce specific immune response and, hence, became key players for a vaccine approach. The peptides selection was carried out using a bioinformatic approach based on Hidden Markov Models profiles of known antigens and propensity scale methods based on hydrophilicity and secondary structure prediction. The antigenicity of the selected B-cell peptides was assessed by multiple serological assays using sera from acute P.vivax infected subjects. The synthetic peptides were recognized by 45.5%, 48.7% and 32.2% of infected subjects for peptides I, II and III respectively. Moreover, when synthetized together (tripeptide), the reactivity increases up to 62%, which is comparable to the reactivity found against the whole protein PvAMA-1 (57%). Furthermore, IgG reactivity against the tripeptide after depletion was reduced by 42%, indicating that these epitopes may be responsible for a considerable part of the protein immunogenicity.

In view of their easy availability and increasing use in Indian children, and their excessive use being linked to physical, developmental and emotional problems, there is a need to develop guidelines related to ensure digital wellness and regulate screen time in infants, children, and adolescents. OBJECTIVES To review the evidence related to effects of screen-based media and excessive screen time on children's health; and to formulate recommendations for limiting screen time and ensuring digital wellness in Indian infants, children and adolescents. PROCESS An Expert Committee constituted by the Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP), consisting of various stakeholders in private and public sector, reviewed the literature and existing guidelines. A detailed review document was circulated to the members, and the National consultative meet was held online on 26th March 2021 for a day-long deliberation on framing the guidelines. The consensus review and recommendations formulated by the Group were circulated to the participants and the guidelines were finalized. CONCLUSIONS Very early exposure to screen-based media and excessive screen time (>1-2h/d) seems to be widely prevalent in Indian children. The Group recommends that children below 2 years age should not be exposed to any type of screen, whereas exposure should be limited to a maximum of one hour of supervised screen time per day for children 24-59 months age, and less than two hours per day for children 5-10 years age. Screen time must not replace other activities such as outdoor physical activities, sleep, family and peer interaction, studies and skill development, which are necessary for overall health and development of the children and adolescents. Families should ensure a warm, nurturing, supportive, fun filled and secure environment at home, and monitor their children's screen use to ensure that the content being watched is educational, age-appropriate and non-violent. Families, schools and pediatricians should be educated regarding the importance of recording screen exposure and digital wellness as a part of routine child health assessment, and detect any signs of cyberbullying or media addiction; and tackle it timely with expert consultation if needed.","output":"Indian Academy of Pediatrics Guidelines on Screen Time and Digital Wellness in Infants, Children and Adolescents."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has broader geographic spread and potentially longer lasting effects than those of previous disasters. Necessary preventive precautions for the transmission of COVID-19 has resulted in delays for in-person health care services, especially at the outset of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Among a US sample, we examined the rates of delays (defined as cancellations and postponements) in health care at the outset of the pandemic and characterized the reasons for such delays. METHODS: As part of an internet-based survey that was distributed on social media in April 2020, we asked a US-based convenience sample of 2570 participants about delays in their health care resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Participant demographics and self-reported worries about general health and the COVID-19 pandemic were explored as potent determinants of health care delays. In addition to all delays, we focused on the following three main types of delays, which were the primary outcomes in this study: dental, preventive, and diagnostic care delays. For each outcome, we used bivariate statistical tests (t tests and chi-square tests) and multiple logistic regression models to determine which factors were associated with health care delays. RESULTS: The top reported barrier to receiving health care was the fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection (126/374, 33.6%). Almost half (1227/2570, 47.7%) of the participants reported experiencing health care delays. Among those who experienced health care delays and further clarified the type of delay they experienced (921/1227, 75.1%), the top three reported types of care that were affected by delays included dental (351/921, 38.1%), preventive (269/921, 29.2%), and diagnostic (151/921, 16.4%) care. The logistic regression models showed that age (P<.001), gender identity (P<.001), education (P=.007), and self-reported worry about general health (P<.001) were significantly associated with experiencing health care delays. Self-reported worry about general health was negatively related to experiencing delays in dental care. However, this predictor was positively associated with delays in diagnostic testing based on the logistic regression model. Additionally, age was positively associated with delays in diagnostic testing. No factors remained significant in the multiple logistic regression for delays in preventive care, and although there was trend between race and delays (people of color experienced fewer delays than White participants), it was not significant (P=.06). CONCLUSIONS: The lessons learned from the initial surge of COVID-19 cases can inform systemic mitigation strategies for potential future disruptions. This study addresses the demand side of health care delays by exploring the determinants of such delays. More research on health care delays during the pandemic is needed, including research on their short- and long-term impacts on patient-level outcomes such as mortality, morbidity, mental health, people's quality of life, and the experience of pain.","output":"Characterizing Health Care Delays and Interruptions in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Internet-Based, Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS To provide: (1) an overview of interventions aimed at improving mental health of student or novice nurses; and (2) an evaluation of their effectiveness on dropout-related outcomes.

This study aimed to evaluate the association between metformin use and clinical outcomes in DM patients with COVID-19. Methods This retrospective study was based on claims data. All diseases, including COVID-19, were defined using International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. Patients were divided into three groups depending on metformin use: CON (those not taking DM medication); N-MFOM (those taking DM medications other than metformin); and MFOM (those taking metformin for DM). Ultimately, 1865 patients were included; CON, N-MFOM and MFOM groups comprised 1301, 95 and 469 patients, respectively. Results KaplanCMeier analyses showed that MFOM patients had poorer survival rates than those in the CON group, but there were no significant differences in survival rates between MFOM and N-MFOM groups. Multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed more favourable survival in CON than in N-MFOM patients, but there was no statistically significant difference in MFOM vs the other groups. Also, there were no significant differences in rates of use of inotropes, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, conventional oxygen therapy, high-flow nasal cannulas or mechanical ventilators, nor in the rates of acute kidney injury or cardiac events across all study groups. Conclusion No definite association could be found between metformin use and clinical outcomes, including survival. However, given the disproportionate participant numbers in our groups and small number of events, further studies are needed to determine whether the use of metformin has favourable or unfavourable effects in DM patients with COVID-19.","output":"Is there an association between metformin use and clinical outcomes in diabetes patients with COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly became the worlds largest threat to health and the economy in recent times. Prediction of the COVID-19 pandemics full impact is a necessary gauge for future policy making, including resource allocation for prevention, mitigation, and control preparedness. Methods: We used the extended form of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected/Infectious-Recovered/Removed (SEIR) model to predict new cases and number of deaths associated to COVID-19. Data from the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran provided relevant parameters for predicting disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). We conducted a review of the literature on COVID-19-like diseases to develop disability weights (DWs) and convened an expert panel to verify their applicability. Beta-PERT distributions were used to calculate DWs for age groups. The minimum and maximum values were 0 and 0.14 for mild to severe disability, respectively. Results: The total DALYs for COVID-19 in Iran predicted by our model will be 973 per 100,000 populations from January, 2020 to January, 2021. Overall, 957 years per 100,000 will be from YLLs (98.4% of DALYs) and 16 will be from YLDs (1.6% of DALY). The total DALYs in men will be 1,082 years per 100,000 and 861 per 100,000 in women. Conclusions: Our predictions of COVID-19 burden will be useful in determining health priorities and to appropriately allocate resources to prepare for future outbreaks of COVID-19 and similar diseases.

The proportion of vape shops found to be noncompliant with the Governor's executive order (i.e., open) during Stage 1 gradually increased from 54 (61.4%) at Assessment 1 (week of April 1, 2020) to 58 (65.9%) at Assessment 3 (week of April 29, 2020). Moreover, vape shops located in Hispanic/Latino and Korean/Asian communities (vs. those in non-Hispanic White and African American communities) were more likely to stay open both during and after the shutdown at Assessments 1 and 6. More specifically, vape shops located in Hispanic/Latino communities were significantly more likely to offer walk-in service during Assessment 1 (during the shutdown), and vape shops in Hispanic/Latino and Korean/Asian were significantly more likely to offer walk-in service during Assessment 6 (after the re-opening).

Studies have revealed the association of the IFNAR2 gene with severe illness in Coronavirus infection and indicated the association of genomic variants, i.e. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, comprehensive analysis of SNPs of the IFNAR2 gene has not been performed in both coding and non-coding region to find the causes of loss of function of IFNAR2 in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we have characterized coding SNPs (nsSNPs) of IFNAR2 gene using different bioinformatics tools and identified deleterious SNPs. We found 9 nsSNPs as pathogenic and disease-causing along with a decrease in protein stability. We employed molecular docking analysis that showed 5 nsSNPs to decrease binding affinity to IFN. Later, MD simulations showed that P136R mutant may destabilize crucial binding with the IFN molecule in response to COVID-19. Thus, P136R is likely to have a high impact on disrupting the structure of the IFNAR2 protein. GTEx portal analysis predicted 14 sQTLs and 5 eQTLs SNPs in lung tissues hampering the post-transcriptional modification (splicing) and altering the expression of the IFNAR2 gene. sQTLs and eQTLs SNPs potentially explain the reduced IFNAR2 production leading to severe diseases.

Some studies even indicate that ML_CDSS may surpass physicians competencies regarding specific isolated tasks. From an ethical perspective, however, the usage of ML_CDSS in medical practice touches on a range of fundamental normative issues. This article aims to add to the ethical discussion by using professionalisation theory as an analytical lens for investigating how medical action at the micro level and the physicianCpatient relationship might be affected by the employment of ML_CDSS. MAIN TEXT: Professionalisation theory, as a distinct sociological framework, provides an elaborated account of what constitutes client-related professional action, such as medical action, at its core and why it is more than pure expertise-based action. Professionalisation theory is introduced by presenting five general structural features of professionalised medical practice: (i) the patient has a concern; (ii) the physician deals with the patients concern; (iii) s/he gives assistance without patronising; (iv) s/he regards the patient in a holistic manner without building up a private relationship; and (v) s/he applies her/his general expertise to the particularities of the individual case. Each of these five key aspects are then analysed regarding the usage of ML_CDSS, thereby integrating the perspectives of professionalisation theory and medical ethics. CONCLUSIONS: Using ML_CDSS in medical practice requires the physician to pay special attention to those facts of the individual case that cannot be comprehensively considered by ML_CDSS, for example, the patients personality, life situation or cultural background. Moreover, the more routinized the use of ML_CDSS becomes in clinical practice, the more that physicians need to focus on the patients concern and strengthen patient autonomy, for instance, by adequately integrating digital decision support in shared decision-making.","output":"The ethics of machine learning-based clinical decision support: an analysis through the lens of professionalisation theory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social media poses a threat to public health by facilitating the spread of misinformation. At the same time, however, social media offers a promising avenue to stem the distribution of false claims - as evidenced by real-time corrections, crowdsourced fact-checking, and algorithmic tagging. Despite the growing attempts to correct misinformation on social media, there is still considerable ambiguity regarding the ability to effectively ameliorate the negative impact of false messages. To address this gap, the current study uses a meta-analysis to evaluate the relative impact of social media interventions designed to correct health-related misinformation (k = 24; N = 6,086). Additionally, the meta-analysis introduces theory-driven moderators that help delineate the effectiveness of social media interventions. The mean effect size of attempts to correct misinformation on social media was positive and significant (d = 0.40, 95% CI [0.25, 0.55], p =.0005) and a publication bias could not be excluded. Interventions were more effective in cases where participants were involved with the health topic, as well as when misinformation was distributed by news organizations (vs. peers) and debunked by experts (vs. non-experts). The findings of this meta-analysis can be used not only to depict the current state of the literature but also to prescribe specific recommendations to better address the proliferation of health misinformation on social media.","output":"Evaluating the Impact of Attempts to Correct Health Misinformation on Social Media: A Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neurotropic and neuroinvasive capabilities of coronaviruses have been described in humans.

RECENT FINDINGS: Mental health problems are frequently encountered in health professionals during emergencies and often prevail over the following years. Results show health professionals exhibited symptoms of depression, anxiety, emotional distress, burnout, post-traumatic stress and poor sleep quality. In response to acute responses to stress, it is crucial to provide psychoeducation, mindfulness and coping resources. These interventions can improve resilience and self-efficacy of professionals, as well as help to prevent anxiety, depression and quality of sleep. The need for intervention programmes targeting the mental health of vulnerable populations has been widely acknowledged. We described a psychological support plan designed and implemented with the aim of providing mental health care for health professionals.

Limited mobility can restrict opportunities to interact with others and therefore may lead to social exclusion. This pilot study was designed to test the feasibility of integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) trajectory data and interview data to understand the different mobility patterns between lower- and higher-income older adults in Hong Kong and the potential reasons for and impacts of these differences. Lower- (n = 21) and higher- (n = 24) income adults aged 60 years of age or older in Hong Kong were recruited based on purposive sampling. They were asked to wear a GPS device for 7 days. Seven measures of mobility (four dimensions) were created based on GPS data and compared between lower- and higher-income older adults, including extensity (standard deviation ellipse, standard distance between all locations), intensity (time spent out of home, doing activities), diversity (number of locations), and non-exclusivity (time spent in public open spaces and places with higher public service provisions). It then administered semi-structured interviews to understand the determined differences. The activity spaces for lower-income older adults were, on average, smaller than those for higher-income older adults, but lower-income older adults spent significantly more time participating in out-of-home activities. They were more likely to be exposed to environments with similar socioeconomic characteristics as their own. The interviews showed that limited social networks and expenditure on transport were the two main factors associated with lower-income older adults having relatively fewer activity spaces, which may lead to further social exclusion. We recommend using GPS in daily life as a feasible way to capture the mobility patterns and using interviews to deeply understand the different patterns between lower- and higher-income older adults. Policy strategies aiming to improve the mobility of older might be helpful for further improving the social inclusion of lower-income older adults.","output":"Mobility Based on GPS Trajectory Data and Interviews: A Pilot Study to Understand the Differences between Lower- and Higher-Income Older Adults in Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For some people with severe physical disabilities, the main assistive device to improve their independence and to enhance overall well-being is an electric-powered wheelchair (EPW).

MethodsWe evaluated data from the National COVID-19 Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a multicenter retrospective cohort of electronic medical record (EMR) data from across the United States, on. 1,446,913 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. HIV, SOT, comorbidity, and HIV markers were identified from EMR data prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 disease severity within 45 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection was classified into 5 categories: asymptomatic/mild disease with outpatient care; mild disease with emergency department (ED) visit; moderate disease requiring hospitalization; severe disease requiring ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); and death. We used multivariable, multinomial logistic regression models to compare odds of COVID-19 outcomes between patients with and without immune dysfunction. FindingsCompared to patients without immune dysfunction, PWH and SOT had a greater likelihood of having ED visits (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-1.29; aOR: 2.61, CI: 2.58-2.65, respectively), requiring ventilation or ECMO (aOR: 1.43, CI: 1.43-1.43; aOR: 4.82, CI: 4.78-4.86, respectively), and death (aOR: 1.20, CI: 1.19-1.20; aOR: 3.38, CI: 3.35-3.41, respectively).

In 2011, there was an ADHD diagnosis prevalence of around 8% among children (4-17 years) in the US. ADHD-affected children are more prone to physical injuries such as physical trauma, accidental poisoning, burns, etc. This study was aimed to evaluate the association of ADHD with severe injuries, the influence of age and gender on this association, and the impact of ADHD medications on the frequency of such injuries. Methodology This study was conducted in three governmental and three private settings in Aseer region. The files of children who were diagnosed with ADHD in the study settings were reviewed for a 12-month time period. Data were extracted from the medical files using a pre-structured data extraction sheet to avoid errors and inter-rater bias. The extracted data included child gender, age, duration of disease, and injury-related data. A brief questionnaire had been applied to mothers regarding mothers' attitudes towards injuries among their children, adherence to medications, as well as the reasons for non-adherence to medications and clinical visits in a non-adherent group during the clinic visit. Results One hundred and sixty-three children with a diagnosis of ADHD completed the study. The affected children were aged between two and 15 years (mean: 7.8  2.9 years). An exact of 116 (71.2%) children were males. An exact of 70 (42.9%) affected children had trauma. The most-reported traumas were superficial injuries (84.3%), burns (48.6%), fractures (37.1%), deep injuries (31.4%), and broken or lost teeth (28.6%). About 52% of the children were adherent to medications and their clinical visits. Among the non-adherent group, the most reported reasons were parents care and attention (20.5%), followed by the COVID-19 pandemic and delay in visits times (16.7%). Regarding mothers' attitudes towards injuries among children with ADHD, 49.1% of the mothers agreed that there is an association between a child with ADHD and being traumatized while 22.7% said there was no relation. Conclusions In our cohort, the majority of the children with ADHD were boys at primary school age. Association of the history of the disease with trauma was not uncommon, and most injuries were not severe, but burns and deep injuries were reported among considered portions.","output":"Patterns of Injuries Among Children Diagnosed With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Aseer Region, Southwestern Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically highlighted the isolation of domestic violence survivors, triggering media coverage and innovative efforts to reach out to those who are trapped in their homes, facing greater danger from their partners than from the virus. But another harmful aspect of this difficult time has received far less attention: survivors' intensified loneliness. Although loneliness can be catalyzed by isolation, it is a distinct psychological phenomenon that is internal and subjective in nature. Loneliness is not only acutely painful in its own right; it also inflicts a range of long lasting, health-related harms, and heightens survivors' vulnerability to violence, creating a vicious cycle that may continue long after strict stay-at-home and physical distancing policies end.

Introduction: By July 1st, 2020, the SARS-CoV2 epidemic had affected more than 200 countries with more than 10 million identified cases and 508,000 deaths. Many older people have been infected, but little data exists for those aged over 75 years, especially for those presenting cognitive and behavioral problems. Objective: To describe the characteristics of the symptoms presented by two populations of hospitalized patients: patients hospitalized in an Alzheimer's protected unit and standard patients hospitalized in a dedicated COVID unit, and to compare the mortality rates. Materials and method: A retrospective study including patients over 65 years old hospitalized in Paul Brousse was conducted from March 13 to April 15, 2020 in an Alzheimer's unit and a COVID unit, with Sars-CoV2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR or serology. Data was derived from medical records concerning the patient's background, long-term treatments, and clinical and laboratory data during the infection. Results: One hundred and seventy-eight patients (87 years [82 ; 91], 67% women) were included, including 60 Alzheimer patients (86 years [81 ; 88,25], 68% women) and 118 \\"standard\\" patients (88 years [83,25 ; 92], 66% female). The \\"standard\\" group was older and had a higher Charlson comorbidity index. The mortality rate was not significantly different between the 2 groups (p = 0,09). Clinically, the \\"standard\\" group had a more serious infection than the \\"Alzheimer's\\" group: the qSOFA score and the maximum oxygen flow required were higher.

No studies have examined this relationship with people with non-affective psychosis. The present study sought to redress this gap in the literature. Sixty-four participants with non-affective psychosis and suicidal experiences who were receiving a suicide-focused cognitive therapy were recruited. Self-reported suicidal ideation, suicide plans, suicide attempts, depression, and hopelessness were collected from participants prior to starting therapy. Suicidal experience measures were collected again post-therapy at 6 months. Therapeutic alliance ratings were completed by clients and therapists at session 4 of therapy. Dose of therapy was documented in number of minutes of therapy. Data were analyzed using correlation coefficients, independent samples t-tests, a multiple hierarchical regression, and a moderated linear regression. There was no significant relationship found between suicidal ideation prior to therapy and the therapeutic alliance at session 4, rated by both client and therapist. However, there was a significant negative relationship between the client-rated therapeutic alliance at session 4 and suicidal ideation at 6 months, after controlling for pre-therapy suicidal ideation, depression, and hopelessness. Furthermore, the negative relationship between the client-rated alliance and suicidal ideation was the strongest when number of minutes of therapy was 15 h or below. A stronger therapeutic alliance developed in the first few sessions of therapy is important in ameliorating suicidal thoughts in people with psychosis. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily the case that more hours in therapy equates to a cumulative decrease in suicidal ideation of which therapists could be mindful. A limitation of the current study was that the alliance was analyzed only at session 4 of therapy, which future studies could seek to redress.","output":"The Relationship between the Therapeutic Alliance and Suicidal Experiences in People with Psychosis Receiving Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article investigates the complex relationship between endogenous and exogenous, deterministic and stochastic stimulating factors in public opinion dynamics.

The model property analysis and numerical experiments show that the proposed asynchronous multiagent network model can assimilate and explain some interesting phenomena that are observed in the real world. Further case studies with numerical simulation and real-world applications confirm the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed model in public opinion analysis. The results challenge the common perception that mass media or opinion facilitators play the fundamental role in controlling the development trends of public opinion.

In regular times, almost a thousand children crossed the checkpoint every day from Palomas in Mexico to Deming in the United States to attend school. During the COVID-19 pandemic, accessibility to education has been almost completely denied for students living in Mexico. This paper unpacks the findings from a critical case study focused on the school leadership of the community and marks the beginning of a larger action-research initiative aimed at forging alliances with and among community stakeholders, researchers, and community leaders to bring transformative change. Findings suggest that these borderland cities do not view themselves as divided by a physical or ideological Frontera or Barrera. Rather, they see themselves as a unified community whose members live on both sides of the border. The Palomas-Deming borderland community shares one mission of creating the necessary conditions to provide educational equity for all students in the region with U.S. passports regardless of a student?s country of residence.

However, due to the reliability of the UAV system and the complex and changeable operation scene and population distribution in the urban environment, a few ground-impact accidents have occurred and generated enormous risks to ground personnel. In order to reduce the risk of UAV ground-impact accidents in the urban logistical scene, failure causal factors, and failure modes were classified and summarized in the process of UAV operation based on the accumulated operation data of more than 20,000 flight hours. The risk assessment model based on the Bayesian network was built. According to the established network and the probability of failure causal factors, the probabilities of ground impact accidents and intermediate events under different working conditions were calculated, respectively. The posterior probability was carried out based on the network topology to deduce the main failure inducement of the accidents. Mitigation measures were established to achieve the equivalent safety level of manned aviation, aiming at the main causes of accidents.

To test the ability of STX to cross the placental barrier, pregnant mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of STXs (7.5 g/kg body weight) on gestational day fifteen. Immunocytochemistry was performed to detect proliferating and differentiating progenitors, including oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). It was found that specific proliferation of OPCs was significantly increased, but there was no corresponding increase in the number of differentiated oligodendrocytes, which may indicate a negative effect on the maturation process of these cells. Additionally, the data showed that STXs crossed the placental barrier.

Although the importance of social contacts and social activities to fulfill social needs and avoid loneliness is known, these were challenged during the pandemic. This qualitative study specifically focused on how residents, close relatives, and volunteers in nursing homes experienced the restrictive measures in retrospect and gained insights into the impact of the restrictive measures on social needs and loneliness, and the lessons that could be learned. Thirty semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with residents and close relatives, and one online focus group with ten volunteers, were conducted. Recruitment took place at psychogeriatric and somatic units in the Northern, Eastern and Southern regions of the Netherlands and Flanders, Belgium. The interviews and focus group were transcribed verbatim, and an open, inductive approach was used for analysis. Alternative ways of social contact could not fully compensate for physical visits. Generally, participants reported that it was a difficult time, indicated by feelings of loneliness, fear, sadness, and powerlessness. A great diversity in loneliness was reported. The most important reasons for feeling lonely were missing close social contacts and social activities. The diversity in the impact of restrictive measures depended on, e.g., social needs, coping strategies, and character. Restrictive COVID-19 measures in nursing homes resulted in negative emotions and unmet social needs of residents, close relatives, and volunteers. During future outbreaks of the COVID-19 virus or another virus or bacterium, for which restrictive measures may be needed, nursing homes should actively involve residents, close relatives, and volunteers to balance safety, self-determination, and well-being.","output":"Precious Time Together Was Taken Away: Impact of COVID-19 Restrictive Measures on Social Needs and Loneliness from the Perspective of Residents of Nursing Homes, Close Relatives, and Volunteers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Adenomyosis (AM) is a common benign chronic gynaecological disorder; however, the precise pathogenesis of adenomyosis is still poorly understood. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can uncover rare subpopulations, explore genetic and functional heterogeneity, and reveal the uniqueness of each cell. It provides us a new approach to reveal biological issues from a more detailed and microscopic perspective. Here, we utilize this revolutionary technology to identify the changes of gene expression patterns between ectopic lesions and the eutopic endometrium at the single-cell level and explore a potential novel pathogenesis of AM. METHODS: A control endometrium (sample with leiomyoma excluding endometrial disorders, n = 1), eutopic endometrium and ectopic lesion (from a patient with adenomyosis, n = 1) samples were analysed by scRNA-seq, and additional leiomyoma (n = 3) and adenomyosis (n = 3) samples were used to confirm colocalization and vasculogenic mimicry (VM) formation. Protein colocalization was visualized by immunofluorescence, and CD34-periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) double staining was used to assess the formation of VM. RESULTS: The scRNA-seq results suggest that cancer-, cell motility- and inflammation- (CMI) associated terms, cell proliferation and angiogenesis play important roles in the progression of AM. Moreover, the colocalization of EPCAM and PECAM1 increased significantly in the ectopic endometrium group (P < 0.05), cell subpopulation with high copy number variation (CNV) levels possessing tumour-like features existed in the ectopic lesion sample, and VNN1- and EPCAM-positive cell subcluster displayed active cell motility in endometrial epithelial cells. Furthermore, during the transformation of epithelial cells to endothelial cells, we observed the significant accumulation of VM formation (positively stained with PAS but not CD34, P < 0.05) in ectopic lesions. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, our results support the theory of adenomyosis derived from the invasion and migration of the endometrium. Moreover, cell subcluster with high CNV level and tumour-associated characteristics is identified. Furthermore, epithelial-endothelial transition (EET) and the formation of VM in tumours, the latter of which facilitates the blood supply and plays an important role in maintaining cell growth, were also confirmed to occur in AM. These results indicated that the inhibition of EET and VM formation may be a potential strategy for AM management.

METHODS: This prospective study included elderly patients with CAP, severe CAP (sCAP) and healthy elderly subjects between April 2016 and March 2018. Flow cytometry was used to detect CD3, CD20, HLA-DR, CD24, CD27, CD38, IgM, and IgD. CD20(+) B cells were further divided into na?ve B cells (Bn), IgM/D(+) memory B cells (IgM(+) Bm), switched B cells (SwB), and transitional B cells (Btr). RESULTS: A total of 22 healthy controls, 87 patients with CAP and 58 patients with sCAP were included in the study. Compared to CAP, sCAP was characterized by significantly lower absolute number of B cells, Bn and Btr, significantly lower Btr and Bn subset percentage, while percentage of IgM(+) Bm was significantly higher. Heat map showed Bn and Btr on day 3 and day 7 was negatively correlated with activated partial prothrombin time (APTT), international normalized ratio (INR), sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II).

In addition to their structural and biophysical properties of cellular membranes, some sphingolipid (SL) species are bioactive and as such, take part in cellular signaling processes involved in regulating viral replication. It is especially due to the progress made in tools to study accumulation and dynamics of SLs, which visualize their compartmentalization and identify interaction partners at a cellular level, as well as the availability of genetic knockout systems, that the role of particular SL species in the viral replication process can be analyzed and, most importantly, be explored as targets for therapeutic intervention.","output":"Sphingolipids: Effectors and Achilles Heals in Viral Infections?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM) constitutes one of the most common causes to non-ischemic heart failure.

Outside of the medical field there has been a conscious drive to reduce single use plastic and reuse items to reduce the amount of waste we produce. We undertook this investigation to quantify our plastic waste production and generate ideas to reduce this volume. METHODOLOGY: Data was collected from a University Hospital ENT outpatient department via real-time recording methods using standard data collection forms. We measured plastic unit usage pre and post COVID restrictions and compared this to our number of patient encounters. Projections of plastic usage were determined via a hypothetical resumption of patient services model. RESULTS: In total there were 440 patients included. In period one the mean units of plastic used per day was 65.1 (median 67; range 27C84). In the second period, the mean number of plastic units was 23.4 (median 22; range 1C7). Blue nitrile gloves and masks were the most commonly used single use items. The hypothetical projection model predicted a 147.6% increase in single use items following the introduction of COVID precautions. CONCLUSION: We have a duty of care not only to our patients but future generations of patients and the environment which we share. Single use items and excessive plastic wrapping have benefits in terms of convenience and sterility, but these conveniences can be easily extended to reusable types to limit our volume of waste, reduce our waste management costs and protect our environment.","output":"The environmental impact of personal protective equipment in a pre and post COVID era in the ENT clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aberrant expression of the zinc finger protein (ZIC) family has been extensively reported to contribute to progression and metastasis in multiple human cancers. However, the functional roles and underlying mechanisms of ZIC2 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are largely unknown. In this study, ZIC2 expression was evaluated using qRT-PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Animal experiments in vivo and functional assays in vitro were performed to investigate the role of ZIC2 in NSCLC. Luciferase assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were carried out to explore the underlying target involved in the roles of ZIC2 in NSCLC. Here, we reported that ZIC2 was upregulated in NSCLC tissues, and high expression of ZIC2 predicted worse overall and progression-free survival of NSCLC patients. Silencing ZIC2 repressed tumorigenesis and reduced the anoikis resistance of NSCLC cells. Mechanical investigation further revealed that silencing ZIC2 transcriptionally inhibited Src expression and inactivated steroid receptor coactivator/focal adhesion kinase signaling, which further attenuated the anoikis resistance of NSCLC cells. Importantly, our results showed that the number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) was positively correlated with ZIC2 expression in NSCLC patients. Collectively, our findings unravel a novel mechanism implicating ZIC2 in NSCLC, which will facilitate the development of anti-tumor strategies in NSCLC.","output":"Silencing ZIC2 abrogates tumorigenesis and anoikis resistance of non-small cell lung cancer cells by inhibiting Src/FAK signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Community health workers (CHWs) are effective in improving public health, and many states are developing policy to support the workforce.

The Committee followed national best practices in CHW engagement. A CHW and an academic team identified CHWs and employers statewide, administered a survey in partnership with a CHW professional association, and conducted in-depth interviews with CHWs and employers.

Twenty-one CHWs and 15 employers completed interviews. Survey data indicated that Louisiana CHW roles and activities are consistent with national research. Interviews revealed a lack of knowledge about CHWs among key stakeholders, CHW workforce challenges including lack of community and professional resources, and differing ideas about the value of common workforce development practices such as standardized training and credentialing. Findings suggest a need for widespread education about CHWs and support for CHW participation in professional associations to address common workforce challenges.

Infections occur mainly in humans and dogs. In dogs, both dog-adapted and zoonotic S. stercoralis genotypes seem to occur. Clinical manifestations mainly include gastrointestinal and respiratory signs. The severity of the disease can vary greatly and depends on the immune status of the host. The infection is potentially fatal in immunosuppressed individuals, either medically induced or due to an underlying disease, in which hyperinfections and disseminated infections with extraintestinal parasite dissemination may occur. METHODS: Diagnosis was based on coproscopy, including flotation and the Baermann funnel technique, histology of small intestinal biopsies and molecular analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and hypervariable regions I and IV (HVR I and HVR IV) of the nuclear 18S rDNA loci. RESULTS: Two independent cases of severe canine S. stercoralis infection in Austria are presented. In both cases, S. stercoralis was detected in histological sections of the small intestine and with the Baermann funnel technique. Molecular analysis revealed strains with zoonotic potential. Case 1 was a 1-year-old female French bulldog with a long history of respiratory and gastrointestinal signs, severe emaciation and apathy before S. stercoralis infection was diagnosed. Treatment with moxidectin (2.5 mg/kg body weight [BW], oral route) did not eliminate the infection, but treatment with ivermectin (0.2 mg/kg BW, subcutaneously) was successful. Case 2 consisted of two 2-month-old Pomeranian puppies, one female and one male, from a litter of four, which died soon after presenting dyspnoea and haemorrhagic diarrhoea (female) or torticollis (male); S. stercoralis infection was first diagnosed post-mortem. CONCLUSION: More attention should be paid to this nematode because although it appears to be rare in Austria, it is easily overlooked on standard coproscopy unless a Baermann funnel technique is used, and even then, it can be missed. Moxidectin is not always successful in eliminating the infection, and treatment with ivermectin should be considered in cases of infection.

It is categorized as a biosafety level (BSL) 4 agent. Currently, there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs or vaccines specifically for LUJV or other pathogenic OW mammarenaviruses. Here, a high-throughput screening of an FDA-approved drug library was conducted using pseudotype viruses bearing LUJV envelope glycoprotein (GPC) to identify inhibitors of LUJV entry. Three hit compounds, trametinib, manidipine, and lercanidipine, were identified as LUJV entry inhibitors in the micromolar range. Mechanistic studies revealed that trametinib inhibited LUJV GPC-mediated membrane fusion by targeting C410 [located in the transmembrane (TM) domain], while manidipine and lercanidipine inhibited LUJV entry by acting as calcium channel blockers. Meanwhile, all three hits extended their antiviral spectra to the entry of other pathogenic mammarenaviruses. Furthermore, all three could inhibit the authentic prototype mammarenavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and could prevent infection at the micromolar level. This study shows that trametinib, manidipine, and lercanidipine are candidates for LUJV therapy and highlights the critical role of calcium in LUJV infection.

The usefulness and potential of using routine health facility data for monitoring progress towards UHC, in the form of the 16-tracer WHO service coverage index (SCI), was assessed. METHODS: Alternative approaches to calculating the WHO SCI from routine data, allowing for disaggregation to district level, were explored. Data extraction, coding, transformation and modelling processes were applied to generate time series for these alternatives. Equity was assessed using socio-economic quintiles by district. RESULTS: The UHC SCI at a national level was 46.1 in 2007C2008 and 56.9 in 2016C2017. Only for the latter period, could the index be calculated for all indicators at a district level. Alternative indicators were formulated for 9 of 16 tracers in the index. Routine or repeated survey data could be used for 14 tracers. Apart from the NCD indicators, a gradient of poorer performance in the most deprived districts was evident in 2016C2017. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to construct the UHC SCI for South Africa from predominantly routine data sources. Overall, there is evidence from district level data of a trend towards reduced inequity in relation to specific categories (notably RMNCH). Progress towards UHC has the potential to overcome fragmentation and enable harmonisation and interoperability of information systems.

Infection of alveolar macrophages was partially dependent upon their expression of ACE2 and the infections were productive for amplifying virus, both findings which were in contrast with their neutralization of another pandemic virus, Influenza A virus (IAV). Compared to IAV, SARS-CoV-2 was extremely poor at inducing interferon-stimulated genes in infected myeloid cells, providing a window of opportunity for modest titers to amplify within these cells. Endotracheal aspirate samples from humans with COVID-19 confirmed the lung slice findings, revealing a persistent myeloid depot.

Amongst 58.6 million patients aged 18C90 years, patients prescribed a calcium channel blocker (CCB) were compared with those taking a diuretic, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), or -blocker. Cohorts were propensity score-matched for age, sex, race, and blood pressure. Over a 2-year exposure period, we measured the incidence and risk ratio of a first diagnosis (ICD-10 codes), or a recurrence, of psychotic, affective, and anxiety disorders, as well as substance use disorders and sleep disorders. Cohort sizes ranged from 33,734 to 322,814. CCBs were associated with a lower incidence of psychotic, affective, and anxiety disorders than -blockers (risk ratios 0.69C0.99) and a higher incidence than ARBs (risk ratios 1.04C2.23) for both first and recurrent diagnoses. Comparisons of CCBs with ACEIs or diuretics showed smaller risk ratios that varied between disorders, and between first episode and recurrence. AHT classes were also associated with the incidence of substance use and sleep disorders. Results remained largely unchanged after more extensive cohort matching for additional potential confounders. In a secondary analysis, a comparison between ARBs and ACEIs showed lower rates of psychotic, affective, and substance use disorders with ARBs, but higher risks of anxiety and sleep disorders.

Little is known about the pH1N1 molecular dynamics in general population. A prospective study (CoPanFlu-RUN) was carried out in Reunion Island to characterize pH1N1 genetic variability and molecular evolution occurring in population during the pH1N1 Influenza pandemic in 2009. METHODOLOGY We directly amplified pH1N1 genomes from 28 different nasal swabs (26 individuals from 21 households). Fifteen strains were fully sequenced and 13 partially. This includes pairs of sequences from different members of 5 separate households; and two pairs from individuals, collected at different times. We assessed the molecular evolution of pH1N1 by genetic variability and phylogenetic analyses. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We found that i) Reunion pH1N1 sequences stemmed from global \\"clade 7\\" but shaped two phylogenetic sub-clades; ii) D239E mutation was identified in the hemagglutinin protein of all Reunion sequences, a mutation which has been associated elsewhere with mild-, upper-respiratory tract pH1N1 infecting strains; iii) Date estimates from molecular phylogenies predicted clade emergence some time before the first detection of pH1N1 by the epidemiological surveillance system; iv) Phylogenetic relatedness was observed between Reunion pH1N1 viruses and those from other countries in South-western Indian Ocean area; v) Quasispecies populations were observed within households and individuals of the cohort-study.

The aim of this study was to identify awareness, attitudes, and practices related to influenza A (H1N1) among the Saudi public. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 1,548 adult subjects recruited from various shopping malls in Riyadh and Jeddah was conducted. All of the subjects were interviewed using a questionnaire that tested their knowledge, attitudes, and use of precautionary measures in relation to the H1N1 influenza pandemic. RESULTS: More than half (54.3%, 840/1548) of the participants showed high concern, 43.7%(677/1548) showed a low level of knowledge, and 60.8%(941/1548) had taken minimal or no precautionary measures. After adjusting for other variables, education level was the only significant predictor of the level of concern (p < 0.001), while greater precautionary measures were taken by participants who were male (p < 0.001), older (p = 0.047), better educated (p = 0.04), and more knowledgeable (p < 0.001).

The collection of individual tooth images that comprises the image database are used as input into the CNN migration learning model for training. Seventy percent (70%) of the image database is used for training and validating the model while the remaining 30% is used for testing and estimating the accuracy of the model.

The DDSM++ model is an extended version of DDSM model (inspired from Densenet-121), and the X-ray images are preprocessed with Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to improve the quality of X-ray images. The COVID X-ray images are obtained from the open source and the proposed method has obtained almost 98.47% accuracy for COVID detection. Further, the model is quantized to FP-16 using TFLITE and is utilized to benchmark the inference acceleration on Edge devices with ARM Mali GPU. About 30% and 80% reduction in inference time was observed for FP-32 and FP-16 models when run on ARM Mali GPU. Post quantization, about 5% drop in accuracy is observed for COVID detection. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Diagnostic Decision Support for Medical Imaging and COVID-19 Image Classification on ARM Mali GPU"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper deals mainly with the existence and asymptotic behavior of traveling waves in a SIRH model with spatio-temporal delay and nonlocal dispersal based on Schauders fixed-point theorem and analysis techniques, which generalize the results of nonlocal SIRH models without relapse and delay.

Materials and Methods This prospective cohort study was conducted on pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19. Study population was divided into two groups: 1) Mild COVID-19 group (n = 811) and 2) Moderate/severe COVID-19 group (n = 52). Demographic features, clinical characteristics, obstetric complications, and serum electrolytes were compared between the groups. Afterward, a correlation analysis was performed to investigate the association between serum electrolyte disturbances with COVID-19 severity and obstetric complications. Results Highest serum sodium, hypernatremia, potassium replacement, hypopotassemia, hyperchloremia, initial serum magnesium, hypermagnesemia, and hypocalcemia were significantly higher in the moderate/severe COVID-19 group. The lowest serum sodium, lowest serum potassium, and initial serum calcium were significantly higher in the mild COVID-19 group (p < 0.05). Statistically significant positive weak correlations were found between hypernatremia, hypopotassemia, hyperchloremia, hypermagnesemia, hypocalcemia and COVID-19 severity (r values were 0.27, 0.20, 0.12, 0.18 and 0.12, p values were < 0.001, < 0.001, 0.02, 0.03 and 0.03, respectively).

This study aimed to identify the degree of satisfaction in patients who benefit from medical recuperation services in one private clinic from Romania and the factors that played a part in this respect. Method: An online questionnaire was completed by 105 patients of a private clinic in the period immediately following the opening of the clinic after the quarantine period due to COVID-19. The following concepts were measured: general satisfaction with clinical recuperation services (SG), physicians behavior (PB), the impact of interventions on the state of health (IHI), modern equipment (ME), and the intention to return to the clinic (IRC). Based on a linear regression model, the impact of PB, IHI, ME, and IRC variables on general satisfaction (SG) was established. Results: The study results confirm the data from studies carried out in different sociocultural contexts in ordinary time, where physician behavior is the most crucial factor in patients satisfaction. Therefore, we can say that the physiotherapists behavior has an essential role in determining the patients satisfaction both in ordinary time and in COVID-19 time. The data in this study reflect the fact that satisfaction with the services offered by a medical recuperation clinic is a predictor for using the services in the future.

DATA SOURCES: We searched grey literature including websites of national research and ethics regulatory bodies and health departments of selected countries. STUDY SELECTION: National guidance documents were included from six countries: Ireland, England, Australia, New Zealand, the United States of America and Canada. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted from 19 documents using an a priori framework developed from the published literature. RESULTS: We organised data under five themes: ethical frameworks; guidance on ethical review; consent, vulnerable groups and personal health data. Quality improvement activity tended to be outside the scope of the ethics frameworks in most countries. Only New Zealand had integrated national ethics standards for both research and quality improvement. Across countries, there is consensus that this activity should not be automatically exempted from ethical review, but requires proportionate review or organisational oversight for minimal risk projects. In the majority of countries, there is a lack of guidance on participant consent, use of personal health information and inclusion of vulnerable groups in routine quality improvement. CONCLUSION: Where countries fail to provide specific ethics frameworks for quality improvement, guidance is dispersed across several organisations which may lack legal certainty.

Design/methodology/approach: The research literature on coronavirus published globally and indexed in the Web of Science core collection was retrieved using the term Coronavirus and its related and synonymous terms (e.g. COVID-19, SARS-COV, SARS-COV-2 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) as per the Medical List of Subject Headings. A total of 5,625 publications were retrieved;however, the study was restricted to articles only (i.e. 4,471), and other document types were excluded. Quantitative and visualization techniques were used for data analysis and interpretation. VOSViewer software was employed to map collaborative networks of authors, institutions and countries. Findings: A total of 4,471 articles have been published on coronavirus by 99 countries of the world with the maximum contribution from the USA, followed by the People's Republic of China. The United States, China, Canada, Netherlands and Germany are the front runners in the collaborative network and form strong sub-networks with other countries as well. More than 1,000 institutions collaborate in the field of coronavirus research among 99 contributing countries. The authorship pattern shows that 97.5% of publications are contributed by authors in collaboration in which 77.5% of publications are contributed by four or more than four authors. The range between degree of collaboration (DC) varies from 0.89 in 1993 to 1 in 2000 with an average of 0.96 from 1989 to 2020. The results confirm that the coronavirus research is carried out in teamwork at the individual, institutional and global levels with high magnitude and density of collaboration. The relative growth of the literature has shown inconsistency as a decreasing trend has been observed from 2007 onwards, thereby increasing the doubling time from 4.2 in the first ten years to 17.3 in the last ten years.

METHODS: This study was conducted in Maldivian nations above 18 of age with COVID-19 who were admitted in isolation facilities. Patients who were on treatment for any other chronic medical conditions, severe and critical COVID-19 disease were excluded. This study was conducted over a period of 2 months by administering a local translated version of DASS21 questionnaire. RESULTS: The total of 195 patients were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 40 (CI at 95% 38C42) years. The respondents were 48.7% men and 51.3% women. Overall, 9% of patients with COVID-19 had depression while 23% of patients had anxiety and 12% of the patients had stress.

The standard of care entails regular monitoring by dilated ophthalmoscopy examinations, which entail stress and potential morbidity. In this pilot study, we used plane-wave ultrasound (PWUS) to image, measure, and assess the association of blood-flow velocities in the retrobulbar vessels with ROP stages ranging from stage 0 (immature vessels without ROP) to stage 3. METHODS: Both eyes of 14 preterm neonates at risk for ROP were examined by 18 MHz PWUS. All but two subjects had a follow-up examination. PWUS was acquired for 1.5 seconds at 3000 compound B-scans/sec. Data were postprocessed to form color-flow images and spectrograms depicting flow velocity in the central retinal artery (CRA), central retinal vein (CRV), and the short posterior ciliary arteries (SPCA). Flow parameters derived from spectrograms were compared by ROP stage. RESULTS: ROP stage was found to correlate with flow velocities. Velocities were significantly elevated with respect to non-ROP eyes in all vessels at stage 3 and in the SPCAs at stage 2. CONCLUSIONS: PWUS measurement of blood flow may provide a quantitative, clinically important, and easily tolerated means for detecting and assessing the risk of ROP in preterm neonates. We speculate that the observed increase in flow velocity results from elevated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in ROP eyes.

The workforce of peer recovery specialists (PRSs), individuals with lived substance use and recovery experience, has rapidly expanded in response to a shortage of access to substance use treatment, particularly for those from underserved communities. As PRSs are likely serving individuals disproportionately affected by the pandemic, it is important to understand how COVID-19 has affected the PRS role and the individuals with SUD who they are supporting. METHOD: This study aimed to examine: (1) the impact of COVID-19 on the PRS role and experience, (2) the impact of COVID-19 on clients in or seeking SUD treatment, (3) facilitators for clients engaging in treatment and adapting to new changes, and (4) sustainability of new treatment methods post-pandemic. RESULTS: Findings suggest that PRSs have had to adapt their role and responsibilities to meet changing client needs; however, PRS strengths, such as their shared experience and expertise navigating treatment barriers, make them uniquely suited to assist clients during the pandemic. The study identified various barriers and facilitators to clients seeking treatment or living with SUD, such as the loss of interpersonal connection. PRSs also identified some drawbacks to utilizing telehealth, but identified this as a potentially sustainable approach to delivering care after the pandemic.

Another proposed high latitude SNR is the 20 x 26 degree Antlia nebula (G275.5+18.4) discovered in 2002 through low-resolution all-sky H$\\\\alpha$ and ROSAT soft X-ray emissions. GALEX UV and H$\\\\alpha$ mosaics along with optical spectra indicate the presence of shocks throughout the Antlia nebula with estimated shock velocities of 70 to over 100 km s$^{-1}$. We also present evidence that it has collided with the northeast rim of the Gum Nebula.

METHOD Synopsis of the articles selected for the IMIA Yearbook 2006. RESULTS Current research in the field of bioinformatics clearly shows ongoing unification of experimental findings and clinical outcomes. Microarray data, gene sequences and clinical data are more and more perceived as different but related facets of one entity. Significant work is done in the area of text and data mining in order to bring together patient data and biochemical phenomena by means of ontologies. A strong trend in the clinical field is performance of exhaustive studies on DNA material derived from patients that suffer from diseases that are already known to be inherited. Examination of appropriate methods covers data and text mining, ontologies as well as machine learning and classification. CONCLUSIONS The best paper selection of articles on bioinformatics shows examples of excellent research on methods used for studying inherited diseases and their underlying genetic dispositions. Clinical studies, inclusion of experimental findings like microarray data, and of knowledge representation formats all lead to a better understanding the linkage between gene sequences, biological functions and clinical findings in the form of healthy state or physiological disorders.","output":"Bioinformatics and its impact on clinical research methods.

Our review aimed to evaluate the efficacy of QE for alleviating fatigue. Methods: A related literature search was performed in the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, China Biology Medicine disc (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, and VIP data bases from inception to November 2020. Information on fatigue, malaise, tiredness, and Qigong research data was collected. Results: Sixteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were reported in patients with cancer (n = 4), chronic fatigue syndrome (n = 2), and other diseases (n = 10). The QE groups showed significant improvements in total fatigue intensity [15 RCTs, p < 0.00001; standard mean difference (SMD) ?0.69 (?0.95 to ?0.44)]. The QE groups did not show significant improvement in quality of life [4 RCTs, p = 0.08; SMD 0.53 (?0.07 to 1.14)]. The statistically significant difference of the subgroup analyses (different primary diseases, QE types, and study quality) also remained unchanged. Conclusion: The findings of this meta-analysis indicate that QE may be beneficial for improving fatigue in patients diagnosed with various diseases. Considering the limitations of the study, we draw a very cautious conclusion regarding the resulting estimate of the effect.

METHODS Retrospective analysis of clinical data and survival follow-up was undertaken on 41 patients with advanced P-ADC from January 1, 2009, to April 30, 2019. Analysis on tumor biomarkers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and the cytokeratin-19-fragment (Cyfra21-1) were undertaken. The patients in this study were divided into three groups based on usage of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI): TKI therapy group (including combination with chemotherapy), non-TKI therapy group (chemotherapy alone), and palliative care group. RESULTS More than half of the patients had higher levels of tumor biomarkers and the incidence of NSE was highest (81.8%), followed by CEA (74.4%) and Cyfra21-1 (74.1%). All patients had abnormal findings on chest computed tomography and with adenocarcinoma pathology. The overall survival (OS) time was 10.4 months in TKI group, 8.8 months in the non-TKI group, and 2.1 months in the palliative care group. Patients with higher level of serum Cyfra21-1 had insignificantly shorter survival time compared to those with normal Cyfra21-1 (p = 0.067). TKI therapy and non-TKI therapy provided a better prognosis prediction compared to palliative care. TKI therapy improved prognosis compared to non-TKI therapy. The comprehensive based TKI therapy provided improved OS vs the non-TKI therapy. CONCLUSION TKI-based therapy could improve the prognosis and OS for advanced P-ADC.

The current infection trends of a disease in some targeted locations are efficiently captured by the ESN when it is fed with the infection data for other locations. The performance of the ESN is first tested with synthetic data generated by numerical simulations of independent uncoupled patches, each governed by the classical susceptible-infected-recovery model for a choice of distributed infection parameters. From a large pool of synthetic data, the ESN predicts the current trend of infection in patches by exploiting the uncorrelated infection trend of patches. The prediction remains consistent for most of the patches for approximately 4 to 5 weeks. The machine's performance is further tested with real data on the current COVID-19 pandemic collected for different countries. We show that our proposed scheme is able to predict the trend of the disease for up to 3 weeks for some targeted locations.

SARS-CoV-2 began like all new viruses with an ordinary moment when a cluster of patients admitted to a hospital with pneumonia turned out to have a new strain of coronavirus. The virus's high transmissibility made the epidemic in China turn into a global pandemic with an ongoing daily reporting of new cases and deaths. However, as fast as viruses spread, the detection of pandemics and taking early measures has become much easier due to the advancement of science in today's world. The early responses and measures adopted by China, such as early reporting and situation monitoring, large-scale surveillance, and preparation of medical facilities and supplies, were all successful in reducing the epidemic in China generally and in the epicenter Wuhan specifically. The purpose of this review is to focus on the effectiveness of the measures taken by the Chinese government to stop COVID-19 spreading by comparing the country's response to SARS and CO-VID-19 outbreaks, which will provide an example for the communities, health managers, and leaders of countries to follow on how to prepare, detect, and respond to potential outbreaks. Method: For this article, epidemic preparedness and management strategies under comparison were derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) frameworks and guidelines.

METHODS To explore interconnections among variables such as social media use, empathic skills for in-person conversation and strategies for coping with Covid-19 anxiety, Australian 18- to 26-year-olds took several novel in-depth questionnaire measures that were purpose-built for the present research. RESULTS Main findings were threefold: (i) Individuals who most frequently and wholeheartedly enjoyed live in-person conversations with friends suffered the most Covid-19 anxiety, worry and stress during periods of pandemic restriction. (ii) Empathic conversational skills were highest among those who conversed in-person (by phone or face-to-face) most often and were lowest for those who rarely did so and/or had little skill with in-person conversation. (iii) Those who gained the greatest relief from anxiety (e.g. about Covid-19) through solitary use of screen-based social media and games had the fewest empathic conversational skills.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with 13 older adults and one informal carer. Topics covered included participants overall experiences of CTM, changes to their overall activity and participation, aspects of CTM that they found valuable and issues that were challenging. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed thematically to capture barriers and facilitators to the approach delivery. RESULTS: Four themes were developed: i) I have good days and bad days, ii) safety and security is the name of the game, iii) were a team as it stands, iv) its [COVID-19] depressing for everybody at the moment. Older adults identified benefits of CTM engagement including improvements in physical and psychological wellbeing. However, subjective frailty and self-reported multimorbidity influenced overall engagement. Participants expressed concerns around the logistics of delivering CTM and competing care staff interests. The broader role of care staff in supporting CTM was highlighted, as well as the emotional support that staff provided to older adults.

To this end, 1,297 French university students were assessed during lockdown, which lasted from 16 March to 11 May in France. Situational factors included the belief that lockdown was compromising their future job prospects, COVID-19 symptoms, and health concerns. Psychological factors included students' implicit theory of emotion, and the coping strategies they used during lockdown.

However, whether all or specific psychiatric disorders are intrinsic risk factors of death in COVID-19, or whether these associations reflect the greater prevalence of medical risk factors in people with psychiatric disorders, has yet to be evaluated. Methods We performed an observational multicenter retrospective cohort study to examine the association between psychiatric disorders and mortality among patients hospitalized for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at 36 Greater Paris University hospitals. Results Of 15,168 adult patients, 857 (5.7%) had an ICD-10 diagnosis of psychiatric disorder. Over a mean follow-up of 14.6 days (SD=17.9), death occurred in 326/857 (38.0%) patients with a diagnosis of psychiatric disorder versus 1,276/14,311 (8.9%) in patients without such a diagnosis (OR=6.27;95%CI=5.40-7.28;p<0.01).

Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) diagnosis does not represent a predisposing factor to viral infections and most of CTCL patients have indolent disease. However, physicians should be cautious with patients with aggressive primary cutaneous lymphomas and advanced CTCL. Different treatment strategies for cutaneous lymphomas should be taken into consideration during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus; it is highly needed to estimate the benefit-to-risk ratio on a case-by-case basis. This article is protected by copyright.

In the stages prior to the development of arthritis, nonspecific musculoskeletal (MSK) manifestations may occur. The aim of the study is to describe the frequency of rheumatic regional pain syndromes (RRPS) in FDR of RA patients. A cross-sectional study was carried out from July 2016 to September 2018. Parents, offspring, and siblings of RA patients completed the Community Oriented Program in the Rheumatic Diseases (COPCORD) questionnaire. Rheumatoid factor (RF) IgG, IgM, and IgA; anticitrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs); C-reactive protein (CRP); and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were determined. All subjects with a positive COPCORD (defined by the presence of musculoskeletal pain) were evaluated and classified. Three hundred thirty-five FDRs participated, 75.8% were female, mean age of 44.15 years; 138 (41.2%) were diagnosed with at least one RRPS; 72 (21.5%) had rotator cuff tendinitis, 51 (15.2%) pes anserine bursitis, and 39 (11.6) lateral epicondylitis; RA was diagnosed in 24 (7.16%) subjects, undifferentiated arthritis (UA) in 30 (8.9%) and inflammatory arthralgia (AI) in 104 (31%). We found anti-CCP positivity in 6.8%, RF IgA in 22.3%, RF IgM in 48.6%, and RF IgG in 8.9%. The presence of RRPS was higher in this RA-FDR group compared to general population.

Methods: Six electronic databases including CINALH Complete, Cochrane Library, PubMed, MEDLINE via OvidSP, British Nursing Index and PsycINFO were searched from 2010 to 2020. Randomised control trials that met the inclusion criteria were critically appraised by two independent reviewers using Revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials (RoB2). Meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.3 for at least two studies reporting the same outcome parameter. Narrative synthesis was performed if there was a considerable heterogeneity (I2) with a significant p-value. Results: Nine trials with 1016 participants with coronary heart diseases in phase II cardiac rehabilitation (mean age between 54.99.6 and 62.6811.95 years old, predominantly male (81.7%) were included. Technologyassisted CR interventions showed comparable effectiveness with traditional centre-based CR on modifiable coronary risk factors (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol, all pooled results p>0.05), exercise capacity (peak VO2: SMD 0.13, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.35, p=0.28), psychological outcomes (anxiety: SMD 0.25, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.61, p=0.17 and depression: SMD 0.09, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.35, p=0.47). Narrative synthesis was conducted for adherence to CR. Inconsistent results were found among studies. The technology assisted CR interventions with web apps and wearable technology for self-monitoring were found to improve CR adherence when compared to traditional centre-based CR. Adverse events were self-reported, mostly were unrelated to technology-assisted CR interventions and the number of events was comparable between both groups. Conclusion: The technology-assisted interventions, incorporating smartphone and web apps, wearable physiological sensing devices, realtime video conferencing and secure messaging in home-based or hybrid CR, have demonstrated comparable effectiveness on patient outcomes as comparing with the traditional centre-based CR programs. Thus, it has opened up an array of opportunities for patient-professional coaching and monitoring while bridging geographical distances and physical contacts, especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

To date, there are no solidified criteria for long-COVID diagnosis. Nevertheless, long-COVID is conceptualized as a multi-organ disorder with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that may be indicative of underlying pulmonary, cardiovascular, endocrine, hematologic, renal, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, immunological, psychiatric, or neurological disease. Involvement of the central or peripheral nervous system is noted in more than one-third of patients with antecedent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, while an approximately threefold higher incidence of neurological symptoms is recorded in observational studies including patient-reported data. The most frequent neurological manifestations of long-COVID encompass fatigue;brain fog;headache;cognitive impairment;sleep, mood, smell, or taste disorders;myalgias;sensorimotor deficits;and dysautonomia. Although very limited evidence exists to date on the pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in the manifestation of long-COVID, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress processes are thought to prevail in propagating neurological long-COVID sequelae. In this narrative review, we sought to present a comprehensive overview of our current understanding of clinical features, risk factors, and pathophysiological processes of neurological long-COVID sequelae. Moreover, we propose diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms that may aid in the prompt recognition and management of underlying causes of neurological symptoms that persist beyond the resolution of acute COVID-19. Furthermore, as causal treatments for long-COVID are currently unavailable, we propose therapeutic approaches for symptom-oriented management of neurological long-COVID symptoms.

Thus, in many studies, seeding or deposition in experimental chambers is performed to quantify initial concentrations for subsequent resuspension experiments. The current study was carried out to assess metal particle seeding efficiency on four types of urban surfaces (slate, facade coating, tile, and glass) in a test chamber. To achieve this objective, we compared firstly different solubilization techniques of silver polydisperse particles (1.3-3.2 m and 0.5-1.0 m) and gold polydisperse particles (5 m) for chemical quantification by ICP-MS. The result showed better yields in the case of gold for all solubilization techniques studied (82%  5% to 98%  2% for gold versus 23%  18% to 84%  12% for silver). Based on this result, four seeding tests were carried out with the gold particles (distribution in chamber centered on 1m). The concentrations seeded on urban surfaces (mean  SD) varied from 10,900  1,900 g.m-2 (facade coating sample) to 1900  390 g.m-2 (glass sample). The relative standard deviation of the measured concentrations equaled 9.5% (tested for aluminum foils), which was less than the measurement uncertainty of the recording equipment (14%) and reflected good seeding homogeneity.

Adenovirus-derived vectors are also commonly chosen for gene therapy in human clinical trials. We have shown in previous work that homologous recombination between adenoviral genomes of human adenovirus species D (HAdV-D), the largest and fastest growing HAdV species, is responsible for the rapid evolution of this species. Because adenovirus infection initiates in mucosal epithelia, particularly at the gastrointestinal, respiratory, genitourinary, and ocular surfaces, we sought to determine a possible role for mucosal microbiota in adenovirus genome diversity. By analysis of known recombination hot spots across 38 human adenovirus genomes in species D (HAdV-D), we identified nucleotide sequence motifs similar to bacterial Chi sequences, which facilitate homologous recombination in the presence of bacterial Rec enzymes. These motifs, referred to here as Chi(AD), were identified immediately 5 to the sequence encoding penton base hypervariable loop 2, which expresses the arginine-glycine-aspartate moiety critical to adenoviral cellular entry. Coinfection with two HAdV-Ds in the presence of an Escherichia coli lysate increased recombination; this was blocked in a RecA mutant strain, E. coli DH5, or upon RecA depletion. Recombination increased in the presence of E. coli lysate despite a general reduction in viral replication. RecA colocalized with viral DNA in HAdV-D-infected cell nuclei and was shown to bind specifically to Chi(AD) sequences. These results indicate that adenoviruses may repurpose bacterial recombination machinery, a sharing of evolutionary mechanisms across a diverse microbiota, and unique example of viral commensalism. IMPORTANCE Adenoviruses are common human mucosal pathogens of the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts and ocular surface. Here, we report finding Chi-like sequences in adenovirus recombination hot spots. Adenovirus coinfection in the presence of bacterial RecA protein facilitated homologous recombination between viruses. Genetic recombination led to evolution of an important external feature on the adenoviral capsid, namely, the penton base protein hypervariable loop 2, which contains the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid motif critical to viral internalization. We speculate that free Rec proteins present in gastrointestinal secretions upon bacterial cell death facilitate the evolution of human adenoviruses through homologous recombination, an example of viral commensalism and the complexity of virus-host interactions, including regional microbiota.","output":"Bacterial RecA Protein Promotes Adenoviral Recombination during In Vitro Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Debriefing after perioperative crises (eg, cardiac arrest, massive hemorrhage) is a well-described practice that can provide benefits to individuals, teams, and health systems.

Patients requiring ECMO therapy (n = 14) during ICU stay versus patients without ECMO treatment (n = 81) were evaluated for discriminative clinical prediction parameters and AI-based CT imaging features and their diagnostic potential to predict ECMO therapy. Reported patient data include clinical scores, AI-based CT findings and patient outcomes; (3) Results: Patients subsequently allocated to ECMO therapy had significantly higher sequential organ failure (SOFA) scores (p < 0.001) and significantly lower oxygenation indices on admission (p = 0.009) than patients with standard ICU therapy. The median time from hospital admission to ECMO placement was 1.4 days (IQR 0.2C4.0). The percentage of lung involvement on AI-based CT assessment on admission to the hospital was significantly higher in ECMO patients (p < 0.001). In binary logistic regression analyses for ECMO prediction including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), SOFA score on admission, lactate on admission and percentage of lung involvement on admission CTs, only SOFA score (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.08C1.62) and lung involvement (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01C1.11) were significantly associated with subsequent ECMO allocation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 (95% CI 0.73C0.94) for lung involvement on admission CT and 0.82 (95% CI 0.72C0.91) for SOFA scores on ICU admission.

However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic necessitated the use of multiple drastic measures to stop the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, limiting womens access to essential invasive and non-invasive investigations for cervical cancer diagnosis. Therefore, we aimed to determine the impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on cancer diagnosis and management in western Romania. A retrospective study design allowed us to compare the last 24 months of the pre-pandemic period with the first 24 months of the COVID-19 pandemic to determine the change in volume of cervical screening tests, the number of newly diagnosed cases and their severity, and the access to cancer care. A drastic 75.5% decrease in the volume of tests was observed in April 2020 during the first lockdown, after which the volume of cases decreased by up to 36.1% in December 2021. The total volume loss of tests during the first 24 months of the pandemic was 49.9%. The percentage of late-stage cervical cancers (IIICIV) rose by 17%, while the number of newly diagnosed cancers in our outpatient clinic was significantly lower than the baseline, with a 45% drop. The access to cancer care was negatively influenced, with 9.2% more patients waiting longer to receive test results over four weeks, while taking longer to seek cancer care after diagnosis (6.4 months vs. 4.1 months pre-pandemic) and missing significantly more appointments.

Radiotherapy also provides palliation in metastatic disease, and acts as a bridge to resection and transplantation in selected patients. Advancements in radiotherapy modalities offer improved dose planning and targeted delivery, allowing for better tumor response and safer dose escalations while minimizing the risks of radiation-induced liver damage. Radiotherapy modalities are broadly classified into external beam radiation therapy and selective internal radiation therapy. With emerging modalities, radiotherapy plays a complementary role in the multidisciplinary care of HCC patients.

We also found that PM(2.5) mass concentration is susceptible to regional transmission from the surrounding cities. PM(2.5) and other gaseous pollutants show different correlations in different periods, while NO(2) and O(3) always show a strong negative correlation. The principal components before the Spring Festival in 2019 were O(3) and NO(2), and after the Spring Festival, they were PM(2.5) and CO, while the principal components before the lockdown in 2020 were PM(2.5) and CO, and during lockdown they were O(3) and NO(2).

The incidence of new cases of COVID-19 has reduced dramatically since a peak in mid-March. Social distancing measures, public health action and the reduction in international travel have likely been effective in slowing the spread of the disease, in the Australian community. Testing rates over the past week have increased markedly, with a continued very low proportion of people testing positive. These low rates of detection are indicative of low levels of COVID-19 transmission. It is important that testing rates and community adherence to public health measures remain high to support the continued suppression of the virus, particularly in vulnerable high-risk groups and settings. New cases of COVID-19 are currently being reported by by only some jurisdictions, albeit at relatively low rates. Although case numbers are low, new cases tend to still be a mix of overseas-acquired and locally-acquired infections. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a known case or cluster. Although the proportion of locally-acquired cases has increased, the overall rate of new cases, regardless of place of acquisition, continues to decrease. The crude case fatality rate in Australia remains low (1.4%), compared with the WHO reported global rate (6.9%). The low case fatality rate is likely reflective of high case detection and high quality of health care services in Australia. Deaths from COVID-19 in Australia have occurred predominantly among the elderly and those with comorbidities, with no deaths occurring in those under 40 years. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 60-79 years. One third of all cases in this age group have been associated with several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in young children, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, while the number of new cases each day remains relatively stable at the global level, some areas such as Brazil and India are showing a dramatic rise in reported cases. Although some low-income countries have so far reported few cases, it is possible that this is due to limited diagnostic and public health capacity, and may not be reflective of true disease incidence.","output":"COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 16 (Reporting week to 23:59 AEST 17 May 2020)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Characterizing acute service demand is critical for neurosurgery and other emergency-dominant specialties in order to dynamically distribute resources and ensure timely access to treatment. This is especially important in the post-Covid 19 pandemic period, when healthcare centers are grappling with a record backlog of pending surgical procedures and rising acute referral numbers. Healthcare dashboards are well-placed to analyze this data, making key information about service and clinical outcomes available to staff in an easy-to-understand format. However, they typically provide insights based on inference rather than prediction, limiting their operational utility. We retrospectively analyzed and prospectively forecasted acute neurosurgical referrals, based on 10,033 referrals made to a large volume tertiary neurosciences center in London, U.K., from the start of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown period until October 2021 through the use of a novel AI-enabled predictive dashboard. As anticipated, weekly referral volumes significantly increased during this period, largely owing to an increase in spinal referrals (p < 0.05). Applying validated time-series forecasting methods, we found that referrals were projected to increase beyond this time-point, with Prophet demonstrating the best test and computational performance.

Therefore, understanding the subcellular localization and interactions of a specific protein is crucial to uncover its biological function. The advent of proximity labeling (PL) has reshaped cellular proteomics in infection biology. PL utilizes a genetically modified enzyme that generates a \\"labeling cloud\\" by covalently labeling proteins in close proximity to the enzyme. Fusion of a PL enzyme to a specific antibody or a \\"bait\\" protein of interest in combination with affinity enrichment mass spectrometry (AE-MS) enables the isolation and identification of the cellular proximity proteome, or proxisome. This powerful methodology has been paramount for the mapping of membrane or membraneless organelles as well as for the understanding of hard-to-purify protein complexes, such as those of transmembrane proteins. Unsurprisingly, more and more infection biology research groups have recognized the potential of PL for the identification of host-pathogen interactions. In this chapter, we introduce the enzymes commonly used for PL labeling as well as recent promising advancements and summarize the major achievements in organelle mapping and nucleic acid PL. Moreover, we comprehensively describe the research on host-pathogen interactions using PL, giving special attention to studies in the field of virology.","output":"Proximity labeling approaches to study protein complexes during virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the early spring of 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak obliged us to slow down the pace of life in many ways, altering our well-laid plans.

(Prolonged) exposure to optimal lipid quantity and quality, i.e., the supramolecular structure of lipids, in mammalian milk, may contribute to these beneficial effects through nutritional early-life programming. In this pre-clinical study, we exposed male C57BL/6J mice from post-natal Days 16 to 42 (i.e., directly following normal lactation), to a diet with large lipid droplets coated with bovine milk fat globule membrane-derived phospholipids, which mimic more closely the supramolecular structure of lipid droplets in mammalian milk. We investigated whether exposure to this diet could affect growth and brain development-related parameters. As these outcomes are also known to be affected by the post-weaning social environment in mice, we included both individually housed and pair-wise housed animals and studied whether effects of diet were modulated by the social environment. After Day 42, all the animals were fed standard semi-synthetic rodent diet. Growth and body composition were assessed, and the mice were subjected to various behavioral tests. Individual housing attenuated adolescent growth, reduced femur length, and increased body fat mass. Adult social interest was increased due to individual housing, while cognitive and behavioral alterations as a result of different housing conditions were modest. The diet increased adolescent growth and femur length, increased lean body mass, reduced adolescent anxiety, and improved adult cognitive performance. These effects of diet exposure were comparable between individually and socially housed mice. Hence, early life exposure to a diet with lipid droplets that mimic the supramolecular structure of those in mammalian milk may improve adolescent growth and alters brain function in both socially and individually housed mice. These findings suggest that lipid structure in infant milk formula may be a relevant target for nutritional solutions, targeting both healthy infants and infants facing growth challenges.","output":"Early Life Exposure to a Diet With a Supramolecular Lipid Structure Close to That of Mammalian Milk Improves Early Life Growth, Skeletal Development, and Later Life Neurocognitive Function in Individually and Socially Housed Male C57BL/6J Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the development of the COVID-19 epidemic, there is an urgent need to establish a system for determining the effectiveness and neutralizing activity of vaccine candidates in biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) facilities.

Different levels of neutralizing antibodies were detected in convalescent serum samples of COVID-19 patients using ppSARS-2. The recombinant, soluble, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protein was found to inhibit the entry of ppSARS-2 in Huh7.5 cells effectively. Furthermore, the neutralization results for ppSARS-2 were consistent with those of live SARS-CoV-2 and determined using the serum samples from convalescent patients.

The Harm Reduction and BRidges to Care (HRBR) Clinic is an on demand, low barrier addiction clinic that opened in October 2019. In the first three months of operation (November through January , 2020), HRBR saw steadily increasing numbers of patients. Oregon saw its first case of novel coronavirus in February, and declared a state of emergency and enacted a formal Stay at Home order in March. That same month, the DEA announced that patients could be initiated on buprenorphine through telemedicine visits without an in-person exam. Within a week of being granted the ability to see patients virtually, HRBR had transitioned to over 90% virtual visits, while still allowing patients without technology to access in-person care. Within four weeks, the clinic expanded hours significantly, established workflows with community harm reduction partners, and was caring for patients in rural areas of the state. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the HRBR clinic was able to quickly transition from in-person to almost completely virtual visits within a week. This rapid pivot to telemedicine significantly increased access to care for individuals seeking low-threshold treatment in multiple contexts. Overarching institutional support, grant funding and a small flexible team were critical. HRBR's increased access and capacity were only possible with the Drug Enforcement Agency loosening restrictions around the use of telehealth for new patients. Keeping these altered regulations in place will be key to improving health and health care equity for people who use drugs, even after the pandemic subsides.

METHODS Two chitosan-based radiopaque hydrogels were prepared, one with STS and one without STS. Their rheological, injectability, and embolizing properties were assessed in vitro; afterwards, their efficacy in occluding endoleaks was compared in a canine bilateral aneurysm model reproducing type I endoleaks (n = 9 each). The primary endpoint was endoleak persistence at 3 or 6 months, assessed on a CT scan and macroscopic examination. Secondary endpoints were the occurrence of stent-graft (SG) thrombosis, the evolution of the aneurysm mean diameter, as well as aneurysm healing and inflammation scores in pathology examinations. RESULTS In vitro experiments showed that both products gelled rapidly and presented initial storage moduli greater than 800 Pa, which increased with time. Both gels were compatible with microcatheter injection and occlude flow up to physiological pressure in vitro. In a type I endoleak model, the injection of CH-STS sclerosing gel tended to reduce the risk of occurrence of endoleaks, compared to CH non-sclerosing agent (2/9 vs. 6/9, p = 0.069). No case of SG thrombosis was observed. Moderate inflammation was found around both gels, with a comparable intensity score in both CH and CH-STS groups (2.6  0.9 and 2.7  0.9, respectively; p = 0.789).

Hence, this study aimed to provide concrete evidence towards malaria prevention practices and associated factors among Households of Hawassa City Administration, Southern Ethiopia, 2020. METHOD: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among a randomly selected 598 households at Hawassa City Administration from April 1-15, 2020. Multistage sampling technique was employed to recruit the study households. Data were collected by trained data collectors through a face-to-face interview with pretested structured questionnaire, which was adapted from previous peer reviewed articles. Then the data were checked for the completeness and consistencies, then, coded and entered into Epi data 3.1 and it was exported to SPSS IBM version 23 for analysis. Descriptive mean with standard deviation was used to summarize the continuous variables. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression model was used to assess factors affecting prevention and control of Malaria. Finally, adjusted odds ratio together with 95% CI and p-value <0.05 was used to declare the statistical significances. RESULTS: The overall 317 (54.3%) of households practiced good measure of malaria prevention and control measures.

Despite the availability of retinal services, people may not access them because of the lack of knowledge about DR and poor referral systems. Published studies on referral pathways in Nepal are scarce. Improving DR awareness among general physicians has the potential to address these challenges. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a health education intervention on health personnel, establish a referral pathway, and assess the impact of the intervention on the attendance of patients with diabetes mellitus for retinal screening at Reiyukai Eiko Masunaga Eye Hospital in Nepal. METHODS: This is a nonrandomized, pre- and postintervention study. Health education on DR will be provided to selected health personnel of the intervention hospital (Scheer Memorial) using information education and communication (IEC) materials in the form of PowerPoint presentations, posters, pamphlets, videos, and pre- and postevaluation questionnaires along with referral slip. Pre- and postevaluation will be undertaken during the study period. Data will be analyzed using MS Excel and Epi Info 7.

How the transmission of detrimental mtDNA mutations is restricted through the maternal lineage is debated. Here, we demonstrate that mitochondrial fission, together with the lack of mtDNA replication, segregate mtDNA into individual organelles in the Drosophila early germarium. After mtDNA segregation, mtDNA transcription begins, which activates respiration. Mitochondria harboring wild-type genomes have functional electron transport chains and propagate more vigorously than mitochondria containing deleterious mutations in hetreoplasmic cells. Therefore, mtDNA expression acts as a stress test for the integrity of mitochondrial genomes and sets the stage for replication competition. Our observations support selective inheritance at the organelle level through a series of developmentally orchestrated mitochondrial processes. We also show that the Balbiani body has a minor role in mtDNA selective inheritance by supplying healthy mitochondria to the pole plasm.

However, it has been seldom used for in-service training and continuing medical education. We aimed to develop a PBL curriculum for a short in-service training on breastfeeding for maternal and child health professionals, and to assess the effect of these courses on their knowledge and skills. Also, the project aimed at increasing exclusive breastfeeding rates and duration in an Italian region. METHODS: After initial training on PBL and an assessment of the learning needs of about 400 health professionals, a small working group developed learning objectives, designed a curriculum, produced manuals, and shaped assessment tools for a new PBL course on breastfeeding. The field test of the new course allowed selection of the tutors for the scaling up of the training to the whole region. During this extension phase, participants were asked to complete an evaluation questionnaire. In addition, the health professionals who attended the PBL courses in 2019 were asked to complete an online survey to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) just before, soon after the course, and 4C6 months later. RESULTS: The new 29 ? hour PBL course, to be delivered in four days over four consecutive weeks, gives priority to tutorial groups and practical activities (71% of the total time). Supervised clinical practices absorb 16% of time. Ethics, communication and woman-centred clinical management content run throughout the four days and all activities. The three manuals, for tutors, participants and practical activities, facilitate the tasks and performance of tutors and participants. After the field test, 32 regional tutors ran courses for 562 health professionals. The analysis of the evaluation showed a high level of satisfaction for perceived effectiveness, relevance to practice, and educational quality. The KAP questionnaires indicated a general improvement after the course and retention after 4C6 months.

However, racial and ethnic digital divides, which are disparities among people who have internet access and post on social media, can bias inferences. This bias is particularly problematic in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic because due to structural inequalities, members of racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately vulnerable to contracting the virus and to the deleterious economic and social effects from mitigation efforts. Further, important demographic intersections with race and ethnicity, such as gender and age, are rarely investigated in work characterizing social media users; however, they reflect additional axes of inequality shaping differential exposure to COVID-19 and its effects. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to characterize how the race and ethnicity of US adults are associated with their odds of posting COVID-19 content on social media and how gender and age modify these odds. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center from March 19 to 24, 2020, using a national probability sample (N=10,510). Respondents were recruited from an online panel, where panelists without an internet-enabled device were given one to keep at no cost. The binary dependent variable was responses to an item asking whether respondents used social media to share or post information about the coronavirus. We used survey-weighted logistic regressions to estimate the odds of responding in the affirmative based on the race and ethnicity of respondents (white, black, Latino, other race/ethnicity), adjusted for covariates measuring sociodemographic background and COVID-19 experiences. We examined how gender (female, male) and age (18 to 30 years, 31 to 50 years, 51 to 64 years, and 65 years and older) intersected with race and ethnicity by estimating interactions. RESULTS: Respondents who identified as black (odds ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.02-1.64; P=.03), Latino (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.36-2.04; P<.001), or other races/ethnicities (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.02-1.72; P=.03) had higher odds than respondents who identified as white of reporting that they posted COVID-19 content on social media. Women had higher odds of posting than men regardless of race and ethnicity (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.39-1.80; P<.001). Among men, respondents who identified as black, Latino, or members of other races/ethnicities were significantly more likely to post than respondents who identified as white.

METHODS All SARS survivors from the hospitals of a local region in Hong Kong were assessed by a constellation of psychometric questionnaires and a semistructured clinical interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) to determine the presence of psychiatric disorders and chronic fatigue problems. RESULTS Of 369 SARS survivors, 233 (63.1%) participated in the study (mean period of time after SARS, 41.3 months). Over 40% of the respondents had active psychiatric illnesses, 40.3% reported a chronic fatigue problem, and 27.1% met the modified 1994 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. Logistic regression analysis suggested that being a health care worker at the time of SARS infection (odds ratio [OR], 3.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12- 9.39; P = .03), being unemployed at follow-up (OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 1.50-14.78; P = .008), having a perception of social stigmatization (OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.20-7.60; P = .02), and having applied to the SARS survivors' fund (OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.18-7.22; P = .02) were associated with an increased risk of psychiatric morbidities at follow-up, whereas application to the SARS survivors' fund (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.07-6.51; P = .04) was associated with increased risk of chronic fatigue problems.

We produced CSF-derived monoclonal antibodies from a COVID-19 patient, and find that these mAbs target both anti-viral and anti-neural antigens-including one mAb that reacted to both spike protein and neural tissue. Overall, CSF IgG from 5/7 patients contains anti-neural reactivity.

Highly conserved VP1 proteins from closely related polyomaviruses recognize different oligosaccharides. To determine whether amino acid changes restricted to the oligosaccharide binding site are sufficient to determine receptor specificity and how changes in receptor usage affect tropism, we studied the primate polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40), which uses the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor that mediates cell binding and entry. Here, we used two sequential genetic screens to isolate and characterize viable SV40 mutants with mutations in the VP1 GM1 binding site. Two of these mutants were completely resistant to GM1 neutralization, were no longer stimulated by incorporation of GM1 into cell membranes, and were unable to bind to GM1 on the cell surface. In addition, these mutant viruses displayed an infection defect in monkey cells with high levels of cell surface GM1. Interestingly, one mutant infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more efficiently than wild-type virus, apparently by utilizing a different ganglioside receptor. Our results indicate that a small number of mutations in the GM1 binding site are sufficient to alter ganglioside usage and change tropism, and they suggest that VP1 divergence is driven primarily by a requirement to accommodate specific receptors. In addition, our results suggest that GM1 binding is required for vacuole formation in permissive monkey CV-1 cells. Further study of these mutants will provide new insight into polyomavirus entry, pathogenesis, and evolution.","output":"Mutations in the GM1 binding site of simian virus 40 VP1 alter receptor usage and cell tropism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rural connectivity is widely research topic for several years.

While subunit vaccines are one of the prominent options for combating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the immunogenicity of spike protein-based antigens remains unknown. When immunized in mice, the S1 domain induced much higher IgG and IgA antibody levels than the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and more efficiently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 when adjuvanted with alum. It is inferred that a large proportion of these neutralization epitopes are located in the S1 domain but outside the RBD and that some of these are spatial epitopes. This finding indicates that expression systems with posttranslational modification abilities are important to maintain the natural configurations of recombinant spike protein antigens and are critical for effective COVID-19 vaccines. Further, adjuvants prone to a Th1 response should be considered for S1-based subunit COVID-19 vaccines to reduce the potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 S1 is superior to the RBD as a COVID-19 subunit vaccine antigen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to Michel Foucault, French philosophy can be divided into two categories, one, the philosophy of consciousness, the other that of the concept.

In France, as this, there is a long tradition of epistemology whose project is to retrace the history of science by continuing the development of concepts that animate it and by analyzing their evolution. This tradition has long been interested in philosophy of medicine and biology. Its most important representative in this domain is Georges Canguilhem whose influence has spread widely.

The reading of Canguilhem that we will propose here, focusing on some key concepts of his book, highlights in this author three fundamental points: the impossibility of objectivable pathology, the central role of individuality and the preeminence of normativism. We are aware of limits of this reading, which cannot fundamentally explore all of Canguilhem's thought or the tradition of French vitalism.

Several endoscopic approaches are available, such as transaxillary, unilateral axillo-breast approach (UABA), modified anterior chest wall approach (MACWA), bilateral axillo-breast approach, and most recently the transoral approach and the robotic-assisted techniques. There is no recommended approach, because each approach has its own positive and negative attributes. We, herein, compare between UABA and MACWA in terms of surgical and cosmetic outcomes. METHODS This prospective study was conducted from April 2016 to August 2017. Forty patients with unilateral benign thyroid lesions were selected. Of them, 20 patients underwent ET using UABA, and 20 patients underwent ET using MACWA. Gas insufflation was implemented for all patients. Clinicopathologic data, surgical outcomes, and cosmetic outcomes in both groups were analyzed. RESULTS There was no significant difference between both groups in the clinicopathologic characteristics. The mean surgical time was significantly longer in the UABA group compared with the chest wall group (147.3 vs. 124.3 min). The postoperative pain scores were relatively lower in the UABA group compared with the MACWA group. We reported a higher rate of persistent paresthesia, neck contracture with swallowing discomfort, and hypertrophic scars in the MACWA group. Cosmetic satisfaction scores for patients who underwent UABA were higher than for those who underwent MACWA. CONCLUSIONS Both approaches were similar in terms of safety, feasibility, and operative complications. Even though the surgical time was longer, patients who underwent the UABA reported relatively less postoperative pain, superior cosmetic results, scar perception, and patient satisfaction compared with MACWA.","output":"Endoscopic Thyroidectomy Using the Unilateral Axillo-breast Approach Versus the Modified Anterior Chest Wall Approach: A Prospective Comparative Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Persons who use opioids may be at elevated risk of harm from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, yet few data currently exist that can be used to examine this risk.

Thirty-seven percent of participants reported both their use and motivation to quit stayed the same; 16.6% reported decreased use and increased motivation to quit. Participants who reported that their opioid use increased after learning about COVID-19, or whose motivation to quit opioids decreased, were more likely to also be engaged in treatment than those whose use or motivation stayed the same.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Validated database was used to procure global and Indian data related to coronavirus and related outcomes. Multiple regression and linear regression analyses were used interchangeably. Since the week 6 death count data was not correlated significantly with any of the chosen inputs, an auto-regression technique was employed to improve the predictive ability of the regression model.

COVID-19 infections are disproportionately affecting minority communities across the United States. Presentation and outcomes vary, with the elderly and those with underlying diseases having poorer outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective chart review of patients tested for COVID-19 infection from March 2020-May 2020 at the Zablocki VA Medical Center, Milwaukee, WI evaluated demographics, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, and duration of symptoms. The primary outcomes analyzed were whether there were significant differences in demographic data, comorbidities, and presentation between patients testing positive or not positive for COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 173 patients tested for COVID-19 were included during the study period, 82 positive and 91 otherwise. Univariate analysis of patient demographics and presenting symptoms are summarized in Table 1. A multivariable logistic regression using stepwise selection (AUC=0.7188) determined patients that tested positive for COVID-19, when controlling for demographics and comorbidities, were more likely to be African-American than White (OR 3.455, CI 1.733C6.887), and more likely to have a diagnosis of diabetes (OR 2.698, CI 1.36C5.353). However, race and diabetes were not informative when symptoms were included in a subsequent model (AUC=0.8458); patients testing positive for COVID-19 were more likely to present with diarrhea (OR 6.926, CI 1.760C6.926) and a higher temperature (OR 2.651, CI 1.533C4.584), but less likely to present with vomiting (OR 0.007, CI < .001-0.161) when compared to patients testing otherwise for COVID-19.

Variables such as, municipalities of residence, age, gender, signs and symptoms, comorbidities were included and associated with COVID-19 cases and outcomes. The spatial distribution was performed using the ArcGIS program. A total of 100,819 cases were evaluated. Overall, patients had the mean age of 42.3 years, were female (51.2%) and with lethality reaching 4.79% of cases. Main symptoms included fever (66.5%), cough (61.9%) and sore throat (39.8%).

METHODS: Severely distressed communities were classified by DCI>75 for univariate analyses. Adjusted rate ratios were calculated for cases and fatalities per 100,000 persons using hierarchical linear mixed models. RESULTS: This cohort included 1,089,999 cases and 62,298 deaths in 3127 counties for a case fatality rate of 5.7%. Severely distressed counties had significantly fewer deaths from COVID-19 but higher number of deaths per 100,000 persons. In risk-adjusted analysis, the two socio-economic determinants of health with the strongest association with both higher cases per 100,000 persons and higher fatalities per 100,000 persons were the percentage of adults without a high school degree (cases: RR 1.10; fatalities: RR 1.08) and proportion of black residents (cases and fatalities: Relative risk(RR) 1.03). The percentage of the population aged older than 65 years was also highly predictive for fatalities per 100,000 persons (RR 1.07).

We analysed data using mixed-effects repeated measures models in the intention-to-treat population, adjusted for stratification variables, sex, and years of experience. The primary outcome was teacher well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale). Secondary outcomes were teacher depression, absence, and presenteeism, and student well-being, mental health difficulties, attendance, and attainment. Follow-up was at months 12 (T1) and 24 (T2). We collected process data to test the logic model underpinning the intervention, to aid interpretation of the findings. A total of 1,722 teachers were included in the primary analysis. Teacher well-being did not differ between groups at T2 (intervention mean well-being score 47.5, control group mean well-being score 48.4, adjusted mean difference ?0.90, 95% CI C2.07 to 0.27, p = 0.130). The only effect on secondary outcomes was higher teacher-reported absence among the intervention group at T2 (intervention group median number of days absent 0, control group median number of days absent 0, ratio of geometric means 1.04, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.09, p = 0.042). Process measures indicated little change in perceived mental health support, quality of relationships, and work-related stress. The average cost of the intervention was 9,103 per school. The studys main limitations were a lack of blinding of research participants and the self-report nature of the outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed no improvements to teacher or student mental health following the intervention, possibly due to a lack of impact on key drivers of poor mental health within the school environment. Future research should focus on structural and cultural changes to the school environment, which may be more effective at improving teacher and student mental health and well-being.

In this study, surface\\\\enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) coupled with gold SERS\\\\active substrates was used to detect and discriminate 7 food\\\\ and waterborne viruses, including norovirus, adenovirus, parvovirus, rotavirus, coronavirus, paramyxovirus, and herpersvirus. Virus samples were purified and dialyzed in phosphate buffered saline (8 to 9 log PFU/mL) and then further diluted in deionized water for SERS measurement. After capturing the characteristic SERS spectral patterns, multivariate statistical analyses, including soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) and principal component analysis (PCA), were employed to analyze SERS spectral data for characterization and identification of viruses. The results show that SIMCA was able to differentiate viruses with and without envelope with >95% of classification accuracy, while PCA presented clear spectral data segregations between different virus strains. The virus detection limit by SERS using gold substrates reached a titer of 10(2). Practical Application: SERS is a simple, rapid, and accurate method for detection of food\\\\ and waterborne viruses. Our results demonstrate that coupled with gold substrates, SERS was able to rapidly detect and discriminate among different food\\\\ and waterborne viruses, indicating that SERS can provide rapid, sensitive, and reproducible detection results with minimum sample preparation for virus detection.","output":"Detecting Food\\\\ and Waterborne Viruses by Surface\\\\Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Mobile-health applications are revolutionising the way healthcare is being delivered. However, current research focusses on apps aimed at monitoring of conditions rather than the prevention of disease. Healthcare apps that prevent disease can be classified as lifestyle apps (LAs) and encompass mindfulness, exercise, and diet apps. In order for widespread implementation of these apps, perspectives of the user must be taken into consideration. Therefore, this systematic literature review identifies the barriers and facilitators to the use of LAs from a users perspective. Objective: To both identify the facilitators to the use of LAs from a user perspective as well as identify the barriers to the use of LAs from a user perspective. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Qualitative articles focussed on a healthy non-diseased population were obtained. Two independent researchers coded the articles, and themes were identified. Results: Our results found that there were five barriers and five facilitators to app use. The facilitators included (1) motivational aspects to the user, (2) effective marketing and communication, (3) user-centred design and content, (4) humanising technology, and (5) accessibility. The five barriers identified were (1) a non-conducive, (2) poor marketing and branding, (3) controlling and invasive, (4) disengaging content, and (5) inaccessibility. Conclusions: By overcoming the barriers of LAs and encouraging the facilitators found, users are more likely to engage with this method of health promotion.

METHODS: An online questionnaire was developed by two board-certified radiologists, reviewed by the EUSOBI board and committees, and finally distributed among EUSOBI active and associated (not based in Europe) radiologist members. The questionnaire included 20 questions pertaining to technical preferences (acquisition time, magnet strength, breast coils, number of b values), clinical indications, imaging evaluation, and reporting. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, the Chi-square test of independence, and Fishers exact test. RESULTS: Of 1411 EUSOBI radiologist members, 275/1411 (19.5%) responded. Most (222/275, 81%) reported using DWI as part of their routine protocol. Common indications for DWI include lesion characterization (using an ADC threshold of 1.2C1.3  10(?3) mm(2)/s) and prediction of response to chemotherapy. Members most commonly acquire two separate b values (114/217, 53%), with b value = 800 s/mm(2) being the preferred value for appraisal among those acquiring more than two b values (71/171, 42%). Most did not use synthetic b values (169/217, 78%). While most mention hindered diffusion in the MRI report (161/213, 76%), only 142/217 (57%) report ADC values. CONCLUSION: The utilization of DWI in clinical practice among EUSOBI radiologists who responded to the survey is generally in line with international recommendations, with the main application being the differentiation of benign and malignant enhancing lesions, treatment response assessment, and prediction of response to chemotherapy. Report integration of qualitative and quantitative DWI data is not uniform. KEY POINTS: ?

The study was aimed at measuring the prevalence and distribution of work-related musculoskeletal disorders and determining the risk factors associated with affliction among Pakistani dentists. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted using a validated questionnaire consisting of four sections. The first section had questions related to sociodemographic information, the second section had questions that assessed the intensity and frequency of musculoskeletal pain (MSP), third section questions were concerned with the effect of MSP on the respondents' daily life, while the last section contained questions on whether they perceived their work in the dental clinic as a cause of their pain. Chi-square and one-way ANOVA tests were used for the analysis of the data in SPSS-23. RESULTS: A total of 600 completely filled questionnaires were received with a response rate of 76.4%, and about 87% of the dental practitioners had some sort of MSD. The intensity and frequency of WMSDs were statistically significant (p < 0.05) in association with all the sociodemographic characteristics. The lower back area was the most reported site of WMSD pain (51.3%) followed by the neck/upper back (21.3%) and shoulder (17.6%). The site of pain was statistically significant (p < 0.05) in association with all the sociodemographic characteristics except gender (p = 0.11). A majority of participants (95.4%) had sought medical treatment and taken sick leaves (70%) due to WMSDs pain during their life. Participants attributed a number of working years and working posture as the two main reasons behind WMSDs. CONCLUSION: Considering the high prevalence of WMSDs among dentists, preventive strategies that minimize the occurrence of WMSDs should be adopted by dental professionals. The impact of WMSDs can be reduced by maintaining good posture, taking breaks and rest in between work, doing regular exercise, and improving the work environment.","output":"Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders and Their Associated Risk Factors among Pakistani Dental Practitioners: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Alcohol and substance misuse are a public health priority. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that harmful alcohol use accounts for 5.1% of the global burden of disease and that 35.6 million people worldwide are affected by substance misuse. The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has disrupted delivery of face-to-face alcohol and substance misuse interventions and has forced the development of alternative remote interventions or adaptation to existing ones. Although existing research on remote interventions suggests they might be as effective as face-to-face delivery, there has been a lack of systematic exploration of their content, the experience of service users, and their effectiveness for behavioural outcomes. This review will provide a narrative synthesis of the behaviour change techniques (BCT) contained in interventions for alcohol and/or substance misuse and their association with effectiveness. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Systematic searches will be conducted in MEDLINE, Scopus, PsycINFO (ProQuest), and the Cochrane Library. Included studies will be those reporting remote interventions focusing on alcohol and/or substance misuse among adults living in the community and which have a primary behaviour change outcome (i.e., alcohol levels consumed). Data extraction will be conducted by one author and moderated by a second, and risk of bias and behaviour change technique (BCT) coding will be conducted by two authors independently. A narrative synthesis will be undertaken focussing upon the association of BCTs with intervention effectiveness using promise ratios.

Among 1,236 patients with COVID-19, 45 (3.6%) were evaluated with contrast-enhanced CT examination. VTE events occurred in 10 patients (22.2%), and the incidence of VTE in mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 was 0%, 11.8%, and 40.0%, respectively. COVID-19 patients with VTE showed a higher body weight (81.6 vs. 64.0 kg, P=0.005) and body mass index (26.9 vs. 23.2 kg/m2, P=0.04), and a higher proportion had a severe status for COVID-19 compared with those without.

In this study, questionnaires were distributed in seven major geographic regions of Chinese mainland to investigate the publics awareness and agreement with information related to the utilization of wildlife in order to measure the impact of information on various issues relating wildlife conservation and utilization. The Chinese public had the greatest awareness and agreement with information that prevents unsustainable and illegal utilization, and the least awareness and agreement with information that promotes unsustainable utilization. It is also noteworthy that the Chinese public have higher levels of awareness and agreement with information that does not support utilization than with information that supports sustainable utilization. From our research, we can conclude that overall the public tends to support and be informed by a purist view of conservation, and there is significantly less support for conservation based on sustainable utilization. On this basis, we suggest that in the future, conservation education should seek to balance the publics respect and love for nature which is often inspired by social media, with more scientific information about scientific understandings that influence conservation policy and practice. ABSTRACT: The widespread dissemination of information related to wildlife utilization in new online media and traditional media undoubtedly impacts societal conservation concepts and attitudes, thus triggering public discussions on the relationship between conservation and utilization. A study on how public attitudes and concepts are affected by the related information on wildlife utilization is helpful to implement the scientific wildlife conservation and management strategies, and to propose targeted measures to optimize the information environment. We designed the questionnaire to investigate the publics awareness and agreement with related information on wildlife utilization so as to measure how information with different dissemination channels, source types, and content orientation influenced the publics concept of wildlife conservation and utilization. The questionnaire was distributed in seven major geographical regions throughout China. Out of a total of 1645 questionnaires that were collected, 1294 questionnaires were valid, with an effective rate of 78.7%. Results show that respondents had the greatest awareness of information on preventing unsustainable and illegal utilization, and the lowest awareness of information on promoting unsustainable utilization, and that awareness of information that against utilization was higher than that of information which supported sustainable utilization. At the same time, respondents showed the greatest agreement for information on preventing unsustainable utilization and the lowest agreement for information on promoting unsustainable utilization; also, their agreement with information that against utilization was higher than that for information which supported sustainable use. Respondents had a high level of awareness of information on wildlife related to COVID-19 provided by experts. Gender, age, the level of development of the city in which they live, education, vegetarianism, and religious beliefs all affected respondents agreement with related information on wildlife utilization. This research suggests that the publicity and education of scientific conservation methods should be emphasized in the future conservation education. In addition, scholars in the field of wildlife research should assume the role of influencer and give full play to the scientific guidance of public opinion.","output":"The Impact of Information on Attitudes toward Sustainable Wildlife Utilization and Management: A Survey of the Chinese Public"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As many prophylactics targeting SARS-CoV-2 are aimed at the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), we examined the risk of immune evasion from previously published RBD-targeting neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Epitopes for RBD-targeting nAbs overlap one another substantially and can give rise to escape mutants with ACE2 affinities comparable to wild type that still infect cells in vitro. Based on this demonstrated mutational tolerance of the RBD, we used evolutionary modeling to predict the frequency of immune escape before and after the widespread presence of nAbs raised by vaccines, administered as prophylactics, or produced through natural immunity. Our modeling suggests that SARS-CoV-2 mutants with one or two mildly deleterious mutations are expected to exist in high numbers due to neutral genetic variation, and likewise resistance to single or double antibody combinations will develop quickly under positive selection.","output":"Risk of evolutionary escape from neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background.

Traditionally, beneficial health effects have been largely attributed to the high concentration of monounsaturated fatty acids, and in recent years, these have also been related to other components including oleacein and oleocanthal. Here, we evaluated, for the first time, the antimicrobial activity of different green extra virgin olive oil-based formulations in natural deep eutectic solvents (NaDESs) emerging as powerful and biocompatible solvents. Specifically, the antimicrobial activity of the EVOO extract, as well as purified oleocanthal and oleacein in two NaDESs (choline/glycerol and choline/propylene glycol), against several drug-resistant clinical isolates and standard microbial strains has been evaluated. The main result was the inhibitory activity of the EVOO extract in choline/glycerol as well as oleacein in choline/propylene glycol toward drug-resistant Gram-positive and -negative strains. Specifically, the EVOO extract in choline/glycerol showed the highest antibacterial activity against several clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus, whereas oleacein in choline/propylene glycol was the most effective toward various clinical strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In addition, all the formulations tested were effective against Candida spp. In conclusion, our results suggest EVOO-based formulations in NaDESs as an interesting strategy that may help in reducing the risk of development of drug resistance.

METHODS Out of a prospective database with all laparoscopic colon resection between May 1999 and January 2008 the patients with laparoscopic sigmoid resection for diverticulitis were analyzed. Preoperative diagnosis was made by abdominal computed tomography with irrigoscopy and/or endoscopy. Indications for laparoscopic sigmoid resections were diverticulitis as an early elective or elective operation and selected cases with perforated diverticulitis. RESULTS Between May 1999 and January 2008, 200 patients (97 women, 103 men) were operated by laparoscopy for diverticulitis. Mean age at surgery was 59 years (range: 27 to 86); mean preoperative body mass index was 27.2 kg/m2 (range: 20 to 38). Mean operating time was 121 minutes (range: 60 to 239).

Laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) has been observed more frequently since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods All patients referred to our 24/7 Airway Diseases Center for laryngotracheal post-intubation/tracheostomy stenosis from May 2020 to May 2021were evaluated retrospectively. Patient data on comorbidities, diagnosis, type of procedures, lengths of ICU stay and invasive mechanical ventilation, medical treatment, and the severity of illness were recorded. Results This case series included nine patients (five women and four men), with a mean age of 52.9 years, most with a BMI >30, all with a severe illness revealed by the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II >31. From May 2020 to May 2021, 21 procedures were performed on seven patients, consisting of bronchoscopic rigid interventions, T-tube Montgomery tracheostomy, and one cricotracheal resection with end-to-end anastomosis. Histologic examination of tracheal biopsies showed an inflammatory state of the airway mucosa. Two patients only had medical therapy. Discussion and Conclusions Pneumonia caused by SARSCoV-2 can lead to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. The time of intubation, the drugs used, the prone position, comorbidities (diabetes, obesity), and the inflammatory state of the upper airways linked to the viral infection, predispose to an increased tendency to stenosis and its recurrence. A conservative approach with medical and endoscopic treatment should be preferred in case of persistence of local airways inflammation. Further studies with a larger sample of patients will help to a better understanding of the disease, reduce the prevalence, and improve its treatment.","output":"Case Report: Laryngotracheal Post-Intubation/Tracheostomy Stenosis in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Molecular diagnostics has been the front runner in the worlds response to the COVID-19 pandemic Particularly, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the quantitative variant (qRT-PCR) have been the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis However, faster antigen tests and other point-of-care (POC) devices have also played a significant role in containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by facilitating mass screening and delivering results in less time Thus, despite the higher sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR assays, the impact of POC tests cannot be ignored As a consequence, there has been an increased interest in the development of miniaturized, high-throughput, and automated PCR systems, many of which can be used at point-of-care This review summarizes the recent advances in the development of miniaturized PCR systems with an emphasis on COVID-19 detection The distinct features of digital PCR and electrochemical PCR are detailed along with the challenges The potential of CRISPR/Cas technology for POC diagnostics is also highlighted Commercial RTCPCR POC systems approved by various agencies for COVID-19 detection are discussed","output":"Point-of-Care PCR Assays for COVID-19 Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract COVID-19 triggers a hypercoagulable state with a high incidence of thrombotic complications.

Up to 31 May 2020, mortality in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) with COVID-19 was 41.6%. Since then, changes in therapeutics and management may have improved outcomes. Also, data from countries affected later in the pandemic are now available. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed and Cochrane databases up to 30 September 2020 for studies reporting ICU mortality among adult patients with COVID-19 and present an updated systematic review and meta-analysis. The primary outcome measure was death in intensive care as a proportion of completed ICU admissions, either through discharge from intensive care or death. We identified 52 observational studies including 43,128 patients, and first reports from the Middle East, South Asia and Australasia, as well as four national or regional registries. Reported mortality was lower in registries compared with other reports. In two regions, mortality differed significantly from all others, being higher in the Middle East and lower in a single registry study from Australasia. Although ICU mortality (95%CI) was lower than reported in June (35.5% (31.3-39.9%) vs. 41.6% (34.0-49.7%)), the absence of patient-level data prevents a definitive evaluation. A lack of standardisation of reporting prevents comparison of cohorts in terms of underlying risk, severity of illness or outcomes. We found that the decrease in ICU mortality from COVID-19 has reduced or plateaued since May 2020 and note the possibility of some geographical variation.

Though previous studies have shown that overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL) improves at one year after implantation, specific factors that predict a higher quality of life have not been identified. Hypothesis Self-perceived quality of life after LVAD implant is influenced by demographics and preexisting comorbidities. Methods We identified 118 patients in the INTERMACS database who received a LVAD at our institution. Of these, 26 patients completed the KCCQ-12 questionnaire and 32 patients completed VAS at 1-year follow up. An exploratory data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics, correlation tests, and non-parametric comparison tests such as Wilcoxon rank-sum to identify important trends and predictors for changes in HRQoL. Multiple variables (patient characteristics, clinical data) were tested independently against the KCCQ-12 and VAS scores at one year and with the absolute change in these scores over a one-year period. Due to low sample size, we were not able to perform a multivariate model. Results New York Heart Association Class IV symptoms at baseline (p=0.01) were predictive of large gains in VAS scores at one year. Frailty, although not reaching significance, may be associated with smaller magnitudes of improvement in KCCQ at one year (p=0.067).

Combining microfluidic experiments, confocal microscopy and numerical models helps to better understand the physical chemistry and mechanisms involved in pore plugging. The results show that plugging starts from the walls of sweat pores before expanding into the centre of the channel.

However, current evaluation methods do not provide evidence-based suggestions or measurements on how to detect outbreaks earlier. Key conditions for earlier detection and their influencing factors remain unclear and unmeasured. Without clarity about conditions and influencing factors, attempts to improve disease detection remain ad hoc and unsystematic. Methods: We developed a generic five-step disease detection model and a novel methodology to use for data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Data was collected in two workshops in Southeast Europe (n = 33 participants) and Southern and East Africa (n = 19 participants), representing mid- and low-income countries. Through systematic, qualitative, and quantitative data analyses, we identified key conditions for earlier detection and prioritized factors that influence them. As participants joined a workshop format and not an experimental setting, no ethics approval was required. Findings: Our analyses suggest that governance is the most important condition for earlier detection in both regions. Facilitating factors for earlier detection are risk communication activities such as information sharing, communication, and collaboration activities. Impeding factors are lack of communication, coordination, and leadership. Interpretation: Governance and risk communication are key influencers for earlier detection in both regions. However, inadequate technical capacity, commonly assumed to be a leading factor impeding early outbreak detection, was not found a leading factor.

However, the role of response assessment by end-of-treatment (EOT) PET has only been addressed in small case series. METHODS We performed a retrospective, multicenter study of 37 patients with CD20-positive PTLD after solid organ transplantation treated with uniform, up-to-date, first-line protocols in the prospective German PTLD registry who had received EOT 18F-FDG-PET between 2006 and 2014. Median follow-up was 5.0 years. Any nonphysiological 18F-FDG uptake (Deauville score greater 2) was interpreted as PET-positive. RESULTS By computed tomography (CT) final staging, 18 of 37 patients had a complete response, 18 had a partial response and 1 patient had stable disease. EOT PET was negative in 24 of 37 patients and positive in 13 of 37 patients. The positive predictive value of EOT PET for PTLD relapse was 38%, and the negative predictive value was 92%. Time to progression (TTP) and progression-free-survival were significantly longer in the PET negative group (P = 0.019 and P = 0.013).

This raises the question as to whether accelerated immune-ageing mechanistically links early-life adversity to the lifelong health trajectory resulting in either 'poor' or 'healthy' ageing. Here we examine observational and mechanistic studies of ELA and inflammageing, highlighting common and distinct features in these two life stages. Many biological processes appear in common including reduction in telomere length, increased immunosenescence, metabolic distortions and chronic (viral) infections. We propose that ELA shapes the developing immune, endocrine and nervous system in a non-reversible way, creating a distinct phenotype with accelerated immunosenescence and systemic inflammation. We conclude that ELA might act as an accelerator for inflammageing and age-related diseases.

In direct ELISAs, where the antigen was directly bound to the ELISA surface, both antigens discriminated sera from non-exposed and exposed individuals. However, the discriminating resolution was better in ELISAs that used the full-spike antigen than the S-RBD(N318-V510). Attachment of the antigens to the ELISA surface using a layer of anti-histidine antibodies gave equivalent resolution for both S-RBD(N318-V510) and the full-length spike protein. Results demonstrate that ELISA-functional SARS-CoV-2 antigens can be produced in bacterial cultures, and that S-RBD(N318-V510) may represent a cost-effective alternative to the use of structurally more complex antigens in serological COVID-19 testing.","output":"Serological Test to Determine Exposure to SARS-CoV-2: ELISA Based on the Receptor-Binding Domain of the Spike Protein (S-RBD(N318-V510)) Expressed in Escherichia coli"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID 19 infection represents a global threat and now a frequent cause of hospitalization in pediatrics. COVID 19, as well as Influenza virus could have a severe course. There are few studies, and no local or regional information comparing severe disease between COVID 19 and Influenza virus in children. METHODS: Confirmed COVID 19 between March 2020 to October 2021 and influenza infections from Jan-2017 to dec-2019 were included. Asymptomatic or ambulatory COVID 19 infections were excluded. The main objective was to compare clinical, laboratory and outcome characteristic of PICU admitted patients. RESULTS: 71 patients were included, 32(45,1%) with COVID 19 and 39 (54,9%) influenza virus. COVID 19 patients were older than influenza patients: 67 (20,5-143) vs. 10 (2- 46) p=0.0002. The majority of influenza patients were younger than two years, with different distributions in COVID 19 patients. Figure 1. Respiratory distress was more frequent in influenza (92,3% vs. 62,5%) p=0.002, but exanthema (28,1% vs 2,6%), shock (68,7% vs. 7,7%) and central nervous system manifestations (40,6% vs. 7,7%) were significantly more common in COVID19 than in Influenza respectively. COVID 19 had lower platelets and lymphocyte counts than inlfuenza. There were no differences in treatment, nor deceased either, but Influenza patients had slightly longer hospital stays 12 (7 C 23) vs. 9.5 (6C15.5) p=0.1592 than COVID 19 (Table 1).

[Image: see text] CONCLUSION: COVID 19 and influenza severe infections can have some differences including age of presentation. Inlfuenza main manifestation requiring UCIP is respiratory distress, while COVID19 can have other presentations including shock and central nervous manifestation. Lower lymphocyte counts as well as lower platelets were significantly more common in COVID 19 patients. Although there are no unique characteristics of each infection, some particularities could guide clinician to the etiology of the infection.

Surprisingly, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has apparently required little to no significant adaptation to humans since the start of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to October 2020. Here we assess the types of natural selection taking place in Sarbecoviruses in horseshoe bats versus the early SARS-CoV-2 evolution in humans. While there is moderate evidence of diversifying positive selection in SARS-CoV-2 in humans, it is limited to the early phase of the pandemic, and purifying selection is much weaker in SARS-CoV-2 than in related bat Sarbecoviruses. In contrast, our analysis detects evidence for significant positive episodic diversifying selection acting at the base of the bat virus lineage SARS-CoV-2 emerged from, accompanied by an adaptive depletion in CpG composition presumed to be linked to the action of antiviral mechanisms in these ancestral bat hosts. The closest bat virus to SARS-CoV-2, RmYN02 (sharing an ancestor about 1976), is a recombinant with a structure that includes differential CpG content in Spike; clear evidence of coinfection and evolution in bats without involvement of other species. While an undiscovered \\"facilitating\\" intermediate species cannot be discounted, collectively, our results support the progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 being capable of efficient human-human transmission as a consequence of its adaptive evolutionary history in bats, not humans, which created a relatively generalist virus.","output":"Natural selection in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats created a generalist virus and highly capable human pathogen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of SARS-CoV-2 caused a worldwide healthcare threat.

Data on the outcome of patients with a chronic critical illness (CCI) are scarce. Single-center retrospective study including all adult critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated at the Department of Intensive Care Medicine at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany, between 1 March 2020 and 8 August 2021. We identified 304 critically ill patients with COVID-19 during the study period. Of those, 55% (n = 167) had an ICU stay 21 days and were defined as chronic critical illness, and 45% (n = 137) had an ICU stay <21 days. Age, sex and BMI were distributed equally between both groups. Patients with CCI had a higher median SAPS II (CCI: 39.5 vs. no-CCI: 38 points, p = 0.140) and SOFA score (10 vs. 6, p < 0.001) on admission. Seventy-three per cent (n = 223) of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) (86% vs. 58%; p < 0.001).

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic created a situation in which nascent memory could be tracked through additional antigen exposures.

We therefore investigated how vaccine-induced memory is shaped by previous infection. We found that following vaccination, previously infected individuals generated more SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific memory B cells and variant-neutralizing antibodies and a distinct population of IFN- and IL-10-expressing memory SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ T cells than previously naive individuals. While additional vaccination could increase humoral memory, it did not recapitulate the distinct CD4+ T cell cytokine profile in previously naive individuals.

Few information, dated back to almost two decades ago, exist as to whether a gluten-free diet (GFD) could reduce the islet-specific autoimmunity detected in patients at CD diagnosis. Aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of GFD on 31 patients who presented islet-specific autoimmunity at CD diagnosis. METHODS: CD patient sera collected at diagnosis and throughout the GFD were analyzed for the main humoral autoantibodies so far identified in T1D, directed against one or more among insulin, glutamic-acid decarboxylase, tyrosine-phosphatase 2 and zinc cation-efflux transporter autoantigens. RESULTS: GFD (median duration 39 months) was associated to a decrease or disappearance of the islet-specific autoantibodies in 71% of CD patients. Almost 80% of the patients who became autoantibody-negative during the GFD were positive for only one of the islet-specific autoimmune markers at CD diagnosis, with none of them developing diabetes. Conversely, 80% of the CD patients positive at diagnosis for &#8805;2 islet-specific autoantibodies were still positive after more than two years of GFD, with 25% of them developing T1D. CONCLUSIONS: Various factors appear to influence, individually or in combination, the effects of the GFD on pancreatic islet-specific autoimmune response detected at CD diagnosis.

Among these, 40% of females experience acute postoperative pain, and between 25 to 60% develop persistent chronic postsurgical pain. The rationale of this study was that minimally invasive procedures can result in immediate pain relief in patients undergoing mastectomy, which has been proven to satisfy their needs and lead to early discharge in the local population. Objective: This study determined to find out the efficacy of instilling bupivacaine on wounds by means of surgical drains in controlling pain after MRM. Methodology: This was a randomized control study trial that was carried out in Surgical Unit 1, Ward 3, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, from November 2020 to April 2021. All patients tested negative for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by PCR test before randomly allocating them into two groups. Thirty women in Group B received 40 ml of 0.25% injection bupivacaine, and 30 in Group C received no drug. Duration of analgesia was recorded as time in hours when the patient was received after surgery in the post-anesthesia care unit until the patient felt ache and discomfort of > three scores according to the visual analog pain score chart (VAS). Results: The average age was 52.484.76 years. The mean period of time during which analgesia was observed was significantly higher in Group B as compared to Group C (10.931.84 vs 5.031.35 hours, p=0.0005).

Since then, several pieces of advice have been made to boost the immune system to fight more efficiently with this infection. Previously published studies showed that vitamin D3 (Vit D3) level was low in COVID-19 patients. One of the most important factors in COVID-19 severity would be the inflammatory response. It is well documented that the inflammatory cytokine storm increases the severity of COVID-19. Cytokine storm results from dysregulation of the innate immune system with an outpouring of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to abnormal activation of the adaptive immune pathway. It has been approved that Vit D3 has immunomodulatory functions and plays an anti-inflammatory role, particularly in viral infections. Therefore, the current study was designed to investigate the possible role of Vit D3 deficiency in the COVID-19 patients' innate immunity. This study included 180 participants who were divided into group (A) consisted of 60 COVID-19 positive patients with normal level of Vit D3, group (B) consisted of 60 COVID-19 positive patients with Vit D3 deficiency, and group (C) consisted of 60 COVID-19 positive patients that had received Vit D3 therapy. The results showed that the rate of hospitalization in the group (B) (41.3%) was significantly increased, compared to group (A) (12.5%). In this regard, Vit D3 therapy led to a significant increase in the level of Vit D3, and the patients who received Vit D3 were recovered from hospital 5 days on average sooner than those in the group (B). Therefore, the consumption of Vit D3 as a daily supplement would be a reasonable suggestion for these days of the COVID-19 pandemic to increase the power of immunity of the body.","output":"Importance of Vitamin D3 in COVID-19 Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction C objectifs Deux patients atteints de MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus) ont t hospitaliss en France en 2013.

By conducting theoretical and empirical research, we try to reveal the relationship and mechanism between the economic growth and public health from the perspective of environmental pollution. By constructing an embedded theoretical model of industrial agglomeration and FDI, this article combines other environmental pollution influencing factors, expounds the impact mechanism of industrial agglomeration on environmental pollution. Based on the provincial-level panel data of China on environmental pollution and industrial agglomeration, the empirical test is carried out through the threshold panel regression model. According to the results, industrial agglomeration can significantly rectify the regional environmental pollution, thereby benefiting public health. FDI has a phased impact on the relationship between industrial agglomeration and environmental pollution. Specifically, when the level of FDI is low, the positive improvement effect of industrial agglomeration on environmental pollution is relatively strong. This is mainly because industrial agglomeration can promote economic growth, technological progress, and enhance environmental awareness. When the level of FDI exceeds the first threshold and continues to rise, the positive improvement effect of industrial agglomeration is maximized. Before the level of FDI exceeds the second threshold, this effect gradually weakens. The population concentration and excessive expansion of city scale brought about by industrial agglomeration will lead to the increase of regional resource and energy consumption, thus aggravating environmental pollution. The policy implication is that while the government and enterprises are vigorously increasing the level of foreign investment, they must pay equal attention to economic growth and public health, and the level of industrial agglomeration should match the level of foreign investment so as to give full play to the positive improvement effect of industrial agglomeration on environmental pollution, and realize the coordinated development of the regional economy, environment and population health.","output":"Does Industrial Agglomeration or Foreign Direct Investment Matter for Environment Pollution of Public Health?

Three related clones, designated SY2, SY10, and SY11, encoding two distinct polypeptides were purified for further analysis. Antibodies affinity purified by adsorption to the lambda Zap- cloned recombinant proteins and antibodies from NZW rabbits immunized with purified recombinant proteins reproduced Golgi staining and bound two different proteins, 95 and 160 kD, from whole cell extracts. The SY11 protein was provisionally named golgin-95 and the SY2/SY10 protein was named golgin-160. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA clone of SY2 and SY11 represented 58.7- and 70-kD proteins of 568 and 620 amino acids. The in vitro translation products of SY2 and SY11 cDNAs migrated in SDS-PAGE at 65 and 95 kD, respectively. The in vitro translated proteins were immunoprecipitated by human anti-Golgi serum or immune rabbit serum, but not by normal human serum or preimmune rabbit serum. Features of the cDNA suggested that SY11 was a full- length clone encoding golgin-95 but SY2 and SY10 together encoded a partial sequence of golgin-160. Analysis of the SY11 recombinant protein identified a leucine zipper spanning positions 419-455, a glutamic acid-rich tract spanning positions 322-333, and a proline-rich tract spanning positions 67-73. A search of the SwissProt data bank indicated sequence similarity of SY11 to human restin, the heavy chain of kinesin, and the heavy chain of myosin. SY2 shared sequence similarity with the heavy chain of myosin, the USO1 transport protein from yeast, and the 150-kD cytoplasmic dynein-associated polypeptide.

Both imidazodiazepines showed affinity toward the GABAAR binding site of clonazepam, with IC50 values of 576 and 242 nM, respectively. Molecular docking analysis, using the available 132 GABAAR structural data, suggests binding of the diazepine core between the 1+/2- interface, whereas alkyl substituents are located outside the binding site and thus interact with the protein surface and solvent molecules. The physicochemical properties of these compounds are very different. The solubility of PI310 is low in water. PEGylation of PI320 significantly improves aqueous solubility and cell permeability. Neither compound is toxic in HEK293 cells following exposure at >300 M for 18 h. Ex vivo studies using guinea pig tracheal rings showed that PI310 was unable to relax the constricted airway smooth muscle. In contrast, PI320 induced muscle relaxation at organ bath concentrations as low as 5 M, with rapid onset (15 min) at 25 M. PI320 also reduced airway hyper-responsiveness in vivo in a mouse model of steroid-resistant lung inflammation induced by intratracheal challenge with INF and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). At nebulized doses of 7.2 mg/kg, PI320 and albuterol were equally effective in reducing airway hyper-responsiveness. Ten minutes after nebulization, the lung concentration of PI320 was 50-fold that of PI310, indicating superior availability of PI320 when nebulized as an aqueous solution. Overall, PI320 is a promising inhaled drug candidate to quickly relax airway smooth muscle in bronchoconstrictive disorders, such as asthma.

Results from the analyses show that in the very large corpus datasets, a large group of documents encompasses the overall or dominant general theme. However, the smaller clusters of documents reveal very precise and niche themes. Generalized COVID-19 is the dominant theme present in largest clusters. Smaller clusters include more specific terms (e.g., popular drugs, popular terms, key features/impacts related to COVID).

However, critical care medicine, which is abundant with high acuity yet infrequent procedures, has not embraced 3DP as much as others. The discrepancy between the possible training or therapeutic uses of 3DP in critical care and what is currently utilized in other fields needs to be addressed. OBJECTIVE: This narrative literature review describes the uses of 3DP in critical care that have been documented. It also discusses possible future directions based on recent technological advances. METHODS: A literature search on PubMed was performed using keywords and Mesh terms for 3DP, critical care, and critical care skills. RESULTS: Our search found that 3DP use in critical care fell under the major categories of medical education (23 papers), patient care (4 papers) and clinical equipment modification (4 papers). Medical education showed the use of 3DP in bronchoscopy, congenital heart disease, cricothyroidotomy, and medical imaging. On the other hand, patient care papers discussed 3DP use in wound care, personalized splints, and patient monitoring. Clinical equipment modification papers reported the use of 3DP to modify stethoscopes and laryngoscopes to improve their performance. Notably, we found that only 13 of the 31 papers were directly produced or studied by critical care physicians. CONCLUSION: The papers discussed provide examples of the possible utilities of 3DP in critical care. The relative scarcity of papers produced by critical care physicians may indicate barriers to 3DP implementation. However, technological advances such as point-of-care 3DP tools and the increased demand for 3DP during the recent COVID-19 pandemic may change 3DP implementation across the critical care field.","output":"3D printing in critical care: a narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human respiratory viral infections are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality around the world.

We have a window of time during which we can begin to anticipate just, equitable and salutary ways to accommodate a disease-modifying therapy Alzheimers disease. Here we consider the implications for caregivers, clinicians, researchers, and the US healthcare system of the availability of an expensive, presymptomatic treatment for a common late-onset neurodegenerative disease for which diagnosis can be difficult.","output":"Good problems to have?

We investigated anti-TB drug resistance profiles and the impact of socioeconomic as well as behavioural factors on the prevalence of TB and drug resistance in two regions of Cameroon with such data paucity. METHODS This was a hospital-based study in which 1706 participants, comprising 1133 females and 573 males consecutively enrolled from selected TB and HIV treatment centres of the Northwest and Southwest regions. Demographic, clinical and self-reported risk behaviours and socioeconomic data were obtained with the consent of participants using questionnaires. Culture and drug resistance testing were performed according to standard procedures. RESULTS The prevalence of resistance to at least one anti-TB drug was 27.7% and multi-drug resistance was 5.9%. Smoking, concurrent alcohol consumption and smoking, being on antiretroviral therapy for  12 months and previous household contact with TB patient were independently associated with tuberculosis prevalence, while only previous tuberculosis infection was associated with drug resistance in a univariate analysis. CONCLUSION The study showed a high prevalence of drug resistance TB in the study population with only previous TB infection associated with drug resistance in a univariate analysis. It also provides evidence in our context, of the role of alcohol and smoking in increasing the risk of developing TB, which is more likely in people living with HIV/AIDS.

The benefits of early mobility while undergoing ECMO have been previously documented. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented physical therapists with novel challenges, balancing the risk of a widespread shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) with the benefits of early mobility for patients on ECMO. The purpose of this case study is to report the successful rehabilitation of a critically ill patient with COVID-19 undergoing VV ECMO. Methods: This is a case description of a 38-year-old man who presented to the hospital with COVID-19 and subsequent intubation and cannulation for VV ECMO. Physical therapy was initiated while the patient remained critically ill on VV ECMO. Focused coordination and education were employed to limit PPE usage by limiting the number of essential staff/therapists that entered the room as well as changing the frequency of therapy sessions dependent on how the patient was progressing functionally. Results: On VV ECMO day 11, he was able to sit up and perform a sit-to-stand. ECMO decannulation occurred on hospital day 14 with extubation on hospital day 18. The patient progressed functionally while quarantined in the room until he was discharged home with supplemental oxygen after spending 29 days in the hospital. Conclusion: This case study demonstrates the clinical decision-making used to provide physical therapy services for a critically ill patient with COVID-19. High-level team coordination resulted in limiting the use of PPE as well as reducing staff exposure frequency during rehabilitation.

The previous method of reducing the risk of POPF was the application of a polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheet to the pancreatic stump after cutting the pancreas with a stapler (After-stapling); the new method involves wrapping the pancreatic resection line with a PGA sheet before stapling (Before-stapling). The study aimed to compare the incidence of POPF and POFC between two methods. METHODS Data of patients who underwent open or laparoscopic DPs by a single surgeon from October 2010 to February 2020 in a tertiary referral hospital were retrospectively analyzed. POPF was defined according to the updated International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula criteria. POFC was measured by postoperative computed tomography (CT). RESULTS Altogether, 182 patients were enrolled (After-stapling group, n = 138; Before-stapling group, n = 44). Clinicopathologic and intraoperative findings between the two groups were similar. Clinically relevant POPF rates were similar between both groups (4.3% vs. 4.5%, p = 0.989). POFC was significantly lesser in the Before-stapling group on postoperative day 7 (p < 0.001).

Persistent mucosal inflammation is a hallmark of the disease. Epithelial microbiota dysbiosis is found in other chronic inflammatory mucosal diseases; however, the relationship between tracheal microbiota composition and iSGS is unknown. OBJECTIVES: Given the critical role for host defense at mucosal barriers, we analyzed tissue specimens from iSGS patients for the presence of microbial pathogens. METHODS: Utilizing 20 human iSGS, 20 intubation-related tracheal stenosis (iLTS) and 10 healthy control specimens we applied molecular, immunohistochemical, electron microscopic, immunologic and Sanger? sequencing techniques. MAIN RESULTS: With unbiased culture-independent nucleic acid, protein, and immunologic approaches, we demonstrate that Mycobacterium species are uniquely associated with iSGS. Phylogenetic analysis of the mycobacterial virulence factor rpoB suggests that rather than Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (Mtb), a variant member of the Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Complex (MtbC), or a closely related novel mycobacterium is present in iSGS specimens.

To safeguard transportation equity, this study used complete records of service trips and riders obtained from the Access Transportation Program in the Seattle region for an empirical analysis aimed at answering two research questions. First, how did the ridership and trip purposes of paratransit change after the outbreak of COVID-19? Second, what factors explained the users' changing levels of service usage in response to the pandemic? Statistical methods, including a Hurdle model, were employed as the analytical tools. The results show that paratransit ridership dramatically decreased during 2020 with the most substantial reductions of working and non-essential personal trips, and that most of the remaining trips were for medical purposes. The results also indicate that riders' service usage during the pandemic was associated with their sociodemographic characteristics, disability conditions, and pre-pandemic travel demand. When controlling for other factors, riders who lived in neighborhoods with lower income and lower access to personal vehicles were more dependent on the service. Based on the empirical findings, we recommend that when developing plans for future disruptive events, public transit agencies should promptly implement safety measures, identify and prioritize neighborhoods that are most in need of mobility services, and actively pursue collaboration with other organizations for innovative service delivery options.

A potential mechanism to protect this population could be provided by passive immunity through the milk of a previously infected mother. We and others have reported on the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in human milk (2-5). We now report the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgA in the milk of 75 COVID-19-recovered participants, and find that 88% of samples are positive for Spike-specific IgA. In a subset of these samples, 95% exhibited robust IgA activity as determined by endpoint binding titer, with 50% considered high-titer. These IgA positive specimens were also positive for Spike-specific antibodies bearing the secretory component. Levels of IgA antibodies and antibodies bearing secretory component were shown to be strongly positively correlated. The secretory IgA response was dominant among the milk samples tested compared to the IgG response, which was present in 75% of samples and found to be of high-titer in only 13% of cases. Our IgA durability analysis using 28 paired samples, obtained 4-6 weeks and 4-10 months after infection, found that all samples exhibited persistently significant Spike-specific IgA, with 43% of donors exhibiting increasing IgA titers over time. Finally, COVID-19 and pre-pandemic control milk samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies; 6 of 8 COVID-19 samples exhibited neutralization of Spike-pseudotyped VSV (IC50 range, 2.39-89.4ug/mL) compared to 1 of 8 controls. IgA binding and neutralization capacities were found to be strongly positively correlated. These data are highly relevant to public health, not only in terms of the protective capacity of these antibodies for breastfed infants, but also for the potential use of such antibodies as a COVID-19 therapeutic, given that secretory IgA is highly stable not only in milk and the infant mouth and gut, but in all mucosa including the gastrointestinal tract, upper airway, and lungs (6).","output":"The Spike-specific IgA in milk commonly-elicited after SARS-Cov-2 infection is concurrent with a robust secretory antibody response, exhibits neutralization potency strongly correlated with IgA binding, and is highly durable over time"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital contact tracing is a promising digital public health intervention to manage epidemics.

The objective of the present study was to explore the effect of Ulva armoricana extracts on MDV infection in vitro. RESULTS: We could demonstrate that the ulvan extract as well as its vitamin-enriched formulation reduce the viral load by about 80% at 24 h post-infection in infected chicken fibroblasts at concentrations that are innocuous for the cells. We also observed a substantial decrease in MDV plaque size suggesting that ulvans impede MDV cell-to-cell spread in vitro.

METHODOLOGY: Using a population-based observational design, all eight South Asian countries were analyzed using a step-wise approach. Data were obtained from government websites and publicly-available repositories for population dynamics and key variables. RESULTS: South Asian countries have a younger average age of their population. Inequitable distribution of resources centered in urban metropolitan cities within South Asia is present. Certain densely populated regions in these countries have better testing and healthcare facilities that correlate with lower COVID-19 incidence per million populations. Trends of urban-rural disparities are unclear given the lack of clear reporting of the gaps within these regions. COVID-19 vaccination lag has become apparent in South Asian countries, with the expected time to complete the campaign being unfeasible as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses. CONCLUSION: With a redesigning of governance policies on preventing the rise of COVID-19 promptly, the relief on the healthcare system and healthcare workers will allow for adequate time to roll out vaccination campaigns with equitable distribution.

Data for the study spanned five waves of the Growing Up in Scotland longitudinal survey (N = 3,621). Findings indicate that income volatility was more prevalent among disadvantaged sociodemographic groups. In addition to average income, short-term volatility was associated with changes in child cognitive outcomes from ages 3 to 5. While upward volatility was associated with gains in expressive vocabulary, downward and fluctuating volatility were associated with declines in child problem-solving abilities. The association between volatility and changes in cognitive outcomes was similar for both children living in poverty and those from mediumChigh-income households. Our results suggest that policies aiming to cushion all families from negative income shocks, boost family income to ensure stability, and take low-income families out of poverty will have a significant impact on childrens cognitive development.

Methods The presence of postmortem SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 35 complete COVID-19 autopsies was correlated with the time interval between the first diagnosis of COVID-19 and death and with its relationship to morphologic findings. Results Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA can be evident up to 40 days after the first diagnosis and can persist to 94 hours after death. Postmortem SARS-CoV-2 RNA was mostly positive in lungs (70%) and trachea (69%), but all investigated organs were positive with variable frequency. Late-stage tissue damage was evident up to 65 days after initial diagnosis in several organs. Positivity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in pulmonary swabs correlated with diffuse alveolar damage (p = 0.0009).

However, few studies have investigated the role of diet-alone interventions in improving individuals' weight gain by taking AAPs. In closed management mental hospitals of China, family members are allowed to bring food to patients regularly, causing patients to have caloric intake added to their 3 daily meals. However, during the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), bringing food to the hospital was temporarily prohibited in mental health institutions in China to prevent the spread of the virus. This study sought to compare the body weight and body mass index (BMI) changes of patients taking olanzapine or clozapine undergoing diet-alone interventions caused by this prohibition. METHODS: A retrospective self-controlled study was conducted on 90 patients with schizophrenia from a single-center treated with olanzapine or clozapine monotherapy, or combined with aripiprazole or ziprasidone which has a small metabolic impact. A paired-samples t-test was used to compare the changes in body weight and BMI before and after the 3-month prohibition, and general linear regression was used to analyze the effects of gender, age, disease course, duration of drug exposure, and equivalent dose on the BMI improvement. Also, the percentage of people who lost weight and that of individuals who lost 5% of their pre-prohibition body weight were calculated. RESULTS: Paired-samples t-test showed that after 3-month prohibition, the patients' body weight (71.686.83 vs. 66.917.03, P<0.001) and BMI (26.432.11 vs. 24.631.81, P<0.001) decreased significantly. Weight loss rate accounted for 99.1%, and weight loss of 5% from the pre-prohibition body weight accounted for 71.8%. General linear regression showed that the duration of drug exposure (? =-0.678, P<0.001) was significantly and negatively correlated with the BMI changes.

Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of thermal discomfort caused by personal protective equipment (PPE). Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted online at hospitals from 11 administrative regions of Guangzhou for the assessment of thermal discomfort among HCWs from June 12C16, 2021. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were used to explore the risk factors associated with thermal discomfort. Results A total of 3658 valid responses were collected. The thermal discomfort and humid discomfort levels increased from 2.91  1.19 to 3.61  0.72 and from 0.98  1.36 to 3.06  1.1 after wearing PPE, respectively (p < 0.01). Feelings of being very hot and uncomfortably humid were the most influenced by wearing PPE, increasing from 31% to 69.1% and from 9.1% to 45.7%, respectively. There were significant increases in the thermal discomfort level (3.75  0.57 vs. 3.33  0.89, p < 0.01) and the humid discomfort level (3.33  0.95 vs. 2.54  1.19, p < 0.01) between the comfortable group and uncomfortable group, accompanied by similar patterns in the feelings of being very hot and uncomfortably humid. For general thermal-related symptoms, the most common new-onset symptom was profuse sweating (80%) followed by labored breathing (55.2%) and excessive dehydration (46.8%), while facial swelling (74%) was associated with local thermal-related symptoms, followed by hand maceration erosion (56.7%) and visual impairment (49.3%). In the multivariate analysis, the apparent temperature of the environment (35 C), working in negative-pressure ambulances and outdoors, continuing to wear PPE for 1C3 days during this period, being aged >40 years, and previous experiences fighting the pandemic were independently associated with thermal discomfort (p < 0.01). Immediately after PPE removal, 32.3% of respondents considered drinking ice water/another drink, followed by 25% shortening the duration of wearing PPE and 19.1% going to the toilet. A large proportion of the participants looked forward to modifications to the material of the suit (72.9%) and mask (53.4%) for heat dissipation and dehumidification, as well as anti-fogging goggles (60.2%), adding hydration equipment to PPE (53.4%), and using soft materials to reduce pressure (40%).

We conducted community-based surveillance in conjunction with hospital-based surveillance in a rural region in Bangladesh from June 2006 to September 2007 to assess the incidence and etiology of community-acquired viral infections among neonates. METHODS Community health workers (CHWs) assessed neonates at home on days 0, 2, 5 and 8 after birth and referred cases of suspected illness to the hospital (CHW surveillance). Among neonates with clinically suspected upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), pneumonia, sepsis and/or meningitis, virus identification studies were conducted on nasal wash, cerebrospinal fluid and/or blood specimens. In the hospital-based surveillance, similar screening was conducted among all neonates (referred by CHWs and self-referred) who were admitted to the hospital. RESULTS CHW surveillance found an incidence rate of 15.6 neonatal viral infections per 1000 live births with 30% of infections identified on the day of birth. Among neonates with suspected sepsis, a viral etiology was identified in 36% of cases, with enterovirus accounting for two-thirds of those infections. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most common etiologic agent among those with viral pneumonia (91%) and URTI (68%). There was a low incidence (1.2%) of influenza in this rural population. CONCLUSION Viral infections are commonly associated with acute newborn illness, even in the early neonatal period. The estimated incidence was 5-fold greater than reported previously for bacterial infections.

Various combinations of inflammatory markers, including CRP, LDH, and D-dimer, have been predictive of increased severity in this group of patients. None of the markers mentioned, however, have had a significant association with increased mortality. Machine learning has been utilized for predictions related to COVID-19. Prior COVID-19 machine learning models used the original features as the input, but we hypothesize that the model can be improved via synthesis of new features by utilizing feature engineering. We aim to explore the predictive capacities of generated features and evaluate for improvements in COVID-19 mortality prediction. Methods: With the approval of the hospital Institutional Review Board, medical records of two hundred sixty-nine patients with a positive COVID-19 PCR study in two 350-bed medical centers were analyzed retrospectively from March 22nd through May 10th, 2020. One hundred sixty-six variables, including laboratory studies, vital signs, demographics, and comorbidities, were collected in total. Features with greater than 50 percent missing values were dropped. Missing data was imputed with SKlearn Multiple Imputation. Feature selection was performed using sequential feature selection via the machine learning extensions library (MLxtend), which led to a final feature space of seven. Feature engineering was performed using the seven features and four additional features generated. LightGBM was chosen as our classification model. The results were compared between the feature engineering and base datasets. Feature ranking was performed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Partial dependence plots were generated to determine feature value cutoffs that predict increased mortality. Results: LightGBM demonstrated good classification performance with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of .9 in the base model. The feature engineering group had an increase in AUC to .94. The feature most predictive of COVID-19 mortality based upon the SHAP plot was the product of Maximum Blood Urea Nitrogen and Maximum Respiratory Rate (MaxBUN?MaxRR). The partial dependence plot demonstrates that at a MaxBUN?MaxRR value &gt; 1000 there is a rise in SHAP values which denotes a rise in predicted mortality. Conclusion: The use of feature engineering improved predictive performance for mortality related to COVID-19. The strongest feature for the prediction of mortality was MaxBUN?MaxRR. A sharp rise in predicted mortality was observed when the product of these values exceeded 1000.

Our secondary objective was to assess changes in paramedic-assigned patient acuity scores as determined using the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS). METHODS: We analyzed data from a regional EMS database related to call type, volume, and patient acuity for January to May 2016-2020. We used statistical methods to assess differences in EMS calls between 2016 and 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: A total of 114,507 EMS calls were made for the period of January 1 to May 26 between 2016 and 2020, inclusive. Overall, the incidence rate of EMS calls significantly decreased in 2020 compared to the total EMS calls in 2016-2019.

We investigated the potential mechanism underlying the association between individuals' perceived effectiveness of public health measures and positive attitudes towards the success of pandemic control during the COVID-19 pandemic, by examining the parallel mediating effects of three types of threat appraisals: concerns about contracting the virus, perceived impact of the pandemic on life and estimated duration of the pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In February 2020 when the COVID-19 infection was spreading rapidly in China, a large cross-sectional survey was conducted among 132 054 adults from the 16 districts in Shanghai, China. OUTCOME MEASURES: Perceived effectiveness of the public health measures, positive attitudes towards the success of pandemic control and threat appraisals. RESULTS: Results of structural equation modelling supported the hypothesised mediation model: perceived effectiveness of public health measures was associated with lower levels of concerns about contracting the virus (?=-0.20), perceived impact of the pandemic (?=-0.13) and perceived duration of the pandemic (?=-0.20), which were then associated with higher levels of positive attitudes towards the success of pandemic control (?s=-0.12 to -0.25).

We included studies of ribavirin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, umifenovir (arbidol), favipravir, interferon and lopinavir/ritonavir. If direct evidence from COVID-19 studies was not available, we included indirect evidence from studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) for efficacy outcomes and other acute respiratory viral infections for safety outcomes. RESULTS In patients with nonsevere COVID-19 illness, the death rate was extremely low, precluding an important effect on mortality. We found only very low-quality evidence with little or no suggestion of benefit for most treatments and outcomes in both nonsevere and severe COVID-19. An exception was treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, for which we found low-quality evidence for a decrease in length of stay in the intensive care unit (risk difference 5 d shorter, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0 to 9 d) and hospital stay (risk difference 1 d shorter, 95% CI 0 to 2 d).

After 7 days, in the presence of Lyosecretome, more frequent and complex cellular processes forming bridges across the porous surface of the scaffold were revealed. Also, after 14 and 28 days of culturing in osteogenic medium, the amount of mineralized matrix detected by alizarin red was significantly higher when Lyosecretome was used. Finally, improved osteogenesis with Lyosecretome was confirmed by confocal analysis after 28 and 56 days of treatment, and demonstrating the production by osteoblast-differentiated MSCs of osteocalcin, a specific bone matrix protein.","output":"Freeze-Dried Secretome (Lyosecretome) from Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells Promotes the Osteoinductive and Osteoconductive Properties of Titanium Cages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is influencing our lives in an enormous and unprecedented way.

RECENT FINDINGS: Due to the heterogeneity between patients, management of COVID-19 requires daily monitoring of and/or aeration and inspiratory effort. Electrical impedance tomography can be used to optimize positive end-expiratory pressure, monitor the response to changes in treatment or body position and assess pulmonary perfusion and ventilation/perfusion matching. Lung ultrasound is more readily available and can be used to measure and monitor recruitment, provide an indication of diaphragm function and pulmonary perfusion disturbances. Esophageal pressure measurements enable the calculation of the transpulmonary pressure and inspiratory effort in order to prevent excessive stress on the lung. While esophageal pressure measurements are the golden standard in determining inspiratory effort, alternatives like P(0.1), negative pressure swing during a single airway occlusion and change in central venous pressure are more readily available and capable of diagnosing extreme inspiratory efforts.

Unfortunately, MPIs risk analysis combines several estimates that are biased, and the biases consistently act together to underestimate the level of bycatch and overestimate the species ability to sustain impacts. In essence, the approach uses abundance estimates that are likely biased high, multiplies them by a reproductive rate that has been arbitrarily raised, multiplied by an assumed figure for calf survival, to reach a number of dolphins that would be added each year if the population were to remain stable. From this number, they subtract their estimates of bycatch, which are almost certainly biased low. The remaining number of dolphins is apportioned a cause of death according to autopsy data from 55 Hectors and Maui dolphins found dead on beaches. This is then compared to estimates of what level of takes would be sustainable, calculated using a formula that is not well understood and less conservative than the international standard (PBR, developed by the US National Marine Fisheries Service). This is a poor basis for rational management of an endangered, endemic marine mammal. A key problem with the MPI approach is that its definition of risk does not relate to the risk of population decline or extinction, and is inconsistent with the modern understanding of the behaviour of meta-populations. The approach defines risk as the likelihood of capture, which is apportioned to different areas according to fishing effort and the habitat models outputs for dolphin distribution. The protection options are therefore targeted where high densities of dolphins and high fishing effort coincide. Large populations are allocated the highest level of protection, while small populations remain poorly protected. This approach is likely to increase the risk of local extinctions, contractions of dolphin distribution, population fragmentation, loss of genetic variability and result in increased risk to the species as a whole. Many of these points were made by an International Expert Panel in 2018. MPI have failed to provide a list of recommendations from the Expert Panel Report with their responses (if any) to those recommendations.

Lung ultrasound is well suited to this interstitial, subpleural involvement, and it is now broadly used in intensive care units (ICUs). The extension and severity of lung infiltrates can be described numerically with a reproducible and validated lung ultrasound score (LUSS). We hypothesized that LUSS might be useful as a tool to non-invasively monitor the evolution of COVID-19 pneumonia at the bedside. LUSS monitoring was rapidly implemented in the management of our COVID-19 patients with RT-PCR-documented COVID-19. The LUSS was evaluated repeatedly at the bedside. We present a graphic description of the course of LUSS during COVID-19 in 10 consecutive patients admitted in our intensive care unit with moderate to severe ARDS between March 15 and 30th. LUSS appeared to be closely related to the disease progression. In successfully extubated patients, LUSS decreased and was lower than at the time of intubation. LUSS increased inexorably in a patient who died from refractory hypoxemia. LUSS helped with the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), showing an increased score and the presence of new lung consolidations in all 5 patients with VAPs. There was also a good agreement between CT-scans and LUSS as for the presence of lung consolidations. In conclusion, our early experience suggests that LUSS monitoring accurately reflect disease progression and indicates potential usefulness for the management of COVID-19 patients with ARDS. It might help with early VAP diagnosis, mechanical ventilation weaning management, and potentially reduce the need for X-ray and CT exams. LUSS evaluation is easy to use and readily available in ICUs throughout the world, and might be a safe, cheap and simple tool to optimize critically ill COVID-19 patients care during the pandemic.","output":"Lung ultrasound score to monitor COVID-19 pneumonia progression in patients with ARDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aims Artificial Intelligence (AI) shows extensive capabilities to impact different healthcare areas during the COVID-19 pandemic positively This paper tries to assess the capabilities of AI in the field of cardiology during the COVID-19 pandemic This technology is useful to provide advanced technology-based treatment in cardiology as it can help analyse and measure the functioning of the human heart Methods We have studied a good number of research papers on Artificial Intelligence on cardiology during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify its significant benefits, applications, and future scope AI uses artificial neuronal networks (ANN) to predict In cardiology, it is used to predict the survival of a COVID-19 patient from heart failure Results","output":"Applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for cardiology during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sudden cardiac arrest is one of the leading causes of death globally.

METHODS: In thisretrospective, multicenter study, the medical records of elderly patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Hunan province, China, from January 21 to February 19, 2020 were reviewed. The characteristics of young-old patients and old-old patients were compared. RESULTS: Of the 105 elderly patientsconfirmed withCOVID-19, 81.0% were young-old patients, and 19.0% were old-old patients; 54.3% of elderly patients were females. Overall, 69.5% of elderly patients had underlying diseases, and the most common comorbidities included hypertension (43.8%), diabetes (25.7%), and cardiac disease (16.2%). Of the elderly patients, 22.9% were severe and 10.5% were critical severe cases. On admission, the most frequent symptoms in elderly patients included fever (66.7%), cough (64.8%), and fatigue (33.3%). Lymphopenia (31.4%), increased D-dimer (38.1%), depressed albumin (36.2%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (41.0%), and a high level of C-reactive protein (79.0%) were common among elderly patients with COVID-19. The median prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were longer in old-old patients than young-old patients (PT median 12.3 vs. 13.1 s, p = 0.007; APTT median 39.0 vs. 33.5 s, p = 0.045).

However, variability in specimen quality can alter the Ct values obtained from SARS-CoV-2 clinical assays. We sought to define how variable nasopharyngeal (NP) swab quality impacts clinical SARS-CoV-2 test sensitivity. METHODS: We performed amplification of a human gene target (-actin) in parallel with a clinical RT-PCR targeting the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gene for 1282 NP specimens collected from patients with clinical concern for COVID-19. We evaluated the relationship between NP specimen quality, characterized by late Ct values for the human gene target -actin Ct, and the probability of SARS-CoV-2 detection via logistic regression, as well as the linear relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and -actin Ct. RESULTS: Low quality NP swabs are less likely to detect SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio 0.607, 95%CI 0.487 to 0.753). We observed a positive linear relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and -actin Ct values (slope 0.181, 95%CI 0.097 to 0.264), consistent with a reduction in detection of 0.181 cycles for each additional cycle of the -actin target. COVID-19 disease severity was not associated with -actin Ct values. CONCLUSIONS: Variability in NP specimen quality significantly impacts the performance of clinical SARS-CoV-2 assays, and caution should be taken when interpreting quantitative SARS-CoV-2 Ct results.

Activated macrophages have been shown to produce itaconate, suggesting that these immune cells may employ this metabolite as a weapon against invading bacteria. Here we demonstrate that, in vitro, itaconate can exhibit bactericidal effects under acidic conditions similar to the pH of a macrophage phagosome. In parallel, successful pathogens including Salmonella have acquired a genetic operon encoding itaconate degradation proteins, which are induced heavily in macrophages. We characterize the regulation of this operon by the neighbouring gene, ripR, in specific response to itaconate. Moreover, we develop an itaconate biosensor based on the operon promoter that can detect itaconate in a semi-quantitative manner and, when combined with the ripR gene, is sufficient for itaconate-regulated expression in E. coli. Using this biosensor with fluorescence microscopy, we observe bacteria responding to itaconate in the phagosomes of macrophage and provide additional evidence that interferon- stimulates macrophage itaconate synthesis and that J774 mouse macrophages produce substantially more itaconate than the human THP-1 monocyte cell line. In summary, we examine the role of itaconate as an antibacterial metabolite in mouse and human macrophage, characterize the regulation of Salmonellas defense against it, and develop it as a convenient itaconate biosensor and inducible promoter system. Importance In response to invading bacteria, immune cells can produce a molecule called itaconate, which can inhibit microbial metabolism. Here we show that itaconate can also directly kill Salmonella when combined with moderate acidity, further supporting itaconates role as an antibacterial weapon. We also discover how Salmonella recognizes itaconate and activates a defense to degrade it, and we harness this response to make a biosensor that detects the presence of itaconate. This biosensor is versatile, working in Salmonella enterica or lab strains of Escherichia coli, and can detect itaconate quantitatively in the environment and in immune cells.

Both pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of polymer-complexed siRNA were dominated by the polymer. PEGylated polymers and their siRNA polyplexes showed significantly less uptake into liver (13.6-19.7% ID of PEGylated polymer and 9.5-10.2% ID of siRNA) and spleen compared to PEI 25 kDa (liver deposition: 36.2% ID of polymer and 14.6% ID of siRNA). With non-invasive imaging methods we were able to predict both kinetics and deposition in living animals allowing the investigation of organ distribution in real time and at different time points. FFS measurements proved stability of the applied polyplexes under in vivo conditions which explained the different behavior of complexed from free siRNA. Despite their stability in circulation, we observed that polyplexes dissociated upon liver passage. Therefore, siRNA/(PEG-)PEI delivery systems are not suitable for systemic administration, but instead may be useful when the first-pass effect is circumvented, which is the case in local application.","output":"Stability of siRNA polyplexes from poly(ethylenimine) and poly(ethylenimine)-g-poly(ethylene glycol) under in vivo conditions: effects on pharmacokinetics and biodistribution measured by Fluorescence Fluctuation Spectroscopy and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) imaging."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an unprecedented pandemic posing major threat to global public health. In the past decades of years or so, one could have heard of how dangerous it is to be virtually reliant on medicine supply from other countries. Nonetheless, no action was taken because it seemed to many that the global trade system was operational and Nigerians as well as citizens of African countries appear to have sufficient supply of the medications required at quite appealing cost. Currently in 2020, this apprehension has revolved from an imaginary problem to an actual challenge that might have consequences for millions nationwide due to COVID-19 pandemic. Now, African countries can realize that putting all our eggs in one basket was not such a good idea. In Nigeria, over 70% of the prescribed medications are produced from active ingredients (API) primarily sourced from firms in China and India. Access to medicine is an integral part of healthcare systems, uninterrupted access to medicine is much needed and essential for the well-being of the population.

Orthopaedic departments have been no exception to this and have needed to adapt to the changing circumstances by releasing resources and focusing on 'essential' activity. The aim of this study is to quantify the reduction in trauma and, in addition, describe any changes in the type of referrals to the trust which may have been affected by the pandemic itself and the social distancing measures employed by the UK government. METHODS: The study was performed in a UK District Hospital which is also a Trauma Unit providing trauma and orthopaedic care to a population of 625,000 people. The trust based electronic database of trauma referrals was used to compare the numbers of, and types of referral to our trauma service during the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding time periods in the previous 3 years. RESULTS: The mean number of referrals per week to the service reduced by 33% in the time period following the confirmation of the outbreak as a pandemic (p<0.0001). Number of operations performed per week reduced by 26% (p = 0.001). There was no change in the number of referrals relating to domestic abuse or non-accidental injury. In addition, numbers of hip fractures, periprosthetic fractures and prosthetic joint dislocations were unchanged. There was a significant reduction in the number of referrals for simple fractures, native joint dislocations, wounds and soft tissue injuries. Within the paediatric population, similarly, a reduction in simple fracture referrals was demonstrated. DISCUSSION: An association between the outbreak of the pandemic and a reduction in referral numbers to our department has been demonstrated. The direct cause of this may be multifactorial but proposing that it is, in part, due to the social distancing measures introduced by the government is certainly conceivable. The patterns of injury would reflect this also with low energy and fragility trauma persisting whilst injuries associated with younger people have reduced. We would suggest that information such as this could be useful in healthcare planning and resource allocation in future pandemic situations.","output":"Impact of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic on the workload of the orthopaedic service in a busy UK district general hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aminopeptidase (APN) was found to degrade interleukin\\\\8 (IL\\\\8) and inactivate its chemotactic activity.

Research has demonstrated the single-size Caya contoured diaphragm to be a safe and effective barrier method of nonhormonal, self-care contraception, offering features that improve upon the design of traditional diaphragms. No studies have measured continuation of Caya. In Niamey, Niger, this pilot introduction study explored Caya acceptability, use, and programmatic considerations. METHODS: Women in Niger participated in surveys (n=150) and in-depth interviews (n=25) 6 months after adopting Caya. In-depth interviews were also conducted with men in the community (n=15) and family planning providers (n=15). We conducted descriptive analysis of the percentage of adopters who continued to use the method at 6 months and womens reasons for discontinuation among women who completed the 6-month follow-up survey. We used deductive thematic analysis of in-depth interview data from women, men, and providers to understand program elements and other factors associated with acceptability. RESULTS: Six months after initiation, 76.7% (95% confidence interval=0.70, 0.83) of 150 survey respondents reported continued use of Caya. Top reasons for use included: Caya causes no side effects for most users, works on demand, and is reusable for up to 2 years. Roughly one-quarter of women interviewed reported inconsistent use. Some men supported their partners use; in other cases, women used Caya without informing or involving their partners. Providers described Caya as compatible with the needs of many women and credited pelvic models with enabling effective counseling. DISCUSSION: The Caya diaphragm has the potential to be a valuable addition to the range of contraceptive options, especially in settings with high levels of opposition to other modern methods.","output":"A New Contraceptive Diaphragm in Niamey, Niger: A Mixed Methods Study on Acceptability, Use, and Programmatic Considerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Intussusception refers to the telescoping of a segment of bowel into the lumen of an adjacent segment. While pediatric intussusception is common and generally idiopathic, adult intussusception is exceedingly rare and is usually attributable to a pathologic lead point.

Intraoperatively, the lead point was found to be congenital bands, and there was no evidence of underlying malignancy. He underwent a laparoscopic-assisted extended right hemicolectomy with side-to-side ileo-colic anastomosis. DISCUSSION Colo-colonic intussusception is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction in adults. Patients generally present with subacute abdominal pain and obstructive symptoms, rendering the clinical diagnosis challenging. Computed tomography has been shown to be the most accurate diagnostic imaging modality. Due to the high incidence of underlying malignancy in adult colo-colonic intussusception, en-bloc resection of the involved bowel segment remains the standard of care.

Most are treated with statins, but the impact of these drugs on clinical outcomes of COVID-19 remains unclear. This report is therefore based on meta-analyses of retrospective observational studies aimed at investigating the impact of previous statin therapy in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. METHODS: In studies reporting on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in statin users vs non-users, two endpoints have been used-in-hospital death rates, and disease severity as assessed by admission to intensive care units (ICUs)-with a special focus on patients with diabetes. RESULTS: Regarding mortality, 13 studies were included in the meta-analysis for a total of 10,829 statin users (2517 deaths) and 31,893 non-users (7516 deaths): univariate analysis showed no statistically significant reduction in deaths (OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.92-1.03), although between-study heterogeneity was high (I2 = 97%). As for disease severity, 11 studies were selected for a total of 3462 statin users (724 endpoints) and 10,560 non-users (1763 endpoints): here again, univariate analysis showed no reduction in severity (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.99-1.22; I2 = 93%).

METHODS We analyzed information on cases reported by the Ministry of Health of Haiti and the World Health Organization (WHO). RESULTS Between 2009 and 2018, 232,479 malaria cases were reported by the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP); an increase in the incidence of malaria in the country in 2010, followed by a decrease in 2011, was primarily observed. Due to recent efforts to reduce malaria by 2020, its incidence declined from 60,130 cases in 2010 to 8,978 cases in 2018. Controversially, in terms of the number of reported cases, the MSPP and WHO report conflicting data. However, the results from both datasets present the same trend in Haiti from 2009 to 2018. The results also illustrate the endemicity of the disease throughout Haiti, both in rural and urban areas, especially along the coast.

Decision support tools of risk stratification are needed to predict outcomes in patients with different clinical types of COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study recruited 2425 patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. A logistic regression model was used to select and estimate the factors independently associated with outcomes. Simplified risk stratification score systems were constructed to predict outcomes in moderate and severe patients with COVID-19, and their performances were evaluated by discrimination and calibration. RESULTS: We constructed two risk stratification score systems, named as STPCAL (including significant factors in the prediction model: number of clinical symptoms, the maximum body temperature during hospitalization, platelet count, C-reactive protein, albumin and lactate dehydrogenase) and TRPNCLP (including maximum body temperature during hospitalization, history of respiratory diseases, platelet count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and prothrombin time), to predict hospitalization duration for moderate patients and disease progression for severe patients, respectively. According to STPCAL score, moderate patients were classified into three risk categories for a longer hospital duration: low (Score 0-1, median = 8 days, with less than 20.0% probabilities), intermediate (Score 2-6, median = 13 days, with 30.0-78.9% probabilities), high (Score 7-9, median = 19 days, with more than 86.5% probabilities). Severe patients were stratified into three risk categories for disease progression: low risk (Score 0-5, with less than 12.7% probabilities), intermediate risk (Score 6-11, with 18.6-69.1% probabilities), and high risk (Score 12-16, with more than 77.9% probabilities) by TRPNCLP score. The two risk scores performed well with good discrimination and calibration. CONCLUSIONS: Two easy-to-use risk stratification score systems were built to predict the outcomes in COVID-19 patients with different clinical types.

Considering that the traditional SpO(2) measurement has a certain error due to the number of wavelengths and the algorithm and the wider application of machine learning and spectrum combination, we propose to use 12-wavelength spectral absorption measurement to improve the accuracy of SpO(2) measurement. To investigate the multiple spectral regions for deep learning for SpO(2) measurement, three datasets for training and verification were built, which were constructed over the spectra of first region, second region, and full region and their sub-regions, respectively. For each region under the procedures of optimization of our model, a thorough of investigation of hyperparameters is proceeded. Additionally, data augmentation is preformed to expand dataset with added noise randomly, increasing the diversity of data and improving the generalization of the neural network. After that, the established dataset is input to a one dimensional convolution neural network (1D-CNN) to obtain a measurement model of SpO(2). In order to enhance the model accuracy, GridSearchCV and Bayesian optimization are applied to optimize the hyperparameters. The optimal accuracies of proposed model optimized by GridSearchCV and Bayesian Optimization is 89.3% and 99.4%, respectively, and trained with the dataset at the spectral region of six wavelengths including 650 nm, 680 nm, 730 nm, 760 nm, 810 nm, 860 nm. The total relative error of the best model is only 0.46%, optimized by Bayesian optimization. Although the spectral measurement with more features can improve the resolution ability of the neural network, the results reveal that the training with the dataset of the shorter six wavelength is redundant. This analysis shows that it is very important to construct an effective 1D-CNN model area for spectral measurement using the appropriate spectral ranges and number of wavelengths.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the daily operations of the stomatology department, and provide some help for dental healthcare personnel around the world in continuing to provide exemplary care while limiting the spread of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analyses were performed on dental patients medical records from the stomatology department of the First People's Hospital of Yichang, China, which were collected from pre-epidemic, epidemic, and post-epidemic periods respectively. Hospital-wide triage and stomatology department-specific protocols were taken in our hospital to prevent cross-infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The number of patients decreased and proportion of emergency cases increased during the epidemic period. With prevention protocols in place, the number of dental patients was back to normal range with a slight elevation during the post-epidemic period. Thus far, there has not been a single documented case of COVID-19 related to dental treatments reported in our hospital. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has a major impact on people's habits of seeking dentalcare services. Effective prevention and control measures including three levels of protection, zoning, instrumentation, and environmental disinfection are much needed for dental settings to provide care.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on Dentistry in Yichang, China and Protective Suggestions for Normalization of Epidemic Prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic urgently requires the availability of interventions that improve outcomes for those with severe disease Since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection is characterized by dysregulated lung mucosae, and that mucosal homeostasis is heavily influenced by interleukin (IL)-13 activity, we explore recent findings indicating that IL-13 production is proportional to disease severity We propose that excessive IL-13 contributes to the progression of severe/fatal COVID-19 by (1) promoting the recruitment of immune cells that express inflammatory cytokines, causing a cytokine storm that results in widespread destruction of lung tissue, (2) directly facilitating tissue-remodeling that causes airway hyperinflammation and obstruction, and (3) diverting the immune system away from developing high-quality cytotoxic T cells that confer effective anti-viral immunity These factors may cumulatively result in significant lung distress, multi-organ failure, and death Here, we suggest repurposing existing IL-13-inhibiting interventions, including antibody therapies routinely used for allergic lung hyperinflammation, as well as viral vector-based approaches, to alleviate disease Since many of these strategies have previously been shown to be both safe and effective, this could prove to be a highly cost-effective solution Relevance for Patients: There remains a desperate need to establish medical interventions that reliably improves outcomes for patients suffering from COVID-19 We explore the role of IL-13 in maintaining homeostasis at the lung mucosae and propose that its dysregulation during viral infection may propagate the hallmarks of severe disease - further exploration may provide a platform for invaluable therapeutics","output":"Interleukin-13 as a target to alleviate severe coronavirus disease 2019 and restore lung homeostasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Domestic violence and abuse (DVA) is highly prevalent, with severe adverse consequences to the health and well-being of survivors. There is a smaller evidence base on the health of DVA perpetrators and their engagement with healthcare services. This review examines the experiences of perpetrators of DVA of accessing healthcare services and the barriers and facilitators to their disclosure of abusive behaviours in these settings. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative studies. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was conducted in Cochrane, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, HMIC, BNID, CINAHL, ASSIA, IBSS, SSCI (peer-reviewed literature) and NDLTD, OpenGrey and SCIE Online (grey literature). Each database was searched from its start date to 15 March 2020. Eligibility criteria required that studies used qualitative or mixed methods to report on the experiences of healthcare use by perpetrators of DVA. A meta-ethnographic method was used to analyse the extracted data. RESULTS: Of 30,663 papers identified, six studies (n=125 participants; 124 men, 1 woman) met the inclusion criteria. Barriers to disclosure of DVA to healthcare staff included perpetrators negative emotions and attitudes towards their abusive behaviours; fear of consequences of disclosure; and lack of trust in healthcare services ability to address DVA. Facilitators of disclosure of DVA and engagement with healthcare services were experiencing social consequences of abusive behaviours; feeling listened to by healthcare professionals; and offers of emotional and practical support for relationship problems by healthcare staff. CONCLUSIONS: DVA perpetration is a complex issue with multiple barriers to healthcare engagement and disclosure. However, healthcare services can create positive conditions for the engagement of individuals who perpetrate abuse.

We conducted a prospective analysis of serum 25(OH)D levels in relation to COVID-19 infection among participants in the Black Womens Health Study. METHODS: Since 1995, the Black Womens Health Study has followed 59,000 U.S. Black women through biennial mailed or online questionnaires. Over 13,000 study participants provided a blood sample in 2013C2017. 25(OH)D assays were performed in a certified national laboratory shortly after collection of the samples. In 2020, participants who had completed the online version of the 2019 biennial health questionnaire were invited to complete a supplemental online questionnaire assessing their experiences related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including whether they had been tested for COVID-19 infection and the result of the test. We used logistic regression analysis to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of 25(OH)D level with COVID-19 positivity, adjusting for age, number of people living in the household, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and other potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 5,081 eligible participants whose blood sample had been assayed for 25(OH)D, 1,974 reported having had a COVID-19 test in 2020.

Here, using published datasets, we show that the gene expression program associated with MS1 correlated with sepsis severity and was up-regulated in monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19. To examine the ontogeny and function of MS1 cells, we developed a cellular model for inducing CD14+ MS1 monocytes from healthy bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). We found that plasma from patients with bacterial sepsis or COVID-19 induced myelopoiesis in HSPCs in vitro and expression of the MS1 gene program in monocytes and neutrophils that differentiated from these HSPCs. Furthermore, we found that plasma concentrations of IL-6, and to a lesser extent IL-10, correlated with increased myeloid cell output from HSPCs in vitro and enhanced expression of the MS1 gene program. We validated the requirement for these two cytokines to induce the MS1 gene program through CRISPR-Cas9 editing of their receptors in HSPCs. Using this cellular model system, we demonstrated that induced MS1 cells were broadly immunosuppressive and showed decreased responsiveness to stimulation with a synthetic RNA analog.

In this work, a novel feature peculiar to overlapping coding regions is presented.

A computer scan of an additional set of virus sequences demonstrated that this feature is common to several other known overlapping ORFs and led to prediction of a novel overlapping gene in hepatitis G virus (HGV). The occurrence of a bifunctional coding region in HGV was also supported by its extremely lower rate of synonymous nucleotide substitutions compared to that observed in the other gene regions of the HGV genome.

METHODS A cross-sectional study design was employed using an online questionnaire. A total of 406 from 465 respondents were included in the final analysis. RESULTS It was found that 73.9% of respondents suffered from upper body part pain, 25.15% from low back pain, and 39.7% reported pain in the lower limb. Process Macro Model 4 analysis showed the significant role of well-being as a mediator in the association between work-life balance and the odds of experiencing the upper body and low back pains. However, neither the direct nor mediating effect on the relationship between job strain or job security and any musculoskeletal pains were observed. These findings suggest that specific psychosocial factors may be more relevant to be investigated in the particular context.

We observed a correlation between anti-spike (S) immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, length of hospitalization and clinical parameters associated with worse clinical progression. Although high anti-S IgG levels correlated with worse disease severity, such correlation was time dependent. Deceased patients did not have higher overall humoral response than discharged patients. However, they mounted a robust, yet delayed, response, measured by anti-S, anti-receptor-binding domain IgG and neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels compared to survivors. Delayed seroconversion kinetics correlated with impaired viral control in deceased patients. Finally, although sera from 85% of patients displayed some neutralization capacity during their disease course, NAb generation before 14 d of disease onset emerged as a key factor for recovery.

One way to model such a system, in order to improve preparedness, and learn more about how an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, might spread through a population, is agent-based epidemiological modelling. When a pandemic is caused by an emerging disease, it takes time to develop a completely new model that captures the complexity of the system. In this paper, we discuss adapting an existing agent-based model for the spread of measles in Ireland to simulate the spread of COVID-19. The model already captures the population structure and commuting patterns of the Irish population, and therefore, once adapted to COVID-19, it can provide important insight on the pandemic, specifically in Ireland. We first investigate the different disease parameters that need to be adjusted to simulate the spread of COVID-19 instead of measles and then run a set of experiments initially comparing the model output for our original measles model with that from the adjusted COVID-19 model. We then report on experiments on how the different values of the basic reproductive number, R0, influence the simulated outbreaks, and find that our model behaves as expected: the higher the R0, the more agents are infected. Then, we demonstrate how different intervention strategies, such as vaccinations and school closures, influence the spread of measles and COVID-19 and how we can simulate real pandemic timings and interventions in our model. We show that with the same society, environment and transportation components among the different disease components lead to very different results for the two diseases, and that our COVID-19 model, when run for Leitrim County, Ireland, predicts a similar outbreak length to a real outbreak in Leitrim County, Ireland, but the model results in a higher number of infected agents compared to the real outbreak. This difference in cases is most likely due to identifying all cases of COVID-19 in the model opposed to only those tested. Once an agent-based model is created to simulate a specific complex system or society, the disease component can be adapted to simulate different infectious disease outbreaks. This makes agent-based models a powerful tool that can be used to help understand the spread of new and emerging infectious diseases.","output":"Adapting an Agent-Based Model of Infectious Disease Spread in an Irish County to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, the world knew many challenges concerning the propagation of infectious diseases such as avian influenza, Ebola, SARS-CoV-2, etc. These epidemics caused a change in the healthy balance of humanity.

An estimated 9,603 children with elevated BLL were missed because of decreased BLL testing. Despite geographic variability, all health departments reported fewer children tested for BLL after the national COVID-19 emergency declaration (March-May 2020). In addition, health departments reported difficulty conducting medical follow-up and environmental investigations for children with elevated BLLs because of staffing shortages and constraints on home visits associated with the pandemic. Providers and public health agencies need to take action to ensure that children who missed their scheduled blood lead screening test, or who required follow-up on an earlier high BLL, be tested as soon as possible and receive appropriate care.","output":"Decreases in Young Children Who Received Blood Lead Level Testing During COVID-19  34 Jurisdictions, JanuaryCMay 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Across disciplines, people attend conferences in part to build connections with new ties and to reinforce connections with existing ties--but conference travel comes at a high cost in terms of time, money, and carbon.

Thus, TED2020 offered an opportunity to examine whether attending a virtual conference can promote feelings of social connection. Our findings provide the first evidence that actively participating in a virtual conference may be linked to enhanced feelings of social connection, particularly with new ties. Over the course of the conference, TED attendees exhibited rising levels of connection to new ties, whereas feelings of connection to existing ties remained unchanged.

The intensity and the diversity of the vectors used (plane, helicopter, train, ambulance), during this wave of medical evacuations make it an unprecedented event. The aim of TRANSCOV is to examine the impact of long distance transfers on patient's health and to understand how actors collaborated to overcome clinical and logistical challenges. METHODS: TRANSCOV is made of three disciplinary components: 1) interviews with clinicians and health authorities staff involved in the organisation and realisation of the transfers as part of the qualitative component; 2) a retrospective cohort collecting clinical parameters and pathway details before during and after transfer; 3) a collection of data regarding human and logistical resources mobilised during transfers as part of an economical evaluation. RESULTS: Preliminary results indicate that prior experience in medical evacuations proved useful to collaborate effectively in the exceptional circumstances prevailing in spring 2020. Clinicians had to establish quickly eligibility criteria for transfer. Actors' opinions may vary on the appropriateness of vectors to transfer isolated (e.g. via helicopter) or grouped (train) patients. Early epidemiological data suggest that transferred patients were younger and experienced comparable, if not lower, in-hospital mortality compared to other patients. The economic evaluation is in progress. CONCLUSIONS: Initial results indicate that effective collaborations led to the selection of clinically eligible patients and the realisation of safe distant transfers.

It is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with significant mortality and morbidity rate. The severe risk factors are commonly detected in patients of older age and with medical comorbidities like cancer and diabetes. Scientists and doctors have scrambled to gain knowledge about the novel virus and its pathophysiology in order to discover possible therapeutic regimens and vaccines for COVID-19. The therapeutic strategies like targeting the viral genome emphasize the promising approach to target COVID-19. Additionally, blocking the receptor, ACE2 via the neutralizing antibodies for viral escape that prevents it from entering into the cells provides another therapeutic regimen. In this review article, we have presented the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in comorbid patients and discussed organ failure caused by this virus. Based on the data available from the scientific literature and ongoing clinical trials, we have focused on therapeutic strategies. We hope that we would fill the gaps that puzzled the researchers and clinicians with the best of our knowledge collected for the betterment of the patients for the coming future.","output":"Understanding novel COVID-19: its impact on organ failure and risk assessment for diabetic and cancer patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article offers information on the economic and public health challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic in the U S along with role of the veterinary profession in the pandemic","output":"The role of the veterinary profession in the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading around the world and has attracted extremely wide public attention. From the beginning of the outbreak to now, there have been many mathematical models proposed to describe the spread of the pandemic, and most of them are established with the assumption that people contact with each other in a homogeneous pattern. However, owing to the difference of individuals in reality, social contact is usually heterogeneous, and the models on homogeneous networks cannot accurately describe the outbreak. Thus, we propose a susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-removed (SAIR) model on social networks to describe the spread of COVID-19 and analyse the outbreak based on the epidemic data of Wuhan from January 24 to March 2. Then, according to the results of the simulations, we discover that the measures that can curb the spread of COVID-19 include increasing the recovery rate and the removed rate, cutting off connections between symptomatically infected individuals and their neighbours, and cutting off connections between hub nodes and their neighbours. The feasible measures proposed in the paper are in fair agreement with the measures that the government took to suppress the outbreak. Furthermore, effective measures should be carried out immediately, otherwise the pandemic would spread more rapidly and last longer. In addition, we use the epidemic data of Wuhan from January 24 to March 2 to analyse the outbreak in the city and explain why the number of the infected rose in the early stage of the outbreak though a total lockdown was implemented. Moreover, besides the above measures, a feasible way to curb the spread of COVID-19 is to reduce the density of social networks, such as restricting mobility and decreasing in-person social contacts. This work provides a series of effective measures, which can facilitate the selection of appropriate approaches for controlling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate its adverse impact on peoples livelihood, societies and economies.","output":"A new SAIR model on complex networks for analysing the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective management of the global pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (also known as COVID-19), resulted in the implementation of severe restrictions in movement and enforcement of social distancing measures. This study aimed to understand and characterize the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population and to identify risks and protective factors that predict changes in mental health status. In addition, the study investigated compliance with precautionary measures (PM) to halt the spread of the virus. The online anonymous survey collected information on sociodemographic data, compliance with PM, quality of life (QOL), and mental health via the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). A total of 1642 adult participants (71.6% women, 28.4% men) completed the survey in the European island country, Cyprus. A large percentage (48%) reported significant financial concerns and 66.7% significant changes in their QOL. About 41% reported symptoms associated with mild anxiety; 23.1% reported moderate-severe anxiety symptoms. Concerning depression, 48% reported mild and 9.2% moderate-severe depression symptoms. Women, younger age (18C29), student status, unemployment status, prior psychiatric history, and those reporting greater negative impact on their QOL, were at higher risk for increased anxiety and depression symptoms (p < 0.05). The youngest age group and males also reported lower levels of compliance with PM. Higher compliance with PM predicted lower depression scores (p < 0.001) but higher anxiety for measures related to personal hygiene. The results of this study provide important data on the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and QOL and identify a variety of personal and social determinants that serve as risks and protective factors.

The rapid identification of emerging viral strains, and/or genetic variants potentially associated with novel phenotypic features is one of the most important objectives of genomic surveillance of human pathogens and represents one of the first lines of defense for the control of their spread. During the COVID 19 pandemic, several taxonomic frameworks have been proposed for the classification of SARS-Cov-2 isolates. These systems, which are typically based on phylogenetic approaches, represent essential tools for epidemiological studies as well as contributing to the study of the origin of the outbreak. Here, we propose an alternative, reproducible, and transparent phenetic method to study changes in SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity over time. We suggest that our approach can complement other systems and facilitate the identification of biologically relevant variants in the viral genome. To demonstrate the validity of our approach, we present comparative genomic analyses of more than 175,000 genomes. Our method delineates 22 distinct SARS-CoV-2 haplogroups, which, based on the distribution of high-frequency genetic variants, fall into four major macrohaplogroups. We highlight biased spatiotemporal distributions of SARS-CoV-2 genetic profiles and show that seven of the 22 haplogroups (and of all of the four haplogroup clusters) showed a broad geographic distribution within China by the time the outbreak was widely recognized-suggesting early emergence and widespread cryptic circulation of the virus well before its isolation in January 2020. General patterns of genomic variability are remarkably similar within all major SARS-CoV-2 haplogroups, with UTRs consistently exhibiting the greatest variability, with s2m, a conserved secondary structure element of unknown function in the 3'-UTR of the viral genome showing evidence of a functional shift. Although several polymorphic sites that are specific to one or more haplogroups were predicted to be under positive or negative selection, overall our analyses suggest that the emergence of novel types is unlikely to be driven by convergent evolution and independent fixation of advantageous substitutions, or by selection of recombined strains. In the absence of extensive clinical metadata for most available genome sequences, and in the context of extensive geographic and temporal biases in the sampling, many questions regarding the evolution and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 isolates remain open. However, our data indicate that the approach outlined here can be usefully employed in the identification of candidate SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants of clinical and epidemiological importance.","output":"Comparative Genomics Reveals Early Emergence and Biased Spatiotemporal Distribution of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: It has been proposed that bilinguals language use patterns are differentially associated with executive control. To further examine this, the present study relates the social diversity of bilingual language use to performance on a color-shape switching task (CSST) in a group of bilingual university students with diverse linguistic backgrounds. Crucially, this study used language entropy as a measure of bilinguals language use patterns. This continuous measure reflects a spectrum of language use in a variety of social contexts, ranging from compartmentalized use to fully integrated use. METHODS: Language entropy for university and non-university contexts was calculated from questionnaire data on language use. Reaction times (RTs) were measured to calculate global RT and switching and mixing costs on the CSST, representing conflict monitoring, mental set shifting, and goal maintenance, respectively. In addition, this study innovatively recorded a potentially more sensitive measure of set shifting abilities, namely, pupil size during task performance. RESULTS: Higher university entropy was related to slower global RT. Neither university entropy nor non-university entropy were associated with switching costs as manifested in RTs. However, bilinguals with more compartmentalized language use in non-university contexts showed a larger difference in pupil dilation for switch trials in comparison with non-switch trials. Mixing costs in RTs were reduced for bilinguals with higher diversity of language use in non-university contexts. No such effects were found for university entropy. DISCUSSION: These results point to the social diversity of bilinguals language use as being associated with executive control, but the direction of the effects may depend on social context (university vs. non-university). Importantly, the results also suggest that some of these effects may only be detected by using more sensitive measures, such as pupil dilation. The paper discusses theoretical and practical implications regarding the language entropy measure and the cognitive effects of bilingual experiences more generally, as well as how methodological choices can advance our understanding of these effects.","output":"Language Entropy Relates to Behavioral and Pupil Indices of Executive Control in Young Adult Bilinguals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Anxiety and depression rates are at an all-time high Smartphone-based mental health chatbots can aid psychiatrists replacing some of the costly human based interaction providing a unique opportunity to expand the availability and quality of mental health intervention whilst providing an alternative approach to fill the much-needed self-care gap Objective Assess the quality and characteristics of chatbots for anxiety and depression available on Android and iOS systems Methods A search was performed in the App Store and Google Play Store following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol to identify existing chatbot apps for anxiety and depression Eligibility was assessed by two individuals based on predefined eligibility criteria Meta-data of the included chatbots and their characteristics were extracted from their description and post-installation by two reviewers Information on quality was assessed by following the mHONcode principles Results Only a handful (n=11) of chatbots were included from an initial search of 1000 that provide a substitute for human-human based interaction and clearly had a therapeutic human substitute goal in mind The majority of reviewed apps had a high number of downloads indicating their popularity The apps were also of a general high quality based on our assessment according to the mHONcode principles Conclusion The general popularity of apps reviewed, and results of our quality assessment indicate chatbots have a promising future within the realm of anxiety and depression Anxiety and depression chatbot apps have the potential to increase the capacity of mental health self-care providing much needed low-cost assistance to professionals","output":"A Review of Mobile Chatbot Apps for Anxiety and Depression and their Self-Care Features"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This decision analytical model describes several key epidemiological features of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Wenzhou, China.","output":"Epidemiological Assessment of Imported Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Cases in the Most Affected City Outside of Hubei Province, Wenzhou, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This review was commissioned by the World Health Organization and presents a summary of the latest research evidence on the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on people with diabetes (PWD). PURPOSE: To review the evidence regarding the extent to which PWD are at increased risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and/or of suffering its complications, including associated mortality. DATA SOURCES: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Embase, MEDLINE, and LitCOVID on 3 December 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Systematic reviews synthesizing data on PWD exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection, reporting data on confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, admission to hospital and/or to intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19, and death with COVID-19 were used. DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer appraised and extracted data; data were checked by a second. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data from 112 systematic reviews were narratively synthesized and displayed using effect direction plots. Reviews provided consistent evidence that diabetes is a risk factor for severe disease and death from COVID-19. Fewer data were available on ICU admission, but where available, these data also signaled increased risk. Within PWD, higher blood glucose levels both prior to and during COVID-19 illness were associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Type 1 diabetes was associated with worse outcomes than type 2 diabetes. There were no appropriate data for discerning whether diabetes was a risk factor for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection. LIMITATIONS: Due to the nature of the review questions, the majority of data contributing to included reviews come from retrospective observational studies. Reviews varied in the extent to which they assessed risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: There are no data on whether diabetes predisposes to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Data consistently show that diabetes increases risk of severe COVID-19.

When an algorithm requires making subsequent runs of a SAT-solver on a slightly changing input formula, it is usually beneficial to change the strategy, so that the algorithm only operates on a single instance of a SAT-solver. One way to do this is via a mechanism called assumptions, which allows to accumulate and reuse knowledge from one iteration to the next and, in consequence, the provided input formula need not to be rebuilt during computation. In this paper we propose an encoding of a Pseudo-Boolean goal function that is based on sorting networks and can be provided to a SAT-solver only once. Then, during an optimization process, different bounds on the value of the function can be given to the solver by appropriate sets of assumptions.

PATIENTS AND METHODES: According to the short-term prognosis, 81 COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups, one of worse prognosis (Group W) and the other of better prognosis (Group B). The slope of D-dimer linear regression during hospitalization (SLOPE) was calculated as an indicator of D-dimer daily continuous tendency. The SLOPE difference between Group W and Group B was compared. The difference between the discharge results and the 3-month follow-up results was also compared. COX regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between SLOPE and short-term prognosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: There were 16 patients in Group W and 65 patients in Group B. Group W had more critical proportion (pa< a0.0001), indicating that the symptoms of its patients were more severe during hospitalization. ARDS, the most visible cause of worse prognosis, accounted for up to 68.75%, and many symptoms merged and resulted in worse prognosis. The D-dimer levels of Group W not only were significantly higher (pa< a0.0001), but also showed an increasing trend. In addition, the D-dimer levels at discharge were significantly higher than those at follow-up (pa=a0.0261), and the mean difference was as high as 0.7474. SLOPE significantly correlated with the short-term prognosis of COVID-19 independently (RR: 1.687, 95% CI: 1.345-2.116, Pa< a0.0001). The worst prognosis occurred most likely during the first month after COVID-19 diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Our study found that D-dimer daily continuous tendency independently correlates with worse prognosis and can be used as an independent predictor of the short-term prognosis for COVID-19.","output":"D-dimer daily continuous tendency predicts the short-term prognosis for COVID-19 independently: A retrospective study from Northeast China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The relationship between vitamin D status and COVID-19-related clinical outcomes is controversial. Prior studies have been conducted in smaller, single-site, or homogeneous populations limiting adjustments for social determinants of health (race/ethnicity and poverty) common to both vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the dose-response relationship between continuous 25(OH)D and risk for COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality after adjusting for covariates associated with both vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. PATIENTS: Veteran patients receiving care in US Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) health care facilities with a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test and a blood 25(OH)D test between February 20, 2020, and November 8, 2020, followed for up to 60 days. MAIN MEASURES: Exposure was blood 25(OH)D concentration ascertained closest to and within 15 to 90 days preceding an index positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Co-primary study outcomes were COVID-19-related inpatient hospitalization requiring airborne, droplet, contact, or other isolation and mortality ascertained within 60 days of an index positive SARS-CoV-2 test. KEY RESULTS: Of 4,599 veterans with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, vitamin D deficiency (< 20 ng/mL) was identified in 665 (14.5%); 964 (21.0%) were hospitalized; and 340 (7.4%) died. After adjusting for all covariates, including race/ethnicity and poverty, there was a significant independent inverse dose-response relationship between increasing continuous 25(OH)D concentrations (from 15 to 60 ng/mL) and decreasing probability of COVID-19-related hospitalization (from 24.1 to 18.7%, p=0.009) and mortality (from 10.4 to 5.7%, p=0.001). In modeling 25(OH)D as a log-transformed continuous variable, the greatest risk for hospitalization and death was observed at lower 25(OH)D concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous blood 25(OH)D concentrations are independently associated with COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality in an inverse dose-response relationship in this large racially and ethnically diverse cohort of VA patients. Randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19-related outcomes.

Calnexin bound to most truncated mutants of S protein, and S protein bound to all mutants of calnexin. Pseudotyped virus carrying S protein (S-pseudovirus) produced by human cells that were treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) for calnexin expression (calnexin siRNA-treated cells) showed significantly lower infectivity than S-pseudoviruses produced by untreated and control siRNA-treated cells. S-pseudovirus produced by calnexin siRNA-treated cells contained S protein modified with N-glycan side chains differently from other two S proteins and consisted of two kinds of viral particles: those of normal density with little S protein and those of high density with abundant S protein. Treatment with peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), which removes all types of N-glycan side chains from glycoproteins, eliminated the infectivity of S-pseudovirus. S-pseudovirus and SARS-CoV produced in the presence of -glucosidase inhibitors, which disrupt the interaction between calnexin and its substrates, showed significantly lower infectivity than each virus produced in the absence of those compounds. In S-pseudovirus, the incorporation of S protein into viral particles was obviously inhibited. In SARS-CoV, viral production was obviously inhibited. These findings demonstrated that calnexin strictly monitors the maturation of S protein by its direct binding, resulting in conferring infectivity on SARS-CoV.","output":"Monitoring of S protein maturation in the endoplasmic reticulum by calnexin is important for the infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study was targeted at investigating the effects of long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1094 on breast cancer (BC) cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle and its related mechanism.

This study employs a novel remote qualitative research method in a conflict-affected setting to look at how some of the most at-risk internally displaced and host populations were impacted by COVID-19, what determined their responses, and how this affected their health and socio-economic vulnerability. METHODS: We conducted a remote qualitative study, using Katikati, a 1-to-1 conversation management and analysis platform using short message service (SMS) developed by Lark Systems with Africa's Voices Foundation (AVF), for semi-structured interviews over three months with participants in Mogadishu and Baidoa. We recruited a gender balanced cohort across age groups, and used an analytical framework on the social determinants of health for a narrative analysis on major themes discussed, triangulating data with existing peer-reviewed and grey literature. RESULTS: The remote research approach demonstrated efficacy in sustaining trusted and meaningful conversations for gathering qualitative data from hard-to-reach conflict-affected communities. The major themes discussed by the 35 participants included health, livelihoods and education. Two participants contracted the disease, while others reported family or community members affected by COVID-19. Almost all participants faced a loss of income and/or education, primarily as a result of the strict public health measures. Some of those who were heavily affected economically but did not directly experienced disease, denied the pandemic. Religion played an important role in participants' beliefs in protection against and salvation from the disease. As lockdowns were lifted in August 2020, many believed the pandemic to be over. CONCLUSIONS: While the official COVID-19 burden has remained relatively low in Somalia, the impact to people's daily lives, income and livelihoods due to public health responses, has been significant.

The formation of the covalent enzyme-inhibitor complex was then simulated using hybrid QM/MM free energy methods. After binding, the reaction mechanism was found to be composed of two steps: i) the activation of the catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) to form an ion pair and ii) a Michael addition where the attack of the Sg atom of Cys145 to the Cb atom of the inhibitor precedes the water-mediated proton transfer from His41 to the Ca atom. The microscopic description of protease inhibition by N3 obtained from our simulations is strongly supported by the excellent agreement between the estimated activation free energy and the value derived from kinetic experiments.

In particular, the solution focuses on analyzing valuable information and useful knowledge (e.g., distribution, frequency, patterns) of health-related states and characteristics in populations. Discovered information and knowledge helps users (e.g., researcher, civilian) to understand the disease better, and thus take an active role in fighting, controlling, and/or combating the disease. Evaluation of our solution on real-life data demonstrates its practicality in analyzing COVID-19 epidemiological data and revealing demographic relationships among COVID-19 cases. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Analyzing COVID-19 Epidemiological Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Several countries now have mandatory SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccination for healthcare workers (HCWs) or the general population. HCWs' views on this are largely unknown. Methods We administered an online questionnaire to 17891 United Kingdom (UK) HCWs in Spring 2021 as part of the United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes in Healthcare workers (UK-REACH) nationwide prospective cohort study. We categorised responses to a free-text question 'What should society do if people don't get vaccinated against COVID-19?' using content analysis. We collapsed categories into a binary variable: favours mandatory vaccination or not and used logistic regression to calculate its demographic predictors, and occupational, health and attitudinal predictors adjusted for demographics. Findings Of 5633 questionnaire respondents, 3235 answered the freetext question; 18% (n=578) of those favoured mandatory vaccination but the most frequent suggestion was education (32%, n=1047). Older HCWs, HCWs vaccinated against influenza (OR 1.48; 95%CI 1.10-1.99, vs none) and with more positive vaccination attitudes generally (OR 1.10; 95%CI 1.06-1.14) were more likely to favour mandatory vaccination (OR 1.26; 95%CI 1.17-1.37, per decade increase), whereas female HCWs (OR= 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.99, vs male), Black HCWs (OR= 0.48, 95%CI 0.26-0.87, vs White), those hesitant about COVID-19 vaccination (OR= 0.56; 95%CI 0.43-0.71, vs not hesitant), in an Allied Health Profession (OR 0.67; 95%CI 0.51-0.88, vs Medical), or who trusted their organisation (OR 0.78; 95%CI 0.63-0.96) were less likely to.

As the wealth of bioactivity data accumulates, it provides opportunities for the development of deep learning (DL) models with increasing predictive powers. Conventionally, such models were either limited to the use of very simplified representations of proteins or ineffective voxelization of their 3D structures. Herein, we present the development of the PSG-BAR (Protein Structure Graph -Binding Affinity Regression) approach that utilizes 3D structural information of the proteins along with 2D graph representations of ligands. The method also introduces attention scores to selectively weight protein regions that are most important for ligand binding. ResultsThe developed approach demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on several binding affinity benchmarking datasets. The attention-based pooling of protein graphs enables identification of surface residues as critical residues for protein-ligand binding. Finally, we validate our model predictions against an experimental assay on a viral main protease (Mpro)- the hallmark target of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

In addition to 1000-seed weight and number of primary and secondary branches/plant, the genotypes RH 1569 (line) and DRMR 2035 (tester) appeared to be the strongest general combiners for Sclerotinia stem rot resistance.

METHODS: A prospective, blinded, observational study was conducted in the emergency units of two tertiary hospitals. Participants were asked to identify scents in the pocket smell test (PST) and flavors in four different solutions in the gustatory dysfunction test (GDT). We assessed the level of agreement between objective findings and self-reported symptoms. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of chemosensory dysfunction for diagnosing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. RESULTS: Of 250 participants, 74 (29.6%) were SARS-CoV-2-positive. There was slight agreement between self-reported symptoms and objective findings (kappa = 0.13 and 0.10 for OD and GD, respectively). OD assessed by the PST was independently associated with COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio = 1.89, 95% confidence interval, 1.04C3.46). This association was stronger when OD was combined with objective GD, cough, and fever (adjusted odds ratio = 7.33, 95% confidence interval, 1.17C45.84).

Several promising drugs have been identified and are in various stages of clinical trials globally. If efficacy of these drugs is demonstrated, rapid, mass availability at an affordable cost would be essential to ensuring equity and access especially amongst low- and middle-income economies. METHODS: Minimum costs of production were estimated from the costs of active pharmaceutical ingredients using established methodology, which had good predictive accuracy for medicines for hepatitis C and HIV amongst others. Data were extracted from global export shipment records or analysis of the route of chemical synthesis. The estimated costs were compared with list prices from a range of countries where pricing data were available. RESULTS: Minimum estimated costs of production were US $0.93/day for remdesivir, $1.45/day for favipiravir, $0.08/day for hydroxychloroquine, $0.02/day for chloroquine, $0.10/day for azithromycin, $0.28/day for lopinavir/ritonavir, $0.39/day for sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and $1.09/day for pirfenidone. Costs of production ranged between $0.30 and $31 per treatment course (10C28 days). Current prices of these drugs were far higher than the costs of production, particularly in the US. CONCLUSIONS: Should repurposed drugs demonstrate efficacy against COVID-19, they could be manufactured profitably at very low costs, for much less than current list prices.

The metropolitan area of Milan, Italy, was one of the regions most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. Risk prediction models developed by combining administrative databases and basic clinical data are needed to stratify individual patient risk for public health purposes. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a stratification tool aimed at improving COVID-19 patient management and health care organization. METHODS: A predictive algorithm was developed and applied to 36,834 patients with COVID-19 in Italy between March 8 and the October 9, 2020, in order to foresee their risk of hospitalization. Exposures considered were age, sex, comorbidities, and symptoms associated with COVID-19 (eg, vomiting, cough, fever, diarrhea, myalgia, asthenia, headache, anosmia, ageusia, and dyspnea). The outcome was hospitalizations and emergency department admissions for COVID-19. Discrimination and calibration of the model were also assessed. RESULTS: The predictive model showed a good fit for predicting COVID-19 hospitalization (C-index 0.79) and a good overall prediction accuracy (Brier score 0.14). The model was well calibrated (intercept C0.0028, slope 0.9970). Based on these results, 118,804 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from October 25 to December 11, 2020, were stratified into low, medium, and high risk for COVID-19 severity. Among the overall study population, 67,030 (56.42%) were classified as low-risk patients; 43,886 (36.94%), as medium-risk patients; and 7888 (6.64%), as high-risk patients. In all, 89.37% (106,179/118,804) of the overall study population was being assisted at home, 9% (10,695/118,804) was hospitalized, and 1.62% (1930/118,804) died. Among those assisted at home, most people (63,983/106,179, 60.26%) were classified as low risk, whereas only 3.63% (3858/106,179) were classified at high risk. According to ordinal logistic regression, the odds ratio (OR) of being hospitalized or dead was 5.0 (95% CI 4.6-5.4) among high-risk patients and 2.7 (95% CI 2.6-2.9) among medium-risk patients, as compared to low-risk patients.

It also helps to lower the tissue damage during trauma and initiates the healing process. The pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play a crucial role in recognizing different PAMPs or MAMPs and DAMPs to initiate the pro-inflammatory immune response to clear them. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are first recognized PRRs and their discovery proved milestone in the field of immunology as it filled the gap between the first recognition of the pathogen by the immune system and the initiation of the appropriate immune response required to clear the infection by innate immune cells (macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells or DCs, and mast cells).

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: We recently reported that the fusion rate was relatively lower after CBT-PLIF than after TT-PLIF, although no significant difference was found and that compared with the carbon PEEK cage, the TP cage significantly reduced the incidence of vertebral endplate cysts (cyst signs) and slightly improved the early fusion rate at 1 year after CBT-PLIF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The subjects were 37 patients undergoing TT-PLIF using P cages (TT-P group), 24 patients undergoing CBT-PLIF using P cages (CBT-P group), 32 patients undergoing TT-PLIF using TP cages (TT-TP group), and 20 patients undergoing CBT-PLIF using TP cages (CBT-TP group). On multiplanar reconstruction computed tomography at 6 months after surgery, cyst signs were evaluated and classified into diffuse or local cysts. Early fusion status was assessed using both dynamic plain radiographs and multiplanar reconstruction computed tomography at 1-year postoperatively. RESULTS: The incidence of the diffuse cyst was 27.0% in the TT-P group, 29.2% in the CBT-P group, 25.0% in the TT-TP group and 25.0% in the CBT-TP group (P>0.05). The early fusion rate was 75.7% in the TT-P group, 75.0% in the CBT-P group, 71.9% in the TT-TP group and 75.0% in the CBT-TP group (P>0.05).

They often cause severe complications (disseminated zoster), leading to death when diagnoses and treatment are delayed. However, most commercial VZV diagnostic tests have low sensitivity, and the most sensitive tests are unevenly available worldwide. Here, we developed and validated a highly sensitive VZV diagnostic kit based on the chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) approach. VZV-glycoprotein E (gE) was used to develop a CLIA diagnostic approach for detecting VZV-specific IgA, IgG, and IgM. The kit was tested with 62 blood samples from 29 VZV-patients classified by standard ELISA into true-positive and equivocal groups and 453 blood samples from VZV-negative individuals. The diagnostic accuracy of the CLIA kit was evaluated by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The relationships of immunoglobulin-isotype levels between the two groups and with patient age ranges were analyzed. Overall, the developed CLIA-based diagnostic kit demonstrated the detection of VZV-specific immunoglobulin titers depending on sample dilution. From the ELISA-based true-positive patient samples, the diagnostic approach showed sensitivities of 95.2%, 95.2%, and 97.6% and specificities of 98.0%, 100%, and 98.9% for the detection of VZV-gE-specific IgA, IgG, and IgM, respectively. Combining IgM to IgG and IgA detection improved diagnostic accuracy. Comparative analyses on diagnosing patients with equivocal results displaying very low immunoglobulin titers revealed that the CLIA-based diagnostic approach is overall more sensitive than ELISA. In the presence of typical VZV symptoms, CLIA-based detection of high titer of IgM and low titer of IgA/IgG suggested the equivocal patients experienced primary VZV infection. Furthermore, while no difference in IgA/IgG level was found regarding patient age, IgM level was significantly higher in young adults. The CLIA approach-based detection kit for diagnosing VZV-gE-specific IgA, IgG, and IgM is simple, suitable for high-throughput routine analysis situations, and provides enhanced specificity compared to ELISA.","output":"Detection of Circulating VZV-Glycoprotein E-Specific Antibodies by Chemiluminescent Immunoassay (CLIA) for VaricellaCZoster Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic, we introduce a mathematical description of the impact of sociality in the spread of infectious diseases by integrating an epidemiological dynamic with a kinetic modeling of population-based contacts.

Explicit calculations show that the spread of the disease is closely related to the mean number of contacts, thus justifying the lockdown strategies assumed by governments to prevent them. Furthermore, the kinetic model allows to clarify how a selective control can be assumed to achieve a minimal lockdown strategy by only reducing individuals undergoing a very large number of daily contacts. This, in turns, could permit to maintain at best the economic activities which would seriously suffer from a total closure policy.

The setup entails observations modeled as stationary graph signals generated by local diffusion dynamics on the unknown network. Moreover, we may have a priori information on the presence or absence of a few edges as in the link prediction problem. The stationarity assumption implies that the observations' covariance matrix and the so-called graph shift operator (GSO -- a matrix encoding the graph topology) commute under mild requirements. This motivates formulating the topology inference task as an inverse problem, whereby one searches for a sparse GSO that is structurally admissible and approximately commutes with the observations' empirical covariance matrix. For streaming data said covariance can be updated recursively, and we show online proximal gradient iterations can be brought to bear to efficiently track the time-varying solution of the inverse problem with quantifiable guarantees.

With the increasing number of improved and discharged patients with COVID-19, the definition of an adequate follow-up strategy is needed. The purpose of this study was to assess whether lung ultrasound (LUS) is an effective indicator of subclinical residual lung damage in patients with COVID-19 who meet discharge criteria. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 70 consecutive patients with COVID-19 who had a prolonged hospitalization with inpatient rehabilitation between April 6 and May 22, 2020. All of the patients underwent an LUS evaluation at discharge. Data of patients with more severe disease during the acute phase (ie, required ventilatory support) were compared to those of patients with milder disease. RESULTS: Among the 70 patients with COVID-19 (22 women and 48 men; mean age  SD, 68  13 years), the LUS score before discharge was still frankly pathologic and higher in patients who had more severe disease during the acute phase compared to patients with milder disease (median [interquartile range], 8.0 [5.5-13.5] versus 2.0 [1.0-7.0]; P < .001), even when both categories met internationally defined discharge criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Lung ultrasound can identify the persistence of subclinical residual lung damage in patients with severe COVID-19 even if they meet discharge criteria. Considering the low cost, easy application, and lack of radiation exposure, LUS seems the ideal tool to be adopted in outpatient and primary care settings for the follow-up of patients with COVID-19.","output":"Lung Ultrasound in COVID-19 A Role Beyond the Acute Phase?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Latin America and Southern Africa, norms on violence against women have developed with ups and downs, not simply in reaction to global norms, but sometimes even preceding global norm diffusion or surpassing it in terms of scope, framing and binding character The classic global-to-local account with a single source of norm creation cannot capture these dynamics Including the regional level in a dynamic model of norm diffusion enables us to understand the changing contents of a norm and to acknowledge transregional agency We show (1) how norm contestation is an ongoing, multidirectional and polycentric process;(2) how the regional level opens up opportunities for feminists and femocrats;and (3) under which conditions regional norms can be both more progressive than global ones and more adapted to regional needs, and, in turn, are thus able to strengthen the ?global? norm","output":"Polycentricity and framing battles in the creation of regional norms on violence against women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resistance to respiratory disease in cattle requires host defense mechanisms that protect against pathogens which have evolved sophisticated strategies to evade them, including an altered function of pulmonary macrophages (Ms) or the induction of inflammatory responses that cause lung injury and sepsis.

For this purpose, pulmonary lesions were compared between co-infected calves and healthy animals inoculated only with BHV-1 through immunohistochemical (MAC387, TNF, IL-1, iNOS, COX-2 and Factor-VIII) and ultrastructural studies. Both groups of calves presented important vascular alterations produced by fibrin microthrombi and platelet aggregations within the blood vessels. These findings were earlier and more severe in the co-infected group, indicating that the concomitance of BVDV and BHV-1 in the lungs disrupts the pulmonary homeostasis by facilitating the establishment of an inflammatory and procoagulant environment modulated by inflammatory mediators released by pulmonary Ms. In this regard, the co-infected calves, in spite of presenting a greater number of IMs than single-infected group, show a significant decrease in iNOS expression coinciding with the presence of more coagulation lesions. Moreover, animals pre-inoculated with BVDV displayed an alteration in the response of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF and IL-1), which play a key role in activating the immune response, as well as in the local cell-mediated response.","output":"Pathogenic mechanisms implicated in the intravascular coagulation in the lungs of BVDV-infected calves challenged with BHV-1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among the pathways and mediators that may be dysregulated in COVID-19 infection, there are proinflammatory cytokines, lymphocyte apoptosis, and the coagulation cascade Venous and arterial thromboembolisms also are frequent in COVID-19 patients with the increased risk of some life-threatening complications such as pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke In this regard, overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1, and TNF- induce cytokine storms, increase the risk of clot formation, platelet activation, and multiorgan failure that may eventually lead to death among these patients Surface S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to its target transmembrane receptor, named as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2(, on various cells such as lymphocyte, alveolar cells, monocytes/macrophages, and platelets Notably, the activation of the coagulation cascade occurs through tissue factor (TF)/FVIIa-initiated hemostasis Accordingly, TF plays the major role in the activation of coagulation system during viral infection In viral infections, the related coagulopathy multiple factors such as inflammatory cytokines and viral specific TLRs are involved, which consequently induce TF expression aberrantly SARS-COV-2 may directly infect monocytes/ macrophages In addition, TF expression/release from these cells may play a critical role in the development of COVID-19 coagulopathy In this regard, the use of TF- VIIa complex inhibitor may reduce the cytokine storm and mortality among COVID-19 patients","output":"Coagulation abnormalities in SARS-CoV-2 infection: overexpression tissue factor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a vasculopathy resulting in recurrent vaso-occlusive crises leading to endothelial dysfunction, chronic end-organ damage, poor quality of life, early mortality and the major curative therapy to date is allogeneic stem cell transplantation (AlloSCT) (Talano/Cairo, EJH, 2015). Acute chest syndrome (ACS) can result in pulmonary hypertension and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with SCD (Gladwin et al, NEJM, 2008). ACS accounts for 25% of deaths (Vichinsky et al, Blood, 1997). Clinical definition of ACS is chest pain, fever, cough, dyspnea, and new pulmonary infiltrate on chest radiography. Defibrotide was approved in the US for the treatment of severe sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS) with renal or pulmonary dysfunction following HSCT (Cairo et al, BJH, 2020). Defibrotide primarily targets endothelium in microvascular beds and has anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulant activity, which can treat the underlying pathophysiology of ACS (Falanga et al, Leukemia, 2003 and Scallia et al, Clin Pharm, 1996 and Pescador et al, Vasc Pharm, 2013). Objective: To determine the safety and toxicity of defibrotide in children, adolescents, and young adults with SCD-associated ACS. Design/Methods: Patients with SCD aged 2 to 40 years meeting ACS criteria (at least two of the following: fever, chest pain, cough, dyspnea, tachypnea, pulmonary infiltrate on chest imaging, decreased oxygen saturation with or without supplemental oxygen requirements) and eligibility were enrolled within 72 hours of diagnosis after consent was obtained (NCT03805581). Baseline studies comprised of chest radiograph, CT chest angiogram, echocardiography with TRJ velocity and brachial artery reactivity, pulmonary function tests, and biomarkers (IFN-a and -g, TNF-a, IL-6, 8, and 10, sCD163, TSP-1, secretory phospholipase A(2), sVCAM-1, sTNFR1, Ang2, sTei-2, PAI-1, sICAM-1, sP-and sE-selectin, sPECAM-1, VEGF-A, C, D and sVEGFR1 and 2). Defibrotide was administered at 6.25mg/kg IV q6 hours and continued for 7 days or until time of discharge, whichever occurred earlier and patients were followed until day +30 following defibrotide. Dose limiting toxicities include Grade III/IV infusion/allergic reaction or hemorrhage probably or directly related to defibrotide. Results: We have enrolled thirteen patients aged 3 to 18 years with a gender ratio (M/F) of 4/9. Patients' genotypes are as follows: hemoglobin SS disease in nine patients, hemoglobin SC disease in two patients, and hemoglobin Sb0/+ thalassemia in two patients. Presenting symptoms included fever, chest pain, cough, dyspnea, tachypnea, pulmonary infiltrate on imaging, and hypoxia.Eight patients completed seven days of treatment, one patient received 6 days of treatment, three patients were discharged after three days of treatment, and one patient withdrew due to recurrent fevers unrelated to defibrotide. All but one patient had resolution of fevers prior to end of treatment. Patients required an average of 1.15 days of oxygen support, with one patient requiring high flow nasal cannula, and no patients required mechanical ventilation. There were no adverse events possibly, probably, or directly related to defibrotide. There was no evidence of hemorrhage in any patient despite four patients receiving concomitant ketorolac or ibuprofen. Of the eleven patients who had pulmonary infiltrates on imaging, eight were evaluated on day +30, two had complete resolution of infiltrate, five had improvements, and one had no change. Seven patients did not follow-up for echocardiography or pulmonary function testing and two of those patients were unable to be evaluated at day +30 due to COVID-19. Discussion: The preliminary data suggest defibrotide is safe and well tolerated in patients with SCD-related ACS. All patients at diagnosis have had baseline studies, which included biomarkers;however, only eight of the thirteen patients have completed all required observations due to poor compliance. After four patients were enrolled and three failed to follow-up, changes to appointment schedules were made with detailed information on all follow-ups.

The goal of the present study was to advance our understanding on this front. METHOD: We isolated and examined motor kinematics associated with the learning of a rapid aimed limb movement in a sample of 40 individuals (13-34 years of age) with ETPKU and a matched comparison group of 40 individuals without phenylketonuria (PKU). Indices of motor learning included overall movement duration as well as the relative proportion of movement time devoted to ballistic and corrective submovements. (Note that practice of motor movements in nonclinical populations is associated with, not only improvements in overall speed, but also reduction in the proportion of movement time devoted to corrective submovements relative to an initial ballistic submovement.) Results: A group-by-time interaction was found. With practice, the non-PKU group showed a significant reduction in the proportion of movement time devoted to the corrected (as compared to the ballistic) submovement. A similar change was not observed for the ETPKU group. In addition, within the ETPKU group, the rate of improvement in total movement duration was correlated with recent blood phenylalanine levels (an indicator of treatment adherence). CONCLUSIONS: Motor learning is adversely affected in individuals with ETPKU. Further investigation into the behavioral and neural mechanisms of motor learning in ETPKU will advance our understanding of the etiologic basis for this disruption as well as how it relates to the broader neurocognitive profile of ETPKU.

We analyzed big data to investigate whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers have any significant effect on the risk of COVID-19. Population-based cohort study was conducted based on the prescription data from nationwide health insurance records. METHODS: We investigated the 1,374,381 residents aged &#8805; 40 years living in Daegu, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, between February and March 2020. Prescriptions of antihypertensive medication during the year before the outbreak were extracted from the National Health Insurance Service registry. Medications were categorized by types and stratified by the medication possession ratios (MPRs) of antihypertensive medications after controlling for the potential confounders. The risk of COVID-19 was estimated using a difference in difference analysis. RESULTS: Females, older individuals, low-income earners, and recently hospitalized patients had a higher risk of infection. Patients with higher MPRs of antihypertensive medications had a consistently lower risk of COVID-19 than those with lower MPRs of antihypertensive medications and non-users. Among patients who showed complete compliance, there was a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 for those prescribed angiotensin II receptor blockers (relative risk [RR], 0.751; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.587-0.960) or calcium channel blockers (RR, 0.768; 95% CI, 0.601-0.980).

To evaluate the lung pathology in this life-threatening respiratory illness, we studied postmortem lung sections from 8 patients who died from SARS during the spring 2003 Singapore outbreak. The predominant pattern of lung injury in all 8 cases was diffuse alveolar damage. The histology varied according to the duration of illness. Cases of 10 or fewer days duration demonstrated acute-phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), airspace edema, and bronchiolar fibrin. Cases of more than 10 days duration exhibited organizing-phase DAD, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, multinucleated giant cells, and acute bronchopneumonia. In acute-phase DAD, pancytokeratin staining was positive in hyaline membranes along alveolar walls and highlighted the absence of pneumocytes. Multinucleated cells were shown to be both type II pneumocytes and macrophages by pancytokeratin, thyroid transcription factor-1, and CD68 staining. SARS-CoV RNA was identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 7 of 8 cases in fresh autopsy tissue and in 8 of 8 cases in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue, including the 1 negative case in fresh tissue.

A separate group of non-infected mice were given 1a?mL Tween 20, and served as a normal control group (NC). Extract and drug were dissolved in Tween 20 and administered orally once daily for 12 consecutive days. At the end of the treatment period, mice were anesthetized with chloroform and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Plasma was prepared from blood obtained from each mouse. Parameters evaluated at the end of the treatment period include parasitemia, red blood cell count, hematocrit, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), and interleukin-10 (IL-10).

Detection and mutation surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses require separate and complex workflows that rely on highly-specialized facilities, personnel, and reagents. To date, no method can rapidly diagnose multiple viral infections and determine variants in a high-throughput manner. Methods: We describe a method for multiplex isothermal amplification-based sequencing and real-time analysis of multiple viral genomes, termed NIRVANA. It can simultaneously detect SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, human adenovirus, and human coronavirus, and monitor mutations for up to 96 samples in real-time. Findings: NIRVANA showed high sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 in 70 clinical samples with a detection limit of 20 viral RNA copies per l of extracted nucleic acid. It also detected the influenza A co-infection in two samples. The variant analysis results of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples mirror the epidemiology of COVID-19. Additionally, NIRVANA could simultaneously detect SARS-CoV-2 and PMMoV (an omnipresent virus and water quality indicator) in municipal wastewater samples. Conclusions: NIRVANA provides high-confidence detection of both SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses and mutation surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 on the fly.

To maintain public trust in the digital society and to enable acceptable policy-making in the future, it is important to investigate peoples preferences for sharing digital health data. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to elicit the preferences of the public in different Northern European countries (the United Kingdom, Norway, Iceland, and Sweden) for sharing health information in different contexts. METHODS: Respondents in this discrete choice experiment completed several choice tasks, in which they were asked if data sharing in the described hypothetical situation was acceptable to them. Latent class logistic regression models were used to determine attribute-level estimates and heterogeneity in preferences. We calculated the relative importance of the attributes and the predicted acceptability for different contexts in which the data were shared from the estimates. RESULTS: In the final analysis, we used 37.83% (1967/5199) questionnaires. All attributes influenced the respondents willingness to share health information (P<.001). The most important attribute was whether the respondents were informed about their data being shared. The possibility of opting out from sharing data was preferred over the opportunity to consent (opt-in). Four classes were identified in the latent class model, and the average probabilities of belonging were 27% for class 1, 32% for class 2, 23% for class 3, and 18% for class 4. The uptake probability varied between 14% and 85%, depending on the least to most preferred combination of levels. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents from different countries have different preferences for sharing their health data regarding the value of a review process and the reason for their new use. Offering respondents information about the use of their data and the possibility to opt out is the most preferred governance mechanism.","output":"Preferences of the Public for Sharing Health Data: Discrete Choice Experiment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 but later spread to other parts of the world. The disease as at the point of writing this paper has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The application of mathematical models, artificial intelligence, big data, and similar methodologies are potential tools to predict the extent of the spread and effectiveness of containment strategies to stem the transmission of this disease. In societies with constrained data infrastructures, modeling and forecasting COVID-19 becomes an extremely difficult endeavor. Nonetheless, we propose an online forecasting mechanism that streams data from the Nigeria Center for Disease Control to update the parameters of an ensemble model which in turn provides updated COVID-19 forecasts every 24 hours. The ensemble combines an Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA), Prophet - an additive regression model developed by Facebook, and a Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing model combined with Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH). The outcomes of these efforts are expected to provide academic thrust in guiding the policymakers in the deployment of containment strategies and/or assessment of containment interventions in stemming the spread of the disease in Nigeria.","output":"Online Forecasting of Covid-19 Cases in Nigeria Using Limited Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has been declared a public health emergency of international concern; this has caused excessive anxiety among health care workers. In addition, publication bias and low-quality publications have become widespread, which can result in the dissemination of unreliable findings. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for a meta-analysis with the following two aims: (1) to examine the prevalence of anxiety among health care workers and determine whether it has increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) to investigate whether there has been an increase in publication bias. METHODS: All related studies that were published/released from 2015 to 2020 will be searched in electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, PsyArXiv, and medRxiv). The risk of bias in individual studies will be assessed using the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) checklist. The heterogeneity of the studies will be assessed using the I(2) statistic. The effect size (prevalence rates of anxiety) and a 95% CI for each paper will also be calculated. We will use a moderator analysis to test for the effect of COVID-19 on health care workers anxiety levels and detect publication bias in COVID-19 studies. We will also assess publication bias using the funnel plot and Egger regression. In case of publication bias, if studies have no homogeneity, the trim-and-fill procedure will be applied to adjust for missing studies. RESULTS: Database searches will commence in November 2020. The meta-analysis will be completed within 2 months of the start date. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis aims to provide comprehensive evidence about whether COVID-19 increases the prevalence of anxiety among health care workers and whether there has been an increase in publication bias and a deterioration in the quality of publications due to the pandemic. The results of this meta-analysis can provide evidence to help health managers to make informed decisions related to anxiety prevention in health care workers.

It involves exchanging healthcare or healthcare information digitally across large distances. This form of teaching has become more common due to significant advances in communication technology and increased access to the internet at more affordable costs. Isolated and poorly staffed areas are now able to access specialist review, mentorship, educational materials, and general support more efficiently than before. Typically, telemedicine is used to deliver didactic sessions and lectures and not skill sharing or training exercises. While ultrasonography is a skill typically taught at the bedside, we face a global pandemic where patient safety and standard operating procedures are prohibitive of this teaching model. Our team sought to have a practical session to determine whether practical skills can be taught through virtual training workshops as a way to mitigate these constraints. Practical stations were set up, with each station hosting an independent skill. The aim of the session was to introduce the topics to learners, to have learners visualize how the scans can be done with local setup and lastly perform these scans on volunteers to the satisfaction of the supervisors. Skills such as performing ocular ultrasound, gallbladder evaluation, and aortic aneurysm assessment were carried out on volunteers under a virtual supervisor's direction at all stations. The topics were chosen based on a previous needs assessment, and participants reported great satisfaction from the session. Ultrasound provides an excellent opportunity for virtual skill-based training, mentorship and trainee support. This commentary is directed at mostly low resource African countries with nascent Emergency Medicine programs. It also applies to organizations that support remote ultrasound skills training for emergency care providers and those that run emergency care outreach programs. These principles may also apply for other lower resource settings outside of Africa.","output":"Ultrasound virtual skills based workshop: An African experience in the COVID era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increasing number cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infections in the general population in Indonesia raises questions concerning the public's knowledge and attitudes regarding this pandemic.

This cross-sectional study was conducted between early March and the end of April 2020 in the general population of Indonesia, beginning with the North Sumatra region, where the spread of COVID-19 in Indonesia began. Questionnaires were randomly distributed online in the red zone in Indonesia. Data were collected by collecting people's responses to the questionnaire, which were distributed via WhatsApp (WA) application and were competed independently by the participants. A descriptive analysis was conducted to describe the demographic characteristics, knowledge, and attitudes of the general population. A total of 201 people had good knowledge (98%) and a positive attitude (96%) regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. The respondents had a negative attitude in relation to two aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak: having to always maintain a distance of 1.5 m when in crowds, and not being able to regularly exercise or eat nutritious food (78.6% and 79.1%, respectively). Most people in Indonesia have good knowledge and a positive attitude regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recordings were obtained during rest for both OFF and ON dopaminergic medication states. We analyzed the bilateral LFP channels that had the maximum beta power in the OFF state and the cortical sources that had the maximum coherence with the selected LFP channels in the alpha band. Our findings revealed the inherent nonlinearity in the PD data as subcortical high beta (20 - 30 Hz) band and cortical alpha (8 - 12 Hz) band activities. While the former was discernible without medication (p=0.015), the latter was induced upon the dopaminergic medication (p<6.10-4). The degree of subthalamic nonlinearity was correlated with contralateral tremor severity (r=0.45, p=0.02). Conversely, for the cortical signals nonlinearity was present for the ON medication state with a peak in the alpha band and correlated with contralateral akinesia and rigidity (r=0.46, p=0.02). This correlation appeared to be independent from that of alpha power and the two measures combined explained 34 % of the variance in contralateral akinesia scores.

This study aimed to determine the changes in whole transcriptome in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) in an animal model of PONV, to screen a drug candidate and to elucidate the molecular genetic mechanisms of PONV development. METHODS Twenty-one female musk shrews were assigned into three groups: the Surgery group (shrew PONV model, n = 9), the Sham group (n = 6), and the Na?ve group (n = 6). In behavioral studies, the main outcome was the number of emetic episodes. In genetic experiments, changes in the transcriptome in the NTS were measured. In a separate study, 12 shrews were used to verify the candidate mechanism underlying PONV. RESULTS A median of six emetic episodes occurred in both the Sham and Surgery groups. Whole-transcriptome analysis indicated the inhibition of the GABAB receptor-mediated signaling pathway in the PONV model.

We employed computational analysis and modeling to examine the feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges of enumerating active coronavirus infections locally and globally using WBE. Depending on local conditions, detection in community wastewater of one symptomatic/asymptomatic infected case per 100 to 2,000,000 non-infected people is theoretically feasible, with some practical successes now being reported from around the world. Computer simulations for past, present and emerging epidemic hotspots (e.g., Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, New York City, Teheran, Seattle, Detroit and New Orleans) identified temperature, average in-sewer travel time and per-capita water use as key variables. WBE surveillance of populations is shown to be orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than clinical screening, yet cannot fully replace it. Cost savings worldwide for one-time national surveillance campaigns are estimated to be in the million to billion US dollar range (US$), depending on a nation's population size and number of testing rounds conducted. For resource poor regions and nations, WBE may represent the only viable means of effective surveillance. Important limitations of WBE rest with its inability to identify individuals and to pinpoint their specific locations. Not compensating for temperature effects renders WBE data vulnerable to severe under-/over-estimation of infected cases. Effective surveillance may be envisioned as a two-step process in which WBE serves to identify and enumerate infected cases, where after clinical testing then serves to identify infected individuals in WBE-revealed hotspots. Data provided here demonstrate this approach to save money, be broadly applicable worldwide, and potentially aid in precision management of the pandemic, thereby helping to accelerate the global economic recovery that billions of people rely upon for their livelihoods.","output":"Computational analysis of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 surveillance by wastewater-based epidemiology locally and globally: Feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Consideration of the preferences for everyday living of older people with various care needs is a prerequisite for person-centred and evidence-based nursing care. Knowledge of and respect for these preferences by nursing staff are associated with better care outcomes for older people with various care needs. To assess preferences in a structured way, instruments focusing on different topics of everyday living appear to be useful. It is unclear which instruments exist for assessing preferences for everyday living. The aim of this planned review is to identify relevant instruments for assessing the preferences for everyday living of older people with various care needs in the form of an evidence map. Additionally, gaps requiring further research will be presented. METHODS AND ANALYSIS To identify the different instruments, we will conduct a systematic search in the electronic databases MEDLINE (via PubMed), CINAHL and PsycINFO (via EBSCO). In addition, we will perform backward and forward citation tracking via reference lists and Google Scholar. The identified records will be independently screened (title/abstract and full text) by two reviewers. Data from the included studies will be extracted independently by the same two reviewers. In all three steps, the results will be checked for deviations, and if there are any deviations, they will be discussed. If no consensus can be achieved through discussion, a third reviewer will be engaged. All study designs will be included, and there will be no limitations regarding the publication status or time period. We will include all studies published in English and German that use instruments focusing on the assessment of preferences for everyday living in people older than 60 years of age with various care needs. For data charting, we will extract the number, categories and types of preferences, the care setting for which the instrument was developed and, if available, psychometric properties. Finally, the various extracted results will be presented in the form of tables and a bubble plot. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION There are no ethical concerns related to the construction of an evidence map, and ethical approval was given by the Witten/Herdecke University (application number 226/2020). We will discuss our results with practitioners in the field of nursing care and persons with various care needs. We will also make our results available to practitioners in an upcoming Project (PELI-D II) and to the public at (inter)national conferences and in the form of practice and peer-reviewed articles.","output":"Instruments for assessing the preferences for everyday living of older people with various care needs: protocol for an evidence map."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: (1) Present a case of visual decompensation related to a Rathke's cleft cyst (RCC) in setting of acute COVID-19 infection.

Imaging revealed a large intrasellar and suprasellar T1 hyperintense mass with displacement of the optic chiasm superiorly ([Fig. 1]). An endoscopic transsphenoidal approach was performed and the cyst was marsupialized into the sphenoid sinus decompressing the optic chiasm. Cultures demonstrated many white blood cells, but no organisms. Pathology confirmed a diagnosis of RCC. There was no intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak noted. To prevent reaccumulation of cyst contents, a free mucosal graft harvested from the posterior septectomy and was used to line the sellar defect to facilitate marsupialization into the sphenoid sinus. Postoperatively, physical exam revealed normalization of her vision and extraocular movements, and the patient subjectively confirmed these findings. She was discharged home on postoperative day 3 without complications. Review of the literature demonstrates that visual field deficits are a common presenting finding in RCC patients and acute inflammation of RCCs can present similarly to pituitary apoplexy. Transsphenoidal approaches are safe and effective in surgical decompression of RCCs. Lining the exposed cyst cavity with a free mucosal graft or nasoseptal flap may facilitate promotion of an epithelialized track to prevent cyst reaccumulation. Conclusion: A case of acute visual decompensation related to a RCC in setting of acute COVID-19 infection is presented. Inflammation of the RCC, presumably related to COVID-19 infection, contributed to the acute presentation. Endoscopic transsphenoidal approaches are effective at decompression of RCCs and free mucosal grafts or nasoseptal flaps may promote epithelialization of a tract to decrease recurrences.","output":"Rathke's Cleft Cyst in Setting of COVID-19 Infection Causing Acute Visual Decompensation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Objective: To compare the C-reactive protein levels in different groups of COVID-19 patients to assess disease severity Study Design: Cross sectional study Place and Duration of Study: Combined Military Hospital Kohat, from Apr 2020 to Jun 2020 Methodology: Forty five Confirmed cases of COVID-19 patients were included by non-probability consecutive sampling Patients were divided into five groups (Asymptomatic, Mild, Moderate, Severe and Critical) Serum sample for C - reactive protein levels were collected at presentation and compared in different clinical groups by Paired sample t test and one way Anova (Post Hoc LSD) Result: Out of 45 cases in our study 28 (62 2%) were male and 17 (37 8%) were female Mean age of patients was 51 96  16 and mean C-reactive protein levels were 76 61  75 mg/L When compared by paired sample t-test C-reactive protein levels were: higher in the mild patient group than asymptomatic group, higher in the moderate group than mild group, higher in severe group than moderate group and those in the critical group were higher than those in the severe group The difference was statistically significant with p-value 0 05 in each group Conclusion: C-reactive protein levels were lowest in asymptomatic and highest in critical patients in early COVID-19 This may help guide management","output":"C-reactive Protein Levels and the Severity of Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, contact tracing program as part of a larger epidemiological case investigation was effectively implemented by the local department of health in Paterson, NJ The Paterson Communicable Disease Strike Team (PCDST) was established by leveraging skills and using existing public health staff of the health department team which led to a timely and robust public health intervention Methods: PCDST comprised of 25 communicable disease investigators/contact tracers established in preparation for public health response in the event of large-scale communicable disease outbreaks pre-COVID In March 2020 with initial COVID-19 cases in Paterson, PCDST was activated utilizing NJ DOH's Communicable Disease Reporting and Surveillance System (CDRSS) Additional staff members were cross-trained to augment team as new cases surged A triage coordinator would identify and assign new cases to disease investigators at a 24/7 schedule Disease Investigators would provide test results, perform epidemiological case interviews, elicit close contacts, and provide isolation/quarantine recommendations Case-contact monitors followed up daily basis until completion of isolation/quarantine period Results: As of June 15, 2020, 6537 cases tested COVID-19 (+) in Paterson, NJ 91% of cases and their contacts were interviewed Peak occurred in mid-April with 263 cases on a single day By mid-June, daily number of cases declined to 7/day Reported COVID-19 mortality rate in Paterson (4 65%), compared to surrounding towns in the same county of Passaic (6%), other large cities in New Jersey (Newark 8%, Jersey City 7 4%) and New Jersey state (7 59%) Conclusion: Despite limited resources, we were able to cross train and engage our frontline public health team (PCDST) to investigate and effectively contact trace new COVID-19 cases to help contain spread of infection Although its unclear if our intervention impacted mortality rates, it is certain that contact tracing using a trained public health workforce is a model that has proven successful in Paterson A local public health workforce vested in their communities can develop rapport needed to build trust and confidence in an intervention that elicits confidential medical information to limit viral transmission","output":"Effective contact tracing strategies for COVID-19: A municipal health department's model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"cGAS, a DNA sensor in mammalian cells, catalyzes the generation of 2-3-cyclic AMP-GMP (cGAMP) once activated by the binding of free DNA. cGAMP can bind to STING, activating downstream TBK1-IRF-3 signaling to initiate the expression of type I interferons. Although cGAS has been considered a traditional DNA-binding protein, several lines of evidence suggest that cGAS is a potential RNA-binding protein (RBP), which is mainly supported by its interactions with RNAs, RBP partners, RNA/cGAS-phase-separations as well as its structural similarity with the dsRNA recognition receptor 2-5 oligoadenylate synthase. Moreover, two influential studies reported that the cGAS-like receptors (cGLRs) of fly Drosophila melanogaster sense RNA and control 3-2-cGAMP signaling. In this review, we summarize and discuss in depth recent studies that identified or implied cGAS as an RBP. We also comprehensively summarized current experimental methods and computational tools that can identify or predict RNAs that bind to cGAS. Based on these discussions, we appeal that the RNA-binding activity of cGAS cannot be ignored in the cGAS-mediated innate antiviral response. It will be important to identify RNAs that can bind and regulate the activity of cGAS in cells with or without virus infection. Our review provides novel insight into the regulation of cGAS by its RNA-binding activity and extends beyond its DNA-binding activity.

METHODS: We surveyed 1,444 Australian adults online in October 2019. To identify factors associated with vaccination site, we used Pearson's chi-square test. We used thematic analysis to describe responses to the question, 'Please explain why you chose to get vaccinated there'. RESULTS: Most participants (73%) received the influenza vaccine in a medical setting, while 13% received it at a pharmacy and 14% at their workplace. Being vaccinated in pharmacy was associated with being under 65 years of age (p<0.01), marital status (p=0.01), and not having a high-risk comorbidity (p<0.01). Workplace vaccination was associated with being under 65 (p<0.01), household income (p<0.01), not having a regular general physician/practice (p=0.01), having private insurance (p<0.01), and not having a high-risk comorbidity (p<0.01). There was no association between site of vaccination and first-time vaccination (p=0.71, p=0.22). CONCLUSIONS: Despite new policies allowing pharmacists to administer influenza vaccines, most Australian adults are still vaccinated in medical settings. Pharmacy and workplace vaccination settings were more common among younger adults without high-risk comorbidities. Implications for public health: Workplaces, pharmacies and other non-medical settings may provide an opportunity to increase influenza vaccination among healthy, working-age adults who might otherwise forego annual vaccination.

Upon activation of the gene switch, the vectors replicate in infected cells with an efficacy that approaches that of the wildtype virus from which they were derived. Essentially no replication occurs in the absence of activation. When administered to mice, localized application of a transient heat treatment in the presence of systemic antiprogestin results in efficient but limited virus replication at the site of administration. The immunogenicity of these viral vectors was tested in a mouse footpad lethal challenge model. Unactivated viral vectors - which may be regarded as equivalents of inactivated vaccines - induced detectable protection against lethality caused by wildtype virus challenge. Single activation of the viral vectors at the site of administration (rear footpads) greatly enhanced protective immune responses, and second immunization resulted in complete protection. Once activated vectors also induced far better neutralizing antibody and HSV-1-specific T cells responses than unactivated vectors. To find out whether the immunogenicity of a heterologous antigen was also enhanced in the context of efficient transient vector replication, a virus vector constitutively expressing an equine influenza virus hemagglutinin was constructed. Immunization of mice with this recombinant induced detectable antibody-mediated neutralization of equine influenza virus as well as a hemagglutinin-specific T cell response. Single activation of viral replication resulted in a several-fold enhancement of this immune response. IMPORTANCE We hypothesized that vigorous replication of a pathogen may be critical for eliciting the most potent and balanced immune response against it. Hence, attenuation/inactivation (as in conventional vaccines) should be avoided. Instead, necessary safety should be provided by placing replication of the pathogen under stringent control and of activating time-limited replication of the pathogen strictly in an administration region in which pathology cannot develop. Immunization will then occur in the context of highly efficient pathogen replication and uncompromised safety. We found that localized activation in mice of efficient but limited replication of a replication-competent controlled herpesvirus vector resulted in a greatly enhanced immune response to the virus or an expressed heterologous antigen. This finding supports the above hypothesis as well as suggests that the vectors may be promising novel agents worth exploring for the prevention/mitigation of infectious diseases for which efficient vaccination is lacking, in particular in immunocompromised patients.","output":"Immunization by replication-competent controlled herpesvirus vectors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Canine adenovirus 2, parainfluenza, and Bordetella bronchiseptica cause respiratory disease in dogs, and each has a modified live intranasal vaccine available.

We included studies on depression and various indications unspecified (including off-label use) reporting risk of suicide and/or suicide attempt for adult patients using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and other new-generation antidepressants relative to non-users. Effects were meta-analytically aggregated with random-effects models, reporting relative risk (RR) estimates with 95% CIs. Publication bias was assessed via funnel-plot asymmetry and trim-and-fill method. Financial conflict of interest (fCOI) was defined present when lead authors' professorship was industry-sponsored, they received industry-payments, or when the study was industry-sponsored. RESULTS: We included 27 studies, 19 on depression and 8 on various indications unspecified (n=1.45 million subjects). SSRI were not definitely related to suicide risk (suicide and suicide attempt combined) in depression (RR=1.03, 0.70-1.51) and all indications (RR=1.19, 0.88-1.60).

Such rapid and widespread changes in the lives of people all over the world must have an impact on the environment and wildlife. Most of the current pandemicCwildlife papers focus on changes in the movement and behavior of wild animals. These changes, although interesting and worth documenting, may be ephemeral and may not have any significant effect on wildlife in the long run; they may only show how our daily presence may limit the presence and behavior of animals. In this paper, we suggest that scientific interest should be directed toward more permanent changes in the functioning of wildlife. One such topic is the lower road mortality rates of animals during the lockdown. In this study, hedgehog roadkill levels during the lockdown were over 50% lower than in the pre-pandemic years. Reduced road mortality in the case of hedgehogs may mean tens of thousands of survivors nationwide. We hypothesize that this may result in a change in the demographic and genetic characteristics of the population of hedgehogs, and also help to stop the long-term decline in the number of hedgehogs in Europe. ABSTRACT: Globally, wildlife is affected by unprecedented changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, the lockdown effect on the traffic-related mortality in hedgehogs in an urban area was studied. Comparing the pre-pandemic (2018 and 2019) and pandemic (2020) years, we showed that hedgehog roadkill levels during the lockdown period were over 50% lower (which means a decrease greater than the decrease in road traffic in the same period measured by the number of accidents or the average number of vehicles per day).

Every 2 years, CDC analyzes data from the national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) to evaluate trends in cigarette use among high school students in the United States. This report updates a previous report and describes results of CDC's 2010 analysis of YRBS data from 1991-2009 for three measures: ever smoked cigarettes, current cigarette use, and current frequent cigarette use. For ever smoked cigarettes, the prevalence did not change from 1991 (70.1%) to 1999 (70.4%), declined to 58.4% in 2003, and then declined more gradually, to 46.3% in 2009. For current cigarette use, the prevalence increased from 27.5% in 1991 to 36.4% in 1997, declined to 21.9% in 2003, and then declined more gradually, to 19.5% in 2009.

The disease is systemic and dynamic with broad range of manifestations, varying from mild symptoms to severe dengue (Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever and Dengue Shock Syndrome). The only licensed tetravalent dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, is a chimeric yellow fever virus with prM and E genes from the different dengue serotypes. However, recent results indicated that seronegative individuals became more susceptible to develop severe dengue when infected after vaccination, and now WHO recommends vaccination only to dengue seropositive people. One possibility to explain these data is the lack of robust T-cell responses and antibody-dependent enhancement of virus replication in vaccinated people. On the other hand, DNA vaccines are excellent inducers of T-cell responses in experimental animals and it can also elicit antibody production. Clinical trials with DNA vaccines have improved and shown promising results regarding the use of this approach for human vaccination. Therefore, in this paper we review preclinical and clinical tests with DNA vaccines against the dengue virus. Most of the studies are based on the E protein since this antigen is the main target for neutralizing antibody production. Yet, there are other reports with DNA vaccines based on non-structural dengue proteins with protective results, as well. Combining structural and non-structural genes may be a solution for inducing immune responses aging in different infection moments. Furthermore, DNA immunizations are also a very good approach in combining strategies for vaccines against dengue, in heterologous prime/boost regimen or even administering different vaccines at the same time, in order to induce efficient humoral and cellular immune responses.","output":"Dengue Virus and Vaccines: How Can DNA Immunization Contribute to This Challenge?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, Wuhan, China, experienced an outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19). The number of cases has increased rapidly, but information on the clinical characteristics remains limited. OBJECTIVES: This paper describes the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19. Early detection and identification of critically ill patients is necessary to facilitate scientific classification and treatment. STUDY DESIGN: This study included a retrospective, single-center case series of 99 consecutively hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Chengdu Public Health Clinical Medical Center in Chengdu, China, from January 16 to February 20, 2020. The final date of follow-up was February 23, 2020. We collected and analyzed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data. We compared outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients. RESULTS: Of the 99 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 49 years (minimum, 3 months; maximum, 87 years) and 51 (52 %) were men; 42 (42 %) had traveled to or lived in Wuhan and 48 (49 %) had come into close contact with patients with new coronavirus pneumonia; 41 (41 %) patients had underlying disease. Common symptoms included fever (85 [86 %]), dry cough (84 [85 %]), and fatigue (72 [73 %]). We analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients. We expressed the measurement data as meana?a?standard deviation. We collected data for age (49.39a?a?18.45 years), number of hospital days (12.32a?a?6.70 days), and laboratory indicators. We compared critically ill and noncritically ill patients: p-values for age, C-reactive protein, high-sensitivity troponin T, prothrombin time, fibrin degradation products, D-Dimer, and CD4+ count were pa?<a?0.001; and p-values for hospital days, white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, creatine kinase isoenzyme, myoglobin, N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide, and CD8+ count were pa?<a?0.05. CONCLUSIONS: We collected data from a single-center case series of 32 hospitalized patients who were critically ill with confirmed COVID-19 in Chengdu, China, and compared data with 67 noncritically ill patients. Elderly patients had chronic underlying diseases, notably cardiovascular disease. Higher C-reactive protein levels, higher levels of myocardial damage, and higher brain natriuretic peptide levels; lower white blood cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes; and lower CD4 and CD8 counts could be used for early detection and identification of critically ill patients, and dynamic Data observation was more important than at a single moment.","output":"Epidemiological characteristics and clinical features of 32 critical and 67 noncritical cases of COVID-19 in Chengdu"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper deals with the sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) reactions to the economic and geo-political turbulence of 2020 emerged from COVID-19 pandemic. In recent decade, SWFs as state-run investment vehicles have proved to be the fastest growing group of institutional investors and have noticeably strengthened their role in the global financial system. According to the latest estimates, their cumulative AUM reached 9.1 billion US dollars as of December 2020. There are persuasive evidences that top-10 SWFs from Norway, China, Singapore, Persian Gulf and some other nations have evolved into full-fledged market-driven investors with an active portfolio management strategy. The fact that they continue to contribute the lions share (around 2/3) into the integral figures of SWFs performance as a group explains why the pandemic failed to undermine their progress. Also, it should be taken in mind that, in contrast to GFC of 2008C2009, the recent coronacrisis was featured by a seemingly surprising gap between the deep recession in real sector businesses and eventual growth of basic indexes of capital markets. Generally, this turned good for the financial market community, including many SWFs. For instance, the worlds largest Norwegian GPFG, despite an urgent sellout of some of its assets in order to help the national government in financing somewhat undermined state budget in the situation of deep slump at world oil market, reported, by the end of the year, the 10.9% operational profit and 8.2% increment of AUM (in terms of local currency). In the upcoming years, we may see the state funds vehicles to increasing change the whole landscape of the global investment playfield. It is highly likely that the post-COVID turbulent environment will increasingly push the SWFs not only to seek for viable alternatives to the increasingly fading traditional fixed-income instruments but to fundamentally change the mandates and the modes of operation. The traditional stabilization and saving state investment funds will step down in favor of a subgroup of the so called strategic SWFs, such as Singaporean Temasek, Chinese CIC, Saudi PIF, Indian NIIF, Malaysian Khazanah, Turkish TVF, Bahraini Mubadala, and Russian RDIF. Basically, they are charged to operate as the catalysts of national economic and social development.

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are key mediators of host-pathogen interactions. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of viral hepatitis in humans. Recent reports also demonstrate its extrahepatic manifestations in the brain. Toward understanding the molecular details of HEV life cycle, we screened human liver and fetal brain cDNA libraries to identify the host interaction partners of proteins encoded by genotype 1 HEV and constructed the virus-host PPI network. Analysis of the network indicated a role of HEV proteins in modulating multiple host biological processes such as stress and immune responses, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, energy and iron metabolism, and protein translation. Further investigations revealed the presence of multiple host translation regulatory factors in the viral translation/replication complex. Depletion of host translation factors such as eIF4A2, eIF3A, and RACK1 significantly reduced the viral replication, whereas eIF2AK4 depletion had no effect. These findings highlight the ingenuity of the pathogen in manipulating the host machinery to its own benefit, a clear understanding of which is essential for the identification of strategic targets and development of specific antivirals against HEV. IMPORTANCE Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a pathogen that is transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Owing to the lack of an efficient laboratory model, the life cycle of the virus is poorly understood. During the course of infection, interactions between the viral and host proteins play essential roles, a clear understanding of which is essential to decode the life cycle of the virus. In this study, we identified the direct host interaction partners of all HEV proteins and generated a PPI network. Our functional analysis of the HEV-human PPI network reveals a role of HEV proteins in modulating multiple host biological processes such as stress and immune responses, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, energy and iron metabolism, and protein translation. Further investigations revealed an essential role of several host factors in HEV replication.

Methods: In the vitro model of ischemic stroke, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of 7,8-DHF through activation of TrkB signaling. Neurons subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion were treated with the protein kinase inhibitor K252a and a knockdown of TrkB. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, Flow Cytometric Analysis (FACS), TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay were conducted for measuring cell viability and numbers of apoptotic cells. And apoptosis-associated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Results: Compared with the Control group, OGD/R group revealed lower cell viability by CCK-8 assay FACS and TUNEL assay showed increased rates of neuronal apoptosis.

METHODS: Using Veteran Health Administrations (VHA) national database of VHA users evaluated for COVID-19 infection (3/1/2020C8/25/2020), we examined whether census tract neighborhood characteristics (percent households overcrowded, without complete plumbing, without kitchen plumbing, and neighborhood socioeconomic status [n-SES]) mediated racial disparities in COVID-19 infection, using inverse odds-weighted logistic models controlling for individual-level characteristics. Using moderated mediation analyses, we assessed whether neighborhood mediating effects on disparities differed for those residing in counties containing/near federally recognized tribal lands (i.e., Contract Health Service Delivery Area [CHSDA] counties) versus not. RESULTS: The percent of households without complete plumbing, percent without kitchen plumbing, and n-SES partially mediated AI/AN-White-non-Hispanic COVID-19 infection disparities (accounting for 17C35% of disparity) to a similar extent in CHSDA and non-CHSDA counties. The percent of households without kitchen plumbing had stronger mediating effects for CHSDA than non-CHSDA residents. CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood-level social determinants of health may contribute to the disproportionate COVID-19 infection burden on AI/ANs; differences are exacerbated among AI/ANs living near reservations.","output":"The Role of Community-Level Factors on Disparities in COVID-19 Infection Among American Indian/Alaska Native Veterans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to be the new normal, suggesting a situation where people use their personal computers at home for several activities like reading emails, surfing the web, chatting with friends.

This study aimed to characterise the respiratory bacterial microbiota of healthy children and to assess the impact of the changes associated with the development of persistent bacterial bronchitis. Blind, protected brushings were obtained from 20 healthy controls and 24 children with persistent bacterial bronchitis, with an additional directed sample obtained from persistent bacterial bronchitis patients. DNA was extracted, quantified using a 16S rRNA gene quantitative PCR assay prior to microbial community analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. No significant difference in bacterial diversity or community composition (R2 = 0.01, P = 0.36) was observed between paired blind and non-blind brushes, showing that blind brushings are a valid means of accessing the airway microbiota. This has important implications for collecting lower respiratory samples from healthy children. A significant decrease in bacterial diversity (P < 0.001) and change in community composition (R2 = 0.08, P = 0.004) was observed between controls and patients. Bacterial communities within patients with PBB were dominated by Proteobacteria, and indicator species analysis showed that Haemophilus and Neisseria were significantly associated with the patient group. In 15 (52.9%) cases the dominant organism by sequencing was not identified by standard routine clinical culture. The bacteria present in the lungs of patients with persistent bacterial bronchitis were less diverse in terms of richness and evenness.

Although this form of assessment is more prevalent in clinical education, LCME standards require ? ? a narrative description of a medical student's performance, including his or her non-cognitive achievement ? whenever teacher-student interaction permits this form of assessment.?1 To provide a narrative assessment (NA) of student performance in a large medical school class is challenging. Here, we present the methodology used in the Human Structure Course at UT Southwestern Medical School. This pre-clerkship course is taught to about 230 students each year and combines Anatomy, Embryology and the basics of Radiology. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the course was dissection-based, but was conducted entirely online in 2020, when the NA procedure was implemented. To emulate the regular dissection experience, small groups of 2-3 students synchronously met in Zoom Breakout Rooms to study a given body region using 3D-Anatomy software together with our own dissection guide and dissection videos. The NA was based on observations faculty members made while joining the small groups in their Breakout Rooms. A rubric with three categories (?Preparation and Knowledge?, ?Teamwork?, and ?Feedback?) was used to categorize the observed behavior of individual students. To construct the NA, faculty members could choose appropriate comments from provided lists as well as write individual comments on the strengths and areas for improvement for each of the categories. All observations were recorded in a FileMaker application database. The records were then transferred to the Data Mart maintained by the Office of Medical Education, where the observations and comments comprising the NA were converted into cohesive individual reports, which were made available to the students. We aimed at providing six NAs for each student over the course of 11 small-group sessions. To achieve this goal, on average, each faculty member needed to observe and comment on 12-13 students per session. As the students did not spent as much time in their Breakout Room sessions as initially anticipated, faculty members were not always able to observe all students assigned to them during a given session. However, of the 229 students in the class, 58% received all 6 reports, 28% received 5, and 12% received 4 reports. Less than 2% of the students received only 2 or 3 reports. Once the reporting mechanism was fully established, we were able to send the individual reports to the students within 48 hours after the session. In summary, the established procedure allowed us to regularly provide timely narrative feedback to a large class. The greatest limitations were constraints on the time for teacher-student interactions and some inconsistencies in the use of the rubric by faculty. In general, students found the NA helpful, but many requested more individualized comments. In the future, the NA will have to be adapted to a dissection-based course and additional faculty development is desirable. 1Liaison Committee on Medical Education,Standards for Accreditation of Medical Education Programs Leading to the MD Degree.","output":"Narrative Assessment of Medical Students in a Human Structure Course"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Dissecting aneurysms of the intracranial vertebral arteries are rare; however, treatment of these presents multiple challenges, including high risk of rebleeding, development of thromboembolic strokes, and progressive partial thrombosis. Flow diverters, such as Pipeline Endovascular Devices (PEDs; Covidien, Medtronic Inc, Dublin, Ireland), have emerged as a potential treatment option. OBJECTIVE To present our experience with patients treated at our institution with PEDs for dissecting distal vertebral artery (V4 segment) aneurysms. METHODS A retrospective search of our prospectively maintained database was performed between January 2014 and December 2016. We queried our database for all patients treated with PED for dissecting aneurysms of the V4 segment. Information was gathered including demographics, the location and morphology of the aneurysm, the clinical presentation, specific form of treatment, complications, antiplatelet medication regimen, and follow-up time. RESULTS There were a total of 9 patients with dissecting V4 aneurysms treated with PED during the study period. All were treated initially with an average of 1.2 PEDs. All patients were followed with at least one repeat diagnostic angiogram and there was no residual aneurysm seen in 8 of 9 cases. In those that presented with neurological deficits, there was an average improvement in modified Rankin Scale of 2.85 points. CONCLUSION PED is a safe and effective tool that can be used to treat ruptured dissecting aneurysms of this specific segment of the posterior circulation, but it does require close management of antiplatelet therapy in the setting of subarachnoid hemorrhage and close angiographic follow-up.","output":"Treatment of Dissecting Distal Vertebral Artery (V4) Aneurysms With Flow Diverters."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The presence of turkey astrovirus (TAstV) was monitored in meat-type turkey flocks in Poland in 2008.

RT-PCR experiments were performed for detection and molecular characterization of TAstV using four sets of primers within the RdRp gene (ORF1b). The prevalence of astrovirus was 34/77 (44.15%) in the flocks tested.

We hypothesized that upregulation of surface activation-induced markers (AIM) would facilitate detection of human M. tuberculosisCspecific CD4 T cells in a cytokine-independent manner in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals with LTBI. PBMCs from HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected adults in Kenya were stimulated with CFP-10 and ESAT-6 peptides and evaluated by flow cytometry for upregulation of the activation markers CD25, OX40, CD69, and CD40L. Although M. tuberculosisCspecific IFN- and IL-2 production was dampened in HIV-infected individuals, M. tuberculosisCspecific CD25(+)OX40(+) and CD69(+)CD40L(+) CD4 T cells were detectable in the AIM assay in both HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected individuals with LTBI. Importantly, the frequency of M. tuberculosisCspecific AIM(+) CD4 T cells was not directly impacted by HIV viral load or CD4 count, thus demonstrating the feasibility of AIM assays for analysis of M. tuberculosisCspecific CD4 T cells across a spectrum of HIV infection states. These data indicate that AIM assays enable identification of M. tuberculosisCspecific CD4 T cells in a cytokine-independent manner in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected individuals with LTBI in a high-tuberculosis burden setting, thus facilitating studies to define novel T cell correlates of protection to M. tuberculosis and elucidate mechanisms of HIV-associated dysregulation of antimycobacterial immunity.","output":"Activation-Induced Marker Expression Identifies Mycobacterium tuberculosisCSpecific CD4 T Cells in a Cytokine-Independent Manner in HIV-Infected Individuals with Latent Tuberculosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome is an underdiagnosed disorder of the autonomic nervous system.

MethodsTo characterize the vaccine uptake among U.S. child care providers, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of the child care workforce. Providers were identified through various national databases and state registries. A link to the survey was sent via email between May 26 and June 23, 2021. Out of 44,771 potential respondents, 21,663 responded (48.4%). ResultsOverall COVID-19 vaccine uptake among U.S. child care providers (78.1%, 95% CI [77.3% to 78.9%]) was higher than that of the U.S. adult population (65%). Vaccination rates varied from 53.5% to 89.4% between states.

Non-infected women with a confirmed pregnancy over 30th gestational week were consecutively included. A patient-reported non-validated questionnaire formed by the expert committee that includes 15 specific questions was used. Non-infected, pregnant women over 30th gestational week who applied to the outpatient clinic were consecutively included. A total of 213 women were enrolled, 37 were excluded: 7 for being in the first trimester, 3 were illiterate, and 27 were Syrian refugees having difficulties in translation.Results: A total of 172 pregnant women were included. Overall, four women refused to participate to the survey (1.9%). The mean age was 27.5  5.3 years. Median gestational week and parity were 35  11 weeks and 1  2, respectively. Pregnant women were observed to trust the authorities (65%) and the healthcare staff (92.4%), and their respect was increased (82.5%) during the outbreak. Majority of the women (87.2%) comply with the self-quarantine rules. Half of the women (52%) reported that they felt vulnerable and predominantly were concerned (80%). Approximately one-third of the women constantly keep thinking that they may get infected (35.5%) or they might get infected during/following the delivery or their baby might get infected after being born (42%). Half of the women (50%) were reported that they either had no idea about or think the breastfeeding is not safe during the outbreak.

METHODS From June 2012 to February 2018, 38 patients with bladder cancer underwent LRC with ileal conduit at our institution. Surgical outcomes were compared between ICIC (n = 30) and extracorporeal ileal conduit (ECIC) (n = 8). The learning curve during ICIC with regard to the operative time and complication rate was compared. RESULTS No significant differences in patient characteristics between the ICIC and ECIC groups were found. Comparison of outcomes between the ICIC and ECIC groups were as follows: median total operative time, 688 vs 713 minutes; urinary diversion time, 213 vs 192 minutes; and estimated blood loss, 450 vs 420 mL, respectively. The median time to walking and oral intake were similar in both groups. Rates of high-grade complications associated with urinary diversion (Clavien-Dindo grade  III) were 3% in ICIC and 25% in ECIC. Although 25% of ECIC patients developed wound dehiscence (Clavien-Dindo grade IIIb), no patient in the ICIC group had postoperative wound infection. For the learning curve of ICIC (n = 30), urinary diversion time decreased significantly (27 minutes decrease per 10 cases, P = .02). Clavien-Dindo grade  II complication did not occur after 20 cases.

The assessment included incidence of biopsy confirmed acute rejection, assessment of nTreg infusion related adverse effects, and signs of over immunosuppression. Secondary endpoints addressed allograft functions. Accompanying research included a comprehensive exploratory biomarker portfolio. RESULTS: For all patients, nTreg products with sufficient yield, purity, and functionality could be generated from 40-50 mL of peripheral blood taken two weeks before kidney transplantation. None of the three nTreg dose escalation groups had dose limiting toxicity. The nTreg and reference groups had 100% three year allograft survival and similar clinical and safety profiles. Stable monotherapy immunosuppression was achieved in eight of 11 (73%) patients receiving nTregs, while the reference group remained on standard dual or triple drug immunosuppression (P=0.002). Mechanistically, the activation of conventional T cells was reduced and nTregs shifted in vivo from a polyclonal to an oligoclonal T cell receptor repertoire. CONCLUSIONS: The application of autologous nTregs was safe and feasible even in patients who had a kidney transplant and were immunosuppressed. These results warrant further evaluation of Treg efficacy and serve as the basis for the development of next generation nTreg approaches in transplantation and any immunopathologies.

This crisis has dramatically disrupted the continuous care provided to cancer patients, as well as diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Thus, studies that help gain insights into COVID-19 prevalence, disease severity, prognosis, and clinical outcomes in cancer patients are of great importance. In this review, we outline the current knowledge of disease outcomes and prognoses for cancer patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and learn if the severity is exacerbated by cancer type, anticancer therapies, gender, behavioral risk factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol consumption), and comorbidities. Our article will help clinicians determine cases where treatment can be postponed during the pandemic and will encourage further research to better understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cancer patients. ABSTRACT: The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms and outcomes vary immensely among patients. Predicting disease progression and managing disease symptoms is even more challenging in cancer patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy, often suppress the immune system, rendering cancer patients more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of severe complications. However, data on the effects of immunosuppression on COVID-19 outcomes in cancer patients remain limited. Further investigations are warranted to better understand the implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients, particularly those that are immunocompromised. In this review, we outline the current knowledge of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Cancer Patients: Effects on Disease Outcomes and Patient Prognosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 (Coronavirus) has troubled regular life and has shown retardation in the world economy Thousands of people have been affected by this pandemic People with low immunity or who are sick have more chances to suffer from this disease Life has taken an entirely a different turn and enforced people stay inside their home and take extra care of themselves, their family, and their near and dear ones Review of Literature: The coronavirus disease 2019 is having an intense effect on all aspects of society, including mental and physical health A major adverse consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase social isolation and loneliness which are strongly associated with anxiety and depression This virus has a ripple effect on the day-to-day life of people, furthermore on the world economy Methods: For this study, 3779 people from the various region, age group, qualifications, income group and employment status are selected for the survey Conclusion: This manuscript concludes that all the sections of the population have been affected by this pandemic and in particular the people who are poor and lack necessities of life, older persons, disabled people, youth, and native peoples ? 2020, Radiance Research Academy All rights reserved","output":"Health monitoring of people during lockdown due to corona virus (Covid-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract We read the article by Laura Korhonen regarding the good, bad, and ugly, of screen-time during the COVID-19 pandemic with interest.

This study sought to identify the respiratory pathogens causing coinfections in patients with moderate/severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia from a hospital in Peru. Also, to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of coinfected and non-coinfected patients. Methods & Materials A descriptive study was conducted on hospitalized patients with a confirmed diagnosis of moderate/severe pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The selection criteria included patients older than 18 years of age who were admitted to the Guillermo Almenara Irigoyen Hospital in Lima, Peru during the period July-November 2020. Pregnant women were excluded from the study. A nasopharyngeal swab sample was obtained from the patients included in the study. Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The detection of the following respiratory viruses was performed by RT-PCR: Influenza A and B, Respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) A and B; and Adenovirus. The detection of atypical bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae was carried out using conventional polymerase chain reaction. Results A total of 295 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled during the study period. A coinfection with one or more respiratory pathogen was detected in 154 (52.20%) patients at hospital admission. The most common coinfections were Mycoplasma pneumoniae (28.12%), Chlamydia pneumoniae (8.81%) and with both bacteria (11.53%); followed by Adenovirus (1.70%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae/Adenovirus (0.71%), Chlamydia pneumoniae/Adenovirus (0.71%), RSV-B/Chlamydia pneumoniae (0.32%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae/Chlamydia pneumoniae/Adenovirus (0.32%). Sepsis was more frequent among coinfected patients than non coinfected (33.12% vs 20.57%, p = 0.018). Expectoration was less frequent in coinfected individuals compared to non coinfected (5.84% vs 12.77%, p = 0.045). We could highlight that the majority of patients were administered an antibiotic (69.50%). The correlation between the empirical use of macrolides in patients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae was observed in 41% of the cases. Conclusion Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae were the main microorganisms associated with SARS-CoV-2 coinfection at hospital admission. The presence of multiple coinfections was described in some patients. Antibiotics should be carefully prescribed, as high rates of antibiotic use was found, particularly with macrolides.","output":"Identification of Co-Infections by Viral and Bacterial Pathogens in Covid-19 Hospitalized Patients in Peru: Molecular Diagnosis and Clinical Characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the COVID-19 pandemic began in China in late 2019, infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread virtually worldwide.

The World Health Organization declared an infodemic of COVID-19 on February 15, 2020. Misinformation and disinformation, including overwhelming amounts of information about COVID-19 on social media, could promote adverse psychological effects. OBJECTIVE: This study used the Psychological Distance and Level of Construal theory (CLT) to predict peoples negative psychological symptoms from social media usage. In this study, the CLT intended to show peoples psychological proximity to objects and events with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, this study links the uncertainty reduction strategy (URS) and CLT for COVID-19Crelated preventive behaviors and affective reactions to assess their effects on mental health problems. METHODS: A path model was tested (N=297) with data from a web-based survey to examine how social media usage behaviors are associated with URS and psychological distance with COVID-19 (based on the CLT), leading to preventive behaviors and affective reactions. Finally, the path model was used to examine how preventive behaviors and affective reactions are associated with mental health problems including anxiety and sleep disorder. RESULTS: After measuring participants social media usage behavior, we found that an increase in general social media usage led to higher use of the URS and lower construal level on COVID-19. The URS is associated with preventive behaviors, but the CLT did not show any association with preventive behaviors; however, it increases affective reactions. Moreover, increased preventive behavior showed negative associations with symptoms of mental health problems; that is, depression and sleep disorder. However, the affective reaction tends to be positively associated with depression and sleep disorder. Owing to the infodemic of COVID-19, the psychological perception of the pandemic negatively influenced users mental health problems. CONCLUSIONS: Our results imply that the information from social media usage heightened concerns and had a lower construal level; this does not facilitate taking preventive actions but rather reinforces the negative emotional reaction and mental health problems. Thus, higher URS usage is desirable.","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Infodemic on Depression and Sleep Disorders: Focusing on Uncertainty Reduction Strategies and Level of Interpretation Theory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 variants brought new waves of infection worldwide.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release records of patients discharged after COVID-19 hospitalization from U.S. hospitals from March to November 2020 (N = 269,674 after exclusion), we estimated risk differences (RD) and risk ratios (RR) of intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation (ICU/MV) and of death among patients with T1DM compared with patients without diabetes or with T2DM. Logistic models were adjusted for age, sex, and race or ethnicity. Models adjusted for additional demographic and clinical characteristics were used to examine whether other factors account for the associations between T1DM and severe COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: Compared with patients without diabetes, T1DM was associated with a 21% higher absolute risk of ICU/MV (RD 0.21, 95% CI 0.19-0.24; RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.43-1.56) and a 5% higher absolute risk of mortality (RD 0.05, 95% CI 0.03-0.07; RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.24-1.57), with adjustment for age, sex, and race or ethnicity. Compared with T2DM, T1DM was associated with a 9% higher absolute risk of ICU/MV (RD 0.09, 95% CI 0.07-0.12; RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.12-1.22), but no difference in mortality (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.02; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89-1.13). After adjustment for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) occurring before or at COVID-19 diagnosis, patients with T1DM no longer had increased risk of ICU/MV (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03) and had lower mortality (RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.05 to -0.01) in comparisons with patients with T2DM. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with T1DM hospitalized for COVID-19 are at higher risk for severe outcomes than those without diabetes. Higher risk of ICU/MV in patients with T1DM than in patients with T2DM was largely accounted for by the presence of DKA.

The scenario is deteriorating due to lack of proper & specific target-oriented pharmacologically safe prophylactic agents or drugs, and or any effective vaccine. drug development is urgently required to back in the normalcy in the community and to combat this pandemic. Thus, we have proposed two novel drug targets, Furin and TMPRSS2, as Covid-19 treatment strategy. We have highlighted this target-oriented novel drug delivery strategy, based on their pathophysiological implication on SARS-CoV-2 infection, as evident from earlier SARS-CoV-1, MERS, and influenza virus infection via host cell entry, priming, fusion, and endocytosis. An earlier study suggested that Furin and TMPRSS2 knockout mice had reduced level of viral load and a lower degree of organ damage such as the lung. The present study thus highlights the promise of some selected novel and potential anti-viral Phytopharmaceutical that bind to Furin and TMPRSS2 as target. As, few of them had shown promising anti-viral response in both preclinical and clinical study with acceptable therapeutic safety-index. Hence, this strategy may limit life-threatening Covid-19 infection and its mortality rate through nano-suspension based intra-nasal or oral nebulizer spray, to treat mild to moderate SARS-COV-2 infection, when Furin and TMPRSS2 receptor may initiate to express and activate for processing the virus to cause cellular infection by replication within the host cell.","output":"Phytopharmaceuticals mediated Furin and TMPRSS2 receptor blocking: can it be a potential therapeutic option for Covid-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Burns and other traumatic injuries represent a substantial biomedical burden. The current standard of care for deep injuries is autologous split-thickness skin grafting (STSG), which frequently results in contractures, abnormal pigmentation, and loss of biomechanical function. Currently, there are no effective therapies that can prevent fibrosis and contracture after STSG. Here, we have developed a clinically relevant porcine model of STSG and comprehensively characterized porcine cell populations involved in healing with single-cell resolution. We identified an up-regulation of proinflammatory and mechanotransduction signaling pathways in standard STSGs. Blocking mechanotransduction with a small-molecule focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor promoted healing, reduced contracture, mitigated scar formation, restored collagen architecture, and ultimately improved graft biomechanical properties. Acute mechanotransduction blockade up-regulated myeloid CXCL10-mediated anti-inflammation with decreased CXCL14-mediated myeloid and fibroblast recruitment. At later time points, mechanical signaling shifted fibroblasts toward profibrotic differentiation fates, and disruption of mechanotransduction modulated mesenchymal fibroblast differentiation states to block those responses, instead driving fibroblasts toward proregenerative, adipogenic states similar to unwounded skin. We then confirmed these two diverging fibroblast transcriptional trajectories in human skin, human scar, and a three-dimensional organotypic model of human skin. Together, pharmacological blockade of mechanotransduction markedly improved large animal healing after STSG by promoting both early, anti-inflammatory and late, regenerative transcriptional programs, resulting in healed tissue similar to unwounded skin.

In this study, 4.5% Si uninoculated ductile iron solidified in thin wall castings (up to 15 mm section size) via a permanent (metal) mold versus a sand mold, was evaluated. Solidification in a metal mold led to small size, higher graphite particles (less dependent on the section size). The graphite particles' real perimeter was 3-5% higher than the convex perimeter, while the values of these parameters were 41-43% higher in the sand mold. Increasing the casting section size led to an increased graphite perimeter, with it being much higher for sand mold. The graphite particles' shape factors, involving the maximum and minimum size, were at a lower level for metal mold solidification, while by involving the difference between Pr and Pc, is higher for the metal mold. The shape factor, including the graphite area and maximum size, had higher values in the metal mold, sustaining a higher compactness degree of graphite particles and a higher nodularity regarding metal mold solidification (75.5% versus 67.4%).

Specifically, we highlight issues associated with delivery of gene-editing tools into clinically relevant cells.","output":"Delivery Approaches for Therapeutic Genome Editing and Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Building accurate and robust artificial intelligence systems for medical image assessment requires not only the research and design of advanced deep learning models but also the creation of large and curated sets of annotated training examples. Constructing such datasets, however, is often very costly -- due to the complex nature of annotation tasks and the high level of expertise required for the interpretation of medical images (e.g., expert radiologists). To counter this limitation, we propose a method for self-supervised learning of rich image features based on contrastive learning and online feature clustering. For this purpose we leverage large training datasets of over 100,000,000 medical images of various modalities, including radiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and ultrasonography. We propose to use these features to guide model training in supervised and hybrid self-supervised/supervised regime on various downstream tasks. We highlight a number of advantages of this strategy on challenging image assessment problems in radiography, CT and MR: 1) Significant increase in accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art (e.g., AUC boost of 3-7% for detection of abnormalities from chest radiography scans and hemorrhage detection on brain CT); 2) Acceleration of model convergence during training by up to 85% compared to using no pretraining (e.g., 83% when training a model for detection of brain metastases in MR scans); 3) Increase in robustness to various image augmentations, such as intensity variations, rotations or scaling reflective of data variation seen in the field.","output":"Self-supervised Learning from 100 Million Medical Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a highly lethal respiratory disease caused by a zoonotic betacoronavirus. The development of effective vaccines and control measures requires a thorough understanding of the immune response to this viral infection. METHODS We investigated cellular immune responses up to 5 years after infection in a cohort of 59 MERS survivors by performing ELISPOT assay and intracellular cytokine staining after stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with synthetic viral peptides. RESULTS Memory T cell responses were detected in 82, 75, 69, 64, and 64% of MERS survivors from 1-5 years post-infection, respectively. Although the frequency of virus-specific gamma interferon (IFN-)-secreting T cells tended to be higher in moderately/severely ill patients than in mildly ill patients during the early period of follow-up, there was no significant difference among the different clinical severity groups across all time points. While both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were involved in memory T cell responses, CD4+ T cells persisted slightly longer than CD8+ T cells. Both memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells recognized the E/M/N proteins better than the S protein and maintained their polyfunctionality throughout the period examined. Memory T cell responses correlated positively with antibody responses during the initial 3-4 years, but not with maximum viral loads at any time point. CONCLUSIONS These findings advance our understanding of the dynamics of virus-specific memory T cell immunity after MERS-CoV infection, which is relevant to the development of effective T cell-based vaccines.","output":"Longitudinal Analysis of Memory T cell Responses in Survivors of Middle East respiratory syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a serious epidemic around the world, but it has been effectively controlled in the mainland of China. The Chinese government limited the migration of people almost from all walks of life. Medical workers have rushed into Hubei province to fight against the epidemic. Any activity that can increase infection is prohibited. The aim of this study was to confirm that timely lockdown, large-scale case-screening and other control measures proposed by the Chinese government were effective to contain the spread of the virus in the mainland of China. METHODS: Based on disease transmission-related parameters, this study was designed to predict the trend of COVID-19 epidemic in the mainland of China and provide theoretical basis for current prevention and control. An SEIQR epidemiological model incorporating asymptomatic transmission, short term immunity and imperfect isolation was constructed to evaluate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 inside and outside of Hubei province. With COVID-19 cases confirmed by the National Health Commission (NHC), the optimal parameters of the model were set by calculating the minimum Chi-square value. RESULTS: Before the migration to and from Wuhan was cut off, the basic reproduction number in China was 5.6015. From 23 January to 26 January 2020, the basic reproduction number in China was 6.6037. From 27 January to 11 February 2020, the basic reproduction number outside Hubei province dropped below 1, but that in Hubei province remained 3.7732. Because of stricter controlling measures, especially after the initiation of the large-scale case-screening, the epidemic rampancy in Hubei has also been contained. The average basic reproduction number in Hubei province was 3.4094 as of 25 February 2020. We estimated the cumulative number of confirmed cases nationwide was 82 186, and 69 230 in Hubei province on 9 April 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown of Hubei province significantly reduced the basic reproduction number. The large-scale case-screening also showed the effectiveness in the epidemic control. This study provided experiences that could be replicated in other countries suffering from the epidemic. Although the epidemic is subsiding in China, the controlling efforts should not be terminated before May.","output":"Basic reproduction number and predicted trends of coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in the mainland of China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We explore the impact of COVID-19 hotspots and regional lockdowns on the Dutch labour market during the outbreak of COVID-19.

Data were analyzed from an online, cross-sectional survey administered to people (N = 1405) living in Canada and the USA in June 2020. Significant results show that respondents from Canada were felt more prepared, adapted/coped better to the pandemic, had less life disruption, fewer challenges with healthcare and financially, and were personally less affected by the pandemic than respondents from the USA. Those from Canada also showed significant higher levels of support for both their national and provincial/state leadership and belief in the necessity of preventative measures than those in the USA. Respondents from the USA were more likely to use family and friends as a source of information and as a basis for their personal preventative practices, whereas those in Canada were more likely to follow the official government recommendations.

In the data mining area, this task is known as Imprecise Classification. Decision Trees that use imprecise probabilities, also known as Credal Decision Trees (CDTs), have been adapted to this field. The adaptation proposed so far uses the Imprecise Dirichlet Model (IDM), a mathematical model of imprecise probabilities that assumes prior knowledge about the data, depending strongly on a hyperparameter. This strong dependence is solved with the Non-Parametric Predictive Inference Model (NPI-M), also based on imprecise probabilities. This model does not make any prior assumption of the data and does not have parameters. In this work, we propose a new adaptation of CDTs to Imprecise Classification based on the NPI-M. An experimental study carried out in this research shows that the adaptation with NPI-M has an equivalent performance than the one obtained with the adaptation based on the IDM with the best choice of the hyperparameter.

OBJECTIVES: Aim of the study was to evaluate the racial effect on severity of disease and in-hospital outcome in individuals diagnosed with COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study based on records of 804 tested positive COVID-19 patients presented at Dammam Medical Complex and Braira quarantine during March to May 2020 was conducted after approval from the ethical board. Patient's records included the routine patient's consent statement about explanation of all the investigations and procedures prior to be performed. Data were retrieved included in analysis were age, gender, country of origin, racial background (Arab, Caucasian, Asian, Black, Latin, and Hispanic), severity of COVID-19 and outcome. RESULTS: Out of total 804 confirmed patients of covid-19, there were 647 (80.5%) males and 157 (19.5%) females (M: F ratio = 4.1: 1). Male preponderance was seen in all racial groups, and significantly higher in Asian than the Middle Eastern race (91.2% vs. 70.3%, p=0.000).

Circular, smooth, light-yellow colonies appeared on brain heart infusion plate after 24C48 h incubation at 28C. The optimal pH for growth was between 6.0 and 7.5. Based on 16S rRNA, the three isolates were phylogenetically related to Agromyces terreus DS-10(T), Agromyces aureus AR33(T), Agromyces salentinus 20-5(T), Agromyces allii UMS-62(T), Agromyces lapidis CD55(T), and Agromyces italicus CD1(T). Moreover, based on 296 core genes, the phylogenomic tree indicated that the three isolates clustered together, closest to Agromyces cerinus VKM Ac-1340(T) and Agromyces fucosus VKM Ac-1345(T) but separated distantly from other Agromyces species. The average nucleotide identity values between strain HY052(T) and other Agromyces species ranged from 79.3% to 87.9%, lower than the 95C96% threshold. Furthermore, the genome of strain HY052(T) contains a circular chromosome of 3,437,203 bp with G + C content of 69.0 mol%. Main fatty acids were anteiso-C(15:0) and anteiso-C(17:0). The polar lipids comprised diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and unidentified glycolipids. Rhamnose, ribose, and glucose were the primary cell wall sugars. The major peptidoglycan amino acids included alanine, glutamic acid, glycine, and 2,4-diaminobutyric acid.

To date, results suggest that the modRNA vaccines are highly effective against virus infection, which causes COVID-19. Although short-term studies have reported that their safety is acceptable, long-term safety and protective immunity remain unclear. In this review, we describe two major approved modRNA vaccines and discuss their potential myocarditis complications.","output":"Modified mRNA-Based Vaccines Against Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is sending shockwaves through communities and economies, and public servants have risen to the novel policy challenges in uncharted waters.

For most people, episodes of spine pain are self-limited; nevertheless, healthcare spending for this condition is extremely high. Focusing care on individuals at high-risk of progressing from acute to chronic pain may improve efficiency. Alternatively, postural therapies, which are frequently used by patients, may prevent the overuse of high-cost interventions while delivering equivalent outcomes. METHODS The SPINE CARE (Spine Pain Intervention to Enhance Care Quality And Reduce Expenditure) trial is a cluster-randomized multi-center pragmatic clinical trial designed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and healthcare utilization of two interventions for primary care patients with acute and subacute spine pain. The study is being conducted at 33 primary care clinics in geographically distinct regions of the United States. Individuals 18 years presenting to primary care with neck and/or back pain of 3 months' duration were randomized at the clinic-level to 1) usual care, 2) a risk-stratified, multidisciplinary approach called the Identify, Coordinate, and Enhance (ICE) care model, or 3) Individualized Postural Therapy (IPT), a standardized postural therapy method of care. The trial's two primary outcomes are change in function at 3 months and spine-related spending at one year. 2971 individuals were enrolled between June 2017 and March 2020. Follow-up was completed on March 31, 2021.

It has tightened its knot around EIs that forced their previous half shut shades completely down to prevent the risk of spreading COVID19. In such a situation, fetching new enrollments on EI campuses is a difficult and challenging task, as students behavior and family preferences have changed drastically due to mental stress and emotions attached to them. Consequently, it becomes a prerequisite to examine the choice characteristics influencing the selection of EI during the COVID-19 pandemic to make it normal for new enrollments. The purpose of this study is to critically examine choice characteristics that affect students choice for EI and consequently to explore relationships between institutional characteristics and the suitability of EI during the COVID19 pandemic across students characteristics. The findings of this study revealed dissimilarities across students characteristics regarding the suitability of EIs under pandemic conditions. Regression analysis revealed that EI characteristics such as proximity, image and reputation, quality education and curriculum delivery have significantly contributed to suitability under COVID19. At the micro level, multiple relationships were noted between EI characteristics and the suitability of EI under the pandemic across students characteristics. The study has successfully demonstrated how choice characteristics can be executed to regulate the suitability of EI under the COVID19 pandemic for the inclusion of diversity. It is useful for policy makers and academicians to reposition EIs that fetch diversity during the pandemic. This study is the first to provide insights into the performance of choice characteristics and their relationship with the suitability of EIs under a pandemic and can be a yardstick in administering new enrollments.","output":"Selection of an engineering institution: Students perceptions of choice characteristics and suitability under the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mesoporous sodalite nanoparticles were directly synthesized from Indonesian kaolin with the addition of CTABr as a mesopore template.

Arthritis patients are a vulnerable population at an increased risk of peritraumatic stress. This could be due to several reasons, including the fear of shortage of medicine and difficulty receiving periodical medical checks. In the present case-control study, psychological distress in patients with autoimmune arthritis during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic were investigated. An electronic survey was conducted to gather information on the perceived change in the emotional state, general health (GH), fatigue, joint pain, and disease activity during the lockdown, in 100 patients with autoimmune arthritis and 100 controls. Mental health status was measured using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) was used to assess the frequency of peritraumatic stress disorders related to COVID-19. Patients reported a significant worsening of perceived GH (36% vs. 7%; p < 0.001), a significantly higher mean CPDI score (p < 0.001) than controls. Using multivariate analysis, arthritis patients had significantly higher CPDI scores (+3.67 points; p = 0.019), independent of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, comorbidities, and sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. Logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of reporting worsened GH was 9-fold higher in patients than controls (p < 0.001).

CTCs are seen not only as an isolated phenomenon but also a key inherent part of the formation of metastasis and a key factor in cancer death. This review discusses the impact of NSCLC therapy strategies based on a meta-analysis of clinical studies. In addition, possible therapeutic strategies for repression when standard methods fail, such as the administration of low-toxicity natural anticancer agents targeting these phenomena (curcumin and flavonoids), are also discussed. These strategies are presented in the context of key mechanisms of tumour biology with a strong influence on CTC spread and metastasis (mechanisms related to tumour-associated and -infiltrating cells, epithelialCmesenchymal transition, and migration of cancer cells).","output":"Circulating Tumour Cells (CTCs) in NSCLC: From Prognosis to Therapy Design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article presents the discussion on drug behemoth Pfizer, a 5-day pill regimen curbing early SARS-CoV-2 infections inhibiting a protease in the coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).","output":"Antiviral pills could change pandemics course"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inflammation is an important contributor to autoimmune thyroiditis.

The experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT) model was established by thyroglobulin (pTG) injections and excessive iodine intake. Thyroid lesions were observed using hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) staining and serum TgAb, TPOAb, TSH, T3, and T4 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay IL-35 levels were evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Th17/Treg balance in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was determined by flow cytometry and RT-PCR. Changes in Wnt/-catenin signaling were evaluated using Western blot. Immunofluorescence staining and western blot were employed to examine NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the thyroid. YH minimized thyroid follicle injury and decreased concentrations of serum TgAb, TPOAb, TSH, T3, and T4 in EAT model. The mRNA of IL-35 was increased after YH treatment. YH also increased the percentage of Treg cells, and decreased Th17 proportion as well as Th17/Treg ratio in PBMCs. Meanwhile, the mRNA levels of Th17 related cytokines (RORt, IL-17A, IL-21, and IL-22) were suppressed and Treg related cytokines (FoxP3, TGF-, and IL-10) were promoted in PBMCs. Additionally, the protein expressions of Wnt-1 and -catenin were unregulated after YH treatment. NLRP3 immunostaining signal and protein levels of IL-17, p-NF-B, NLRP3, ASC, cleaved-Caspase-1, cleaved-IL-1, and IL-18 were downregulated in the thyroid after YH intervention.

Several agents were described to be associated with the PEMS; however, a specific etiological agent(s) has not been identified. The diagnosis of PEMS is still a huge challenge for several reasons: (1) no specific clinical signs or pathognomonic lesions, (2) isolation of some enteric viruses still difficult, (3) the pathogenicity of several enteric viruses in turkeys is not fully understood, (4) PEMS is an interaction between several known and might be unknown agents and (5) opportunistic microorganisms also have a role in the pathogenesis of PEMS. Both electron microscopy and molecular techniques can be used for diagnosis of PEMS and might help to discover unknown causes. Until now, no specific vaccines against enteric viruses associated with PEMS. However, biosecurity, maintaining a healthy gut and strengthening the immune system of turkey poults using probiotics, prebiotics and/or phytogenic substances are crucial factors to prevent and/or reduce losses of PEMS in turkeys. This review is a call for scientists to perform further research to investigate the real cause(s) of PEMS and to develop a preventive strategy against it. ABSTRACT: Poult enteritis and mortality syndrome (PEMS) is one of the most significant problem affecting turkeys and continues to cause severe economic losses worldwide. Although the specific causes of PEMS remains unknown, this syndrome might involve an interaction between several causative agents such as enteropathogenic viruses (coronaviruses, rotavirus, astroviruses and adenoviruses) and bacteria and protozoa. Non-infectious causes such as feed and management are also interconnected factors. However, it is difficult to determine the specific cause of enteric disorders under field conditions. Additionally, similarities of clinical signs and lesions hamper the accurate diagnosis. The purpose of the present review is to discuss in detail the main viral possible causative agents of PEMS and challenges in diagnosis and control.","output":"Poult Enteritis and Mortality Syndrome in Turkey Poults: Causes, Diagnosis and Preventive Measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause respiratory tract infections ranging from colds to more severe diseases, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). New Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which led to deaths as well as social and economic disruptions, is an ongoing worldwide pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, there is no approved treatment for COVID-19. Hence, only supportive care has been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) for now. Pharmacological agents used for the adjunctive treatment of COVID-19 following the current literature and clinical experiences include antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-malaria drugs, and other traditional or untraditional treatments. However, it has been reported that the use of these drugs may have some negative effects and comorbidities. Moreover, the current data have indicated that the risk of drug-drug interactions may also be high in polypharmacy cases, especially in elderly people, some comorbidity situations, and intensive care unit (ICU) patients. It is highly possible that these situations can not only increase the risk of drug-drug interactions but also increase the risk of food/nutrition-drug interactions and affect the nutritional status. However, this issue has not yet been entirely discussed in the literature. In this review, current information on the possible mechanisms as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of some pharmacological agents used in the treatment of COVID-19 and/or their secondary interactions with nutrition were evaluated and some future directions were given.","output":"Emergent Drug and Nutrition Interactions in COVID-19: A Comprehensive Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Education is regarded as an avenue for success while the under-educated are disproportionately more likely to be incarcerated and remain within the correctional system.

We used archival data from a previous dataset we had access to, which included Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale (CES-D) data from non-clinical volunteers collected before (n = 151;Pre-COVID-19 group) and during (n = 352;COVID group) the pandemic. Statistical analyses compared CES-D scores yielded by the Pre-COVID-19 sample against those yielded by the COVID-19 sample. Additionally, the possible impact of demographic variables on CES-D scores before and during COVID-19 was tested. Moreover, in the COVID-19 group we found a statistically significant difference on the CES-D scores between men and women and a nearly significant relationship between age and CES-D scores.

L'obiettivo del presente studio  stato quello di indagare la sintomatologia depressiva sperimentata da un campione proveniente dalla popolazione generale, confrontando i dati raccolti prima e durante il lockdown da COVID-19. Sono stati utilizzati dati d'archivio che includevano dati relativi alla Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale (CES-D) somministrata prima (n = 151;gruppo Pre-COVID-19) e durante (n = 352;gruppo COVID-19) il primo lockdown italiano a un campione non-clinico. Le analisi si sono focalizzare sul confronto dei punteggi ottenuti alla CES-D nel gruppo Pre-COVID-19 e nel gruppo COVID-19. Inoltre,  stata valutata la possibile influenza di alcune variabili demografiche sui punteggi ottenuti alla CES-D prima e durante la pandemia da COVID-19. Inoltre, all'interno del gruppo COVID-19, sono state osservate delle differenze statisticamente significative tra i punteggi alla CES-D ottenuti da uomini e donne e una correlazione quasi significativa tra l'et dei partecipanti e i punteggi ottenuti alla CES-D.

Biological properties of ASFV indicate that the African swine fever (ASF) pandemic will continue to develop and that only the implementation of an effective and safe vaccine will ensure a reduction in the spread of ASFV. At present, vaccines against ASF are not available. The latest approaches to the ASFV vaccines design concentrate on the development of either modified live vaccines by targeted gene deletion from different isolates or subunit vaccines. The construction of an effective vaccine is hindered by the complex structure of the virus, the lack of an effective continuous cell line for the isolation and propagation of ASFV, unpredictable and stain-specific phenotypes after the genetic modification of ASFV, a risk of reversion to virulence, and our current inability to differentiate infected animals from vaccinated ones. Moreover, the design of vaccines intended for wild boars and oral administration is desirable. Despite several obstacles, the design of a safe and effective vaccine against ASFV seems to be achievable.","output":"African Swine Fever Virus as a Difficult Opponent in the Fight for a VaccineCurrent Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the relationships between biomedical terms like viruses, drugs, and symptoms is essential in the fight against diseases. Many attempts have been made to introduce the use of machine learning to the scientific process of hypothesis generation (HG), which refers to the discovery of meaningful implicit connections between biomedical terms. However, most existing methods fail to truly capture the temporal dynamics of scientific term relations and also assume unobserved connections to be irrelevant (i.e., in a positive-negative (PN) learning setting). To break these limits, we formulate this HG problem as future connectivity prediction task on a dynamic attributed graph via positive-unlabeled (PU) learning. Then, the key is to capture the temporal evolution of node pair (term pair) relations from just the positive and unlabeled data. We propose a variational inference model to estimate the positive prior, and incorporate it in the learning of node pair embeddings, which are then used for link prediction. Experiment results on real-world biomedical term relationship datasets and case study analyses on a COVID-19 dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. ? 2020 Neural information processing systems foundation.

The extract of Ginkgo folium has been reported on attenuating bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, but the anti-fibrotic effects of ginkgetin is still unclear. This study was intended to investigate the protective effects of ginkgetin against experimental pulmonary fibrosis and its underlying mechanism. METHODS In vivo, bleomycin (5 mg/kg) in 50 L saline was administrated intratracheally in mice. One week after bleomycin administration, ginkgetin (25 or 50 mg/kg) or nintedanib (40 mg/kg) were administrated intragastrically daily for 14 consecutive days. In vitro, the AMPK-siRNA transfection in primary lung fibroblasts further verified the regulation effect of ginkgetin on AMPK. RESULTS Administration of bleomycin caused characteristic histopathology structural changes with elevated lipid peroxidation, pulmonary fibrosis indexes, and inflammatory mediators. The bleomycin-induced alteration was normalized by ginkgetin intervention. Moreover, this protective effect of ginkgetin (20 mg/kg) was equivalent to nintedanib (40 mg/kg). AMPK-siRNA transfection in primary lung fibroblasts markedly blocked TGF-?1-induced myofibroblasts transdifferentiation and abolished oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS All these results suggested that ginkgetin exerted the ameliorative effects on bleomycin-induced oxidative stress and lung fibrosis mainly through an AMPK-dependent manner.","output":"Modulation of Bleomycin-induced oxidative stress and pulmonary fibrosis by ginkgetin in mice via AMPK."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we show the results of a quantitative and qualitative analysis of open citations on a popular and highly cited retracted paper: Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis and pervasive developmental disorder in children by Wakefield et al., published in 1998.

Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted with French GPs working in a private practice in France who were asked to fulfil an internet questionnaire. We used the secure internet application REDCap(?). Exclusion criteria were only working in a hospital, substitute doctors, and internship students. There was a putative sample size of 88,886 GPs. We retrieved the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), occupational characteristics (type of installation, emergency regulated shifts, night shifts, university supervisor, weekly hours worked, seniority), and personal characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, and number of children. Results: We included 1926 GPs among the 2602 retrieved questionnaires. A total of 44.8% of French liberal GPs were experiencing burnout, with 4.8% (95%CI 3.9C5.9%) experiencing severe burnout. The risk factors of severe burnout were male gender (RR = 1.91, 95%CI 1.15C3.16), working in a suburban area (5.23, 2.18C12.58), and having more than 28 appointments per day (1.95, 1.19C3.19). Working more than 50 h weekly showed a tendency to increase the risk of severe burnout (1.55, 0.93C2.59, p = 0.095), with a significant increase in the risk of low and moderate burnout (1.31, 1.02C1.67 and 1.86, 1.34C2.57, respectively). Protective factors were mainly resident training, which decreased the risk of both low, moderate, and severe burnout (0.65, 0.51C0.83; 0.66, 0.48C0.92; and 0.42, 95%CI 0.23C0.76, respectively). Performing home visits decreased the risk of severe burnout (0.25, 0.13C0.47), as did group practice for intermediate level of burnout (0.71, 0.51C0.96). Conclusion: GPs are at a high risk of burnout, with nearly half of them in burnout, with burnout predominantly affecting males and those between the ages of 50 and 60 years old.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the prediction of future daily national confirmed COVID-19 infection growth-the percentage change in total cumulative cases-across 14 days for 114 countries using nonpharmaceutical intervention metrics and cultural dimension metrics, which are indicative of specific national sociocultural norms. METHODS: We combined the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker data set, Hofstede cultural dimensions, and daily reported COVID-19 infection case numbers to train and evaluate five non-time series machine learning models in predicting confirmed infection growth. We used three validation methods-in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and country-based cross-validation-for the evaluation, each of which was applicable to a different use case of the models. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate high R2 values between the labels and predictions for the in-distribution method (0.959) and moderate R2 values for the out-of-distribution and country-based cross-validation methods (0.513 and 0.574, respectively) using random forest and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) regression. Although these models may be used to predict confirmed infection growth, the differing accuracies obtained from the three tasks suggest a strong influence of the use case.

Pregnant multiparous sows and their litters were allocated to one of 3 treatment groups: Group 1C6 serum antibody-negative sows and a subset (n = 11) of their piglets. Group 2C8 serum antibody-positive sows and their 91 piglets. Piglets were orally inoculated with PEDV at 4 (Group 1) or 2 (Group 2) days of age. Group 3C2 PEDV serum antibody-negative sows and 22 piglets, provided a baseline for piglet survivability and growth rate. Piglets were monitored daily for clinical signs, body weight, and body temperature through day post-inoculation (DPI) 12 (Groups 2 and 3) or 14 (Group 1). Serum and mammary secretions were tested for PEDV IgG, IgA, and virus-neutralizing antibody. Feces were tested by PEDV real-time, reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR). Piglets on sows without (Group 1) or with (Group 2) anti-PEDV antibody showed significantly different responses to PEDV infection in virus shedding (p < 0.05), thermoregulation (p < 0.05), growth rate (p < 0.05), and survivability (p < 0.0001). Specifically, Group 1 piglets shed more virus on DPIs 1 to 5, were hypothermic at all sampling points except DPIs 9, 11, and 12, gained weight more slowly, and exhibited lower survivability than Group 2 piglets. Within Group 2 litters, significant differences were found in virus shedding (p < 0.05), and body temperature (p < 0.05), but not in piglet survival rate. The number of sows and litters in Group 2 was insufficient to derive the relationship between specific levels of lactogenic antibody (FFN, IgA, and IgG) and the amelioration of clinical effects.

Presence of SARS-CoV-2 in human feces and its passage to sewage system is an emerging concern for public health. Pieces of evidence of the occurrence of viral RNA in feces and municipal wastewater (sewage) systems have not only warned reinforcing the treatment facilities but also suggest that these systems can be monitored to get epidemiological data for checking trend of COVID-19 infection in the community. This review summarizes the occurrence and persistence of novel coronavirus in sewage with an emphasis on the possible water environment contamination. Monitoring of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) via sewage-based epidemiology could deliver promising information regarding rate of infection providing a valid and complementary tool for tracking and diagnosing COVID-19 across communities. Tracking the sewage systems could act as an early warning tool for alerting the public health authorities for necessary actions. Given the impracticality of testing every citizen with limited diagnostic resources, it is imperative that sewage-based epidemiology can be tested as an early warning system.

The hypothesis for this study was that opioid antagonism in the parabrachial nucleus/K?lliker-Fuse complex plus pre-B?tzinger complex completely reverses respiratory depression from clinically relevant opioid concentrations. METHODS Experiments were performed in 48 adult, artificially ventilated, decerebrate rabbits. The authors decreased baseline respiratory rate ~50% with intravenous, \\"analgesic\\" remifentanil infusion or produced apnea with remifentanil boluses and investigated the reversal with naloxone microinjections (1 mM, 700 nl) into the K?lliker-Fuse nucleus, parabrachial nucleus, and pre-B?tzinger complex. In another group of animals, naloxone was injected only into the pre-B?tzinger complex to determine whether prior parabrachial nucleus/K?lliker-Fuse complex injection impacted the naloxone effect. Last, the -opioid receptor agonist [d-Ala,2N-MePhe,4Gly-ol]-enkephalin (100 M, 700 nl) was injected into the parabrachial nucleus/K?lliker-Fuse complex. The data are presented as medians (25 to 75%). RESULTS Remifentanil infusion reduced the respiratory rate from 36 (31 to 40) to 16 (15 to 21) breaths/min. Naloxone microinjections into the bilateral K?lliker-Fuse nucleus, parabrachial nucleus, and pre-B?tzinger complex increased the rate to 17 (16 to 22, n = 19, P = 0.005), 23 (19 to 29, n = 19, P < 0.001), and 25 (22 to 28) breaths/min (n = 11, P < 0.001), respectively. Naloxone injection into the parabrachial nucleus/K?lliker-Fuse complex prevented apnea in 12 of 17 animals, increasing the respiratory rate to 10 (0 to 12) breaths/min (P < 0.001); subsequent pre-B?tzinger complex injection prevented apnea in all animals (13 [10 to 19] breaths/min, n = 12, P = 0.002). Naloxone injection into the pre-B?tzinger complex alone increased the respiratory rate to 21 (15 to 26) breaths/min during analgesic concentrations (n = 10, P = 0.008) but not during apnea (0 [0 to 0] breaths/min, n = 9, P = 0.500). [d-Ala,2N-MePhe,4Gly-ol]-enkephalin injection into the parabrachial nucleus/K?lliker-Fuse complex decreased respiratory rate to 3 (2 to 6) breaths/min. CONCLUSIONS Opioid reversal in the parabrachial nucleus/K?lliker-Fuse complex plus pre-B?tzinger complex only partially reversed respiratory depression from analgesic and even less from \\"apneic\\" opioid doses.

Trust in others (people and institutions) varies greatly, both between countries and within countries, and depends on the characteristics of both trustor and trustee, and there are great differences in the extent to which people trust vaccines. However, it is a mistake to think that people who do not trust vaccines are simply ill-informed. There are a range of reasons for rejecting what is often an unexamined narrative about vaccines, namely that vaccines are always desirable. Many people come from communities that have sound reasons for being suspicious of what they are told by governments, business and the medical establishment. COVID-19 and earlier reactions to vaccination health scares show how important high-quality education about vaccines is. Much of that education can take place out of school, but the foundations are laid in school. Vaccine rejection and hesitancy have major global public health implications. Good quality vaccine education should help students understand about relevant biology and the nature of science;it should also be respectful of all students, including those who come from families that reject vaccines or are hesitant about them.","output":"Trust, Science Education and Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although preliminary research has evidenced negative psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population, little research has been carried out examining the interplay among the broader dimensions and correlates of individual distress. Via network analysis, the current study investigated the pathways that underlie some components of psychological distress and their changes over time (during and post COVID-19-related lockdown). METHODS: 1,129 adult participants (79.1% women) completed a two-wave online survey during and after the lockdown, and reported on variables such as depression, anxiety, stress, fear of COVID, intolerance of uncertainty, emotion regulation and social support. The networks were estimated via Gaussian Graphical Models and their temporal changes were compared through the centrality measures. RESULTS: Depression, stress, anxiety and fear of COVID formed a spatially contiguous pattern, which remained unchanged in both the two waves. After the lockdown, the fear of COVID node reduced its strength in the network, whereas inhibitory intolerance of uncertainty and emotion suppression were associated with depression. Emotion regulation was connected to depression, but not to stress and anxiety during both waves. Perceived emotional support had few connections to the other nodes. LIMITATIONS: Only 32.7% of participants provided complete responses for both waves. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant psychosocial impact on adults. In the context of the network approach, depressive symptoms had the highest strength and their associations to other dimensions of individual distress may be key factors in understanding the influence of exposure to the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health.","output":"Psychological distress associated with the COVID-19 lockdown: A two-wave network analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Myocardial dysfunction and coronary artery dilation have been reported in the acute setting of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease-2-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.

This study investigates the serum 25-hydroxy-Vit D [25(OH)D] status in healthy US civilians and identifies how the two main sources, sun exposure and dietary Vit D intake, determine the final 25(OH)D levels in individuals. METHODS: A total of 2,360 of participants from The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009C2014 were analyzed. We divided the levels of sun exposure and dietary Vit D intake of all subjects into 10 strata and gave a score ranging from 1 to 10 points, respectively. Scores 1C5 in sun exposure and dietary intake were considered as relatively low exposure groups, whereas scores 6C10 were considered as relatively high exposure groups. Serum Vit D inadequacy was defined as <50 nmol/L. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the associations between sources of Vit D and serum 25(OH)D levels. RESULTS: In relatively low Vit D intake groups (Vit D intake score 1C5), relatively high sun exposure (sun exposure score >5) resulted in higher serum 25(OH)D levels (average 57 nmol/L) compared with relatively low sun exposure (sun exposure score <5) (average 50 nmol/L), whereas this difference became negligible in high intake groups (Vit D intake score 6C10). Moreover, the greatest slope occurred in the low Vit D intake curve (decile 3 of Vit D intake), which shows increased sun exposure time causing the greatest degree of change in serum 25(OH)D level in this group. CONCLUSION: Sun exposure can significantly make up for deficiencies in subjects who consume insufficient dietary Vit D. Compared with the extra cost and time for building habits of Vit D supplementation, moderate sun exposure appears to be a simple and costless means for the public to start in daily practice.","output":"Moderate Sun Exposure Is the Complementor in Insufficient Vitamin D Consumers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since early March 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic across the United Kingdom has led to a range of social distancing policies, which have resulted in reduced mobility across different regions. Crowd level data on mobile phone usage can be used as a proxy for actual population mobility patterns and provide a way of quantifying the impact of social distancing measures on changes in mobility. Methods: Here, we use two mobile phone-based datasets (anonymised and aggregated crowd level data from O2 and from the Facebook app on mobile phones) to assess changes in average mobility, both overall and broken down into high and low population density areas, and changes in the distribution of journey lengths. Results: We show that there was a substantial overall reduction in mobility, with the most rapid decline on the 24th March 2020, the day after the Prime Minister's announcement of an enforced lockdown. The reduction in mobility was highly synchronized across the UK. Although mobility has remained low since 26th March 2020, we detect a gradual increase since that time. We also show that the two different datasets produce similar trends, albeit with some location-specific differences. We see slightly larger reductions in average mobility in high-density areas than in low-density areas, with greater variation in mobility in the high-density areas: some high-density areas eliminated almost all mobility.

However, there is paucity of data from the United States, particularly from a predominantly black population. We report the phenotype and outcomes of AKI at an academic hospital in New Orleans. Methods We conducted an observational study in patients hospitalized at Ochsner Medical Center over a 1-month period with COVID-19 and diagnosis of AKI (KDIGO). We examined the rates of RRT and in-hospital mortality as outcome measures. Results Among 575 admissions (70% black) with COVID-19 [173 (30%) to an intensive care unit (ICU)], we found 161 (28%) cases of AKI (61% ICU and 14% general ward admissions). Patients were predominantly men (62%) and hypertensive (83%). Median body mass index (BMI) was higher among those with AKI (34 versus 31 kg/m2, P<0.0001). AKI over preexisting CKD occurred in 35%. Median follow-up was 25 (1-45) days. The in-hospital mortality rate for the AKI cohort was 50%. Vasopressors and/or mechanical ventilation were required in 105 (65%) of those with AKI. RRT was required in 89 (55%) patients. Those with AKI requiring RRT (AKI-RRT) had higher median BMI (35 versus 33 kg/m2, P=0.05) and younger age (61 versus 68, P=0.0003). Initial values of ferritin, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and lactate dehydrogenase were higher among those with AKI; and among them, values were higher for those with AKI-RRT. Ischemic acute tubular injury (ATI) and rhabdomyolysis accounted for 66% and 7% of causes, respectively. In 13%, no obvious cause of AKI was identified aside from COVID-19 diagnosis. Conclusions CoV-AKI is associated with high rates of RRT and death. Higher BMI and inflammatory marker levels are associated with AKI as well as with AKI-RRT.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of all patients admitted to two tertiary care centers between March 15 and May 15, 2020, with a diagnosis of COVID-19. From a common database prepared for COVID-19, we retrieved the relevant data and compared the clinical findings and outcomes of PCR-positive patients with those of PCR-negative cases who had been diagnosed on the basis of typical clinical and radiographic findings. RESULTS: A total of 349 patients were included in the analysis, of which 126 (36.1%) were PCR-negative. PCR-negative patients were younger (54.6  20.8 vs. 60.8  18.9 years, P = .009) but were similar to PCR-positive patients in terms of demographics, comorbidities, and presenting symptoms. They had higher lymphocyte counts (1519  868 vs. 1331  737/mm3, P = .02) and less frequently presented with bilateral radiographic findings (68.3% vs. 79.4%, P = .046) than PCR-positive patients.

Despite extensive progress, there remains a need for treatments to bolster the immune responses in infected immunocompromised individuals, such as cancer patients who recently underwent a haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Immunological protection against COVID-19 is mediated by both short-lived neutralizing antibodies and long-lasting virus-reactive T cells. Therefore, we propose that T cell therapy may augment efficacy of current treatments. For the greatest efficacy with minimal adverse effects, it is important that any cellular therapy is designed to be as specific and directed as possible. Here, we identify T cells from COVID-19 patients with a potentially protective response to two major antigens of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, Spike and Nucleocapsid protein. By generating clones of highly virus-reactive CD4+ T cells, we were able to confirm a set of nine immunodominant epitopes and characterize T cell responses against these. Accordingly, the sensitivity of T cell clones for their specific epitope, as well as the extent and focus of their cytokine response was examined. Moreover, using an advanced T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing approach, we determined the paired TCR-&#945;? sequences of clones of interest. While these data on a limited population require further expansion for universal application, the results presented here form a crucial first step towards TCR-transgenic CD4+ T cell therapy of COVID-19.","output":"Human CD4+ T cells specific for dominant epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins with therapeutic potential"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present the results of our monitoring campaigns of the Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) AT 2020hat in NGC 5068 and AT 2020kog in NGC 6106. The two objects were imaged (and detected) before their discovery by routine survey operations. They show a general trend of slow luminosity rise lasting at least a few months. The subsequent major LRN outbursts were extensively followed in photometry and spectroscopy. The light curves present an initial short-duration peak, followed by a redder plateau phase. AT 2020kog is a moderately luminous event peaking at ~7x10^40 erg/s, while AT 2020hat is almost one order of magnitude fainter than AT 2020kog, although still more luminous than V838 Mon. In analogy with other LRNe, the spectra of AT 2020kog change significantly with time. They resemble those of Type IIn supernovae at early phases, then they become similar to those of K-type stars during the plateau, and to M-type stars at very late phases. In contrast, AT 2020hat shows a redder continuum already at early epochs, and its spectrum shows the late appearance of molecular bands. A moderate-resolution spectrum of AT 2020hat taken at +37 d after maximum shows a forest of narrow P Cygni lines of metals with velocities of 180 km/s, along with an Halpha emission with a full-width at half-maximum velocity of 250 km/s. For AT 2020hat, a robust constraint on its quiescent progenitor is provided by archival images of the Hubble Space Telescope. The progenitor is clearly detected as a mid-K type star, with an absolute magnitude M_F606W=-3.33+-0.09 mag and a colour F606W-F814W=1.14+-0.05 mag, which are inconsistent with the expectations from a massive star that could later produce a core-collapse supernova.

Plasma and urine samples after single and multiple doses were collected and analyzed for talazoparib using validated assays. Plasma PK data from all patients were analyzed using population PK method. Plasma and urine PK parameters in PK-evaluable patients were calculated using non-compartmental analysis (NCA). Safety was monitored in all enrolled patients. RESULTS: 38 patients were enrolled; 37 had 1 PK concentration, among which 17 were evaluable for NCA. Population PK analysis (n = 37) indicated no significant impact of hepatic function on apparent clearance (CL/F) of talazoparib.

Social justice also requires greater and more-sustained attention to disaster preparedness and public health infrastructure-both of which are characteristically neglected, in part because the public health enterprise is identified with politically weak and often stigmatized populations.","output":"Disaster Preparedness and Social Justice in a Public Health Emergency."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to be a significant public health challenge globally. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, and the understanding of what constitutes expressed RNAseq variants in healthy, convalescent, severe, moderate and to those admitted at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is yet to be presented. We set to characterize the different expressed RNAseq variants in healthy, severe, moderate, ICU, and convalescent individuals. Materials and methodsThe bulk RNA sequencing data with identifier PRJNA639275 was download from Sequence Reads Archive (SRA). The individuals were divided into: (i) healthy, n=34, severe, n=16, ICU, n=8, moderate, n=8, and convalescent, n=2. Fastqc version 0.11.9 and Cutadapt version 3.7 was used to asses the reads quality and to perform adapter trimming respectively. STAR was using to align reads to the reference genome and GATK best practice was followed to call variants using rnavar pipeline, part of the nf-core pipelines. ResultsOur analysis demonstrated that convalescent, moderate, severe and those admitted to the ICU are characterized by different sets of unique RNAseq variants. The data shows that the individuals who recover from SARS-CoV-2 infection have the same set of expressed variants as in the healthy controls. We showed that the healthy and SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals display different sets of expressed varinats which is characteristic of the patient phenotype. ConclusionThe individuals with severe, moderate, those admitted at the ICU, and convalescent individuals display a unique set of variants. The findings in this study will inform the test kit development and SARS-CoV-2 patients classification to enhance management and control of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our population.","output":"RNAseq analysis reveals prominent and distinct expressed variants that are related to disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with mild-to-severe disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Histological, cytochemical and ultrastructural changes in giant black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon were investigated at various time intervals after injection with yellow head virus (YHV). Hemocytes, lymphoid organs (LO) and gills were the main focus of the study. After injection with YHV, onset of mortality varied from 36 h onward. By normal hematoxylin and eosin staining, the 3 tissues showed clear and increasing prevalence of nuclear condensation, pyknosis and karyorrhexis from approximately 36 h post-injection (p.i.) until death, although pathology was evident in the LO as early as 12 h p.i. in some shrimp. By nuclear DNA staining with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and by specific labeling of 3'-OH ends of nuclear DNA using a technique called terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxy-UTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), cells of the 3 tissues showed evidence of chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation, respectively. Both are generally considered to be characteristic of apoptosis. In addition to TUNEL labeling, evidence for DNA fragmentation was supported by the appearance of approximately 200 base pair DNA ladders at approximately 48 h p.i. in hemocytes of YHV-infected but not uninfected shrimp. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of LO tissue revealed features of apoptosis in tissues of YHV-infected shrimp only. These included marginated, condensed and fragmented chromatin without concurrent cytoplasmic damage. Histological, cytochemical, ultrastructural and biochemical data were consistent with the hypothesis that widespread and progressive apoptosis occurred in susceptible shrimp infected with YHV. Although no specific tests were carried out to determine whether this purported apoptosis was the cause of mortality, moribund shrimp had extensive deterioration of vital tissues such as the hemolymph, gills, heart and LO, suggesting that many essential bodily functions had been severely compromised. This probably resulted in the gross signs of lethargy and weakness seen, and it is reasonable to suggest that further, progressive deterioration could have led to the collapse of vital functions followed by death.","output":"Evidence for apoptosis correlated with mortality in the giant black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon infected with yellow head virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For fast development of COVID-19, it is only feasible to use drugs (off label use) or approved natural products that are already registered or been assessed for safety in previous human trials.

Older adults (N = 169, aged 61-94 years; 93% cognitively normal) completed four brief smartphone-based testing sessions per day for 7 consecutive days at quasi-random time intervals, assessing associate memory, processing speed, and visual working memory. Scores completed during early hours were averaged for comparison with averaged scores completed during later hours. Mixed effects models evaluated time of day effects on cognition. Additional models included clinical status and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for beta amyloid (A42) and phosphorylated tau181 (pTau). Models with terms for age, gender, education, APOE 4 status, and clinical status revealed significantly worse performance on associate memory in evening hours compared to morning hours. Contemporaneously reported mood and fatigue levels did not moderate relationships. Using CSF data to classify individuals with and without significant AD pathology, there were no group differences in performance in morning hours, but subtle impairment emerged in associate memory in evening hours in those with CSF-confirmed AD pathology. These findings indicate that memory is worse in evening hours in older adults, that this pattern is consistent across several days, and is independent of measures of mood and fatigue.

Since 2012, the naloxone Buyers Club facilitated purchase of low-cost naloxone by harm reduction and syringe service programs, the primary conduits for reaching people who use drugs. This innovative purchasing and mutual aid network has not been previously described. Methods We analyzed transactional records of naloxone orders (2017-2020, n=965), a survey of current Buyers Club members (2020, n=104), and mutual aid requests (2021, n=86). Results Between 2017 and 2020, annual orders for naloxone increased 2.6-fold. 114 unique harm reduction programs from 40 states placed orders for 3,714,110 vials of 0.4 mg/mL generic naloxone through the Buyers Club. States with most orders were: Arizona (600,000 vials), Illinois (576,800), Minnesota (347,450), California (317,200), North Carolina (315,040). Among programs that ordered naloxone in 2020, 52% (n=32) received no federal funding and ordered half as much as funded programs. During the 2021 shortage, mutual aid redistribution was common, with 80% participating as either a donor or recipient. Among 59 mutual aid requestors, 59% (n=35) were willing to accept expired naloxone; the clear preference was for generic injectable naloxone, 95% (n=56). Conclusions The naloxone Buyers Club is a critical element of overdose prevention infrastructure. Yet, barriers from corporate compliance officers and federal prescription-only status impede access.

The presence of HLH was described in severely ill patients during the H1N1 influenza epidemic, presenting with pulmonary vascular thrombosis. We tested the hypothesis that genes causing primary HLH regulate pathways linking pulmonary thromboembolism to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using novel network-informed computational algorithms. This approach led to the identification of Neutrophils Extracellular Traps (NETs) as plausible mediators of vascular thrombosis in severe COVID-19 in children and adults. Taken together, the network-informed analysis led us to propose the following model: the release of NETs in response to inflammatory signals acting in concert with SARS-CoV-2 damage the endothelium and direct platelet-activation promoting abnormal coagulation leading to serious complications of COVID-19. The underlying hypothesis is that genetic and/or environmental conditions that favor the release of NETs may predispose individuals to thrombotic complications of COVID-19 due to an increase risk of abnormal coagulation. This would be a common pathogenic mechanism in conditions including autoimmune/infectious diseases, hematologic and metabolic disorders.","output":"A network-informed analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis genes interactions points to Neutrophil extracellular traps as mediators of thrombosis in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding of aerosol dispersion characteristics has many scientific and engineering applications.

There are known educational demands and variations in surgical practice in endoscopic transsphenoidal approaches to pituitary adenomas. Through an iterative consensus process, we generated a surgical workflow reflective of contemporary surgical practice. METHODS: A mixed-methods consensus process composed of a literature review and iterative Delphi surveys was carried out within the Pituitary Society. Each round of the survey was repeated until data saturation and > 90% consensus was reached. RESULTS: There was a 100% response rate and no attrition across both Delphi rounds. Eighteen international expert panel members participated. An extensive workflow of 4 phases (nasal, sphenoid, sellar and closure) and 40 steps, with associated technical errors and adverse events, were agreed upon by 100% of panel members across rounds. Both core and case-specific or surgeon-specific variations in operative steps were captured. CONCLUSIONS: Through an international expert panel consensus, a workflow for the performance of endoscopic transsphenoidal pituitary adenoma resection has been generated. This workflow captures a wide range of contemporary operative practice. The agreed core steps will serve as a foundation for education, training, assessment and technological development (e.g. models and simulators). The optional steps highlight areas of heterogeneity of practice that will benefit from further research (e.g. methods of skull base repair).

Co-exposure to MWCNTs and heavy metal ions is common during water disposal. However, the hepatotoxicity of co-exposure to MWCNTs and lead ions for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) subjects has not been investigated. NAFLD mice were fed intragastrically with MWCNTs and lead acetate (PbAc). Combined administration of MWCNTs and PbAc significantly damaged the liver function, and aggravated the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis phenotype as well as the hepatic fibrosis and steatosis in NAFLD mice. Furthermore, MWCNTs and PbAc significantly induced apoptosis in primary hepatocytes isolated from NAFLD mice. Combined administration of MWCNTs and PbAc also resulted in hepatic lipid peroxidation by inducing antioxidant defense system dysfunction, and significantly enhanced the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in NAFLD mice livers. Meanwhile, combined administration of MWCNTs and PbAc may exert its hepatotoxicity in the NAFLD via inhibiting the adenosine 5'-monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ?3 (PPAR?3) pathway.

Although there are numerous potential mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated AKI, our current knowledge of kidney pathologic findings in COVID-19 is limited. METHODS We examined the postmortem kidneys from 42 patients who died of COVID-19. We reviewed light microscopy findings in all autopsies and performed immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and in situ hybridization studies for SARS-CoV-2 on a subset of samples. RESULTS The cohort had a median age of 71.5 years (range, 38-97 years); 69% were men, 57% were Hispanic, and 73% had a history of hypertension. Among patients with available data, AKI developed in 31 of 33 patients (94%), including 6 with AKI stage 1, 9 with stage 2, and 16 with stage 3. The predominant finding correlating with AKI was acute tubular injury. However, the degree of acute tubular injury was often less severe than predicted for the degree of AKI, suggesting a role for hemodynamic factors, such as aggressive fluid management. Background changes of hypertensive arterionephrosclerosis and diabetic glomerulosclerosis were frequent but typically mild. We identified focal kidney fibrin thrombi in 6 of 42 (14%) autopsies. A single Black patient had collapsing FSGS. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were largely unrevealing, and in situ hybridization for SARS-CoV-2 showed no definitive positivity. CONCLUSIONS Among a cohort of 42 patients dying with COVID-19, autopsy histologic evaluation revealed acute tubular injury, which was typically mild relative to the degree of creatinine elevation.

The precise glucosylation at C-3 OH of pentacyclic triterpenoids mediated by uridine 5'-diphospho-glucosyltransferase (UDP-glucosyltransferase [UGT]) is an important way to produce valuable derivatives with various improved functions. However, most reported UGTs suffer from low regiospecificity toward the OH and COOH groups of pentacyclic triterpenoids, which significantly decreases the reaction efficiency. Here, two new UGTs (UGT73C33 and UGT73F24) were discovered in Glycyrrhiza uralensis. UGT73C33 showed high activity but poor regioselectivity toward the C-3 OH and C-30 COOH of pentacyclic triterpenoid, producing three glucosides. UGT73F24 showed rigid regioselectivity toward C-3 OH of typical pentacyclic triterpenoids producing only C-3 O-glucosylated derivatives.

Stratified analyses by stillbirth 28 weeks' gestation, studies published prior to 2013 and studies identified as low quality demonstrated a significantly higher odds of stillbirth in meta-regression (p = 0.016, 0.023 and 0.005, respectively). Egger's test for all included cohort studies (p = 0.018) suggests publication bias for the main meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION Given the substantial heterogeneity across studies, there are insufficient data to define the relationship between stillbirth and gestational diabetes adequately. In the main analyes, gestational diabetes was not associated with an increased risk of stillbirth. However, heterogeneity across studies means this finding should be interpreted cautiously.","output":"The association between gestational diabetes and stillbirth: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has changed the paradigms for disease surveillance and rapid deployment of scientific-based evidence for understanding disease biology, susceptibility, and treatment.

Xin guan No.1 (XG-1) prescription is a preventive formula recommended by the Hunan Provincial Administration of TCM to prevent the pandemic of COVID-19. AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the potential preventive mechanisms of XG-1 against COVID-19 in the combination of network pharmacology approach, single-cell RNA expression profiling analysis, molecular docking and retrospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine (ETCM) database was used to determine the meridian tropism, active components and target genes of XG-1. Gene ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analysis were conducted by R Cluster Profiler package (3.14.3). Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of human lung (GSE122960) was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and analyzed by R Seurat package (3.1.2). Cytoscape (3.7.2) was used to construct the interaction network. The main ingredients in XG-1 were identified by HPLC- Q-TOF- MS and used for molecular docking with COVID-19 3CL hydrolytic enzyme and angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). A retrospective study of 47 close contact participants from Dongtang Community of Hunan Province was conducted to evaluated the preventive effect of XG-1. RESULTS: According to the network pharmacology analysis, XG-1 formula was closely related to lung-, spleen- and stomach-meridians and include a total of 206 active components and 853 target genes. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment revealed that XG-1 mainly regulated cellular amino acid metabolism process and neuroactive ligand-receptors interaction. The scRNA-seq profiling showed that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was principally expressed in alveolar type 2 epithelial cells (AT2). 153 genes were up-regulated in AT2 cells expressing ACE2 and 12 genes were obtained by intersecting with XG-1 target genes, of which 3 were related to immunity. Five main chemical ingredients were detected in XG-1 sample by HPLC-Q-TOF-MS. The molecular docking showed that Rutin, Liquiritin and Astragaloside a  had a good affinity with COVID-19 3CL hydrolytic enzyme and ACE2. Compared with participants who didn't take XG-1, preventive treatment with XG-1gradules resulted in a significant lower rate of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The present study showed that XG-1 exerts a preventive effect in close contacts against COVID-19. The underlying mechanism may be related to modulate immunity response through multiple components, pathways, and several target genes co-expressed with ACE2. These findings provide preliminary evidences and methodological reference for the potential preventive mechanism of XG-1 against COVID-19.","output":"In silico analysis of the potential mechanism of a preventive Chinese medicine formula on coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Aim of the study was to compare the viral load and clinical status among different age groups with COVID-19 infection Methods & Materials A retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out to analyse the Ct values of positive samples reported during April 2020 till May 2021.

SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from fecal samples, and active viral replication was reported in human intestinal cells. The human gut also harbors an enormous amount of resident viruses (collectively known as the virome) that play a role in regulating host immunity and disease pathophysiology. Understanding gut virome perturbation that underlies SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity is an unmet need. METHODS: We enrolled 98 COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity (3 asymptomatic, 53 mild, 34 moderate, 5 severe, 3 critical) and 78 non-COVID-19 controls matched for gender and co-morbidities. All subjects had fecal specimens sampled at inclusion. Blood specimens were collected for COVID-19 patients at admission to test for inflammatory markers and white cell counts. Among COVID-19 cases, 37 (38%) patients had serial fecal samples collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until after discharge. Using shotgun metagenomics sequencing, we sequenced and profiled the fecal RNA and DNA virome. We investigated alterations and longitudinal dynamics of the gut virome in association with disease severity and blood parameters. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 showed underrepresentation of Pepper mild mottle virus (RNA virus) and multiple bacteriophage lineages (DNA viruses) and enrichment of environment-derived eukaryotic DNA viruses in fecal samples, compared to non-COVID-19 subjects. Such gut virome alterations persisted up to 30 days after disease resolution. Fecal virome in SARS-CoV-2 infection harbored more stress-, inflammation-, and virulence-associated gene encoding capacities including those pertaining to bacteriophage integration, DNA repair, and metabolism and virulence associated with their bacterial host. Baseline fecal abundance of 10 virus species (1 RNA virus, pepper chlorotic spot virus, and 9 DNA virus species) inversely correlated with disease COVID-19 severity. These viruses inversely correlated with blood levels of pro-inflammatory proteins, white cells, and neutrophils. Among the 10 COVID-19 severity-associated DNA virus species, 4 showed inverse correlation with age; 5 showed persistent lower abundance both during disease course and after disease resolution relative to non-COVID-19 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Both enteric RNA and DNA virome in COVID-19 patients were different from non-COVID-19 subjects, which persisted after disease resolution of COVID-19. Gut virome may calibrate host immunity and regulate severity to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our observation that gut viruses inversely correlated with both severity of COVID-19 and host age may partly explain that older subjects are prone to severe and worse COVID-19 outcomes. Altogether, our data highlight the importance of human gut virome in severity and potentially therapeutics of COVID-19.

In particular, individuals can obtain different types of information about the disease and respond by altering their behaviors, and this can affect the spreading dynamics, possibly in a significant way. We propose a model where individuals' behavioral response is based on a generic type of local information, i.e., the number of neighbors that has been infected with the disease. Mathematically, the response can be characterized by a reduction in the transmission rate by a factor that depends on the number of infected neighbors. Utilizing the standard susceptible-infected-susceptible and susceptible-infected-recovery dynamical models for epidemic spreading, we derive a theoretical formula for the epidemic threshold and provide numerical verification. Our analysis lays on a solid quantitative footing the intuition that individual behavioral response can in general suppress epidemic spreading. Furthermore, we find that the hub nodes play the role of double-edged sword in that they can either suppress or promote outbreak, depending on their responses to the epidemic, providing additional support for the idea that these nodes are key to controlling epidemic spreading in complex networks.","output":"Suppression of epidemic spreading in complex networks by local information based behavioral responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome are life-threatening conditions that still have no definite pharmacotherapy. Hence, we investigate the potential effectiveness and underlying mechanism of CT-133, a newly developed selective antagonist of prostaglandin D2 receptor 2 (DP2) or of chemoattractant receptor homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2), against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. CT-133 (10 or 30 mg/kg) or dexamethasone (1 mg/kg, positive control) were intragastrically administered 1 h before and 12 h after intratracheal LPS instillation, and primary neutrophils and macrophages and RAW264.7 macrophages were used to investigate the role of CT-133 in regulation of their functions. LPS induced a significant secretion of PGD(2) from primary macrophages, however, CT-133 dose-dependently and markedly decreased the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into lungs, reduced the IL-1, TNF-, IL-6, and KC levels in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluids, decreased the wet weight and myeloperoxidase activity of lungs, reduced Evans blue and albumin exudation into lungs, and improved the lung histopathological changes and hypoxemia. Moreover, CT-133 significantly suppressed the primary neutrophil migration toward the PGD(2) and robustly inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of IL-1, TNF-, IL-6, and KC in primary and RAW264.7 macrophages in response to either LPS- or PGD(2) stimulation. Finally, CT-133 significantly blocked the LPS-induced P65 activation in both RAW264.7 macrophages and mouse lungs. Thus, This is the first report that a CRTH2 antagonist, CT-133, is capable of significantly alleviating LPS-induced lung injury by probably down-regulating the NF-B signalling.","output":"A CRTH2 antagonist, CT-133, suppresses NF-B signalling to relieve lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and social justice movement have highlighted the impact of social determinants of health (SDOH) and structural racism in the United States on both access to care and patient outcomes.

The electronic health record was queried for all computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) studies from December 1, 2019, to October 22, 2020. All ED patients who underwent CTPA had D\\\\dimer and COVID\\\\19 testing completed in a single encounter were included in the study. Baseline demographics were obtained. Test characteristics of D\\\\dimer for PE were calculated for patients with and without COVID\\\\19. Additionally, receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves were constructed for two different D\\\\dimer assays. RESULTS: There were 1158 patient encounters that met criteria for analysis. Performance of D\\\\dimer testing for PE was similar between COVID\\\\19Cpositive and Cnegative patients. In COVID\\\\19Cpositive patients, the sensitivity was 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 87.6%C100%), specificity was 11.9% (95% CI = 7.9%C17.1%), and negative predictive value (NPV) was 100%. In COVID\\\\19Cnegative patients the sensitivity was 97.6% (95% CI = 91.5%C99.7%), specificity was 14.4% (95% CI = 12.1%C17%), and NPV was 98.3% (95% CI = 93.8%C99.6%). For assay 1 the area under the curve (AUC) for COVID\\\\19Cpositive patients was 0.76 (95% CI = 0.68C0.83), and for COVID\\\\19Cnegative patients, 0.73 (95% CI = 0.69C0.77).

By introducing modifications at all four positions, we synthesized 20 boceprevir-based MPro inhibitors including PF-07321332 and characterized their MPro inhibition potency in test tubes (in vitro) and human host cells (in cellulo). Crystal structures of MPro bound with 10 inhibitors and antiviral potency of 4 inhibitors were characterized as well. Replacing the P1 site with a {beta}-(S-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl)-alanyl (opal) residue and the warhead with an aldehyde leads to high in vitro potency. The original moieties at P2, P3 and the P4 N-terminal cap positions in boceprevir are better than other tested chemical moieties for high in vitro potency. In crystal structures, all inhibitors form a covalent adduct with the MPro active site cysteine. The P1 opal residue, P2 dimethylcyclopropylproline and P4 N-terminal tert-butylcarbamide make strong hydrophobic interactions with MPro, explaining high in vitro potency of inhibitors that contain these moieties. A unique observation was made with an inhibitor that contains an P4 N-terminal isovaleramide. In its MPro complex structure, the P4 N-terminal isovaleramide is tucked deep in a small pocket of MPro that originally recognizes a P4 alanine side chain in a substrate. Although all inhibitors show high in vitro potency, they have drastically different in cellulo potency in inhibiting ectopically expressed MPro in human 293T cells. All inhibitors including PF-07321332 with a P4 N-terminal carbamide or amide have low in cellulo potency. This trend is reversed when the P4 N-terminal cap is changed to a carbamate. The installation of a P3 O-tert-butyl-threonine improves in cellulo potency. Three molecules that contain a P4 N-terminal carbamate were advanced to antiviral tests on three SARS-CoV-2 variants.

The referral data can be used to give immediate monthly feedback to the referring department to further improving patient flow. METHOD: Prospective data was collected for all referrals to VFC during March 2020. Data included referral diagnosis, actual diagnosis, referrers grade, and final outcome. RESULTS: 630 referrals were made to VFC. 347 (55%) of those referrals were directly discharged without the need for physical consultation. Of these 114 (32%) were injuries which can be discharged by the Emergency Department with an advice leaflet using existing pathways. Of the remaining discharges 102 (29%) were query fractures or sprains; and 135 (39%) were minor fractures; which needed only advice via a letter and no face to face follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of VFC leads to a decrease in physical appointments by 55% saving 347 face to face appointments. The new system has also facilitated effective audit of referrals in order to further improve patient flow from the Emergency Department via feedback mechanisms and education.","output":"688 Rapid Implementation of Virtual Fracture Clinic During COVID 19 Reduces Both Face-To-Face Appointments and Facilitates Rapid Feedback and Education to Be Delivered to The Emergency Department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Sars-Cov-2 pandemic has produced a change in the quality of life of people, both directly and indirectly involved by the virus, and in particular, on individuals belonging to the most vulnerable groups of the population.

However, few studies have focused on the efficacy of this biologic for the treatment of SA in a real-world setting. METHODS: From April 2019 to December 2021, 26 Japanese patients with SA received dupilumab at Jikei University Hospital. We retrospectively evaluated the number of moderate-to-severe exacerbations, pulmonary function, maintenance dose of corticosteroids, biomarkers, and adverse events. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up period of 12.6 months, 10 patients received dupilumab as the first biologic, and 16 switched to dupilumab from other biologics. Dupilumab treatment significantly reduced the number of annual exacerbations from 3.4  4.1 to 1.6  2.7 (/person-year, p < 0.01) at the last follow-up regardless of previous biologic use. The Asthma Control Test score significantly improved in all patients by six months after administration but tended to worsen by 24 months in patients with previous biologic use. On the other hand, blood eosinophil counts (BECs) transiently increased and peaked three to six months after administration. The peak timing can be affected by previous biologic use. Adverse events included wheezing immediately after injection, hypereosinophilia, mild conjunctivitis, and relapse of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia in the patient switched from benralizumab. CONCLUSION: Dupilumab treatment was useful for patients with SA in a real-world setting.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional observational study of patients with active epilepsy and COVID-19. A control group was used to compare the cumulative incidence and case-fatality rate (CFR). The main outcomes of the study were cumulative incidence, defined as number of patients with active epilepsy and COVID-19 admitted to an emergency department divided by the total number of patients with epilepsy at risk, and CFR based on the number of deaths during the enrollment period. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate risk factors for fatality in patients with active epilepsy. RESULTS: Of the 1,537 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 21 (1.3%) had active epilepsy. The cumulative incidence (95% confidence interval [CI]) of COVID-19 in patients with epilepsy was higher (1.2% [0.6-2.4]) compared to the population without epilepsy (0.5% [0.5-0.5]). In reverse transcription PCR-positive patients, there were no significant differences in CFR in patients with active epilepsy compared to patients without epilepsy (33.3% vs 8.3%; p = 0.266). Of the 21 patients with active epilepsy, 5 (23%) died. In multivariate analysis, the factor associated with fatality in patients with active epilepsy was hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 2.8 [95% CI 1.3-21.6]).

In order to provide a basis for clinical diagnosis, this study retrospectively analyzed the imaging characteristics, evolution and related imaging manifestations of COVID-19 patients in different stages of the disease. The results suggest that the imaging findings of 48 COVID-19 patients from Hengyang, Hunan Province are comparable in different stages of the disease. Chest CT showed no pneumonia in one mild patient. Chest CT findings of moderate type (n=38) and severe type (n=9) had comparable characteristics. The main manifestations were ground-glass opacity (GGO) (18/38, 47.37%; 1/9, 11.11%), and GGO with consolidation (16/38, 42.11%; 5/9, 55.56%), which respectively presented in bilateral lungs (34/38, 89.47%; 9/9, 100.00%), and multi-lobe distribution (involving 5 lobes) (17/38, 44.74%; 8/9, 88.89%).

South Korea has reported the lowest death rate with the majority of the deaths, associated with persons with underlying health conditions or elderly infected individuals. Currently the infected patients (total 989) remaining in South Korea are mild cases owing to its robust health care system and quarantine inspection procedures followed by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of South Korea to flatten the COVID-19 curve. Although the COVID-19 countermeasures taken by the South Korean government may not be conclusive or universal for all, but its exemplary approach to tackle COVID-19 can aid countries across the globe to strengthen their response system for the future outbreak of such an infectious disease.

The flow cytometry analysis, measurement of OCR and ROS were performed to investigate the mitochondrial function. Histological analysis, quantitative PCR and ChIP were performed to analyze the target genes of YY1 in -cells. RESULTS Our results showed that loss of YY1 resulted in reduction of insulin production, -cell mass and glucose tolerance in mice. Ablation of YY1 led to defective ATP production and mitochondrial ROS accumulation in pancreatic -cells. The inactivation of YY1 impaired the activity of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, induced mitochondrial dysfunction and diabetes in mouse models.

The standard diagnosis is based on isolation of the fungi in culture, and by microscopic visualization of characteristic multiple budding yeast cells in biological samples. However, in some situations, access to the site of injury prevents the collection of biological material. A variety of immuno-serological techniques has proven useful for allowing inferring diagnosis with a certain degree of certainty, thus optimizing time. The aim of this study was to standardize and validate the Dot-ELISA (DE) assay, comparing it with the serological standard, double immunodiffusion (DI). Methods In order to standardize the DE assay, 143 serum samples were used. Out of those, 23 were from apparently healthy patients, 77 were from patients with confirmed PCM and 43 were from patients with other lung infections (tuberculosis, aspergillosis and histoplasmosis). To validate the DE technique, 300 serum samples from patients with PCM clinical suspicion (probable and possible cases) were employed, and these results were compared with those of DI. Results The DE assay showed sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 95.4%, positive predictive value of 96%, negative predictive value of 98.2%, accuracy of 93%, and great precision (k = 0.93). In addition, the nitrocellulose membranes have proved to be viable for using at least 90 days after P. brasiliensis B-339 antigen sensitization. Conclusion Dot-ELISA method was found to be an extremely promising tool as serologic screening technique, because of its high sensitivity. Furthermore, Dot-ELISA shows the prospect of being transferred to laboratories of mycoserology including those with fewer resources or even to be used directly in the field. It has an excellent shelf life - membranes coated with antigen can be used for testing without changes in the pattern of reactivity among laboratories - and presents reliable values of sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, accuracy and a high correlation with the serological standard methodology.

Previous studies have shown how it is done in the normal classroom setting, and that the practice of differentiated instruction contributes to students motivation as well as academic performance. However, there is a need to explore how do teachers go about with online differentiated instruction and how does it affect the students, since online learning poses various threads to both teachers and students;and thus, one might argue the effectiveness of not only the teaching approach but also the overall teaching and learning outcomes. Borgs framework of teacher cognition, which has been extensively used in exploring how teachers teach, can be utilized to document the practice of online differentiated instruction.

This approach adapts the superpixel approach to reduce a large amount of spatial information. The original cuckoo search approach is modified and the Luus-Jaakola heuristic method is incorporated with McCullochs approach. This modified cuckoo search approach is used to optimize the fuzzy modified objective function. This objective function exploits the advantages of the superpixel. Both CT scan and X-ray images are investigated in detail. Both qualitative and quantitative outcomes are quite promising and prove the efficiency and the real-life applicability of the proposed approach.","output":"Sufmacs: a machine learning-based robust image segmentation framework for covid-19 radiological image interpretation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This critical essay responds to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown in Victoria from the perspective of a retired Aboriginal academic and reflects on personal responsibility, Indigenous history, and resilience.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic: The Circus is Over, for the Moment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several people around the world have died from the coronavirus (COVID-19) disease.

We tested the hypothesis that sociodemographic, access to health care, and presentation to care characteristics among individuals with diabetes in Mexico confer an additional risk of hospitalization with COVID-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using public data from the General Directorate of Epidemiology of the Mexican Ministry of Health. We included individuals with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 between 1 March and 31 July 2020. The primary outcome was the predicted probability of hospitalization, inclusive of 8.5% of patients who required intensive care unit admission. RESULTS: Among 373,963 adults with COVID-19, 16.1% (95% CI 16.0C16.3) self-reported diabetes. The predicted probability of hospitalization was 38.4% (37.6C39.2) for patients with diabetes only and 42.9% (42.2C43.7) for patients with diabetes and one or more comorbidities (obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease). High municipality-level of social deprivation and low state-level health care resources were associated with a 9.5% (6.3C12.7) and 17.5% (14.5C20.4) increased probability of hospitalization among patients with diabetes, respectively. In age-, sex-, and comorbidity-adjusted models, living in a context of high social vulnerability and low health care resources was associated with the highest predicted probability of hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Social vulnerability contributes considerably to the probability of hospitalization among individuals with COVID-19 and diabetes with associated comorbidities.

Apical (canalicular) transporters extrude compounds to the bile, while basolateral hepatocyte transporters promote the uptake of, or expel, various compounds from/into the venous blood stream. In the present work we have examined the in vitro interactions of some key repurposed drugs advocated to treat COVID-19 (lopinavir, ritonavir, ivermectin, remdesivir and favipiravir), with the key drug transporters of hepatocytes. These transporters included ABCB11/BSEP, ABCC2/MRP2, and SLC47A1/MATE1 in the canalicular membrane, as well as ABCC3/MRP3, ABCC4/MRP4, SLC22A1/OCT1, SLCO1B1/OATP1B1, SLCO1B3/OATP1B3, and SLC10A1/NTCP, residing in the basolateral membrane. Lopinavir and ritonavir in low micromolar concentrations inhibited BSEP and MATE1 exporters, as well as OATP1B1/1B3 uptake transporters. Ritonavir had a similar inhibitory pattern, also inhibiting OCT1. Remdesivir strongly inhibited MRP4, OATP1B1/1B3, MATE1 and OCT1. Favipiravir had no significant effect on any of these transporters. Since both general drug metabolism and drug-induced liver toxicity are strongly dependent on the functioning of these transporters, the various interactions reported here may have important clinical relevance in the drug treatment of this viral disease and the existing co-morbidities.","output":"Interactions of anti-COVID-19 drug candidates with hepatic transporters may cause liver toxicity and affect pharmacokinetics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Scrum is the most commonly used agile software development method, and the role of the Scrum Master (SM) in a Scrum environment is vital.

By bridging split-and-pool combinatorial synthesis with the ligation of unique encoding DNA oligomers, million- to billion-member libraries can be synthesized for use in hundreds of healthcare target screens. Although structural diversity and desirable molecular property ranges generally guide DNA-encoded chemical library design, recent reports have highlighted the utility of focused DNA-encoded chemical libraries that are structurally biased for a class of protein targets. Herein, a protease-focused DNA-encoded chemical library was designed that utilizes chemotypes known to engage conserved catalytic protease residues. The three-cycle library features functional moieties such as guanidine, which interacts strongly with aspartate of the protease catalytic triad, as well as mild electrophiles such as sulfonamide, urea, and carbamate. We developed a DNA-compatible method for guanidinylation of amines and reduction of nitriles. Employing these optimized reactions, we constructed a 9.8-million-membered DNA-encoded chemical library. Affinity selection of the library with thrombin, a common protease, revealed a number of enriched features which ultimately led to the discovery of a 1 nM inhibitor of thrombin. Thus, structurally focused DNA-encoded chemical libraries have tremendous potential to find clinically useful high-affinity hits for the rapid discovery of drugs for targets (e.g., proteases) with essential functions in infectious diseases (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and relevant healthcare conditions (e.g., male contraception).","output":"Discovery of potent thrombin inhibitors from a protease-focused DNA-encoded chemical library"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores the potential for community building within an intergenerational, LGBTQIA+ arts workshop known as Stay Gold I describe my personal experiences as an art educator in such an environment, as well as my journey to finding a community I hope to become a stronger educator through self-reflection and to inspire other educators to seek out communities of their own","output":"The Joy of Finding Community in an Intergenerational LGBTQIA Arts Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND A rapid immune response is critical to ensure effective protection against COVID-19. Platelets are first-line sentinels of the vascular system able to rapidly alert and stimulate the immune system. However, their role in the immune response to vaccines is not known. OBJECTIVE To identify features of the platelet-immune crosstalk that would provide an early readout of vaccine efficacy in adults who received the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2). METHODS We prospectively enrolled 11 young healthy volunteers (54% females, median age: 28 years) who received two doses of BNT162b2, 21 days apart, and we studied their platelet and immune response before and after each dose of the vaccine (3 and 102 days post-injection), in relation to the kinetics of the humoral response. RESULTS Participants achieving an effective level of neutralizing antibodies before the second dose of the vaccine (fast responders) had a higher leukocyte count, mounted a rapid cytokine response, that incremented further after the second dose, and an elevated platelet turnover that maintained the platelet count stable. Their circulating platelets were not more reactive but expressed lower surface levels of the Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Inhibitory Motif (ITIM)-coupled receptor CD31 (PECAM-1) compared to slow responders, and formed specific platelet-leukocyte aggregates, with B cells, just 3 days after the first dose, and with non-classical monocytes and eosinophils. CONCLUSION We identified features of the platelet-immune crosstalk that are associated with the development of a rapid humoral response to an mRNA-based vaccine (BNT162b2) and that could be exploited as early biomarkers of vaccine efficacy.","output":"Platelet and immune signature associated with a rapid response to the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic emergency caused by the spread of COVID-19 has stressed the importance of promptly identifying new epidemic clusters and patterns, to ensure the implementation of local risk containment measures and provide the needed healthcare to the population.

Social media analytics can be used to trigger Earth Observation (EO) satellite acquisitions over potential new areas of human aggregation. Similarly, EO satellites can be used jointly with social media analytics to systematically monitor well-known areas of aggregation (green urban areas, public markets, etc.).

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at all hospitals in Turkey between March 11, 2020, and June 22, 2020. All hospitalized COVID-19 patients (&#8805;18 years) who had cTn measurements within 24 h of admission were included. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 14,855 COVID-19 patients (median age 49 years and 54% male) from 81 provinces of Turkey were included. Of these, 2020 patients (13.6%) were transferred to intensive care unit, 1165 patients (7.8%) needed mechanical ventilation, and 882 patients (5.9%) died during hospitalization.

The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the DL models in detecting COVID-19 were 0.95 (95% CI 0.94-0.95) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.96-0.97), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98. The positive likelihood, negative likelihood, and diagnostic odds ratio were 19.02 (95% CI 12.83-28.19), 0.06 (95% CI 0.04-0.10), and 368.07 (95% CI 162.30-834.75), respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing other types of pneumonia from COVID-19 were 0.93 (95% CI 0.92-0.94) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.94-0.95), respectively. The performance of radiologists in detecting COVID-19 was lower than that of the DL models; however, the performance of junior radiologists was improved when they used DL-based prediction tools. CONCLUSIONS: Our study findings show that DL models have immense potential in accurately stratifying COVID-19 patients and in correctly differentiating them from patients with other types of pneumonia and normal patients. Implementation of DL-based tools can assist radiologists in correctly and quickly detecting COVID-19 and, consequently, in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Application of Artificial Intelligence for Screening COVID-19 Patients Using Digital Images: Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] We report cellular nanosponges as an effective medical countermeasure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

During this period, an average of 439 persons died annually from unintentional, non-fire-related CO poisoning, and the national average annual death rate was 1.5 per million persons. However, rates varied by demographic subgroup, month of the year, and state. Rates were highest among adults aged > or =65 years, men, non-Hispanic whites, and non-Hispanic blacks. The average number of deaths was highest during January. Among the states, Nebraska had the highest reliable CO mortality rate.

METHODS Inpatient admissions from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample and State Inpatient Databases were analyzed for packed red blood cell (PRBC), plasma, platelet, and whole blood (WB) transfusions. The transfusion rates per admission and per prevalent case were calculated. Prevalence estimates were from the Global Burden of Disease 2017 study (GBD). RESULTS From 2000 to 2014, blood usage rates for most causes peaked around 2010. Across all causes, PRBC were the most commonly transfused component, followed by plasma, platelets, and WB. However, the relative use of each type varied by cause. Nutritional deficiencies (1.75 blood product units across all components per admission; 95 % uncertainty interval (UI) 1.62-1.87), neoplasms (0.95; 0.87-1.04), and injuries (0.92; 0.86 - 0.98) had the greatest blood use per admission. Cardiovascular diseases (96.9 units per 1000 prevalent cases; 89.3-105.0) and neoplasms (92.7 units per 1000 prevalent cases; 84.3-101.5) had the greatest blood use per prevalent case. Across all admissions, over three million blood units were saved in 2014 compared to 2011 due to transfusing at a reduced rate. CONCLUSIONS Blood transfusion rates decreased from 2011 to 2014 in the United States.

Here, we present a case report which illustrates a biopsy proven distinct chronic complication of Covid-19 disease which afflicts some survivors: Post Covid-19 Organizing Pneumonia (PCOP). A 30 year old African-American female with known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and recently diagnosed nodular marginal zone lymphoma, on chemotherapy, became infected with SARS-Cov-2 in early August, 2020. She presented with fever, increased cough, and shortness of breath worsening over two weeks. In the emergency room, she had temperature 102o F, heart rate of 110 with oxygen saturation 88% on room air. Lab work was significant for Leukocytosis of 17.62 k/uL and recent absolute CD4 of 590/mm3. SARSCoV-2 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test was positive. Admission Chest Roentgenogram (X-ray) revealed bilateral basal opacities consistent with Covid-19 Pneumonia. Our patient was admitted and received Dexamethasone and a course of empiric antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia. She was discharged on brief oral prednisone taper with home oxygen 2L/min;However, she would be readmitted to hospital twice more over the next eight weeks with similar complaints of cough, recurrent fever, and dyspnea with new focal opacities on serial chest imaging (Figure 1). Her symptoms persisted despite broadened empiric antibiotics including antifungal therapy. Extensive lab work-up for secondary infection and autoimmune disease was unrevealing. Bronchoscopy was finally done with Transbronchial Cryobiopsy (TBC) revealing acute and chronic inflammation with interstitial fibrosis. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures were negative. As evidenced by serial imaging (Figure 1), our patient consistently improved with empiric steroids for organizing pneumonia. Her clinical findings recurred with attempts to taper steroids even at five months post initial positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. This case illustrates Post Covid-19 Organizing Pneumonia (PCOP). It is a Clinicopathologic syndrome characterized by rapid resolution with corticosteroids, but frequent relapses when treatment is tapered or stopped.1 It also illustrates several salient issues in caring for patients who survive acute SARS-CoV-2 infection: i) Delayed viral clearance related to chronic immunosuppression,2 ii) Delayed Bronchoscopy in an effort to mitigate infection risk to care providers, iii) The impact of ongoing therapy on consequent delayed pathology findings,3 iv) Increased morbidity associated with both late disease recognition and our attempts to taper chronic steroid therapy in the setting of an Organizing Pneumonia4 and v) The possibility that earlier biopsy, diagnosis and uninterrupted therapy may prevent pulmonary fibrosis.","output":"Post-covid organizing pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19-related encephalitis is a heterogeneous syndrome characterized by a combination of clinical, laboratory, and imaging features related to inflammation of the brain, where the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is presumably the causative agent.

Among them, substituting fossil fuels with alternative low-carbon energy sources has received remarkable attention. SUMMARY: The core concept of this study is to explore the relationship between food security, sustainable development, and renewable energy. Renewable energy has shown promising potential for integration into a wide range of agricultural activities and offers an alternative sustainable solution to current practices. In modern agriculture, the need for electrification has increased, with electric tractors and agricultural robots accounting for a large share, which represents a great opportunity for the use of renewable technologies in this sector. As new technologies emerge, investors need to familiarize themselves with them.

Resurgences of COVID-19 have also been observed in many other countries. In Guangzhou, China, a small outbreak, involving less than 100 residents, emerged in March and April 2020, and comprehensive and near-real-time genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted. When the numbers of confirmed cases among overseas travelers increased, public health measures were enhanced by shifting from self-quarantine to central quarantine and SARS-CoV-2 testing for all overseas travelers. In an analysis of 109 imported cases, we found diverse viral variants distributed in the global viral phylogeny, which were frequently shared within households but not among passengers on the same flight. In contrast to the viral diversity of imported cases, local transmission was predominately attributed to two specific variants imported from Africa, including local cases that reported no direct or indirect contact with imported cases. The introduction events of the virus were identified or deduced before the enhanced measures were taken. These results show the interventions were effective in containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and they rule out the possibility of cryptic transmission of viral variants from the first wave in January and February 2020. Our study provides evidence and emphasizes the importance of controls for overseas travelers in the context of the pandemic and exemplifies how viral genomic data can facilitate COVID-19 surveillance and inform public health mitigation strategies.","output":"Genomic Elucidation of a COVID-19 Resurgence and Local Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangzhou, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a scale designed to measure specific purpose orientations among adults.

This study presents a systematic review of the research pertaining to SOL associated with students interest and engagement in HEIs during the MCO environment. Methods: Five major online databases, i.e., EBSCOhost, Science Direct, Emerald, Scopus and Springer were searched to collect relevant papers published between 1st January 2010 to 15th June 2021 including conference proceedings, peer-reviewed papers and dissertations. Papers written in the English language, based in full-fledged universities, and with these five keywords: (i) synchronous online learning, (ii) engagement, (iii) interest, (iv) MCO/Covid-19 and (v) HEI, were included. Papers focussing on synchronous and asynchronous online learning in schools and colleges were excluded. Each paper was reviewed by two reviewers in order to confirm the eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: We found 31 papers of which six papers were related to SOL, engagement and interest in HEIs in the MCO environment. Our review presents three major findings: (i) limited research has been conducted on SOL associated with students engagement and interest, (ii) studies related to the context of HEIs in the MCO environment are limited, and (iii) the understanding of the new phenomena through qualitative research is insufficient.

The pathogenesis of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy (DiCM) is yet to be elucidated. Increasing studies proved that activation of AKT prevented cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac dysfunction in response to DOX insult. Our previous studies indicated that major vault protein (MVP) deficiency was accompanied by suppressed phosphorylation of AKT in metabolic diseases. This study aimed to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of MVP on cardiomyocyte apoptosis in DiCM. METHODS: Mice were intraperitoneally injected with DOX 5 mg/kg, once a week for 5 weeks, the total cumulative dose was 25 mg/kg. Cardiomyocyte-specific MVP overexpression was achieved using an adeno-associated virus system under the cTnT promoter after the fourth DOX injection. Cardiac function was examined by echocardiography followed by euthanasia. Tissue and serum were collected for morphology analysis and biochemical examination. RESULTS: Herein, we found that MVP expression was upregulated in DOX-treated murine hearts. Cardiac-specific MVP overexpression alleviated DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction, oxidative stress and fibrosis. Mechanistically, MVP overexpression activated AKT signaling and decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis in DiCM.

As individual assessments of all applications suggested in the literature are infeasible due to their sheer number, we propose a novel set of application categories: Remote Sensing, Mapping, Monitoring, Human-drone Interaction, Flying Ad-hoc Networks, Transportation, and Counter UAV Systems. Each categorys maturity is assessed through a literature review of contained applications, using the metric of Application Readiness Levels (ARLs). Relevant aspects such as the environmental complexity and available mission time of addressed scenarios are taken into account. Following the analysis, we infer that improvements in autonomy and software reliability are the most promising research areas for increasing the usefulness and acceptance of UAS in the public safety domain.","output":"Maturity Levels of Public Safety Applications using Unmanned Aerial Systems: a Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical trials for HIV prevention can require knowledge of infection times to subsequently determine protective drug levels. Yet, infection timing is difficult when study visits are sparse. Using population nonlinear mixed-effects (pNLME) statistical inference and viral loads from 46 RV217 study participants, we developed a relatively simple HIV primary infection model that achieved an excellent fit to all data. We also discovered that Aptima assay values from the study strongly correlated with viral loads, enabling imputation of very early viral loads for 28/46 participants. Estimated times between infecting exposures and first positives were generally longer than prior estimates (average of two weeks) and were robust to missing viral upslope data. On simulated data, we found that tighter sampling before diagnosis improved estimation more than tighter sampling after diagnosis. Sampling weekly before and monthly after diagnosis was a pragmatic design for good timing accuracy. Our pNLME timing approach is widely applicable to other infections with existing mathematical models. The present model could be used to simulate future HIV trials and may help estimate protective thresholds from the recently completed antibody-mediated prevention trials.","output":"Timing HIV infection with a simple and accurate population viral dynamics model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disaster countermeasures have been implemented by the Japanese Society of Neurology based on the experience of support to the areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011. The countermeasures activity began at the end of 2011. We, the Committee for Measures Against Disaster, officially started work in 2014. We developed a support network to urgently deal with patients with intractable neurological disease at the time of disaster and strengthen disaster measures, including effective disaster countermeasure training. During the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, we realized the need to prepare for natural disasters, leading to a state of emergency, at normal times. A list of vulnerable people should be prepared and the individual support plan for disaster should be confirmed during normal times. Furthermore, during disaster, livelihood support is required for patients with intractable neurological disease living in evacuation centers in affected areas. Therefore, we compiled and published the book, titled \\"The manual of disaster countermeasures,\\" in 2017. The Committee for Measures Against Disaster in the Japanese Society of Neurology has appointed a liaison officer for patients with intractable neurological disease in each prefecture.

Surgical procedures included catheterization of the right internal jugular vein and the carotid artery. After stabilization with 21% O(2), normocapnic hypoxia was induced by decreasing the inspired O(2) to 6-8%. When piglets developed bradycardia (heart rate < 60 beats/min), reoxygenation was initiated by administering 21% O(2). Arterial blood samples were taken during baseline, hypoxia and reoxygenation in order to measure interleukine-6 and interleukine-8. RESULTS Nine out of ten animals were successfully resuscitated (one of these required chest compressions and a dose of adrenaline) and one died despite resuscitation efforts.

However, the association between stress and seizures has not been thoroughly investigated. In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID\\\\19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, causing tremendous collateral stress. This study was designed to evaluate the influence of the COVID\\\\19 outbreak on seizures in PWE in the most severely affected area, Wuhan, and its surrounding cities. METHODS: In this single\\\\center, cross\\\\sectional study, PWE were surveyed via online questionnaires between February 23 and March 5, 2020. Collected data included demographic information, epilepsy\\\\related characteristics (seizure type, frequency, antiepileptic drugs [AEDs], and medication management), direct and perceived threat of COVID\\\\19, and changes in seizures during the outbreak. Psychological comorbidities were evaluated by the Patient Health QuestionnaireC9, Generalized Anxiety DisorderC7 items, and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify precipitants for seizure exacerbation. RESULTS: We received 362 completed questionnaires after excluding 12 duplicates (response rate = 63.51%). A total of 31 (8.56%) patients had increased seizures during the outbreak. Exposure history to COVID\\\\19 (P = .001), uncontrolled seizure after AED therapy (P = .020), seizure frequency of two or more times per month before the outbreak (P = .005), change of AED regimen during the outbreak (AED reduction, withdrawal, replacement, skipping altogether; P = .002), and worry about the adverse effect of the outbreak on overall seizure\\\\related issues (severity = moderate to critical; P = .038) were risk factors for increased seizures. SIGNIFICANCE: A minority of PWE experienced seizure exacerbation during the outbreak of COVID\\\\19.

However, little is known about the risk of infection during hospitalization or its consequences. The aim of this work was to report a series of patients hospitalized on digestive surgery services who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 virus. Methods This is a non-interventional retrospective study carried out within three departments of digestive surgery. The clinical, biological and radiological data of the patients who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 were collected from the computerized medical record. Results From March 1, 2020 to April 5, 2020, among 305 patients admitted to digestive surgery services, 15 (4.9%) developed evident nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2. There were nine men and six women, with a median age of 62 years (35C68 years). All patients had co-morbidities. The reasons for hospitalization were: surgical treatment of cancer (n =5), complex emergencies (n =5), treatment of complications linked to cancer or its treatment (n =3), gastroplasty (n =1), and stoma closure (n =1). The median time from admission to diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection was 34 days (5C61 days). In 12 patients (80%), the diagnosis was made after a hospital stay of more than 14 days (15C63 days). At the end of the follow-up, two patients had died, seven were hospitalized with two of them on respiratory assistance, and six patients were discharged post-hospitalization. Conclusions The risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection during hospitalization or following digestive surgery is a real and potentially serious risk.

The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of the Unplugged program in Chile (Yo S Lo Que Quiero). METHODS: This is a cluster randomized controlled trial, parallel-group type, where Yo S Lo Que Quiero is compared to standard school preventive curricula in control schools. A total of 70 schools and 8400 adolescents are expected to be randomized with 1:1 allocation. During formative work, the Unplugged program was culturally adapted to Chile, and the instrument to assess the primary and secondary outcomes was validated. The effectiveness of this program will be assessed using the European Drug Addiction Prevention Trial Questionnaire (EU-Dap), measuring substance use prevalence and risk and protective factors in baseline, post-intervention, and four months after the end of the intervention. DISCUSSION: The proposed study will be the first to test the effectiveness of a school-based substance use prevention program in Chile in a cluster randomized control trial and the first study evaluating the Unplugged program in Spanish-speaking Latin America. A model for disseminating the Unplugged program inside Europe already exists and has been implemented successfully in several countries.

Many quantitative analyses rely on structured data, but the extraction of specific information such as the time and place of outbreaks is a tedious process. Machine learning algorithms for natural language processing (NLP) can potentially facilitate the establishment of datasets, but their use in plague research has not been explored much yet. We investigated the performance of five pre-trained NLP libraries (Google NLP, Stanford CoreNLP, spaCy, germaNER and Geoparser.io) for the extraction of location data from a German plague treatise published in 1908 compared to the gold standard of manual annotation. Of all tested algorithms, we found that Stanford CoreNLP had the best overall performance but spaCy showed the highest sensitivity. Moreover, we demonstrate how word associations can be extracted and displayed with simple text mining techniques in order to gain a quick insight into salient topics. Finally, we compared our newly digitised plague dataset to a re-digitised version of the famous Biraben plague list and update the spatio-temporal extent of the second pandemic plague mentions.

Open appendectomy is still the treatment often chosen because it is simple, safe, and effective. Our aim was to study whether cosmetic results of appendectomy wounds are better after using continuous absorbable intradermal (A) sutures compared with wound closure with interrupted nonabsorbable (NA) sutures. METHODS A total of 206 adult patients with clinically suspected appendicitis were allocated to the study and prospectively randomized into two wound-closure groups: the interrupted NA suture group and the A suture group. Of these, 193 patients with sufficient data were invited to the outpatient clinic for cosmetic analysis. Cosmetic results were evaluated after a median of 14 months. For subjective scar assessment, the Vancouver scar scale, the patient and observer scar assessment scale (POSAS), and a visual analog scale (VAS) were used. Objective evaluation was carried out by measuring surface area, average width, and estimated concentration change (ECC) of hemoglobin and melanin in the scar using spectrocutometry. For statistical analyses we used the Mann-Whitney test and Student's t test. RESULTS Both objective and subjective analyses showed better cosmetic results for absorbable intradermal suturing. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant as regards POSAS in both patient (p = 0.032) and observer scales (p = 0.001), and VAS (p = 0.002). Scar surface area was significantly smaller in group A than in group NA (p = 0.002). ECC measurements showed higher values for melanin in group NA than in group A (p = 0.034).

The question, why a COVID-19 detector has classified a stack of lung-ct images as positive, is sometimes more interesting than the overall specificity and sensitivity. Especially when human domain expert knowledge disagrees with the given output. This way, human domain experts could also be advised to reconsider their choice, regarding the information pointed out by the system. In addition, the deep learning model can be controlled, and a present dataset bias can be found. Currently, most explainable AI methods in the computer vision domain are purely used on image classification, where the images are ordinary images in the visible spectrum.

A detailed cardiac evaluation of a series of COVID-19 individuals undergoing postmortem evaluation is provided, with four aims: 1) describe the pathologic spectrum of the myocardium; 2) compare to an alternate viral illness; 3) investigate angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression; and 4) provide the first description of the cardiac findings in patients with cleared infection. Methods: Study cases were identified from institutional files and included COVID-19 (n=15; 12 active, 3 cleared), influenza A/B (n=6), and non-virally mediated deaths (n=6). Salient information was abstracted from the medical record. Light microscopic findings were recorded. An ACE2 immunohistochemical H-score was compared across cases. Viral detection encompassed SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry, ultrastructural examination, and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). Results: Male sex was more common in the COVID-19 group (p=0.05). Non-occlusive fibrin microthrombi (without ischemic injury) were identified in 16 cases (12 COVID-19, 2 influenza, and 2 controls), and were more common in the active COVID-19 cohort (p=0.006). Four active COVID-19 cases showed focal myocarditis, while one case of cleared COVID-19 showed extensive disease. Arteriolar ACE2 endothelial expression was lower in COVID-19 cases versus controls (p=0.004). ACE2 myocardial expression did not differ by disease category, sex, age or number of patient comorbidities (p=0.69, p=1.00, p=0.46, p=0.65, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry showed non-specific staining, while ultrastructural examination and ddPCR were negative for viral presence. Four (26.7%) COVID-19 patients had underlying cardiac amyloidosis. Cases with cleared infection had variable presentations. Conclusions: This detailed histopathologic, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and molecular cardiac series showed no definitive evidence of direct myocardial infection. COVID-19 cases frequently have cardiac fibrin microthrombi, without universal acute ischemic injury.

AIM OF THE STUDY: A Mongolian folk medicinal plant named Thalictrum minus L. (TML) has been extensively used for the treatment of lung inflammation, bacterial and fungal infection and tuberculosis. Our present study aims to investigate the effectiveness of TML against particulate matter (PM)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and the potential underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Initially, HPLC-Q-TOF was applied for the qualitative analysis and HPLC was used for quantitative analysis of main components in TML. Then, the mice model of ALI was induced by PM via intratracheally instilled with 50 mg/kg body weight of Standard Reference Material1648a (SRM1648a), and TML (10, 20, 40 mg/kg) were administered orally 1 h prior to PM. The efficacy and molecular mechanisms in the presence or absence of TML were elucidated. RESULTS: Eleven main ingredients were detected in TML and the contents of homoorientin and berberine were quantified. Additionally, the results demonstrated that TML profoundly inhibited weight loss in mice and ameliorated lung pathological injury induced by PM. Furthermore, we also found that TML significantly decreased the lung wet to dry weight (W/D) ratios, reduced total protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and effectively attenuated PM-induced increased leukocyte and macrophages in BALF. Meanwhile, TML could pronouncedly inhibited myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lung tissues, decreased the PM-induced inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1? (IL-1?), reduced nitric oxide (NO) and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) in BALF. In addition, TML markedly facilitated the expression of p-AMPK-Nrf2 and suppressed the expression of KEAP, prohibited the activation of the MAPKs-NLRP3/caspase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), and inhibited apoptotic pathways. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that TML attenuated PM-induced ALI through suppressing the release of inflammatory cytokines and alleviating oxidative damage correlated with the AMPK-Nrf2/KEAP signaling pathways, MAPKs-NLRP3/caspase-1 signaling pathways, as well as apoptotic pathways.","output":"Thalictrum minus L. ameliorates particulate matter-induced acute lung injury in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is now plagued by a pandemic of unprecedented nature caused by a novel, emerging, and still poorly understood infectious disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Wu and McGoogan, 2020).

Ecoimmunology also highlights the importance of integration across physiological systems, including the immune, endocrine, and nervous systems, in the production of immune defenses. The field has demonstrated the importance of genetics, developmental environment, and current conditions to individual variation in immune function and emphasized the traits of species, such as body size, that could be integral to immune phenotypes. Furthermore, ecoimmunological studies have shown that heterogeneity in immunity at the individual and species levels can have important consequences for disease dynamics within populations and communities as well as population cycling. Herein we discuss these key research areas in ecoimmunology as they relate to three central themes: (1) immunity in the context of the whole organism, (2) heterogeneity in immunity, and (3) the broad consequences of individual variation in immunity. We conclude by reviewing future directions for ecoimmunology, focusing on those that could have important implications for public health, conservation, and wildlife management.","output":"An Introduction to Ecoimmunology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and are both globally prevalent in the pig population. While HEV does not cause clinical disease in pigs, its zoonotic potential has raised concerns in the food safety sector. PRRS has become endemic in the United Kingdom (UK) since its introduction in 1991, and continues to cause considerable economic losses to the swine industry. A better understanding of the current prevalence and diversity of PRRSV and HEV in the UK, and their potential association, is needed to assess risks and target control measures appropriately. This study used plasma, tonsil, and cecal content samples previously collected from pigs in 14 abattoirs in England and Northern Ireland to study the prevalence of several pathogens including PRRSV and HEV. The diversity of PRRSV strains detected in these samples was analyzed by sequencing open reading frame 5 (ORF5), revealing no substantial difference in PRRSV strains from these clinically unaffected pigs relative to those from clinical cases of disease in the UK. Despite the potential immuno-modulatory effect of PRRSV infection, previously demonstrated to affect Salmonella and HEV shedding profiles, no significant association was found between positive PRRSV status and positive HEV status.","output":"UK Pigs at the Time of Slaughter: Investigation into the Correlation of Infection with PRRSV and HEV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has been extensively utilized as a viral vector system for the induction of protective immune responses against a variety of pathogens. We constructed recombinant VSVs specifying either the Indiana or Chandipura virus G glycoprotein and expressing the West Nile virus (WNV) envelope (E) glycoprotein. Mice were intranasally vaccinated using a prime (Indiana)-boost (Chandipura) immunization approach and challenged with the virulent WNV-LSU-AR01. Ninety-percent (9 of 10) of the vaccinated mice survived as compared to 10% of the mock-vaccinated mice after WNV lethal challenge. Histopathological examination of brain tissues revealed neuronal necrosis in mock-vaccinated mice but not in vaccinated mice, and vaccinated, but not mock-vaccinated mice developed a strong neutralizing antibody response against WNV. Extensive immunological analysis using polychromatic flow cytometry staining revealed that vaccinated, but not mock-vaccinated mice developed robust cellular immune responses as evidenced by up-regulation of CD4(+) CD154(+) IFN(+) T cells in vaccinated, but not mock-vaccinated mice. Similarly, vaccinated mice developed robust E-glycoprotein-specific CD8(+) T cell immune responses as evidenced by the presence of a high percentage of CD8(+) CD62L(low) IFN(+) cells. In addition, a sizeable population of CD8(+) CD69(+) cells was detected indicating E-specific activation of mature T cells and CD4(+) CD25(+) CD127(low) T regulatory (T reg) cells were down-regulated.

Research Design and Methods: A systematic search of 6 key databases found 11,895 citations published between 2010 and 2021. Studies were included if they involved community-dwelling older adults with or without cognitive impairment arising from acquired brain injury, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia, and if they evaluated everyday smartphone or tablet device use for cognition, memory, or activities of daily living. Results: A total of 28 papers were included in the narrative synthesis. There was some evidence that the use of smartphones and tablets could aid cognitive function in older adults without cognitive impairment, particularly executive function and processing speed. There was modest evidence that smartphone and tablet use could support memory in both older adults without cognitive impairment and those with acquired brain injury and dementia. Discussion and Implications: Smartphones and tablets were seen by users as acceptable, enjoyable, and nonstigmatizing alternatives to conventional assistive technology devices; however, current use of smartphone and tablet devices is hindered by the digital literacy of older adults, a lack of accommodation for older adult users' motor and sensory impairments, and a lack of input from clinicians and researchers. Much of the evidence presented in this review derives from case studies and small-scale trials of smartphone and tablet training interventions.

METHODS: We performed a post-hoc analysis of a prospective international registry comprising 109 consecutive patients (age 64  16 years; 62% male) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and noncontrast chest CT imaging. Using semi-automated software, we quantified the burden (%) of lung abnormalities associated with COVID-19 pneumonia. EAT volume (mL) and attenuation (Hounsfield units) were measured using deep learning software. The primary outcome was clinical deterioration (intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or vasopressor therapy) or in-hospital death. RESULTS: In multivariable linear regression analysis adjusted for patient comorbidities, the total burden of COVID-19 pneumonia was associated with EAT volume ( = 10.6, p = 0.005) and EAT attenuation ( = 5.2, p = 0.004). EAT volume correlated with serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (r = 0.361, p = 0.001) and C-reactive protein (r = 0.450, p < 0.001). Clinical deterioration or death occurred in 23 (21.1%) patients at a median of 3 days (IQR 1C13 days) following the chest CT. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, EAT volume (OR 5.1 [95% CI 1.8C14.1] per doubling p = 0.011) and EAT attenuation (OR 3.4 [95% CI 1.5C7.5] per 5 Hounsfield unit increase, p = 0.003) were independent predictors of clinical deterioration or death, as was total pneumonia burden (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4C4.6, p = 0.002), chronic lung disease (OR 1.3 [95% CI 1.1C1.7], p = 0.011), and history of heart failure (OR 3.5 [95% 1.1C8.2], p = 0.037).

MethodsWe used Hospital Episode Statistics to identify all people alive 01 March 2020 with ICD-10 codes for RAIRD from the whole population of England. We used linked national health records (demographic, death certificate, admissions and PCR testing data) to calculate rates of COVID-19 infection and death up to 31 July 2020. Our primary definition of COVID-19-related death was mention of COVID-19 on the death certificate. General population data from Public Health England and the Office for National Statistics were used for comparison. We also describe COVID-19-related hospital admissions and all-cause deaths. ResultsWe identified a cohort of 168,680 people with RAIRD, of whom 1874 (1.11%) had a positive COVID-19 PCR test. The age-standardised infection rate was 1.54 (95% CI 1.50-1.59) times higher than in the general population. 713 (0.42%) people with RAIRD died with COVID-19 on their death certificate and the age-sex-standardised mortality rate for COVID-19-related death was 2.41 (2.30 - 2.53) times higher than in the general population.

This may be due to the synergistic effects of unemployment, stress from childcare or additional caregiving responsibilities, reduced social interactions and negative coping strategies. Weerakoon and colleagues set out to identify the most robust risk factors for alcohol consumption, binge drinking, and changes in drinking patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. One-third of the sample reported consuming more alcohol after COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19. In addition, each additional week spent at home under stay-at-home orders was increased the odds of binge drinking by 19%.

The RSVs were detected using the respiratory virus panel fast assay and single-tube RT-PCR, their nucleotides were sequenced, and they were tested for positive selection. Of the 165 positive samples, 131 (79.4%) carried RSV-A and 34 (20.6%) RSV-B; both groups co-circulated in all of the study periods, with RSV-A predominating in all the seasons except for winter 2010C2011, which had a predominance of RSV-B. Phylogenetic analysis of the RSV-A sequences identified genotypes NA1 and ON1, the second replacing the first during the last two years of the study period. The RSV-B belonged to genotypes BA9 and BA10. BA9 was detected in all the years of the study whereas BA only desultorily. Comparison of the subjects infected by RSV-A and RSV-B types did not reveal any significant differences, but the children infected by genotype A/NA1 more frequently had lower respiratory tract infections (p<0.0001) and required hospitalisation (p = 0.007) more often than those infected by genotype A/ON1. These findings show that RSV has complex patterns of circulation characterised by the periodical replacement of the predominant genotypes, and indicate that the circulation and pathogenic role of the different RSV strains should be investigated as each may have a different impact on the host. A knowledge of the correlations between types, genotypes and disease severity may also be important in order to be able to include the more virulent strains in future vaccines.","output":"Characteristics and Their Clinical Relevance of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Types and Genotypes Circulating in Northern Italy in Five Consecutive Winter Seasons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The trendy task of digital medical image analysis has been continually evolving.

The impact of sustainable digital transformation in universities could be perceived as system and systematic. When the intangible but impactful influence is identified/recognized as a system, an applicable conceptual model could become designable and implementable. Conceptual models of digital transformation are vital to universities and business schools to gain sustainability amid rapid technological changes. However, there is paucity of practical, implementable and simple digital transformational models combining technologies, system and educational phenomena. This theoretical gap is sizeable, impactful and non-ignorable. To fulfil this gap, this paper critically examines the need and the association between sustainable digital transformation and its impact in the universities, using an innovative qualitative grounded theory approach which uses three distinct coding procedures namely open, axial and selective followed by transcribing qualitative data. The researchers have proposed a conceptual model for sustainable digital transformation, new propositions by critically reviewing the latest but multiple cases on (a) sustainability (b) digital transformation (c) green technologies and (d) implementable approaches in the education industry/universities. How fast universities could develop dependable business models to cater for the rapid changes amid globalization of education has become an important issue. If the universities can explore a scientific approach to the design-developing conceptual model, then it becomes straightforward for the academic leaders to implement digital transformation process effectively without resource burnouts.

This knowledge has been made available in many places in form of open source product data, so that products could be adapted and improved, saving development time. METHODS: This production and innovation potential has been taken up and professionalized by the authors of this article. By means of a proof-of-principle we provide an overview of the possibility and successful unique introduction of a so-called professional \\"hybrid production\\" in a micro factory using 3D-printing at the place of greatest demand in a hospital by medical personnel to produce their own PPE. Furthermore the learning process and future benefits of on site 3D-printing are described. RESULTS: Our proof-of-principle successfully showed that the allocation of 3D-printing capabilities in the hospital infrastructure is possible. With assistance of the engineers, responsible for product design and development, the medical staff was able to produce PPE by means of AM. However, due to legal uncertainties and high material and production costs the usability is severely limited. CONCLUSIONS: The practical research showed that a complete implementation of the concept and the short-term establishment of a 3D-printing factory for the autonomous supply of a hospital with PPE was not feasible without further efforts.

The aim of the current study was to explore the role of anxiety and depression as a potential mediator between perceived stress and sleep quality among health care workers. METHODS: Data were collected through an online survey using the snowball sampling method and comprised 588 current health care workers in Zhejiang and Hubei provinces, China, from February to March 2020. We administered the Sleep Quality Questionnaire (SQQ), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) and the sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19-related characteristics questionnaire. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to examine the direct and indirect relationships between perceived stress, anxiety and depression, and sleep quality. RESULTS: The average scores for sleep quality and perceived stress were 16.01 (95% CI [15.40, 16.57]) and 15.46 (95% CI [15.05, 15.87]), respectively. The positive rates of anxiety and depression symptom tests were 9.86% and 10.37%, respectively. The SEM results indicated that the original relationship between perceived stress and sleep quality was beta = 0.52 (P < 0.001) and reduced to beta = 0.25 (P = 0.045) while introducing anxiety and depression as mediating variables. Perceived stress was positively associated with anxiety and depression (beta = 0.78, P = 0.014), and anxiety and depression were positively associated with sleep quality (beta = 0.42, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Poor sleep quality and high perceived stress were common during the COVID-19 crisis. Reducing perceived stress could help reduce anxiety and depression symptoms, thereby improving sleep quality among health care workers. In an attempt to promote psychological resources, we should perhaps take multiple measures, including personal tailored intervention and organizational humanistic concern.","output":"Understanding the Mediating Role of Anxiety and Depression on the Relationship Between Perceived Stress and Sleep Quality Among Health Care Workers in the COVID-19 Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates the effect of the COVID-19-induced decline in economic activities on the financial and social efficiency of microfinance institutions (MFIs).

To explore potential channels through which efficiency is influenced by the COVID-19 outbreak, we examine the supply and demand side of MFIs funding.

It was drawn to our group's attention that healthcare workers (HCWs) had a lower mortality rate against higher COVID-19 incidence compared to the general population in Turkey. Since risk of exposure to tuberculosis bacillus among healthcare workers are higher than the population, we aimed to investigate if there is a relationship between BCG and Mycobacterium tuberculosis exposure history with COVID-19 severity in infected HCWs. This study was conducted with 465 infected HCWs from thirty-three hospitals to assess the relationship between COVID-19 severity (according to their hospitalization status and the presence of radiological pneumonia) and BCG and Mycobacterium tuberculosis exposure history. HCWs who required hospital admission had significantly higher rates of chronic diseases, radiological pneumonia, and longer working hours in the clinics. Higher rates of history of contact and care to tuberculosis patients, history of tuberculosis, and BCG vaccine were observed in hospitalized HCWs. HCWs who had radiological pneumonia had a significantly increased ratio of history of care to tuberculosis patients and a higher family history of tuberculosis. The findings from our study suggest that the lower mortality rate despite the more severe disease course seen in infected HCWs might be due to frequent exposure to tuberculosis bacillus and the mortality-reducing effects of the BCG vaccine.","output":"The Relationship between COVID-19 Severity and Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG)/ Mycobacterium tuberculosis exposure history in healthcare workers: a multi-center study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Motivated with various responses of world governments to COVID-19, here we develop a toy model of the dependence epidemics spreading on the availability of tests for disease. Our model, that we call SUDR+K, is based on usual SIR model, but it splits the total fraction of infected individuals into two components: those that are undetected and those that are detected through tests. Moreover, we assume that available tests increase at a constant rate from the beginning of epidemics but are consumed to detect infected individuals. Strikingly we find a bi-stable behavior between a phase with a giant fraction of infected and a phase with a very small fraction. We show that the separation between these two regimes is governed by a match between the rate of testing and a rate of infection spread at given time. We also show that the existence of two phases does not depend on the mathematical choice of the form of the term describing the rate at which undetected individuals are tested and detected. Presented research implies that a vigorous early testing activity, before the epidemics enters into its giant phase, can potentially keep epidemics under control, and that even a very small change in rate of testing can increase or decrease the size of the whole epidemics of various orders of magnitude. For the real application of realistic model to ongoing epidemics, we would gladly collaborate with field epidemiologists in order to develop quantitative models of testing process.","output":"Bi-stability of SUDR+K model of epidemics and test kits applied to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid pandemic has affected contemporary lives to unprecedented levels, including the world of sports, which have faced training and competition bans, matches and tournaments having been postponed or cancelled However, the Union of the European Football Associations (UEFA) was keen to continue playing despite the pandemic and staged matches played behind closed doors Thus, UEFA provided the involved parties with a strict protocol of how to organise and conduct matches in order to protect players and staff from contracting the virus, as well as to limit the risk of spreading the virus This study provides a visual auto-ethnographical account of a European qualifier match between the womens national teams of Iceland and Sweden The match took place in September 2020, in the midst of the second wave of the Covid pandemic which was sweeping through Europe at the time This visual story illustrates how the Covid pandemic was experienced in a team working quarantine and how it affected the social organisation of the match as shown by established rules and recommendations for human conduct and manifested in new norms of behaviour The visual story further highlights how the pandemic imposed unprecedented challenges for sport teams to settle the conflicting forces of how to withhold manifested and collective team rituals under such constrains, as for the social organisations, which had to make-up protocols, at short notice, in order to keep the virus at bay When analysed visually those protocols seemed inconsistent and illogical at times It can however be argued, that despite those inconsistencies the protocols should be recognised as a responsible act for public welfare as they counter possible public health repercussions associated with such pandemics [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Visual Studies is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"An international football match experienced from within a 'working quarantine' C a photographic journey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We critically evaluated the quality of evidence and quality of harm reporting in clinical trials that evaluated the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or chloroquine (CQ) for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Scientific databases were systematically searched to identify relevant trials of HCQ/CQ for the treatment of COVID-19 published up to 10 September 2020. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tools for randomized trials and non-randomized trials of interventions were used to assess risk of bias in the included studies. A 10-item Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) harm extension was used to assess quality of harm reporting in the included trials. RESULTS: Sixteen trials, including fourteen randomized trials and two non-randomized trials, met the inclusion criteria. The results from the included trials were conflicting and lacked effect estimates adjusted for baseline disease severity or comorbidities in many cases, and most of the trials recruited a fairly small cohort of patients. None of the clinical trials met the CONSORT criteria in full for reporting harm data in clinical trials. None of the 16 trials had an overall 'low' risk of bias, while four of the trials had a 'high', 'critical', or 'serious' risk of bias. Biases observed in these trials arise from the randomization process, potential deviation from intended interventions, outcome measurements, selective reporting, confounding, participant selection, and/or classification of interventions. CONCLUSION: In general, the quality of currently available evidence for the effectiveness of CQ/HCQ in patients with COVID-19 is suboptimal. The importance of a properly designed and reported clinical trial cannot be overemphasized amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and its dismissal could lead to poorer clinical and policy decisions, resulting in wastage of already stretched invaluable health care resources.","output":"Use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in COVID-19: How good is the quality of randomized controlled trials?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to a drastic decline in the number of elective surgeries performed in the United States Many national societies and local governments provided recommendations for surgeons to initially suspend and progressively resume elective surgery The authors used a survey to the American Council of Academic Plastic Surgeons (ACAPS) to assess the effect on plastic surgeons METHODS: An electronic survey questionnaire was distributed to 532 members of ACAPS Data on individual and plastic surgery practice demographics, COVID-19 prevention measures, and procedures or services that were being performed or delayed were collected and analyzed RESULTS: An estimated 161 members (30 2%) completed the survey Changes in hospital policy were cited as the most common reason (89%) for determining which procedures were currently offered Results vary by specialty Notably, &lt;10% of respondents who normally offered aesthetic procedures currently offered any procedures during the survey Subspecialty-specific results and prevention measures when seeing clinic patients are further summarized and discussed CONCLUSIONS: Plastic surgeons have seen a drastic decrease in the variety of procedures and services they are allowed to offer during the COVID-19 pandemic To help plan a return to normalcy, surgeons should create and implement plans to protect patients and staff from coronavirus transmission, assure financial solvency, and consider the effects of delayed surgeries on both the physical and mental health of their patients In doing so, surgeons and their patients will be better prepared in the event of a resurgence of the virus","output":"The Impact of COVID-19-based Suspension of Surgeries on Plastic Surgery Practices: A Survey of ACAPS Members"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Targeted delivery of dexamethasone to inflamed tissues using nanoparticles is much-needed to improve its efficacy while reducing side effects. To drastically improve dexamethasone loading and prevent burst release once injected intravenously, a lipophilic prodrug dexamethasone palmitate (DXP) was encapsulated into poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide)-polyethylene glycol (PLGA-PEG) nanoparticles (NPs). DXP-loaded PLGA-PEG NPs (DXP-NPs) of about 150 nm with a drug loading as high as 7.5% exhibited low hemolytic profile and cytotoxicity. DXP-NPs were able to inhibit the LPS-induced release of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages. After an intravenous injection to mice, dexamethasone (DXM) pharmacokinetic profile was also significantly improved. The concentration of DXM in the plasma of healthy mice remained high up to 18 h, much longer than the commercial soluble drug dexamethasone phosphate (DSP). Biodistribution studies showed lower DXM concentrations in the liver, kidneys, and lungs when DXP-NPs were administered as compared with the soluble drug. Histology analysis revealed an improvement in the knee structure and reduction of cell infiltration in animals treated with the encapsulated DXP compared with the soluble DSP or non-treated animals. In summary, the encapsulation of a lipidic prodrug of dexamethasone into PLGA-PEG NPs appears as a promising strategy to improve the pharmacological profile and reduce joint inflammation in a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis.

METHODS: Studies that evaluated at least one of the five target dimensions of the psychological impact of COVID-19 on HCW in China were included. Studies with no data of our interest were excluded. Relevant Databases were searched from inception up to June 10, 2020. Preprint articles were also included. The methodological quality was assessed using the checklist recommended by AHRQ. Both the rate of prevalence and the severity of symptoms were pooled. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020197126) on July 09, 2020. RESULTS: We included 44 studies with a total of 65,706 HCW participants. Pooled prevalence rates of moderate to severe PTSS, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances were 27% (95% CI 16%-38%), 17% (13C21%), 15% (13C16%), and 15% (7C23%), respectively; while the prevalence of mild to severe level of PTSS, anxiety, and depression was estimated as 31% (25C37%), 37% (32C42%) and 39% (25C52%). Due to the lack of data, no analysis of profession-related burnout was pooled. Subgroup analyses indicated higher prevalence of moderate to severe psychological impact in frontline HCW, female HCW, nurses, and HCW in Wuhan. CONCLUSION: About a third of HCW in China showed at least one dimension of psychological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the prevalence of moderate and severe syndromes was relatively low.

We fit generalized additive models to cycle threshold (Ct) value data from our RT-qPCR platform, demonstrating a peak in high viral load, low-Ct value infections temporally coincident with peak epidemic growth rates estimated in real time from publicly-reported incidence data and retrospectively from our own laboratory testing data across three administrative regions. We additionally demonstrate a statistically significant effect of duration of time since infection onset on Ct value, suggesting that Ct value can be used as a biomarker of the stage at which an individual is sampled in the course of an infection trajectory. As an extension, the population level Ct distribution at a given timepoint can be used to estimate population-level epidemiological dynamics. We illustrate this concept by adopting a recently-developed, nested modeling approach, embedding a within-host viral kinetics model within a population-level Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) framework, to mechanistically estimate epidemic growth rates from cross-sectional Ct distributions across three regions in Madagascar. We find that Ct-derived epidemic growth estimates slightly precede those derived from incidence data across the first epidemic wave, suggesting delays in surveillance and case reporting. Our findings indicate that public reporting of Ct values could offer an important resource for epidemiological inference in low surveillance settings, enabling forecasts of impending incidence peaks in regions with limited case reporting.","output":"Cross-sectional cycle threshold values reflect epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 in Madagascar"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this review, we summarize existing trends of flow control used to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of wings.

Emerging evidence indicates that preexisting humoral immunity against other seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoVs) plays a critical role in the specific antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. However, current work to assess the effects of preexisting and cross-reactive anti-HCoVs antibodies has been limited. To address this issue, we have adapted our previously reported multiplex assay to simultaneously and quantitatively measure anti-HCoV antibodies. The full mPlex-CoV panel covers the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of three highly pathogenic HCoVs (SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS) and four human seasonal strains (OC43, HKU1, NL63, 229E). Combining this assay with volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS), we measured the anti-HCoV IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies in fingerstick blood samples. The results demonstrate that the mPlex-CoV assay has high specificity and sensitivity. It can detect strain-specific anti-HCoV antibodies down to 0.1 ng/ml with 4 log assay range and with low intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (%CV). We also estimate multiple strain HCoVs IgG, IgA and IgM concentration in VAMS samples in three categories of subjects: pre-COVID-19 (n=21), post-COVID-19 convalescents (n=19), and COVID-19 vaccine recipients (n=14). Using metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis, HCoVs IgG concentrations in fingerstick blood samples were well separated between the pre-COVID-19, post-COVID-19 convalescents, and COVID-19 vaccine recipients. In addition, we demonstrate how multi-dimensional scaling analysis can be used to visualize IgG mediated antibody immunity against multiple human coronaviruses. We conclude that the combination of VAMS and the mPlex-Cov assay is well suited to performing remote study sample collection under pandemic conditions to monitor HCoVs antibody responses in population studies.","output":"Antibody Mediated Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and Human Coronaviruses: Multiplex Beads Assay and Volumetric Absorptive Microsampling to Generate Immune Repertoire Cartography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, high hopes were placed on digital contact tracing. Digital contact tracing apps can now be downloaded in many countries, but as further waves of COVID-19 tear through much of the northern hemisphere, these apps are playing a less important role in interrupting chains of infection than anticipated. We argue that one of the reasons for this is that most countries have opted for decentralised apps, which cannot provide a means of rapidly informing users of likely infections while avoiding too many false positive reports. Centralised apps, in contrast, have the potential to do this. But policy making was influenced by public debates about the right app configuration, which have tended to focus heavily on privacy, and are driven by the assumption that decentralised apps are privacy preserving by design. We show that both types of apps are in fact vulnerable to privacy breaches, and, drawing on principles from safety engineering and risk analysis, compare the risks of centralised and decentralised systems along two dimensions, namely the probability of possible breaches and their severity. We conclude that a centralised app may in fact minimise overall ethical risk, and contend that we must reassess our approach to digital contact tracing, and should, more generally, be cautious about a myopic focus on privacy when conducting ethical assessments of data technologies.","output":"Privacy versus Public Health?

Neuraminidase inhibiting antibodies have been recognized as correlates of protection against disease caused by natural or experimental influenza A virus infection in humans. In the past years, we have witnessed an increasing interest in the use of influenza neuraminidase to improve the protective potential of currently used influenza vaccines. A number of well-characterized influenza neuraminidase-specific monoclonal antibodies have been described recently, most of which can protect in experimental challenge models by inhibiting the neuraminidase activity or by Fc receptor-dependent mechanisms. The relative instability of the neuraminidase poses a challenge for protein-based antigen design. We critically review the different solutions that have been proposed to solve this problem, ranging from the inclusion of stabilizing heterologous tetramerizing zippers to the introduction of inter-protomer stabilizing mutations. Computationally engineered neuraminidase antigens have been generated that offer broad, within subtype protection in animal challenge models. We also provide an overview of modern vaccine technology platforms that are compatible with the induction of robust neuraminidase-specific immune responses.

Lengthy quarantine is difficult for many individuals to rigorously observe. To date, 14 days has been recommended as the quarantine period for people who are exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 case, because most infections appear by then. For household close contacts, there remains a 0.5% chance that a COVID-19 infection may appear after that time, because the COVID-19 incubation period is up to 21 days. However, the risk of transmission after 14 days is so small that public health authorities have decided that 0.5% is an acceptable risk to balance the impact of quarantine on individuals, their communities, and our economy. Therefore, this 0.5% risk of infection is a useful benchmark to consider additional strategies for reducing the burden on individuals while reducing spread of COVID-19. With appropriately timed testing and awareness of possible symptoms, a non-symptomatic individual with a negative COVID-19 test at day 7-8 would be at lower risk of being or becoming infectious than someone completing a 14-day quarantine without testing.

All piglets orally inoculated developed severe watery diarrhea and vomiting within 24 hours post-inoculation (hpi) and died within 72 hpi. The results of animal experiments reveal that this strain is highly pathogenic to 2-day old piglets.","output":"The dynamics of Chinese variant porcine epidemic diarrhea virus production in Vero cells and intestines of 2-day old piglets."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A good understanding of the bi-directional relationship between diabetes and periodontitis is essential to ensure the successful management of both diseases. This study aimed to develop and evaluate an integrated diabetes-periodontitis nutrition and health education module. METHODS: The module was developed as an iterative and review process by five experts in nutrition and dietetics, periodontics, and dental public health. It consisted of three phases: (i) needs assessment on module contents and characteristics, (ii) module development and (iii) module evaluation by experts. Twelve healthcare professionals aged between 30 and 53 years (average 13.5 years of working experience) validated the module contents and its comprehensibility using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for printable materials (PEMAT-P) and audio-visual materials (PEMAT-A/V). Scores of 0 (disagree) or 1 (agree) were given for sets of understandability and actionability statements and presented as a total percentage. RESULTS: Seventeen infographic-flip charts and 13 short-videos were developed in the Malay language and grouped into four topics: (i) Introduction to Diabetes and Periodontitis, (ii) Diabetes and Periodontitis Care, (iii) Lifestyle Modification, and (iv) Myths and Facts. Flip charts were rated between 76-100% for understandability and 80C100% for actionability, while videos rated between 90-100% for understandability and 100% for actionability, respectively. CONCLUSION: Overall, the newly developed module ranked high median scores for understandability and actionability.

METHODS: A single-center observational study was performed in patients treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx or hypopharynx by total (pharyngo)-laryngectomy between 2010 and 2015. Study data comprised: maximum phonation time (sec), number of and reasons for prosthesis exchanges (leakage through or around the prosthesis, expulsion or inclusion of the prosthesis), plus 2 quality of life questionnaires (QLQ-C30, QLQ-H&N35) and the Voice Handicap Inventory (VHI 30). RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were included. The most common causes of prosthesis exchange were leakage through (73.2%) or around the prosthesis (18.5%). The median time between exchanges was 4 months. Global quality of life status on the QLQ-C30 was 63.5. Mean maximum phonation time was 7.4sec. Mean VHI was 46/120; 10 patients had a mild voice handicap, 12 moderate and 10 severe. No relation emerged between the number of prosthesis exchanges per year and quality of life. Voice handicap significantly decreased quality of life, with QLQ-C30 72.3 for the 22 patients with mild to moderate voice handicap and 44.2 for the 10 patients with severe voice handicap (P=0.001).

For example, the COVID-19 pandemic can be considered as a dynamical system, where objects represent geographical locations (e.g., states) whose daily confirmed cases of infection evolve over time. Outbreak at one location may influence another location as people travel between these locations, forming a graph. Thus, how to model and predict the complex dynamics for these systems becomes a critical research problem. Existing work on modeling graph-structured data mostly assumes a static setting. How to handle dynamic graphs remains to be further explored. On one hand, features of objects change over time, influenced by the linked objects in the interaction graph. On the other hand, the graph itself can also evolve, where new interactions (links) may form and existing links may drop, which may in turn be affected by the dynamic features of objects. In this paper, we propose coupled graph ODE: a novel latent ordinary differential equation (ODE) generative model that learns the coupled dynamics of nodes and edges with a graph neural network (GNN) based ODE in a continuous manner. Our model consists of two coupled ODE functions for modeling the dynamics of edges and nodes based on their latent representations respectively. It employs a novel encoder parameterized by a GNN for inferring the initial states from historical data, which serves as the starting point of the predicted latent trajectories.

An understanding of the SARS-Cov-2 outbreak in Zimbabwe will assist in the implementation of effective public health interventions to control transmission. Nasopharyngeal samples from 92,299 suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in Zimbabwe between 20 March and 16 October 2020 were obtained. Available demographic data associated with those cases identified as positive (8,099) were analysed to describe the national breakdown of positive cases over time in more detail (geographical location, sex, age and travel history). The whole genome sequence (WGS) of one hundred SARS-CoV-2-positive samples from the first 120 days of the epidemic in Zimbabwe was determined to identify their relationship to one another and WGS from global samples. Overall, a greater proportion of infections were in males (55.5%) than females (44.85%), although in older age groups more females were affected than males. Most COVID-19 cases (57 %) were in the 20-40 age group. Eight lineages, from at least 25 separate introductions into the region were found using comparative genomics. Of these, 95% had the D614G mutation on the spike protein which was associated with higher transmissibility than the ancestral strain. Early introductions and spread of SARS-CoV-2 were predominantly associated with genomes common in Europe and the United States of America (USA), and few common in Asia at this time. As the pandemic evolved, travel-associated cases from South Africa and other neighbouring countries were also recorded. Transmission within quarantine centres occurred when travelling nationals returning to Zimbabwe. International and regional migration followed by local transmission were identified as accounting for the development of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Zimbabwe. Based on this, rapid implementation of public health interventions are critical to reduce local transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

The roles and responsibilities of managing diabetes during cancer care are unclear, as oncologists lack interest and clinical expertise and many patients stop seeing their primary care providers (PCPs). Uncertainty around who should manage diabetes for cancer patients can result in gaps in care for survivors. We sought to elicit the perspectives of providers about a novel diabetes care delivery intervention for women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer. METHODS: We conducted nominal group sessions with PCPs and breast oncologists across the USA. We introduced a novel care delivery model, which involved a nurse practitioner (NP) specifically trained in diabetes to work within the oncology team to manage diabetes for women during chemotherapy. PCPs and oncologists were asked to identify potential barriers and facilitators to the interventions success and then vote on the top three most important barriers and facilitators, separately. Votes were aggregated across sessions and presented as frequencies and weighted percentages. RESULTS: From November to December 2020, two 60-min sessions with PCPs and two 60-min sessions with breast oncologists were held virtually. In total, 29 providers participated, with 16 PCPs and 13 breast oncologists. At the health system level, financial support for the NP-led intervention was identified as the most important barrier across both provider types. Clearly defined roles for each care team member were identified as the most important facilitator at the care team level. At the patient level, lack of cancer-specific diabetes education was identified as an important barrier. CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the need to engage various stakeholders including policy makers, institutional leadership, care team members, and patients to improve diabetes care for patients undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer. As such, multi-disciplinary interventions are warranted to increase awareness, engagement, and self-management practices among breast cancer patients with diabetes.

For patients with adult spinal deformity (ASD), spine surgery often requires extended LOS and non-routine discharge. Given resource limitations during the COVID-19 pandemic and caution regarding hospital stays, surgeons have modified standard postoperative protocols to minimize patient exposure. PURPOSE The primary aim of this study was to compare LOS and discharge disposition of ASD patients undergoing surgery before and during the pandemic. Secondary aims were to compare the rates of 30-day complications, readmissions, and ED visits. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING Retrospective review of an institutional surgical registry. PATIENT SAMPLE A total of 117 patients with adult thoracolumbar deformity. OUTCOME MEASURES Outcome measures included LOS and discharge disposition (home vs non-home), as well as 30-day major complications, reoperations, readmissions and ED visits. METHODS We identified all patients who underwent elective thoracolumbar ASD surgery with 5 levels fusion at a tertiary care center during two distinct time intervals: Jul-Dec 2019 (Pre-COVID, N=60) and Jul-Dec 2020 (During-COVID, N=57). Outcome measures included LOS and discharge disposition (home vs non-home), as well as 30-day major complications, reoperations, readmissions, and ED visits. Regression analyses controlled for demographic and surgical factors. RESULTS Patients who underwent ASD surgery during the pandemic were younger (61 vs 67 years) and had longer fusion constructs (9 vs 8 levels) compared to before pandemic (p<0.05 for both). On bivariate analysis, patients undergoing surgery during the pandemic had significantly lower LOS (6 vs 8 days) and were more likely to be discharged home (70% vs 28%) (p<0.05 for both). After controlling for age and levels fused on multivariable regression, patients who had surgery during the pandemic continued to demonstrate a significantly lower LOS (IRR=0.83, p=0.015) and greater odds of home discharge (OR=7.2, p<0.001). Notably, there were no significant differences in reoperations, readmissions, ED visits, or major complications between the two groups (p>0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, the LOS for patients undergoing thoracolumbar ASD surgery decreased, and more patients were discharged home without adversely affecting complication or readmission rates.

A cross-sectional study was conducted, with two different questionnaires administered before and after the conduction of the vaccination campaign against SARS-CoV-2 at the COVID-19 vaccination center of the Palermo University Hospital (PUH). The baseline survey showed that 64% of community pharmacists (CPs) declared that they planned to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2, and 58% were vaccinated against influenza during the 2020/2021 season. Factors significantly associated with willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccination were confidence in vaccines (adjOR 1.76; CI 1.11C2.80), fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjOR 1.50; CI 1.06C2.11), considering COVID-19 vaccination to be the best strategy to counteract SARS-CoV-2 (adjOR 1.79; CI 1.39C2.29), and adherence to influenza vaccination during the 2020/2021 season (adjOR 3.25; CI 2.23C4.25). The adherence among CPs of the Palermo Province to COVID-19 vaccination was 96.5%. From the post-vaccination survey, the main reasons for changing opinions on vaccination adherence were the introduction of mandatory vaccinations, fear of contracting COVID-19, and limitations on work activities in the case of vaccine refusal. The achievement of very high COVID-19 vaccination coverage rates among healthcare professionals (HCPs) in the present study was mainly due to the mandatory vaccination policies; nevertheless, a willingness for COVID-19 vaccination was relatively high among pharmacists before the beginning of the vaccination campaign. HCPs and CPs should receive training on vaccination, which is recommended in the national immunization plan and is also suggested by the respondents in our study, in order to routinely re-evaluate their own vaccination profiles, as well as those of their patients.","output":"Knowledge, Attitudes, Perceptions and Vaccination Acceptance/Hesitancy among the Community Pharmacists of Palermos Province, Italy: From Influenza to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Programmed ?1 ribosomal frameshifting (?1PRF) is an mRNA recoding event commonly utilized by viruses and bacteria to increase the information content of their genomes.

After the confirmation of the first imported cases, the lack of a proper airport entrance control resulted in the infection spreading in a manner directly proportional to the amount of flights reaching each city, following the first occurrence of the virus coming from abroad. METHODOLOGY: We developed a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model divided in a metapopulation structure, where cities with airports were demes connected by the number of flights. Subsequently, we further explored the role of the Manaus airport for a rapid entrance of the pandemic into indigenous territories situated in remote places of the Amazon region. RESULTS: The expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus between cities was fast, directly proportional to the city closeness centrality within the Brazilian air transportation network. There was a clear pattern in the expansion of the pandemic, with a stiff exponential expansion of cases for all the cities. The more a city showed closeness centrality, the greater was its vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: We discussed the weak pandemic control performance of Brazil in comparison with other tropical, developing countries, namely India and Nigeria.

Nurses completed an online questionnaire with psychometrically validated measures of pandemic\\\\related stress, psychological adjustment outcomes (depression, anxiety, and subjective well\\\\being), and protective factors (posttraumatic growth and self\\\\compassion). Descriptive analyses revealed that pandemic\\\\related stress was reported by 17.7% of the participants.

Although the leakage of userslocation privacy has received a lot of research attention, existing works still ignore the rationality of users, resulting that users may not obtain satisfactory spatial distribution even if they provide true location information. To solve the problem, we employ game theory with incomplete information to model the interactions among users and seek an equilibrium state through learning approaches of the game. Specifically, we first model the service as a game in the satisfaction form and define the equilibrium for this service. Then, we design a LEFS algorithm for the privacy strategy learning of users when their satisfaction expectations are fixed, and further design LSRE that allows users to have dynamic satisfaction expectations. We theoretically analyze the convergence conditions and characteristics of the proposed algorithms, along with the privacy protection level obtained by our solution. We conduct extensive experiments to show the superiority and various performances of our proposal, which illustrates that our proposal can get more than 85% advantage in terms of the sensing distribution availability compared to the well-known differential privacy based solutions.

Therefore, this study identified these determinants and discussed their policy implications. Method: Data of 2334 patients seen at the main COVID-19 treatment centre in Ghana were analysed in this study. Their characteristics, such as age, education level and comorbidities, were examined as explanatory variables. The dependent variables were length of COVID-19 hospitalisations and long COVID. Negative binomial and binary logistic regressions were fitted to investigate the determinants. Result: The regression analyses showed that, on average, COVID-19 patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus spent almost 2 days longer in hospital (p = 0.00, 95% CI = 1.42C2.33) and had 4 times the odds of long COVID (95% CI = 1.61C10.85, p = 0.003) compared to those with no comorbidities. In addition, the odds of long COVID decreased with increasing patients education level (primary OR = 0.73, p = 0.02; secondary/vocational OR = 0.26, p = 0.02; tertiary education OR = 0.23, p = 0.12).

We assessed clinical performance and ease-of-use of seven Ag-RDTs in a prospective, manufacturer-independent, multi-centre cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study to inform global decision makers. METHODS: Unvaccinated participants suspected of a first SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited at six sites (Germany, Brazil). Ag-RDTs were evaluated sequentially, with collection of paired swabs for routine reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing and Ag-RDT testing. Performance was compared to RT-PCR overall and in sub-group analyses (viral load, symptoms, symptoms duration). To understandusability a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire and ease-of-use (EoU) assessment were performed. FINDINGS: 7471 participants were included in the analysis. Sensitivities across Ag-RDTs ranged from 704%-901%, specificities were above 972% for all Ag-RDTs but one (931%).Ag-RDTs, Mologic, Bionote, Standard Q, showed diagnostic accuracy in line with WHO targets (> 80% sensitivity, > 97% specificity). All tests showed high sensitivity in the first three days after symptom onset (871%) and in individuals with viral loads 6 log(10)SARS-CoV2 RNA copies/mL ( 887%). Usability varied, with Rapigen, Bionote and Standard Q reaching very good scores; 90, 88 and 84/100, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Variability in test performance is partially explained by variable viral loads in population evaluated over the course of the pandemic. All Ag-RDTs reach high sensitivity early in the disease and in individuals with high viral loads, supporting their role in identifying transmission relevant infections. For easy-to-use tests, performance shown will likely be maintained in routine implementation.

Emetine had amongst the lowest reported half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) from over 290 agents screened for the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses. While EC50 concentrations of emetine are achievable in the blood, studies show that concentrations of emetine can be almost 300 times higher in the lungs. Furthermore, based on the relative EC50s of emetine towards the coronaviruses compared with Entamoeba histolytica, emetine could be much more effective as an anti-coronavirus agent than it is against amoebiasis. This paper also discusses the known side effects of emetine and related compounds, how those side effects can be managed, and the optimal method of administration for the potential treatment of COVID-19. Given the serious and immediate threat that the COVID-19 coronavirus poses, our long history with emetine and the likely ability of emetine to reach therapeutic concentrations within the lungs, ipecac, emetine, and other analogues should be considered as potential treatment options, especially if in vitro studies confirm viral sensitivity.","output":"Emetine, Ipecac, Ipecac Alkaloids and Analogues as Potential Antiviral Agents for Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Due to pro-inflammatory and hypercoagulation states, COVID-19 infection is believed to increase the risk of stroke and worsen the outcomes of the patients having pre-existing cerebrovascular diseases (CeVD).

The objective of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the outcomes of COVID-19 patients with pre-existing CeVD. METHODS: English full-text-observational studies having data on epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients were identified searching PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus using MeSH-terms COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2 OR 2019-nCoV from December 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020. Studies having CeVD or stroke as one of the pre-existing comorbidities and described outcomes including intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation utilization, and mortality were selected with consensus of three reviewers. Following MOOSE protocol, 11 studies were included. The pooled prevalence of CeVD and outcomes were calculated. Meta-regression was performed, and correlation coefficient (r) and odds ratio (OR) were estimated to evaluate the effects of pre-existing CeVD on outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Meta-analysis with random-effects model was used to calculate OR along with its 95% CI from the studies containing data on composite poor outcome. RESULTS: Out of 8/11 studies showing data on mortality and mechanical ventilation, and 7/11 on ICU admission, pooled prevalence of pre-existing CeVD was 4.4% (244/4987). In age-adjusted meta-regression analysis, pre-existing CeVD was associated with ICU admission [r: 0.60; OR: 1.82 (1.25C2.69)], mechanical ventilation [r: 0.29; OR: 1.33 (1.09C1.63)], and mortality [r: 0.35; OR: 1.42 (1.14C1.77)] amongst COVID-19 hospitalizations. 9/11 studies reported data on binary composite outcomes, the pooled prevalence of pre-existing CeVD was 4.3% (155/3603) and 7.46% (83/1113) amongst COVID-19 hospitalizations and COVID-19 hospitalization-related poor outcomes, respectively.

This study was aimed to describe the clinicoepidemiological features and the causes of mortality of COVID-19 deceased patients admitted in a dedicated COVID center in India. METHODOLOGY: This was a retrospective study done in adult deceased patients admitted in COVID ICU from April 4 to July 24, 2020. The clinical features, comorbidities, complications, and causes of mortality in these patients were analyzed. Pediatric deceased were analyzed separately. RESULTS: A total of 654 adult patients were admitted in the ICU during the study period and ICU mortality was 37.7% (247/654). Among the adult deceased, 65.9% were males with a median age of 56 years [interquartile range (IQR), 41.5C65] and 94.74% had one or more comorbidities, most common being hypertension (43.3%), diabetes mellitus (34.8%), and chronic kidney disease (20.6%). The most common presenting features in these deceased were fever (75.7%), cough (68.8%), and shortness of breath (67.6%). The mean initial sequential organ failure assessment score was 9.3  4.7 and 24.2% were already intubated at the time of admission. The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days (IQR, 3C11). The most common cause of death was sepsis with multi-organ failure (55.1%) followed by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (25.5%). All pediatric deceased had comorbid conditions and the most common cause of death in this group was severe ARDS. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of adult deceased, most were young males with age less than 65 years with one or more comorbidities, hypertension being the most common. Only 5% of the deceased had no comorbidities. Sepsis with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome was the most common cause of death.

The time course of changes in rSO2 ratios in each region was evaluated throughout HD. The rSO2 ratio was defined as the ratio of rSO2 value at t (min) during HD to the rSO2 value before HD. During the early phase of HD, blood pressure (BP) gradually decreased and both hepatic and lower limb muscle rSO2 ratios decreased with changes in BP, whereas the cerebral rSO2 ratio was relatively maintained.

Many patients are attempting to balance health and financial stability. Therefore, we sought to determine how physicians who frequently prescribe immunosuppressive medications are counselling patients on return-to-work prior to widespread vaccine distribution and understand their decision processes. Methods We administered a survey through the Canadian Rheumatology, Gastroenterology and Dermatology Associations. Physicians were asked whether patients have requested counselling on return-to-work during the pandemic and how they decide what advice to provide. They were shown seven clinical scenarios of patients on immunosuppressive medications, then asked whether they would provide a medical note advocating for delayed return-to-work or modified duties to reduce exposure. Results 151 physicians took the survey. 94% were asked for advice on return-to-work. 33% felt informed enough to provide counselling. When patients requested a medical note, physicians provided one 25% of the time. Factors most associated with providing notes were patient comorbidities, age, glucocorticoids, high risk work and vulnerable co-inhabitants. Conventional synthetic and biologic immunosuppressants did not prompt most physicians to provide a note. Respondents considered patient perspectives and workplace factors. Several requested guidelines to approach these encounters. Conclusion Almost all rheumatologists, dermatologists and gastroenterologists have been asked to counsel patients on returning to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most do not feel informed enough to do so. Medical notes for acconunodations are only provided a minority of the time, unless specific factors (e.g. glucocorticoids) are present.

Transmission of the infection occurs by inhalation of infected droplets or direct contact with soiled surfaces and fomites. It should be suspected in all symptomatic children who have undertaken international travel in the last 14 d, all hospitalized children with severe acute respiratory illness, and asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case. Clinical symptoms are similar to any acute respiratory viral infection with less pronounced nasal symptoms. Disease seems to be milder in children, but situation appears to be changing. Infants and young children had relatively more severe illness than older children. The case fatality rate is low in children. Diagnosis can be confirmed by Reverse transcriptase C Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on respiratory specimen (commonly nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab). Rapid progress is being made to develop rapid diagnostic tests, which will help ramp up the capacity to test and also reduce the time to getting test results. Management is mainly supportive care. In severe pneumonia and critically ill children, trial of hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir should be considered. As per current policy, children with mild disease also need to be hospitalized; if this is not feasible, these children may be managed on ambulatory basis with strict home isolation. Pneumonia, severe disease and critical illness require admission and aggressive management for acute lung injury and shock and/or multiorgan dysfunction, if present.

This is achieved by cellular palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs), which can modify newly synthesized S proteins before they are assembled into virion envelopes at the intermediate compartment of the exocytic pathway. To address the importance of these fatty acylations to coronavirus infection, we exposed infected cells to 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP), a specific PAT inhibitor. 2-BP profoundly reduced the specific infectivities of murine coronaviruses at very low, nontoxic doses that were inert to alphavirus and rhabdovirus infections. 2-BP effected only two- to fivefold reductions in S palmitoylation, yet this correlated with reduced S complexing with virion membrane (M) proteins and consequent exclusion of S from virions. At defined 2-BP doses, underpalmitoylated S proteins instead trafficked to infected cell surfaces and elicited cell-cell membrane fusions, suggesting that the acyl chain adducts are more critical to virion assembly than to S-induced syncytial developments. These studies involving pharmacologic inhibition of S protein palmitoylation were complemented with molecular genetic analyses in which cysteine acylation substrates were mutated. Notably, some mutations (C1347F and C1348S) did not interfere with S incorporation into virions, indicating that only a subset of the cysteine-rich region provides the essential S-assembly functions. However, the C1347F/C1348S mutant viruses exhibited relatively low specific infectivities, similar to virions secreted from 2-BP-treated cultures. Our collective results indicate that the palmitate adducts on coronavirus S proteins are necessary in assembly and also in positioning the assembled envelope proteins for maximal infectivity.","output":"Palmitoylations on murine coronavirus spike proteins are essential for virion assembly and infectivity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Atorvastatin is not only an antilipemic but also used as an anti-inflammatory medicine in heart disease. Our working hypothesis was that atorvastatin preconditioning could improve the forward blood flow in the no-reflow rats associated with inflammation. We investigated that two doses of atorvastatin preconditioning (20 and 5 mg/kg/day) could alleviate deterioration of early cardiac diastolic function in rats with inflammation detected by echocardiography and haemodynamics. This benefit was obtained from the effect of atorvastatin preconditioning on improving forward blood flow and preserving the infarct cardiomyocytes, which was estimated by Thioflavin S and TTC staining in rats with myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. Subsequently, the improving of forward blood flow was ascribed to reduction of microthrombus in microvascular and myocardial fibrosis observed by MSB and Masson's trichrome staining with atorvastatin preconditioning. Ultimately, we found that atorvastatin preconditioning could reduce inflammation factor, such as tumor necrosis factor- and fibrinogen-like protein 2, both in myocardial and in mononuclear cells, which probably attribute to microcirculation dysfunction in no-reflow rats detected by immunohistochemistry staining, western blot, and ELISA detection, respectively. In conclusion, atorvastatin preconditioning could alleviate deterioration of early cardiac diastolic function and improve the forward blood flow in the no-reflow rats attributing to reduction of TNF- and fgl-2 expression.","output":"Atorvastatin preconditioning improves the forward blood flow in the no-reflow rats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monoclonal antibody therapy for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been highly successful in decreasing disease severity; however, the recent emergence of the heavily mutated Omicron variant has posed a challenge to this treatment strategy.

While this information is critical from a public health perspective to implement surveillance systems and measures to limit infectivity and transmission rate, the misinterpretation of serologic testing in clinical practice has generated much confusion in the medical community because some attempted to apply these strategies to individual patient's treatment schemes. In this mini-review, we examine the different serologic-based testing strategies, how to interpret their results, and their public health impact at the population level, which are critical to contain the transmission of the virus in the community within a busy cardiovascular practice.

We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioural changes of the public on the incidence of COVID-19, as well as on influenza virus infections, which might share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19. METHODS: We analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (Rt) for COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1 to estimate changes in transmissibility over time. Attitudes towards COVID-19 and changes in population behaviours were reviewed through three telephone surveys done on Jan 20-23, Feb 11-14, and March 10-13, 2020. FINDINGS: COVID-19 transmissibility measured by Rt has remained at approximately 1 for 8 weeks in Hong Kong. Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% CI 34-53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, from an estimated Rt of 128 (95% CI 126-130) before the start of the school closures to 072 (070-074) during the closure weeks. Similarly, a 33% (24-43%) reduction in transmissibility was seen based on paediatric hospitalisation rates, from an Rt of 110 (106-112) before the start of the school closures to 073 (068-077) after school closures.

INTERPRETATION: Our study shows that non-pharmaceutical interventions (including border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, distancing, and changes in population behaviour) were associated with reduced transmission of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, and are also likely to have substantially reduced influenza transmission in early February, 2020.

We found that graphs with a logarithmic, as opposed to a linear, scale resulted in laypeople making less accurate predictions of how fast cases would increase, viewing COVID-19 as less dangerous, and expressing both less support for policy interventions and less intention to take personal actions to combat the disease. Education about the differences between linear and logarithmic graphs reduces but does not eliminate these effects.

It is an effective hemostatic device which creates a physical barrier. Unfortunately it interferes with subsequent bone healing and increases the risk of infection in experimental studies. Recently, a water-soluble, synthetic, hemostatic compound (Ostene?) was introduced to serve the same purpose as bone wax without hampering bone healing. This study aims to compare sternal healing after application of either bone wax or Ostene?. METHODS Twenty-four pigs were randomized into one of three treatment groups: Ostene?, bone wax or no hemostatic treatment (control). Each animal was subjected to midline sternotomy. Either Ostene? or bone wax was applied to the spongy bone surfaces until local hemostasis was ensured. The control group received no hemostatic treatment. The wound was left open for 60 min before closing to simulate conditions alike those of cardiac surgery. All sterni were harvested 6 weeks after intervention.Bone density and the area of the bone defect were determined with peripheral quantitative CT-scanning; bone healing was displayed with plain X-ray and chronic inflammation was histologically assessed. RESULTS Both CT-scanning and plain X-ray disclosed that bone healing was significantly impaired in the bone wax group (p < 0.01) compared with the other two groups, and the former group had significantly more chronic inflammation (p < 0.01) than the two latter. CONCLUSION Bone wax inhibits bone healing and induces chronic inflammation in a porcine model.

One-square-centimeter pieces of each mesh were placed on top of a monolayer of human fibroblasts or rat MSCs. The coating status was monitored with a light microscope. The human promonocytic cell line U937 was induced to differentiate into macrophages (M). Three weeks later, meshes were transferred to new 24-well plates and cocultured with the Ms for 72 h. Culture medium was collected and analyzed for IL-1, IL-6, and VEGF production using standard ELISA essays. Parallel mesh samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde or glutaraldehyde for histology or transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) analyses, respectively. RESULTS Uncoated meshes induced increased production of all three cytokines compared with macrophages cultured alone. HF coating further increased the production of both IL-6 and VEGF but reduced IL-1 production. Except for the SoftMesh group, MSC coating significantly blunted release of all cytokines to levels even lower than with Ms cultured alone. Ms tended to deteriorate in the presence of MSCs. Both histology and TEM revealed intimate interactions between cell-coated meshes and Ms. CONCLUSIONS Cytokine response to fibroblast coating varied, while MSC coating blunted the immunogenic effect of both synthetic and biologic meshes in vitro.

The most challenging problem is that the effective condition for refolding is protein dependent and is therefore difficult to select in a rational manner. Accordingly, considerable time and expense using trial-and-error approaches are often needed to increase the final protein yield. Furthermore, for certain target proteins, finding suitable conditions to achieve an adequate yield cannot be obtained by existing methods.

Data were collected on diabetes type, demographics, biochemical and clinical features at presentation, and DKA management. RESULTS: From 786 consecutive DKA, 583 (75.9%) type 1 diabetes and 185 (24.1%) type 2 diabetes episodes were included in the final analysis. Those with type 2 diabetes were older and had more ethnic minority representation than those with type 1 diabetes. Intercurrent illness (39.8%) and suboptimal compliance (26.8%) were the two most common precipitating causes of DKA in both cohorts. Severity of DKA as assessed by pH, glucose and lactate at presentation was similar in both groups. Total insulin requirements and total DKA duration were the same (type 1 diabetes 13.9 units (9.1C21.9); type 2 diabetes 13.9 units (7.7C21.1); p=0.4638).

Inadequate screening capacity has hampered COVID-19 detection, while traditional infectious disease response has been delayed due to significant demands for healthcare resources, time and personnel. This study investigated whether an online health decision-support tool could supplement COVID-19 surveillance and detection in China and the USA. SETTING: Daily website traffic to Thermia was collected from China and the USA, and cross-correlation analyses were used to assess the designated lag time between the daily time series of Thermia sessions and COVID-19 case counts from 22 January to 23 April 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Thermia is a validated health decision-support tool that was modified to include content aimed at educating users about Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations on COVID-19 symptoms. An advertising campaign was released on Microsoft Advertising to refer searches for COVID-19 symptoms to Thermia. RESULTS: The lead times observed for Thermia sessions to COVID-19 case reports was 3 days in China and 19 days in the USA. We found negative cross-correlation between the number of Thermia sessions and rates of influenza A and B, possibly due to the decreasing prevalence of influenza and the lack of specificity of the system for identification of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that early deployment of an online campaign and modified health decision-support tool may support identification of emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19. Researchers and public health officials should deploy web campaigns as early as possible in an epidemic to detect, identify and engage those potentially at risk to help prevent transmission of the disease.","output":"Early detection of COVID-19 in China and the USA: summary of the implementation of a digital decision-support and disease surveillance tool"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: There is an urgent need to identify therapies that prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients Objective: Based upon clinical observations, we proposed that some psychotropic and antihistaminic drugs could protect psychiatric patients from SARS-CoV-2 infection This observation is investigated in the light of experimental in vitro data on SARS-CoV-2 Methods: SARS-CoV-2 high-throughput screening results are available at the NCATS COVID-19 portal We investigated the in vitro anti-viral activity of many psychotropic and antihistaminic drugs using chemoinformatics approaches Results and Discussion: We analyze our clinical observations in the light of SARS-CoV-2 experimental screening results and propose that several cationic amphiphilic psychotropic and antihistaminic drugs could protect people from SARS-CoV-2 infection;some of these molecules have very limited adverse effects and could be used as prophylactic drugs Other cationic amphiphilic drugs used in other disease areas are also highlighted Recent analyses of patient electronic health records reported by several research groups indicate that some of these molecules could be of interest at different stages of the disease progression In addition, recently reported drug combination studies further suggest that it might be valuable to associate several cationic amphiphilic drugs Taken together, these observations underline the need for clinical trials to fully evaluate the potentials of these molecules, some fitting in the so-called category of broad-spectrum antiviral agents Repositioning orally available drugs that have moderate side effects and should act on molecular mechanisms less prone to drug resistance would indeed be of utmost importance to deal with COVID-19","output":"Chemoinformatic Analysis of Psychotropic and Antihistaminic Drugs in the Light of Experimental Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Activities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To evaluate real-world utility of the ForeseeHome monitoring device for the detection of conversion from intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD) to neovascular AMD (nAMD) and compare with results published by the HOME study. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of electronic health records. SUBJECTS: Eyes prescribed use of the ForeseeHome device across 4 retinal practices in the USA. METHODS: Usage information was collected from the online ForeseeHome portal for all eyes prescribed. For a pre-determined subset of eyes, additional clinical information was collected through chart review and analyzed for clinical utility. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures include frequency and length of use, number of eyes that used the device, established baseline and converted to nAMD, and number of alerts. RESULTS: 775 eyes of 448 patients were prescribed use of the ForeseeHome device. 649 eyes (83.7%) used the device at least once; among this population, 478 (73.7%) established baseline. Patients who established baseline were significantly younger than those who did not establish baseline (p<0.001). Among eyes that established baseline, 126 (26.4%) had an overall inadequate frequency of use (&#8805;2 tests per week), and 250 (52.3%) did not use the device as frequently as instructed by the manufacturer (&#8805;3 tests per week); 112 (24.7%) discontinued use within one year. Over a mean of 20.35 months, 106 patients had 152 alerts, indicating possible conversions to nAMD. Out of the 136 eyes that established baseline among 211 eyes prescribed the device at one clinical site, 52 alerts were recorded, 3 (6.8%) correctly identified conversion to nAMD and 47 (93.2%) represented false-positive alerts. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the prospective HOME study, utility of the ForeseeHome device in the current analysis of real-world clinical-practice application was limited. A meaningful proportion of eyes never used the device or could not establish baseline. Overall frequency of use was low and continuous usage of the device decreased over time. There is a need for improvement in home monitoring technology for eyes with iAMD at risk of conversion to nAMD.","output":"Home Monitoring of Age-Related Macular Degeneration: Real-World Utility of the ForeseeHome Device for Detection of Neovascularization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Hospital response to the COVID-19 outbreak has involved the cancellation of elective, deferrable surgeries throughout Europe in order to ensure capacity for emergent surgery and a selection of elective but non-deferrable surgeries. The purpose of this document is to propose technical strategies to assist the pediatric surgeons to minimize the potential aerosolization of viral particles in COVID-19 patients undergoing urgent or emergent surgical treatment using laparoscopic approaches, based on the currently available literature. The situation and recommendations are subject to change with emerging information. Materials and Methods: The Scientific Committee and the Board of the European Society of Pediatric Endoscopic Surgeons gathered together in order to address the issue of minimally invasive surgery during this COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic search through PubMed, Embase, and World Wide Web of the terms COVID-19, Coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2 matched with pneumoperitoneum, laparoscopy, thoracoscopy, retroperitoneoscopy, and surgery was performed. Non-English language papers were excluded. A PRISMA report was performed. Criticalities were identified and a consensus was achieved over a number of key aspects. Results: We identified 121 documents. A total of 11 full-text documents were assessed to address all concerns related to the adoption of minimally invasive surgery. All aspect of pediatric minimally invasive surgery, including elective surgery, urgent surgery, laparoscopy, thoracoscopy, retroperitoneoscopy, and pneumoperitoneum creation and maintainance were extensively addressed through systematic review. A consensus regarding urgent laparoscopic procedures, setting and operation techniques was obtained within the Committee and the Board. Conclusions: The ESPES proposes the following recommendations in case minimally invasive surgery is needed in a COVID-19 positive pediatric patients: (1) consider conservative treatment whenever safely possible, (2) dedicate a theater, columns and reusable laparoscopic instrumentation to COVID-19 pediatric patients, (3) prefer disposable instrumentation and cables, (4) use low CO(2) insufflation pressures, (5) use low power electrocautery, (6) prefer closed-systems CO(2) insufflation and desufflation systems, and (7) avoid leaks through ports.

The study included 6720 parents recruited through schools, patient organizations and social media platforms (2002 parents with a child with a mental health condition and 4718 without) from seven European countries: the UK (n = 508), Sweden (n = 1436), Spain (n = 1491), Belgium (n = 508), the Netherlands (n = 324), Germany (n = 1662) and Italy (n = 794). Many parents reported negative effects of homeschooling for themselves and their child, and many found homeschooling to be of poor quality, with insufficient support from schools. In most countries, contact with teachers was limited, leaving parents with primary responsibility for managing homeschooling. Parents also reported increased levels of stress, worry, social isolation, and domestic conflict. A small number of parents reported increased parental alcohol/drug use. Some differences were found between countries and some negative experiences were more common in families with a child with a mental health condition. However, differences between countries and between families with and without a mental health condition were generally small, indicating that many parents across countries reported negative experiences. Some parents also reported positive experiences of homeschooling. The adverse effects of homeschooling will likely have a long-term impact and contribute to increased inequalities. Given that school closures may be less effective than other interventions, policymakers need to carefully consider the negative consequences of homeschooling during additional waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics.","output":"Parental experiences of homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic: differences between seven European countries and between children with and without mental health conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zoonotic introduction of novel coronaviruses may encounter preexisting immunity in humans.

METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 6191 adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in a large New York City safety-net hospital system between March 1 and June 1, 2020. Associations between 30-day readmission and selected demographic characteristics, socioeconomic factors, prior health care utilization, and relevant features of the index hospitalization were analyzed using a multivariable generalized estimating equation model. RESULTS The readmission rate was 7.3%, with a median of 7 days between discharge and readmission. The following were risk factors for readmission: age 65 and older [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-1.55], history of homelessness, (aOR: 2.03 95% CI: 1.49-2.77), baseline coronary artery disease (aOR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.34-2.10), congestive heart failure (aOR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.20-1.49), cancer (aOR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.26-2.24), chronic kidney disease (aOR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.46-2.07). Patients' sex, race/ethnicity, insurance, and presence of obesity were not associated with increased odds of readmission.

However, although ubiquitous, there has been little work to categorize and analyze MVs in order to better understand its design space. As a result, there has been little to no guideline in how to use the MV design effectively. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of how MVs are designed in practice.

Unfortunately, COVID-19 is not only a short-term infection but that patients (pts) recovering from SARS-CoV2 infection complain of persisting symptoms including: fatigue, diffuse myalgia and weakness, which may lead to chronic fatigue syndrome. There is currently no evidence that nutritional supplements and/or physical exercise can assist in the recovery of pts with chronic fatigue syndrome. 1-Methylnicotinamide (1-MNA) is an endogenic substance that is produced in the liver when nicotinic acid is metabolized. 1-MNA demonstrates anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties. Therefore, we investigated whether 1-MNA supplements could improve exercise tolerance and decrease fatigue among patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2. Methods: The study population was composed of pts after COVID-19, expressing subjective feelings of limited tolerance to exercise. The selected pts were randomized into two groups: GrM0 without supplementation; GrM1 with 1-MNA supplementation. At the beginning of the study (Phase 0), in both groups, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) was carried out and fa-tigue assessment with Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) was performed. After 1 month (Phase 1), a follow up FSS and 6MWT once more were performed in both groups. Results: A significant improvement in the mean distance covered in the 6MWT was noted among the pts in GrM1, compared to those in GrM0. We also noted that in GrM1 the 6MWT distance was significantly higher after 1 month of supplementation with 1-MNA, compared to the beginning of the study (515.18 m in Phase 0 vs 557.8m in Phase 1; p = 0.000034). In GrM1, significantly more pts improved their distance in the 6MWT (23 out of 25 pts, equal to 92%), by a mean of 47 meters, compared to GrM0 (15 of 25 pts, equal to 60%) (p = 0.0061). After one month, significantly more patients in the group without 1-MNA had severe fatigue (FSS [] 4) compared to the group with supplementation (GrM1 = 5 pts (20%) vs GrM0 = 14pts (56%); p = 0.008). Conclusions: 1-MNA supplementation significantly improved physical performance in a 6-minute walk test and reduced the percentage of patients with severe fatigue after COVID-19. The comprehensive action of 1-MNA, including anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant effects, as well as activation of the SIRT1 enzyme, may be beneficial for the recovery of patients with persistent symptoms of fatigue and low tolerance to exercise after COVID-19.

Further expansion of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring efforts to include the detection of variants of interest/concern through next-generation sequencing has enhanced the understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. In this report, we detail the results of a collaborative effort between public health and metropolitan wastewater management authorities and the University of Louisville to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic through the monitoring of aggregate wastewater samples over a period of 28 weeks. Through the use of next-generation sequencing approaches the polymorphism signatures of Variants of Concern/Interest were evaluated to determine the likelihood of their prevalence within the community on the basis of their relative dominance within sequence datasets. Our data indicate that wastewater monitoring of water quality treatment centers and smaller neighborhood-scale catchment areas is a viable means by which the prevalence and genetic variation of SARS-CoV-2 within a metropolitan community of approximately one million individuals may be monitored, as our efforts detected the introduction and emergence of variants of concern in the city of Louisville. Importantly, these efforts confirm that regional emergence and spread of variants of interest/concern may be detected as readily in aggregate wastewater samples as compared to the individual wastewater sheds.

Methods: Data was collected from an adult major trauma centre, paediatric major trauma centre, district general hospital, and a regional hand trauma unit. Data collection included patient demographics, injury mechanism, injury type and treatment required. Time periods studied corresponded with the two weeks leading up to lockdown in the UK, two weeks during lockdown, and the same two-week period in 2019. Results: There was a 55.7% (12,935 vs 5,733) reduction in total accident and emergency (A&E) attendances with a 53.7% (354 vs 164) reduction in trauma admissions during lockdown compared to 2019. The number of patients with fragility fractures requiring admission remained constant (32 patients in 2019 vs 31 patients during lockdown; p > 0.05). Road traffic collisions (57.1%, n = 8) were the commonest cause of major trauma admissions during lockdown. There was a significant increase in DIY related-hand injuries (26% (n = 13)) lockdown vs 8% (n = 11 in 2019, p = 0.006) during lockdown, which resulted in an increase in nerve injuries (12% (n = 6 in lockdown) vs 2.5% (n = 3 in 2019, p = 0.015) and hand infections (24% (n = 12) in lockdown vs 6.2% (n = 8) in 2019, p = 0.002). Conclusion: The national lockdown has dramatically reduced orthopaedic trauma admissions. The incidence of fragility fractures requiring surgery has not changed.

In humans, ARDS can be caused directly through damage of the epithelial tissue or indirectly through damage of the endothelial tissue. Different animal models to induce ALI have been developed to mimic the complex pathophysiology of ARDS, including the use of oleic acid injections. Oleic acid induces clinical ARDS by inducing an extensive immune response, including having direct effects on innate immune cells in the lungs triggering direct inflammatory mediator production, damaging the alveoli-capillary unit with increase of alveolar leakage and impairment of gas exchange. There is a paucity of data available to characterize the use of cytokine markers in pediatric ARDS swine models. We hypothesize that in a pediatric swine model of oleic acid ARDS, pro and anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA in plasma will display at differing concentrations than the baseline at ARDS. METHODS: Seven juvenile swine were sedated, intubated, and mechanically ventilated. ARDS was established using continuous oleic acid infusion at 0.05-0.6 mL/kg. Blood samples were taken from the femoral artery before oleic acid infusion was initiated, an hour after and at the start of ARDS. Plasma was collected and mRNA was extracted from blood mononuclear cells (MNC). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed on samples testing for the presence of mRNA for IFN-, TNF-, IL-17, IL-10, and IL-6. RESULTS: 4-5 10 mL blood samples were collected from each animal and analyzed. When compared to baseline, IFN- collected at ARDS onset significantly decreased by a foldchange of 0.530.4 at ARDS (p=0.028). IL-6 trended down at ARDS onset, although this was not significant (p=0.087). Changes of TNF-, IL-17 and IL-10 levels at ARDS onset were not significant (p=0.740, p=0.262, and p=0.342) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In an oleic acid swine model, ARDS is characterized by decreasing IFN- levels. This data does correlate with severe ARDS caused by COVID in human patients.

When common and rare sounds continue in stable probabilities over a very long period, neonates respond to all sounds equivalently (no differentiation). However, when the same common and rare sounds at the same probabilities alternate over time, the neonate responses show clear differentiations. The context-dependence is consistent with the possibility that the neonate brain produces more precise internal models that discriminate between contexts when there is an emergent structure to be discovered but appears to adopt broader models when discrimination delivers little or no additional information about the environment.","output":"Relevance to the higher order structure may govern auditory statistical learning in neonates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease (COVID-19) was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March, 2020. Since then, physical distancing measures such as confinement have been adopted by different governments to control human to human transmission. This study aimed to determine how confinement affects children's routines, more specifically their physical activity (PA) and sedentary time. An online survey was launched to assess how Portuguese children under 13 years of age adjusted their daily routines to confinement. Parents reported the time each child was engaged in different activities throughout the day, which was used to calculate overall sedentary time and overall physical activity time. Based on the data of 2159 children, our study showed that during confinement: (i) there was a decrease in children's physical activity time and an increase in screen time and family activities; (ii) boys engaged in more playful screen Time than girls (p < 0.05), and girls played more without PA than boys (p < 0.05); (iii) along the age groups, there was a trend for an increase of the overall sedentary time and an associated decrease of the overall physical activity time. In summary, PA of confined children showed low levels and a clear decreasing trend along childhood.

This evolution was thought to occur by independent generation of DI RNAs during virus passages and subsequent selection of new DI RNAs under new cellular conditions. Here we demonstrate that recombination between the old DI RNA and the helper viral RNA can be one of the mechanisms for natural DI RNA evolution. A mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) DI RNA, DIssE RNA, was transcribed in vitro and transfected into a mouse cell line infected with a different MHV strain (A59), which is distinguishable from the original natural helper MHV (JHM). During subsequent serial undiluted passages of the harvested virus, several novel DI RNA species were generated, while the original DIssE RNA disappeared by passage 11. cDNA cloning and sequence analysis of one of these novel DI RNAs, designated DI-2, revealed that it is composed of four discontinuous regions of the genomic sequence and is different from the structure of the original DIssE RNA. Sequence comparison among DI-2, DIssE, and helper MHV-A59 RNAs showed that DI-2 sequence is similar to DIssE in the first and second regions, but similar to the helper A59 virus in the third and last regions. Thus, this DI RNA was generated by RNA recombination between the original DIssE RNA and the herper viral RNA. These results indicate that recombination between DI RNA and helper virus RNA can be involved in the natural evolution of DI RNAs.","output":"Natural Evolution of Coronavirus Defective-Interfering RNA Involves RNA Recombination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Similarities exist between our past experience of viral diseases and COVID-19 concerning the mental health issues of sufferers of an epidemic, frontline health workers and the social and psychological impact on society.

However, vaccine acceptance varies among communities around the world. Social media usage is arguably one of the factors affecting public attitudes towards vaccines. Objective: This study aims to identify if the social media usages factors can be used to predict attitudes and behavior towards the COVID-19 vaccines among the people in the Arab world. Methods: An online survey was conducted in the Arab countries and 217 Arab people participated in this study. Logistic regression was applied to identify what demographics and social media usage factors predict public attitudes and behavior towards the COVID-19 vaccines. Results: Of the 217 participants, 56.22% of them were willing to accept the vaccine and 41.47% of them were hesitant. This study shows that none of the social media usages factors were significant enough to predict the actual vaccine acceptance behavior. Whereas the analysis showed few of the social media usage factors can predict public attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccines. For example, frequent social media users were 2.85 times more likely to agree that the risk of COVID-19 is being exaggerated (OR=2.85, 95% CI=0.86-9.45, p=0.046) than infrequent social media users.

As a collection of measurements in chronological order, a time series needs to be discretized into symbolic sequences, and then users can apply sequential pattern mining methods to discover interesting patterns in time series. The discretization will not only cause the loss of some important information, which partially destroys the continuity of time series, but also ignore the order relations between time-series values. Inspired by order-preserving matching, this article explores a new method called order-preserving sequential pattern (OPP) mining, which does not need to discretize time series into symbolic sequences and represents patterns based on the order relations of time series. An inherent advantage of such representation is that the trend of a time series can be represented by the relative order of the values underneath time series. We propose an OPP-Miner algorithm to mine frequent patterns in time series with the same relative order. OPP-Miner employs the filtration and verification strategies to calculate the support and uses the pattern fusion strategy to generate candidate patterns. To compress the result set, we also study to find the maximal OPPs. Experimental results validate that OPP-Miner is not only efficient but can also discover similar subsequences in time series. In addition, case studies show that our algorithms have high utility in analyzing the COVID-19 epidemic by identifying critical trends and improve the clustering performance.

We sought to evaluate the in vitro effects of dexamethasone phosphate on T cell function in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with acute, severe, and moderate coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Prospective in vitro laboratory study. SETTING: Coronavirus disease 2019-specific medical wards and ICUs at a single-center, quaternary-care academic hospital between October 1, 2020, and November 15, 2020. PATIENTS: Eleven patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to either the ICU or hospital coronavirus disease 2019 unit. Three patients had received at least one dose of dexamethasone prior to enrollment. INTERVENTIONS: Fresh whole blood was collected, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were immediately isolated and plated onto precoated enzyme-linked immunospot plates for detection of interferon- production. Samples were incubated with CD3/CD28 antibodies alone and with three concentrations of dexamethasone. These conditions were also stimulated with recombinant human interleukin-7. Following overnight incubation, the plates were washed and stained for analysis using Cellular Technology Limited ImmunoSpot S6 universal analyzer (ImmunoSpot by Cellular Technology Limited, Cleveland, OH). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Functional cytokine production was assessed by quantitation of cell spot number and total well intensity after calculation for each enzyme-linked immunospot well using the Cellular Technology Limited ImmunoSpot Version 7.0 professional software (CTL Analyzers, Shaker Heights, OH). Comparisons were made using t test and using a nonparametric analysis of variance Friedman test.

Of students relying on the pantry for monthly visits, only 27% were affected by COVID-19. Thus far, 97% of implementation costs are attributed to staff pay. The majority of landfilled food waste (591.4 pounds) was produce (15.8% fruit, 49.9% vegetables) and 18.2% was from premade items like sandwiches, salads, and pastas. Average student satisfaction (n = 45) was 27.3 out of 30 and acceptability was 13.7 out of 16. The pantry is well accepted by students and results suggest it may be needed beyond pandemic times with limited users being affected by COVID-19. Additionally, while advantageous that the pantry receives premade food from other campus programs, more research is needed to determine if the pantry is the best option for redistributing these food items.

Although many instruments facilitating OLV are available, the choice is limited in pediatric patients. PATIENT CONCERNS A 4-year-old female (weight: 18.6 kg, height: 100 cm) was admitted via our pediatric outpatient clinic because of recurrent hemoptysis, 2 weeks in duration. She had no medical or surgical history. DIAGNOSIS Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a 4.5-cm-diameter mass in the left, lower lung lobe. She was diagnosed with a congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM). INTERVENTIONS She was scheduled for emergency lobectomy via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). To ensure successful VATS, OLV was essential. As our hospital lacked a small-diameter fiberoptic bronchoscope and a proper bronchial blocker, we decided to use single-lumen tube (SLT) with adult fiberoptic bronchoscope. OUTCOMES We performed successful bronchoscopic-guided OLV using a SLT. We aligned the tube to the right upper lobar bronchus and Murphy eye to prevent obstruction of the right upper lobe bronchus. At the end of surgery, the endotracheal tube lumen had been narrowed by blood clots, we decided to exchange the tracheal tube. The tube was immediately exchanged. After re-intubation, the pulse oximetry (SpO2) then gradually increased. LESSONS Appropriate preparation and careful management should be considered to perform OLV in pediatric patients without significant complications.","output":"A case of one-lung ventilation using a single-lumen tube placed under fiberoptic bronchoscopic guidance in a 4-year-old child: A case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine immunization is now one of the most effective ways to control porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection.

We conducted a one-center study to comprehensively analyze the effects of kidney involvement on the course and outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, depending on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at admission. Out of the 1958 patients, 1342 (68.54%) had eGFR  60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (group A) and 616 (31.46%) had eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (group B). Group B was additionally divided into subgroups B1, B2, and B3 based on eGFR. We found that mortality rates during hospitalization, as well as after 90 and 180 days, were much higher in group B than group A. The highest mortality was observed in the B2 subgroup with eGFR of 15C29. The mortality of B patients was associated with comorbidities, respiratory dysfunction, immunological impairment, and more frequent development of AKI. AKI had a negative impact on patients survival, regardless of the initial renal function. At discharge, 7.4% of patients had serum creatinine levels 30% higher, or more, as compared to admission.

Though many approaches have been developed to generate desired structures in polymeric films, few of them can effectively and dynamically achieve periodic porous structures. Here, a facile way is proposed to introduce periodic stratified porous structures into polyelectrolyte films. A photo-crosslinkable polyelectrolyte film of poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) and photoreactive poly(acrylic acid) derivative (PAA-N3 ) is prepared by layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly. Stratified crosslinking of the PEI/PAA-N3 film is generated basing on standing-wave optics. The periodic stratified porous structure is constructed by forming pores in noncrosslinked regions in the film. Thanks to the dynamic mobility of polyelectrolytes, this structural controlment can be repeated several times. The size of pores corresponding to the layer spacing of the film contributes to the structural colors. Furthermore, structural color patterns are fabricated in the film by selective photo-crosslinking using photomasks. Although the large-scale structural controlment in thick (micron-scale and above) films needs to be explored further, this work highlights the periodic structural controlment in polymeric films and thus presents an approach for application potentials in sensor, detection, and ink-free printing.","output":"Periodic Stratified Porous Structures in Dynamic Polyelectrolyte Films Through Standing-Wave Optical Crosslinking for Structural Color."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: There currently exists limited and conflicting clinical data on the use of statins amongst COVID-19 patients. Given the both paucity and lack of consensus among data on statin's efficacy and safety amongst COVID-19 patients, the current guideline is to continue statin in COVID-19 patients, who have previously been treated with statins. The aim of this paper was to compare hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who did and did not receive statins, in terms of COVID-19 outcomes. Methods: We conducted population-based retrospective study using South Korea's nationwide healthcare database as of May 15 2020. We identified 4,349 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and aged 40 years or older. The cohort entry was defined as the date of hospitalization. Statin users were individuals with inpatient and outpatient prescription records of statins in the 240 days before cohort entry, and non-users were those without such records during this period. Our primary outcome was a composite endpoint of all-cause death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation use and cardiovascular outcomes (myocardial infarction (MI), transient cerebral ischemic attacks (TIA) or stroke). We conducted inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted logistic regression analysis to estimate odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), to compare outcomes between statin users and non-users. Findings: 1,115 patients were statin users (mean age = 65.9 years; 60% female), and 3,234 were non-users (mean age = 58.3 years; 64% female). Statin use was not associated with increased risk of the primary outcome (IPTW OR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.60-1.11). Subgroup analysis showed a protective role of statins, for individuals with hypertension (IPTW OR 0.40; 95% CI: 0.23-0.69, p for interaction: 0.0087). Interpretation: Given that statins are not detrimental and that it may be beneficial amongst hypertensive patients and relatively cheap, we would encourage further investigation into statin for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","output":"The association between statin and COVID-19 adverse outcomes: National COVID-19 cohort in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged all business owners to maintain their businesses and find ways to cope with the uncertainty. The functional beverage market has shifted its focus to consumers health value and wellness while its operators still lack knowledge to develop their products to serve customer needs, particularly to penetrate new customer groups, which are tourists. Therefore, the objective of this research is to investigate major influential factors of consumer behavior and create a decision support system (DSS) of consumer behavior (CB) on functional beverage. Samples are 378 Chinese tourists who visited Thailand in 2019 before the COVID-19 outbreak. The structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to analyze the data while the sensitivity analysis was to test model robustness. The results showed that motivation, reference group, and knowledge have indirectly influenced CB (buying behavior, brand consciousness, health consciousness, and quality consciousness) through Marketing Mix (MM) while MM has a direct influence on CB. Moreover, sensitivity analysis expressed that either increasing or decreasing place and decreasing knowledge can influence CB factors. These results confirmed that consumers in the new normal market were interested in brands, quality, and health;therefore, brand consciousness/brand creation was a crucial challenge for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the industry as they needed to improve product quality and be informative in terms of products health benefits. Hence, SMEs had to develop the product serving customer needs, gaining competitive advantages, and boosting up the economic cycle of the whole tourism supply chain from Thailands sandbox project. The value of DSS can help entrepreneurs decide to produce beverage to meet Chinese tourists satisfaction and to save cost for product development. It is an applicable tool for entrepreneurs, chiefly SMEs, to penetrate a new tourism market and choose a new suitable product that serves consumer needs in terms of tastes, brand awareness, and health benefits in the post-pandemic era. ? 2022 King Mongkuts University of Technology North Bangkok.

ACE2 is one of the key enzymes in renin-angiotensin system and plays a vital role in the maintenance of cardiovascular function. ACE/ACE2 balance is critical in the regulation of blood pressure, electrolyte homeostasis, vascular and cardiac remodeling and inflammation. ACE2 was shown to be abundantly present in human epithelial cells of the lung and enterocytes of the small intestine as well as in endothelial cells of the arterial and venous vessels. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are colocalized on the cell surface and produced a critical step host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS2-cleaved ACE2 permits SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry however, ADAM17-cleaved ACE2 produces protective effects in several organs. Differently, basigin (CD147) was suggested as a putative alternate receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into endothelial cells. The intestinal ACE2 receptor is associated with the neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 and ACE2 is necessary for the expression of this transporter on the luminal surface of intestinal epithelial cells. There is a good association between the localization of SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor ACE2 and the disease target organs in respiratory, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. Decreased expression of ACE2, being a receptor for coronavirus, would prevent cellular entry of the virus thereby reducing progression of the infection. However, increased ACE2 expression produces beneficial health effects. Further studies are needed to clarify this conflicting situation. Currently, it is recommended to continue the therapy with ACE2-increasing drugs in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Epithelial and Endothelial Expressions of ACE2: SARS-CoV-2 Entry Routes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: As of March 3, 2020, the Shincheonji religious group accounted for the majority of Korean cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Clinical, biological and radiological data, as well as mortality rates, were collected from hospital medical records. RESULTS: A total of 293 periods of hospitalization were analysed in 288 patients. Mean age was 66.1 years old and 57.3% were females. Nineteen patients (6.48%) met the inclusion criteria to be categorized as a nosocomial infection with SARS-CoV-2. In a comparison between patients with and without nosocomial infection, age, mortality and hospital length of stay were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The median time from admission to diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort was 16 days (6-86 days). No statistically significant differences were found in sex, living situation, reason of admission or period of admission (even if we observed that most of the nosocomial infections (78.9%) occurred in March). CONCLUSION: We have found a 6.48% of nosocomial infection with SARS-CoV-2, but with an important reduction of it after undergoing preventing protocols that included screening RT-PCR test for COVID-19.

METHODS: In each trial, RECLAIM and RECLAIM 3 (cIAI; NCT01499290/NCT01726023), REPRISE (cIAI/cUTI; NCT01644643), RECAPTURE (cUTI; NCT01595438/NCT01599806), and REPROVE (HAP/VAP; NCT01808092), patients were randomized 1:1 to intravenous ceftazidime-avibactam (plus metronidazole for those with cIAI) or comparators (carbapenems in > 97% patients) for 5C21 days. Efficacy assessments included clinical and microbiological responses at the test-of-cure visit in the pooled Gram-negative extended microbiologically evaluable (GNeME) population (bacteremia subset). Safety outcomes were summarized for patients with positive bacterial blood culture(s) at baseline who received  1 dose of study treatment. RESULTS: The overall safety population included 4050 patients (ceftazidime-avibactam, n = 2024; comparator, n = 2026). The GNeME population (bacteremia subset) comprised 101 patients (ceftazidime-avibactam, n = 54; comparator, n = 47). Clinical cure rates (all indications combined) were 47/54 (87.0%) for ceftazidime-avibactam and 39/47 (83.0%) for comparators; favorable microbiological response rates were 43/54 (79.6%) and 32/47 (68.1%), respectively. Clinical and microbiological responses in the bacteremia subset were generally similar to those in the overall set. The pattern of adverse events in patients with bacteremia was similar between treatment groups and was consistent with the known safety profile of ceftazidime-avibactam.

The dynamic changes of serum SCD-1, CRP, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, and Vit D levels a well as the disease activity were investigated in three-time points (T1-T3). Our results indicated that the COVID-19 patients had significantly increased SCD-1, CRP, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-18 levels than in HS, while the Vit D levels in COVID-19 patients were significantly lower than HS. Further analysis demonstrated that the SCD-1, CRP, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-18 levels in ICU patients were significantly higher than in non-ICU patients. Tracking dynamic changes in the above markers indicated that on the day of admission, the SCD-1, CRP, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-18 levels were gradually increased on day 5 (T2) and then gradually decreased on day 10 (T3). ROC curve analysis suggests that markers mentioned above, SDC-1, IL-6, and IL-18 are valuable indicators in evaluating the activity of COVID-19.

The study examined stress, anxiety, and coping in a data-driven, real-time assessment of 122 youth with and without ASD and their parents at the height of the COVID-19 shutdown and three-months later. Standardized measures were administered to ascertain stress and coping explicitly related to the pandemic (RSQ COVID-19-Child [self-report], Adult [self-report from the guardian of youth], Parent [report about child]) and anxiety (STAI-C, STAI-A). Multivariate, univariate analyses of variance and hierarchical regression were used. ASD youth endorsed more Trait anxiety and response to specific stressors (e.g., virus). Caregivers of youth with ASD (Adults) self-reported higher anxiety, yet scores were elevated for both groups. Adults of youth with ASD reported more stress, especially related to the virus, access to healthcare, and concern for the future. In the TD group, youth and adults used more Primary and Secondary Control Coping whereas ASD youth and adults used more Disengagement Coping. Adult stress was the primary predictor of parent perception of child stress as well as Child self-reported stress.

We take ideas from the Scheme family of programming languages and solve these two problems simultaneously by proposing a novel hygienic macro system custom-built for ITPs. We further describe how our approach can be extended to cover type-directed macro expansion resulting in a single, uniform system offering multiple abstraction levels that range from supporting simplest syntax sugars to elaboration of formerly baked-in syntax. We have implemented our new macro system and integrated it into the upcoming version (v4) of the Lean theorem prover. Despite its expressivity, the macro system is simple enough that it can easily be integrated into other systems.

We assess the impact of COVID-19 on psychiatric symptoms in healthcare workers, those with psychiatric comorbidities, and the general population. We highlight the challenges ahead and discuss the increased relevance of telepsychiatry. We analyzed all available literature available as of March 25, 2020, on PubMed, Ovid Medline, and PsychInfo. We utilized the MeSH term \\"covid AND (psychiatry OR mental health)\\" and included all articles. Duplicates were removed resulting in 32 articles, of which 19 are cited. Four additional references are included to examine suicide data. During the review process, an additional 7 articles were identified which are also included. Frontline healthcare workers are currently experiencing increased psychiatric symptoms and this is more severe in females and nurses. Non-frontline healthcare workers, as well as the general population, are experiencing vicarious traumatization. People with psychiatric comorbidities, and the general population, face increased psychiatric symptom burden. Migrant workers, the elderly, children, and the homeless may be disproportionately impacted. Suicide rates may be impacted. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a severe disruption to the delivery of mental healthcare. Psychiatric facilities are facing unprecedented disruptions in care provision as they struggle to manage an infected population with comorbid psychiatric symptoms.

To this aim, the book explores the so-called theory revolution that began to take shape in the late 1960s, with the writing of Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault. One focus of the investigation is the undertheorisation of gender in the work of these key theorists so that the focus of the first part of the book explored how, as opposed to death, women writers turn rather to madness as the gateway to a new authorship and agency. In this fiction, madness is re-engineered through writing into a reverse discourse describing the conditions of womens suffering under patriarchal law. Also, the chapter summarises how more contemporary fiction explores postpostmodern (metamodern) constructions of authorship as a new transnational and global world emerges. As the writings of Coetzee, Rushdie and Mantel suggest, the author might now be seen to have a therapeutic function in an age of globalised risk and trauma: the author becomes a kind of therapist for the present and a curator of the past.","output":"Conclusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Heart\\\\healthy lifestyles promote lifelong cardiovascular health. However, patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are often advised to avoid strenuous exercise because of the risk of sudden cardiac death. Given these restrictions, this study explored youth and parent perceptions of a heart\\\\healthy lifestyle and the barriers and facilitators to this lifestyle. METHODS AND RESULTS: Youth and parents were purposefully recruited at 2 Canadian hospitals for this photovoice project. Participants were given cameras and took pictures of everyday heart\\\\healthy or heart\\\\unhealthy choices. Photos were discussed during one\\\\on\\\\one qualitative interviews with youth and parents separately to understand the photos meaning and significance. Inductive descriptive thematic analysis was employed. A total of 16 youth (median age, 14.4 years [range, 10.5C17.7 years]; 63% boys) and 16 parents (100% women) participated. A total of 15 youth were activity restricted. Data analysis revealed 7 categories organized into perceptions of healthy living (health is holistic and individualized) and factors influencing engagement in healthy living (self\\\\awareness, ownership and autonomy, feeling restricted and peer pressure, support from parents, and support from the cardiologist). Participants had a complex understanding of health and discussed the importance of physical, mental, and social well\\\\being. Youth used self\\\\awareness and taking responsibility as facilitators of healthy living. Healthy living was shaped by peers, parent role\\\\modeling, and cardiologist recommendations.

On the one hand, we believe that the distinguished contributions in disease containment efforts by healthcare professionals indicated that our medical education system has achieved its intended outcomes and is socially accountable. On the other hand, we have also identified three major issues that need to be addressed from an educational standpoint: insufficient emphasis on public health emergency preparedness; unsophisticated mechanisms for interdisciplinary cooperation; and inadequate guidance in medical ethics. Whilst these reflections might be seen in its summative form, we would suggest changing it to that of a formative process, where we learn from our assessment through observation and feedback of the gaps, upon which improvement of our present situation can be made.

The most popular search engine worldwide is Google, and since March 2020, COVID-19 has been a global trending search term. Misinformation related to COVID-19 from these searches is a problem, and hence, it is of high importance to assess the quality of health information over the internet related to COVID-19. The objective of our study is to examine the quality of COVID-19 related health information over the internet using the DISCERN tool. Methods: The keywords included in assessment of COVID-19 related information using Google's search engine were \\"Coronavirus,\\" \\"Coronavirus causes,\\" \\"Coronavirus diagnosis,\\" \\"Coronavirus prevention,\\" and \\"Coronavirus management\\". The first 20 websites from each search term were gathered to generate a list of 100 URLs. Duplicate sites were excluded from this search, allowing analysis of unique sites only. Additional exclusion criteria included scientific journals, nonoperational links, nonfunctional websites (where the page was not loading, was not found, or was inactive), and websites in languages other than English. This resulted in a unique list of 48 websites. Four independent raters evaluated the websites using a 16-item DISCERN tool to assess the quality of novel coronavirus related information available on the internet.

The proposed video-summarization technique is a step in this direction that provides clinicians access to relevant key-frames from a given ultrasound scan (such as lung ultrasound) while reducing resource, storage and bandwidth requirements. We propose a new unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) framework with novel rewards that facilitates unsupervised learning avoiding tedious and impractical manual labelling for summarizing ultrasound videos to enhance its utility as a triage tool in the emergency department (ED) and for use in telemedicine. Using an attention ensemble of encoders, the high dimensional image is projected into a low dimensional latent space in terms of: a) reduced distance with a normal or abnormal class (classifier encoder), b) following a topology of landmarks (segmentation encoder), and c) the distance or topology agnostic latent representation (convolutional autoencoders). The decoder is implemented using a bi-directional long-short term memory (Bi-LSTM) which utilizes the latent space representation from the encoder. Our new paradigm for video summarization is capable of delivering classification labels and segmentation of key landmarks for each of the summarized keyframes. Validation is performed on lung ultrasound (LUS) dataset, that typically represent potential use cases in telemedicine and ED triage acquired from different medical centers across geographies (India, Spain and Canada).","output":"Unsupervised multi-latent space reinforcement learning framework for video summarization in ultrasound imaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biological membranes have as a major function the compartmentation of biological processes in cells and organelles.

Detergents are needed to remove integral membrane proteins from the lipid bilayer and they have to be present during further chromatographic purification. Predominantly, four modes of HPLC have been used alone or in combination for the puridication of integral membrane proteins. These are based on differences of proteins in size (size-exclusion chromatography, SEC), electrostatic interaction (ion-exchange chromatography, IEC), bioaffinity (bioaffinity chromatography, BAC) and hydrophobic interaction (reversed-phase chromatography, RPC, and hydrophobic-interaction chromatography, HIC). SEC, IEC, BAC and HIC are used under relatively mild conditions, and buffer systems generally contain a non-ionic detergent.

Routine mask use by frontline HCW was not recommended when seeing 'low risk' patients. The aim of this review was to determine the carriage of respiratory viruses on facemasks used by HCW. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted with structured searches of medical and allied health databases. Two authors independently screened articles for inclusion, with substantial agreement (k = 0.66, 95% CI 0.54-0.79). Studies that at least one author recommended for full text review were reviewed in full for inclusion. Two authors independently extracted data from included studies including the setting, method of analysis and results. There was exact agreement on the proportion of virus detected on masks. RESULTS: We retrieved 1233 titles, 47 underwent full text review and five studies reported in four articles were included. The studies were limited by small numbers and failure to test all eligible masks in some studies. The proportion in each study ranged from 0 (95% CI 0-10) to 25% (95% CI 8-54). No study reported clinical respiratory illness as a result of virus on the masks. CONCLUSIONS: Although limited, current evidence suggests that viral carriage on the outer surface of surgical masks worn by HCW treating patients with clinical respiratory illness is low and there was not strong evidence to support the assumption that mask use may increase the risk of viral transmission.","output":"What proportion of healthcare worker masks carry virus?

The study cohort comprised 68 patients with a mean age of 44 (range, 18 to 83): 36 unilateral and 32 bilateral hernias. Twelve patients also underwent umbilical hernia repair with the Ventralex patch requiring no additional incisions. A 2.5-cm to 3-cm crescentic incision within the confines of the umbilicus was performed. Standard dissecting instruments and 52-cm/5.5-mm/30(0) laparoscope were used. Operation times were 50 minutes for unilateral and 80 minutes for bilateral. There was one conversion to conventional 3-port laparoscopic repair and none to open surgery. Outpatient surgery was achieved in all (except one). Analgesic requirements were minimal: 8 Dextropropoxyphene tablets (range, 0 to 20).

Oral or subcutaneous methotrexate (MTX) is a first-line antipsoriatic treatment, whose adverse effects can be observed even at low doses. To minimize systemic side effects, antipsoriatic drugs should be administered topically, since they could permeate the stratum corneum. As liquid crystals with lamellar phase (LP) can be helpful in promoting skin permeation, this work evaluated two MTX-loaded LPs (C1CH and C1CHCE), based on stearic acid, cholesterol and ceramides, like topical treatments for mice with imiquimod-induced psoriasis. METHODS: C1CH and C1CHCE were topically administered to mice with imiquimod-induced psoriasis. Dexamethasone cream was used as positive treatment control. Skin histology and inflammation biomarkers were assessed. KEY FINDINGS: C1CH and C1CHCE exhibited marked immunomodulatory effects and induced extensive microstructural skin remodelling on the epidermis and dermis. These formulations increased keratinization score, epidermis thickness, inflammatory infiltrate, hair follicle hypertrophy and vascular congestion in the dermis. C1CH and C1CHCE also attenuated IL-10 upregulation and upregulated IL-1, IFN-?3, TNF- and prostaglandin E2 levels, as well as myeloperoxidase, N-acetyl-?-d-glucosaminidase and cyclooxygenase 2 activity compared with untreated psoriatic animals.

PURPOSE Discharge prescriptions represent an important aspect of care for patients seen in the emergency department (ED) setting and are used by providers to continue therapy for acute illness once patients leave the ED or to prevent future exacerbations of chronic conditions. The success of an ED discharge and the medications prescribed rely on patient compliance. Compliance depends on patients' ability to obtain prescriptions, which can be hindered by limited access to pharmacies and cost. SUMMARY In order to address issues traditionally associated with medication noncompliance, a discharge pharmacy was implemented within a busy urban ED. The pharmacy began processing prescriptions on December 18, 2019, using a formulary aimed towards providing commonly prescribed and high-risk medications. The pharmacy accepts insurance plans in addition to utilizing 340B Drug Pricing Program pricing to offer affordable medications to patients. During the first year of operation 10,230 prescriptions were filled for 5,703 patients, representing 13% of all patients discharged during that time. Of the prescriptions filled, 35.4% were for products considered high-risk medications, including epinephrine auto-injectors, insulin, and antibiotics. Over 50% of these high-risk medications were provided to patients through reduced cash pricing. Pharmacist interventions were made on 4.3% of prescriptions to address incorrect dosing, avoid use of inappropriate antibiotics, and recommend alternative therapies. CONCLUSION The implementation of a discharge pharmacy within the ED allowed over 5,700 patients to be discharged with medications and represents a potential solution to issues surrounding medication noncompliance. Similar initiatives have the opportunity to improve medication access for a larger ED population.","output":"Initiation of a discharge pharmacy within a busy urban emergency department: The first year."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the Fall 2020 semester, faculty at colleges and universities across the United States changed course structures in many ways to adapt to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

Faculty were given substantial flexibility in how they restructured their courses, within constraints of socially distanced classrooms and accessibility for students. In prior semesters, our upper\\\\division undergraduate animal physiology course met fully in\\\\person for three 50\\\\minute lecture periods and one 3\\\\hour lab period per week. In fall 2020, a previously planned shift to a 4\\\\day class week had led to a change to two 80\\\\minute lecture periods and one 3\\\\hour lab period per week. To align with COVID mitigation policies, the class was further restructured to a hybrid format as follows: For lecture, half of the students attended the first in\\\\person class meeting of the week, and the other half attended the second in\\\\person class meeting of the week. The same topics were covered in both in\\\\person sessions in a given week and all in\\\\person classes were recorded for asynchronous viewing by students who did not attend in person that week.

The major evasion mechanisms from the host immune system by Brucella are restraint of complement pathway and Toll\\\\like receptors signaling pathways, interference with efficient antigen presentation to CD4\\\\positive T lymphocytes, selective subversion of autophagy pathways, inhibition of dendritic cell stimulation, inhibition of autophagolysosomal fusion, and macrophage apoptosis. Many molecular and cellular pathways contribute to brucellosis that microRNAs have a vital function in the immunopathogenesis of this disease. In this regard, these molecules apply for their roles by modulating various events like inflammatory reactions and immune defense. Recently, in the case of immunity to human brucellosis, it has been shown that microRNAs play an important role in immunity against these bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we tried to review the immune defense and immunopathogenesis of Brucella infection and highlight the current knowledge of the microRNAs in infected cells by Brucella pathogens. The recent findings suggest that the regulation of microRNAs expression is impaired during brucellosis infection, which may contribute to disease progression or inhibition by modulating immune responses against this pathogen.

Material and methods: A total of 180 teeth were treated with Bifluorid 10 and 160 with Futurabond U. Outcome measurements were taken one or two weeks before treatment, at baseline at the application days, at 1 week and at 1C6 months after first treatment. Results: Both treatments reduced pain intensity. Bifluorid 10 and Futurabond U have similar efficacy in reducing SCHIFF-measured pain reduction, while Bifluorid 10 is significantly more efficient for VAS-measured pain reduction, mainly due to long-term pain reduction. Patient age has a significant negative influence on pain reduction, while the influence of patient gender and BEWE of the tooth is insignificant. Conclusions: Bifluorid 10 and Futurabond U are effective in the treatment of dental hypersensitivity. The RCT was registered at the US National Institutes of Health (ClinicalTrials.gov) #NCT04813848.","output":"Long-Term Effectiveness of Treating Dentin Hypersensitivity with Bifluorid 10 and Futurabond U: A Split-Mouth Randomized Double-Blind Clinical Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been spreading rapidly across the world A nucleic acid real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) test of nasopharyngeal samples is the standard method for the diagnosis of an active SARS-CoV-2 infection However, many limitations of the RQ-PCR tests make them unsuitable for the simple and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 patients Moreover, some individuals with COVID-19 present an asymptomatic infection Thus, assessing the asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19, especially in healthcare workers (HCWs), is crucial for evaluating the efficiency of the current preventive measures Serological tests such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are needed to quickly identify a large number of asymptomatic carriers to prevent the further spread of the virus and assess level of possible serological immunity in a community Method Between April 18 and June 17, 2020, 330 HCWs from five Madinah region-affiliated hospitals underwent a seroprevalence screening for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (immunoglobulin [Ig]M/IgA and IgG) using indirect ELISA testing Result Among the 330 samples, 80 (24 24%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgA and/or IgG antibodies There were no significant differences observed in the seroprevalence among the different occupations of the HCWs (excluding the pharmacists) with respect to the percentage of their seropositive samples Conclusion The current study presented the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgA and IgG antibodies in HCWs The regular screening of HCWs for these antibodies is necessary;subsequently, a molecular test is recommended for those with seropositive (IgM, IgA, and IgG) samples to assess their viral load and potential shedding","output":"Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgM/IgA and IgG Antibodies Among Healthcare Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Regioselective synthesis of novel 2H,3H-[1,4]thiazino[2,3,4-ij]quinolin-4-ium derivatives has been developed by annulation reactions of 8-quinolinesulfenyl halides with vinyl chalcogenides (vinyl ethers, divinyl sulfide, divinyl selenide and phenyl vinyl sulfide) and tetravinyl silane.

This theory is further augmented by reports of a pathogenic effect of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus\\\\2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) on the central nervous system with specific impact on the dopaminergic pathway, as well as the possibility of the virus to selectively bind to Angiotensin\\\\Converting Enzyme\\\\2 (ACE\\\\2); these molecules are expressed abundantly in the midbrain dopamine neurons and, are likely involved in several cellular mechanisms cited in Parkinson's Disease (PD) pathophysiology.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether wearable activity trackers could provide information regarding users' adherence to home confinement policies because of their capacity for seamless and continuous monitoring of individuals natural activity patterns regardless of their location. METHODS: We analyzed big data from individuals using activity trackers (Withings) that count the wearers average daily number of steps in a number of representative nations that adopted different modalities of restriction of citizens activities. RESULTS: Data on the number of steps per day from over 740,000 individuals around the world were analyzed. We demonstrate the physical activity patterns in several representative countries with total, partial, or no home confinement. The decrease in steps per day in regions with strict total home confinement ranged from 25% to 54%. Partial lockdown (characterized by social distancing measures such as school closures, bar and restaurant closures, and cancellation of public meetings but without strict home confinement) does not appear to have a significant impact on peoples activity compared to the pre-pandemic period. The absolute level of physical activity under total home confinement in European countries is around twofold that in China. In some countries, such as France and Spain, physical activity started to gradually decrease even before official commitment to lockdown as a result of initial less stringent restriction orders or self-quarantine. However, physical activity began to increase again in the last 2 weeks, suggesting a decrease in compliance with confinement orders.

Given the intrinsic limitations of surgical interventions and the difficulties associated with lifestyle changes, pharmacological manipulation is currently one of the main therapies for metabolic diseases. Approaches aiming to promote energy expenditure through induction of thermogenesis have been explored and, in this context, brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation and browning have been shown to be promising strategies. Although such processes are physiologically stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system, not all situations that are known to increase adrenergic signaling promote a concomitant increase in BAT activation or browning in humans. Thus, a better understanding of factors involved in the thermogenesis attributed to these tissues is needed to enable the development of future therapies against obesity. Herein we carry out a critical review of original articles in humans under conditions previously known to trigger adrenergic responses-namely, cold, catecholamine-secreting tumor (pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma), burn injury, and adrenergic agonists-and discuss which of them are associated with increased BAT activation and browning. BAT is clearly stimulated in individuals exposed to cold or treated with high doses of the ?3-adrenergic agonist mirabegron, whereas browning is certainly induced in patients after burn injury or with pheochromocytoma, as well as in individuals treated with ?3-adrenergic agonist mirabegron for at least 10 weeks.

However, the impact of shear stress on the capacity of EPCs in CAD patients has not been elucidated yet. The C-X-C chemokine receptor 7/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (CXCR7)/(ERK) pathways are identified to regulate EPCs function in CAD patients. Here, we hypothesize that shear stress upregulates the CXCR7/ERK pathways, which restore the EPCs function in CAD patients. METHODS: The human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were collected from healthy adults and CAD patients and then used for EPCs cultivation. The Lv-siRNA for human CXCR7 was transfected into induced EPCs isolated from the CAD patients. Meanwhile, the EPCs from CAD patients were subjected to shear stress generated by a biomimetic device. Next, the cell viability, migration, tube formation, and apoptosis were detected by CCK-8, Transwell assay, Matrigel, and flow cytometry, respectively. Also, the CXCR7/ERK pathways in human EPCs were analyzed by Western blotting and qRT-PCR. RESULT: Compared to the EPCs collected from normal adults, the CAD patient-derived EPCs showed reduced in vitro vasculogenic capacity. Also, the level of CXCR7 in CAD patient-derived EPCs was significantly reduced compared to the EPCs of healthy subjects. Meanwhile, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which represents a CXCR7 downstream signaling pathway, had decreased phosphorylation level. The shear stress treatment augmented the CXCR7 expression and also elevated ERK phosphorylation, which is comparable to the up-regulation of CAD patient-derived EPCs function. Further, the small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated CXCR7 knockdown diminished the enhanced migration, adhesion, and tube formation capacity of shear stress treated CAD patient-derived EPCs. CONCLUSION: Up-regulation of the CXCR7/ERK pathways by shear stress can be a promising new target in enhancing the vasculogenic ability of CAD patient-derived EPCs.","output":"Shear stress improves the endothelial progenitor cell function via the CXCR7/ERK pathway axis in the coronary artery disease cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This editorial summarizes the content of the current themed issue of J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods derived from the 2020 Annual Safety Pharmacology Society (SPS) meeting that was held virtually September 14-17, 2020 due to the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic.

Three nasopharyngeal swabs in the 96 hours following hospital admission were negative, despite a CT thorax suggestive for an early stage of infection. COVID-infection was finally confirmed in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, performed for exclusion of an alternative diagnosis in immunocompromised. In the BAL an increased cellularity with marked lymphocytosis of 35%, a reduced CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.1 and borderline neutrophilia of 3% were found. This finding might be due to the concomitant therapy with anti-CD20 antibodies, but the presence of lymphocytosis in the BAL despite peripheral lymphopenia with decreased CD4/CD8 T-cells ratio are described here for the first time in a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea), fever and initially headache were the predominant symptoms. The respiratory symptoms were scarce (variable mild dyspnea mMRC1).

In a high-throughput screening campaign, we identified an acetic acid benzodiazepine (BDAA) compound which potently inhibits yellow fever virus (YFV). Interestingly, while treatment of YFV-infected cultures with 2 M BDAA reduced the virion production by greater than 2 logs, the compound was not active against 21 other viruses from 14 different viral families. Selection and genetic analysis of drug-resistant viruses revealed that replacement of the proline at amino acid 219 (P219) of the nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B) with serine, threonine, or alanine conferred YFV with resistance to BDAA without apparent loss of replication fitness in cultured mammalian cells. However, replacement of P219 with glycine conferred BDAA resistance with significant loss of replication ability. Bioinformatics analysis predicts that the P219 amino acid is localized at the endoplasmic reticulum lumen side of the fifth putative transmembrane domain of NS4B, and the mutation may render the viral protein incapable of interacting with BDAA. Our studies thus revealed an important role and the structural basis for the NS4B protein in supporting YFV replication. Moreover, in YFV-infected hamsters, oral administration of BDAA protected 90% of the animals from death, significantly reduced viral load by greater than 2 logs, and attenuated virus infection-induced liver injury and body weight loss. The encouraging preclinical results thus warrant further development of BDAA or its derivatives as antiviral agents to treat yellow fever. IMPORTANCE Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease which threatens approximately 1 billion people living in tropical areas of Africa and Latin America. Although a highly effective yellow fever vaccine has been available for more than 7 decades, the low vaccination rate fails to prevent outbreaks in at-risk regions. It has been estimated that up to 1.7 million YFV infections occur in Africa each year, resulting in 29,000 to 60,000 deaths. Thus far, there is no specific antiviral treatment for yellow fever. To cope with this medical challenge, we identified a benzodiazepine compound that selectively inhibits YFV by targeting the viral NS4B protein. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating in vivo safety and antiviral efficacy of a YFV NS4B inhibitor in an animal model. We have thus reached a critical milestone toward the development of specific antiviral therapeutics for clinical management of yellow fever.","output":"A Novel Benzodiazepine Compound Inhibits Yellow Fever Virus Infection by Specifically Targeting NS4B Protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 have produced high pathogenicity and mortality rates in human populations.

The clinical features of TTS, including initial symptoms, cardiac biomarkers, and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, are similar to those of acute coronary syndrome, with the exception that TTS patients typically have no obstructive coronary artery disease. TTS primarily affects elderly women, and emotional or physical stress is a common cause of the disease. Exaggerated sympathetic stimulation associated with dysfunction of the limbic system has also been reported to be related to TTS occurrence. Cancer also induces emotional and physical stress. Therefore, optimization of TTS care should involve cardiac, neurological, psychiatric, and oncological approaches. The first step in optimizing TTS care is to diagnose it by cardiac means. Multimodality imaging, including ECG, echocardiogram, angiography, ventriculography, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, is indispensable for diagnosis, therapy management, and the evaluation of prognosis in the acute and chronic phases of TTS. The current cardiac approach during the acute phase is primarily supportive, with the goal of preventing life-threatening complications. As central nervous system diseases frequently trigger TTS, a neurological approach is also required. Appropriate psychiatric medication may reduce the risk of TTS recurrence, as not only psychiatric disorders themselves but also psychiatric medications can be the trigger for TTS.

The LIGRADIS trial aims to provide evidence either to support or refute the systematic use of LS in euthyroid patients undergoing thyroidectomy for GD. METHODS: A multicenter randomized controlled trial will be performed. Patients 18 years of age, diagnosed with GD, treated with antithyroid drugs, euthyroid and proposed for total thyroidectomy will be eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria will be prior thyroid or parathyroid surgery, hyperparathyroidism that requires associated parathyroidectomy, thyroid cancer that requires adding a lymph node dissection, iodine allergy, consumption of lithium or amiodarone, medically unfit patients (ASA-IV), breastfeeding women, preoperative vocal cord palsy and planned endoscopic, video-assisted or remote access surgery. Between January 2020 and January 2022, 270 patients will be randomized for either receiving or not preoperative preparation with LS. Researchers will be blinded to treatment assignment. The primary outcome will be the rate of postoperative complications: hypoparathyroidism, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hematoma, surgical site infection or death. Secondary outcomes will be intraoperative events (Thyroidectomy Difficulty Scale score, blood loss, recurrent laryngeal nerve neuromonitoring signal loss), operative time, postoperative length of stay, hospital readmissions, permanent complications and adverse events associated to LS. CONCLUSIONS: There is no conclusive evidence supporting the benefits of preoperative treatment with LS in this setting.

Interplay between susceptible genetic variations and CM contributes to the occurrence of depression. This review aims to systematically synthesize the relationships between genetic variations and depression among those exposed to CM. Methods Electronic databases and gray literature to March 31st, 2020 were searched for literature on the topic of depression and CM limited to English-language. Data extraction and quality assessment of key study characteristics were conducted. Qualitative approaches were used to synthesize the findings. Results The initial search resulted in 9185 articles. A total of 29 articles that met the eligibility criteria were included in this review. High heterogeneity was identified regarding the study sample ages, candidate genes and SNPs, the categorization of CM and depression. The findings of this review include several frequently studied genes (5-HTTLPR, CRHR1, BDNF, CREB1, FKBP5, IL1B, NTRK2, and OXTR). Both consistent and inconsistent findings were identified. Overall, the interplay of CM with CREB1-rs2253206 significantly increased the risk of depression. In contrast, CRHR1-TCA haplotype (rs7209436, rs4792887, rs110402), CRHR1-rs17689882, and CRHR1-rs110402 showed protective effects on depression and depressive symptoms among individuals with a history of maltreatment. Limitations Due to clinical and methodological diversity of the studies a qualitative approach was used. Conclusion This review firstly provides a comprehensive overview of the interplay between CM and genetic variations in adult depression.

During the pandemic, treatment delay is being recommended in a nonquantitative, nonobjective, and nonpersonalized manner, and this approach may be associated with suboptimal outcomes. Quantitative integration of cancer mortality estimates and data on the consequences of treatment delay is needed to aid treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes. Objective: To obtain quantitative integration of cancer-specific and COVID-19-specific mortality estimates that can be used to make optimal decisions for individual patients and optimize resource allocation. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this decision analytical model, age-specific and stage-specific estimates of overall survival pre-COVID-19 were adjusted by the probability of COVID-19 (individualized by county, treatment-specific variables, hospital exposure frequency, and COVID-19 infectivity estimates), COVID-19 mortality (individualized by age-specific, comorbidity-specific, and treatment-specific variables), and delay of cancer treatment (impact and duration). These model estimates were integrated into a web application (OncCOVID) to calculate estimates of the cumulative overall survival and restricted mean survival time of patients who received immediate vs delayed cancer treatment. Using currently available information about COVID-19, a susceptible-infected-recovered model that accounted for the increased risk among patients at health care treatment centers was developed. This model integrated the data on cancer mortality and the consequences of treatment delay to aid treatment decisions. Age-specific and cancer stage-specific estimates of overall survival pre-COVID-19 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database for 691 854 individuals with 25 cancer types who received cancer diagnoses in 2005 to 2006. Data from 5a?436a?896 individuals in the National Cancer Database were used to estimate the independent impact of treatment delay by cancer type and stage. In addition, data from 275 patients in a nested case-control study were used to estimate the COVID-19 mortality rate by age group and number of comorbidities. Data were analyzed from March 17 to May 21, 2020. Exposures: COVID-19 and cancer. Main Outcomes and Measures: Estimates of restricted mean survival time after the receipt of immediate vs delayed cancer treatment. Results: At the time of the study, the OncCOVID web application allowed for the selection of up to 47 individualized variables to assess net survival for an individual patient with cancer. Substantial heterogeneity was found regarding the association between delayed cancer treatment and net survival among patients with a given cancer type and stage, and these 2 variables were insufficient to discriminate the net impact of immediate vs delayed treatment. Individualized overall survival estimates were associated with patient age, number of comorbidities, treatment received, and specific local community estimates of COVID-19 risk. Conclusions and Relevance: This decision analytical modeling study found that the OncCOVID web-based application can quantitatively aid in the resource allocation of individualized treatment for patients with cancer during the COVID-19 global pandemic.","output":"Integrated Survival Estimates for Cancer Treatment Delay Among Adults With Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) is one of the most important of the known viral respiratory and reproductive pathogens of both young and adult cattle.

We conducted a clinical study of dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells, a kind of mesenchymal stem cells, by applying cell transplantation therapy to induce angiogenesis in patients with severe ischemic disease. This study aimed to analyze the effect of molecules that regulate angiogenesis in vitro and clarify their molecular mechanisms for therapeutic purposes. Normal human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured in the presence of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Recombinant human angiopoietin-1-producing cells, conditioned media, mouse DFAT cells, and antioxidant polyphenols were added to this system at various concentrations. After 11 days, the cultures were immunostained with CD31 (PECAM-1), and microscopic images were subjected to analysis (area, length, joint, and path) by using software to quantitatively analyze blood vessel formation. The expression of angiogenic markers and COX pathway genes were analyzed by RT-PCR. As a result, the dose-dependent angiogenesis-promoting effect of rAng-1-producing cells, conditioned medium, or commercially available recombinant Ang-1 were observed. DFAT cells also promoted angiogenesis, whereas polyphenols inhibited angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. ABSTRACT: (1) Background: The control of angiogenesis is essential in disease treatment. We investigated angiogenesis-promoting or -suppressing factors and their molecular mechanisms. (2) Methods: Angiogenesis from HUVECs was quantitatively analyzed using the Angiogenesis Analysis Kit (Kurabo, Osaka, Japan). Human rAng-1-producing 107-35 CHO cells or mouse DFAT-D1 cells were co-cultured with HUVEC. Antioxidant polyphenols were added to the culture. Gene expression was analyzed by RT-PCR. (3) Results: The addition of rAng-1-producing cells, their culture supernatant, or commercially available rAng-1 showed a promoting effect on angiogenesis. The co-culture of DFAT-D1 cells promoted angiogenesis. Polyphenols showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on angiogenesis. Luteolin and quercetin showed remarkable anti-angiogenic effects. The expression of vWF, Flk1, and PECAM-1 was increased by adding rAng-1-producing cell culture supernatant. Polyphenols suppressed these genes. Apigenin and luteolin markedly suppressed -SMA and Flk1. Resveratrol and quercetin enhanced the expression of PPAR, and luteolin suppressed the expression of COX-1. The expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), an oxidative stress-related gene, was slightly increased by luteolin. These results suggest that polyphenols induce ROS reduction. (4) Conclusions: We showed the promoting effect of Ang-1 or DFAT and the suppressing effect of polyphenols on angiogenesis and studied their molecular mechanisms.

Participants 1338 participants were enrolled in a home oximetry programme at one of the four pilot sites. Participants were excluded if primary care data and oxygen saturations are rest at enrolment were not available. 908 participants were included in the analysis. Interventions Home oximetry monitoring was provided to participants with a known or suspected diagnosis of Covid-19. Participants were enrolled following attendance to accident and emergency departments, hospital admission or referral through primary care services. Results Of 908 patients enrolled into four different Covid-19 home oximetry programmes in England, 771 (84.9%) had oxygen saturations at rest of 95% or more, and 320 (35.2%) were under 65 years of age and without comorbidities. 52 (5.7%) presented to hospital and 28 (3.1%) died following enrolment, of which 14 (50%) had Covid-19 as a named cause of death. All-cause mortality was significantly higher in patients enrolled after admission to hospital (OR 8.70, 95% CI: 2.5-29.9), compared to those enrolled in primary care, Patients enrolled after hospital discharge (OR 0.31, 95% CI: 0.15-0.68) or emergency department presentation (OR 0.42, 95% CI: 0.20-0.89) were significantly less likely to present to hospital after enrolment than those enrolled in primary care. Conclusions This study find that home oximetry monitoring can be a safe pathway for Covid-19 patients; and indicates increases in risk to vulnerable groups and patients with oxygen saturations < 95% at enrolment, and in those enrolled on discharge from hospital.

Equine melanomas are among the most frequently diagnosed tumors affecting grey horses. The melanocytic tumors progress to malignancy in more than two-thirds of cases. Previous laboratory experiments and studies with horses utilizing the naturally occurring betulinic acid (BA) and its derivative NVX-207 showed promising results with respect to the topical (epicutaneous) treatment of equine melanoma. Therefore, the aim of this feasibility study was to gain first insights into the effect and safety of BA and NVX-207 in eighteen horses with early-stage melanocytic tumors after a 13-week-long topical application. The topical treatment was convenient and safe. Compared to a placebo, the data suggest a positive treatment effect from topical application of BA and NVX-207 on equine melanomas toward the end of the treatment period. However, the time period studied was too short to conclusively prove this. Further advancement of the investigational medicinal products studied herein could lead to an effective, topical and marketable novel drug which helps to relieve suffering and, consequently, improve the welfare of equine skin cancer patients. ABSTRACT: The naturally occurring betulinic acid (BA) and its derivative NVX-207 induce apoptosis in equine melanoma cells in vitro. After topical application, high concentrations of the substances can be reached in healthy equine skin. With the aim to investigate the effect and safety of topically applied BA and NVX-207 in horses with melanocytic tumors, the longitudinal, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study protocol included eighteen Lipizzaner mares with early-stage cutaneous melanoma assigned to three groups. Melanocytic lesions were topically treated either with a placebo, 1% BA or 1% NVX-207 twice a day for 91 days. Caliper measurements, clinical examinations and blood tests were performed to assess the effects and safety of the medication. The topical treatment was convenient and safe. The volumes of tumors treated with BA were significantly reduced over time as compared to tumors treated with the placebo from day 80 of the study. Although treatment with NVX-207 seemed to decrease tumor volume, these results did not reach statistical significance. The findings must be regarded as preliminary due to the limited group size and need to be replicated in a larger cohort with modified pharmaceutical test formulations. Accordingly, the treatment protocol cannot yet be recommended in its current form.","output":"Effects of Topically Applied Betulinic Acid and NVX-207 on Melanocytic Tumors in 18 Horses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Implant infection is one of the most severe complications within the field of orthopaedic surgery, associated with an enormous burden for the healthcare system. During the last decades, attempts have been made to lower the incidence of implant-related infections. In the case of cemented prostheses, the use of antibiotic-containing bone cement can be effective. However, in the case of non-cemented prostheses, osteosynthesis and spinal surgery, local antibacterial prophylaxis is not a standard procedure. For the development of implant coatings with antibacterial properties, there is a need for a reliable animal model to evaluate the preventive capacity of such coatings during a specific period of time. Existing animal models generally present a limited follow-up, with a limited number of outcome parameters and relatively large animal numbers in multiple groups. METHODS To represent an early post-operative implant infection, we established an acute tibial intramedullary nail infection model in rabbits by contamination of the tibial nail with 3.8  10? colony forming units of Staphylococcus aureus. Clinical, haematological and radiological parameters for infection were weekly assessed during a 6-week follow-up with post-mortem bacteriological and histological analyses. RESULTS S. aureus implant infection was confirmed by the above parameters. A saline control group did not develop osteomyelitis. By combining the clinical, haematological, radiological, bacteriological and histological data collected during the experimental follow-up, we were able to differentiate between the control and the infected condition and assess the severity of the infection at sequential timepoints in a parameter-dependent fashion.

SARS-CoV-2, can cause a pandemic infection with severe acute lung injury respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19, that can lead to patient death across all ages. The pathology associated with pandemic infection is linked to an over-response of immune cells, including virus-activated macrophages and mast cells (MCs). The local inflammatory response in the lung that occurs after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is due to a complex network of activated inflammatory innate immune cells and structural lung cells such as bronchial epithelial cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Bronchial epithelial cells and fibroblasts activated by SARS-CoV-2 can result in the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and induction of MC differentiation. In addition, endothelial cells which control leukocyte traffic through the expression of adhesion molecules are also able to amplify leukocyte activation by generating interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and CXC chemokines. In this pathologic environment, the activation of mast cells (MCs) causes the release of histamine, proteases, cytokines, chemokines and arachidonic acid compounds, such as prostaglandin D2 and leukotrienes, all of which are involved in the inflammatory network. Histamine is stored endogenously within the secretory granules of MCs and is released into the vessels after cell stimulation. Histamine is involved in the expression of chemokine IL-8 and cytokine IL-6, an effect that can be inhibited by histamine receptor antagonists. IL-1 is a pleiotropic cytokine that is mainly active in inflammation and immunity. Alveolar macrophages activated by SARS-CoV-2 through the TLR produce IL-1 which stimulates MCs to produce IL-6. IL-1 in combination with IL-6 leads to excessive inflammation which can be lethal. In an interesting study published several years ago (by E. Vannier et al., 1993), it was found that histamine as well as IL-1 are implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammatory reaction, after micorganism immune cell activation. IL-1 in combination with histamine can cause a strong increase of IL-1 levels and, consequently, a higher degree of inflammation. However, it has been reported that histamine alone has no effect on IL-1 production. Furthermore, histamine enhances IL-1-induced IL-6 gene expression and protein synthesis via H2 receptors in peripheral monocytes. Therefore, since MCs are large producers of histamine in inflammatory reactions, this vasoactive amine, by increasing the production of IL-1, can amplify the inflammatory process in the lung infected with SARS-CoV-2. Here, we have proposed for the first time an emerging role for histamine released by MCs which in combination with IL-1 can cause an increase in lung inflammation induced by the viral infection SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Mast cells activated by SARS-CoV-2 release histamine which increases IL-1 levels causing cytokine storm and inflammatory reaction in COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glucocorticoids are extensively used for a variety of conditions including those associated with dysregulation of immune and inflammatory responses as primary etiopathogenic factors Indeed, the pro-inflammatory cytokine storm of COVID-19 is the latest condition for which the use of a glucocorticoid has been advocated Recognition of serious adverse effects of glucocorticoids has led to research aimed at unraveling molecular basis by which they impact immune and inflammatory events with the ultimate objective of devising novel therapies to circumvent glucocorticoids-related adverse outcomes Consequently, GILZ protein was discovered and is increasingly recognized as the pivotal regulator of the effects of glucocorticoids on immune and inflammatory responses Importantly, the advent of GILZ-based options raises the prospect of their eventual therapeutic use for a variety of conditions accompanied with dysregulation of immune and inflammatory responses and associated target organ complications Thus, the objective of this minireview is to describe our current understanding of the role of GILZ in the cardiovascular system and the kidney along with outcome of GILZ-based interventions on associated disorders This information is also of relevance for emerging complications of COVID-19 Significance Statement GILZ was initially discovered as the pivotal mediator of immune regulatory/suppressive effects of glucocorticoids Since the use of glucocorticoids is associated with serious adverse effects, GILZ-based formulations could offer therapeutic advantages Thus, this minireview will describe our current understanding of the role of GILZ in the kidney and the cardiovascular system which is of relevance and significance for pathologies affecting them including the multiorgan complications of COVID-19","output":"Role of GILZ in the Kidney and the Cardiovascular System: Relevance to Cardiorenal Complications of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Spitting is an occupational hazard of police work with increased risk due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Biosecurity measures and vaccination are the main methods for prevention and control of CSF since no specific drug is available for the effective treatment of CSF. Although a series of biosecurity and vaccination strategies have been developed to curb the outbreak events, it is still difficult to eliminate CSF in CSF-endemic and re-emerging areas. Thus, in addition to implementing enhanced biosecurity measures and exploring more effective CSF vaccines, other strategies are also needed for effectively controlling CSF. Currently, more and more research about anti-CSFV strategies was carried out by scientists, because of the great prospects and value of anti-CSFV strategies in the prevention and control of CSF. Additionally, studies on anti-CSFV strategies could be used as a reference for other viruses in the Flaviviridae family, such as hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, and Zika virus. In this review, we aim to summarize the research on anti-CSFV strategies.

Since it is a life-threatening virus, investigation of curative medications along with protective vaccines still maintains its importance. Drug repurposing is a reasonable and immediate approach to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection by identifying inhibitory molecules from marketed drugs. PL protease (PLpro) is one of the essential enzymes for the progression of SARS-CoV-2 replication and life cycle. Objective: We aimed to investigate the potential of 4 HCV protease inhibitors as probable repurposing drugs in Covid-19 treatment. Methods: In order to understand possible binding affinity of HCV protease inhibitors, Boceprevir, Grazoprevir, Simeprevir, and Telaprevir, against PLpro, we performed docking analysis in silico. Docking study was accomplished using AutoDock 4.2 Software. Potential druggable pockets on PLpro were predicted by DoGSiteScorer tool in order to explore any overlapping with binding regions and these pockets. Results: This analysis demonstrated Boceprevir, Grazoprevir, Simeprevir and Telaprevir interacted by PLpro with binding energies (kcal/mol) of-4.97, -4.24, -6.98, -1.08, respectively. Asn109, one of the interacted residues with both Boceprevir and Simeprevir, is a neighbouring residue to catalytic Cys111. Additionally, Telaprevir notably interacted with catalytic His272 in the active site. Conclusion: Present study explains the binding efficiency and repurposing potential of certain HCV protease inhibitors against to SARS-CoV-2 PLpro enzyme.

The diagnosis of PJI is very difficult, especially in the early postoperative period. The value of the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is useful for diagnosing infectious diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate the accuracy of the NLR for the diagnosis of early PJI after total knee or hip arthroplasty. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated consecutive primary total knee or hip arthroplasty and identified the patients who readmitted within the first 90 days postoperatively between January 2011 and October 2018.There were 20 cases diagnosed early PJI and 101 uninfected cases on the basis of the modified Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria. The serum parameters including C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), white blood-cell (WBC) count, NLR and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were compared between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated to estimate the optimal cutoff values for each parameter. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for each parameter were calculated. RESULTS The CRP, ESR, WBC, NLR and IL-6 values were all significally higher in the infected group than the uninfected group. The median of CRP was 66.6 mg/l in the infected group and 8.6 mg/l in the uninfected group (p < 0.001). The median of ESR was 34.8 mm/hr. in the infected group and 17.4 mm/hr. in the uninfected group (p < 0.001). In the infected group and uninfected group, the median of WBC was 8.2X109 /L and 6.1 X109 /L (p = 0.002), respectively; while the median of NLR was 5.2 and 2.1 (p < 0.001). The median of IL-6 was 46 pg/ml and 6.4 pg/ml (p < 0.001),respectively. The best parameter for the diagnosis of early PJI was IL-6 (AUC = 0.814) followed by the NLR (AUC =0.802), CRP (AUC =0.793), ESR (AUC =0.744) and WBC (AUC = 0.632). CONCLUSIONS This study is the first to show that NLR values are more accurate than CRP and may be considered as useful parameters for the diagnosis of early PJI because it is a cheap and convenient parameter to be calculated in daily practice without extra costs.","output":"Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio as a predictor for diagnosis of early Periprosthetic joint infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adenovirus often causes respiratory disease outbreaks in military training soldiers.

Investigations of recent outbreaks confirmed that contaminated feed plays a role in virus transmission. This risk makes it necessary to evaluate the survival of such viruses in various feed ingredients. The objective of our experiment was to characterize the inactivation of PEDV, PDCoV, and TGEV in various feed and ingredient matrices. To determine differences in virus survival, 5-g samples of complete feed, spray-dried porcine plasma, meat meal, meat and bone meal, blood meal, corn, soybean meal, and low, medium, and high oil dried distillers grains with solubles were weighed into separate scintillation vials. These samples were inoculated with 1 mL of PEDV, PDCoV, or TGEV and incubated at room temperature for up to 56 d. At each time point, surviving virus was eluted and the supernatant was inoculated into vero-81 cells for PEDV, or swine testicular cells for PDCoV and TGEV. Cells were observed daily for 10 d for cytopathic effects, and this information was used to calculate a median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID(50)) using the Karber method. Inactivation kinetics were determined using the Weibull model. A delta value was estimated from the model, indicating the time necessary to reduce virus concentration by 1 log. This delta value was then compared across ingredients using the mixed procedure of SAS, and correlations between ingredient proximate analysis data and delta values were determined. Results showed that soybean meal had the greatest delta value (7.50 d) for PEDV compared with other ingredients (P < 0.06). Likewise, PDCoV (42.04 d) and TGEV (42.00 d) delta values were highest in soybean meal (P < 0.001). There was a moderate positive correlation between moisture and the delta value for PDCoV (r = 0.49, P = 0.01) and TGEV (r = 0.41, P = 0.02). There was also a moderate negative correlation between lipid content and the delta value for TGEV (r = ?0.51, P = 0.01), suggesting that TGEV is less stable in ingredients with greater lipid content compared with ingredients with less lipid content. In conclusion, these results indicate that the first log reduction of PDCoV and TGEV takes the greatest amount of time in soybean meal and it appears to be the result of greater moisture content.","output":"0176 Environmental persistence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, porcine delta corona virus, and transmissible gastroenteritis in feed ingredients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study focuses on the role of human miRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 virus can act as an exogenous competing RNA, facilitating the over-expression of its endogenous targets. Transcriptomic analysis of human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells confirmed that the CSF1 gene, a known target of miR-1207-5p, is over-expressed following SARS-CoV-2 infection. CSF1 enhances macrophage recruitment and activation and its overexpression may contribute to the acute inflammatory response observed in severe COVID-19.

MethodsAn agent-based simulation model was adapted and used to project the number of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths under various vaccination start dates, rollout speeds, and prioritization schemes, including (A)no prioritization, (B)two-staged prioritization of elderly population, and (C)multi-staged prioritization of elderly and then high-risk population. The study period was February 18 th , 2020 CJune 1 st , 2021, and the state of Georgia was used as a case study. ResultsThe relative effectiveness of the prioritization schemes depends on the outcome considered, as well as the vaccination start date, prioritized subpopulations, and rollout speed. Having no prioritization results in the fewest infections and hospitalizations in most scenarios;however, it yields the highest number of deaths. Prioritizing the elderly and then high-risk individuals results in the fewest overall and high-risk deaths in most scenarios. ConclusionsHaving no vaccine prioritization, i.e., opening vaccination to every adult regardless of age, simplifies vaccine rollout and reduces the infection spread but results in a higher number of deaths, especially among the elderly and high-risk populations. Prioritizing the elderly, then high-risk patients, as opposed to prioritizing only the elderly provides benefit regarding severe outcomes;however, such assumed benefits need to be counterbalanced with challenges in communicating eligibility and criteria and in distributing vaccines effectively and equitably which could result in suboptimal vaccine uptake and coverage, including among people within subpopulations at disproportionate risk of illness, hospitalization and death, of particular concern during periods of high incidence, severe disease, and death.","output":"Impact of Prioritizing Elderly and High-risk Individuals During COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has required us to recognize a new normal and other additions to our general and clinical vocabulary.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Sixty-one COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive, subintensive, and low intensive care were prospectively enrolled according to the time of admission: group A (up to 8 days) (n = 18); group B (from 9 to 21 days) (n = 19), and group C ( > 21 days) (n = 24). T-TAS measurements were performed at enrolment and after 7 days. Median OST was similar among groups. AUC was lower in group A compared to B (p = 0.001) and C (p = 0.033). OT was longer in group A compared to B (p = 0.001) and C (p = 0.028). Platelet count (PC) was higher in group B compared to A (p = 0.024). The linear regression showed that OT and AUC were independent from PC in group A (OT: 0.149 [95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.326 to 0.624], p = 0.513 and AUC: 0.005 [95% CI: -0.008 to 0.017], p = 0,447).

Patients were divided into groups with negative (seven patients) and positive (14 patients) initial RT-PCR results. The imaging findings in both groups were recorded and compared. RESULTS. Twenty-one patients with symptoms (nine men, 12 women; age range, 26-90 years) were evaluated. Most of the COVID-19 lesions were located in multiple lobes (67%) in both lungs (72%) in our study. The main CT features were ground-glass opacity (95%) and consolidation (72%) with a subpleural distribution (100%). Otherwise, 33% of patients had other lesions around the bronchovascular bundle. The other CT features included air bronchogram (57%), vascular enlargement (67%), interlobular septal thickening (62%), and pleural effusions (19%). Compared with that in the group with positive initial RT-PCR results, CT of the group with negative initial RT-PCR results was less likely to show pulmonary consolidation (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION.

METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients admitted to seven New York City hospitals from March 8, 2020 to August 30, 2020. The primary outcome was mortality; secondary outcomes were ICU admission and intubation. We estimated the annual average fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and black carbon (BC) concentrations at patients' residential addresses. We employed double-robust Poisson regression to analyze associations between annual average PM2.5, NO2 and BC exposure and COVID-19 outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, hospital, insurance and time from onset of the pandemic. RESULTS Of the 6,542 patients, 41% were female and aged median 65 years (IQR 53, 77). Over 50% self-identified as a person of color [N=1,687 (26%) Hispanic, N=1,659 (25%) Black]. Air pollution exposures were generally low. Overall, 31% (N=2,044) of the cohort died, 19% (N=1,237) were admitted to the ICU and 16% (1,051) were intubated. In multivariable models, higher long-term exposure to PM2.5 was associated with increased risk of mortality (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02, 1.21 per 1g/m3 increase in PM2.5) and ICU admission (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00, 1.28 per 1g/m3 increase in PM2.5). In multivariable models, neither NO2 nor BC exposure was associated with COVID-19 mortality, ICU admission or intubation.

CONCLUSIONS: Estimated seroprevalence was low in most sites, indicating that most people in the U.S. have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 as of July 2020. The majority of infections are likely not reported. Decreases in seroprevalence may be related to changes in healthcare-seeking behavior, or evidence of waning of detectable anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody levels at the population level. Thus, seroprevalence estimates may underestimate the cumulative incidence of infection.","output":"Changes in SARS CoV-2 Seroprevalence Over Time in Ten Sites in the United States, March - August, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The wide spread availability and use of sophisticated high-speed telecommunication networks coupled with inexpensive and easily accessible computing capacity have catalyzed the creation of new tools and strategies for healthcare delivery. Such tools and strategies are of value to apheresis medicine (AM) practitioners if they improve delivery of patient care, enhance safety during a therapeutic apheresis (TA) intervention, facilitate care access, advance technical capabilities of apheresis devices, and/or elevate quality performance within TA programs. In the past several years, healthcare delivery systems' adoption of telecommunication technologies has been fostered by organizational financial and quality improvement objectives.

Evidence on cost-effectiveness, which can help inform use of limited resources, is scarce in this area and therefore the purpose of this systematic review is to critically appraise and consolidate the current evidence on economic evaluations of ABI rehabilitation interventions. Methods: Systematic review methodology will be applied to identify, select and extract data from published economic evaluation studies (trial-based, non-trial based, simulation-based, decision model and trial-based model economic evaluations) of ABI treatment interventions in adults. A systematic literature search will be conducted on the following electronic databases: EMBASE, Econlit, CINAHL, Medline, Econlit, the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database and PsyclNFO. This review will only include cost-effectiveness analysis studies (e.g., cost per life year gained), cost-benefit and cost minimisation analyses in which the designs were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCT studies, cost-utility analyses (e.g., cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained or cost per disability-adjusted life year averted), cohort studies, and modeling studies. Only studies that were published in English, associated with adults who have an ABI will be included. There will be no restrictions on perspective, sample size, country, follow-up duration or setting. The search strategy terms will include the following: acquired brain injury, brain*; cost*; or cost-benefit analysis*. Following data extraction, a narrative summary and tables will be used to summarize the characteristics and results of included studies.

The MultimorbiditY Collaborative Medication Review And Decision Making (MyComrade) intervention is an evidence-based, theoretically informed novel intervention which aims to support the conduct of medication reviews for patients with multimorbidity in primary care. Our aim in this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of a trial of the intervention with unique modifications accounting for contextual variations in two neighbouring health systems (Republic of Ireland (ROI) and Northern Ireland (NI)). METHODS: A pilot cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted, using a mixed-methods process evaluation to investigate the feasibility of a trial of the MyComrade intervention based on pre-defined progression criteria. A total of 16 practices will be recruited (eight in ROI; eight in NI), and four practices in each jurisdiction will be randomly allocated to intervention or control. Twenty people living with multimorbidity and prescribed  10 repeat medications will be recruited from each practice prior to practice randomisation. In intervention practices, the MyComrade intervention will be delivered by pairs of general practitioners (GPs) in ROI, and a GP and practice-based pharmacist (PBP) in NI. The GPs/GP and PBP will schedule the time to review the medications together using a checklist. Usual care will proceed in practices in the control arm. Data will be collected via electronic health records and postal questionnaires at recruitment and 4 and 8 months after randomisation. Qualitative interviews to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and explore experiences related to multimorbidity management will be conducted with a purposive sample of GPs, PBPs, practice administration staff and patients in intervention and control practices. The feasibility of conducting a health economic evaluation as part of a future definitive trial will be assessed.

Virological and metabolic analyses were performed on (minimally invasive) collected oral swabs, rectal swabs, and nasal washes. Fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were only found in the nasal wash samples in four of the six ferrets, and in the samples collected 3 to 9 days post-infection (referred to as viral shedding). Central carbon metabolism metabolites were analyzed during viral shedding and post-shedding periods using a dynamic MRM (dMRM) database and method. Subsequent untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics of the same samples were performed using an LC-QToF-MS methodology, building upon the identified differentiated central carbon metabolism metabolites. Multivariate analysis of the acquired data identified 29 significant metabolites and three lipids that were subjected to pathway enrichment and impact analysis. The presence of viral shedding coincided with the challenge dose administered and significant changes in the citric acid cycle, purine metabolism, and pentose phosphate pathways, amongst others, in the host nasal wash samples. An elevated immune response in the host was also observed between the two isolates studied. These results support other reported metabolomic-based findings found in clinical observational studies and indicate the utility of metabolomics applied to ferrets for further COVID-19 research that advances early diagnosis of asymptomatic and mild clinical COVID-19 infections, in addition to assessing the effectiveness of new or re-purposed drug therapies.","output":"Metabolic Profiling from an Asymptomatic Ferret Model of SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Information on the clinical staging of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still limited.

In this retrospective study, 108 non-severe patients with COVID-19 were grouped according to the duration from symptoms onset to hospital admission: &#8804; 1 week, > 1 to 2 weeks, > 2 to 3 weeks, > 3 to 5 weeks, respectively. The dynamic changes of clinical signs were profiled across the four groups. A clinical staging proposal of the disease course over time was proposed from the perspective of the interaction between the virus and host. The prodromal phase, characterized by pneumonia, significant lymphopenia, and slightly elevated inflammatory markers, occurred in the first week after symptoms onset. In the second week, all the hematological and inflammatory markers were at the peak or bottom. Meanwhile, progressive pneumonia as well as the secondary damage of other organs (e.g. cardiac damage, coagulopathy, etc.) was significant during this period, making the disease progress into the apparent manifestation phase. In the third week, the improvement of the majority of clinical signs accompanied by a relatively high degree of inflammatory response defined the remission phase. After 3 weeks, patients were in the convalescent phase, in which all the indicators were maintained at a relatively normal level. We concluded that the disease course over time in non-severe patients with COVID-19 could be divided into four phases: the prodromal phase (in the first week), the apparent manifestation phase (in the second week), the remission phase (in the third week), and the convalescent phase (after 3 weeks), respectively.

Nurses have been facing a tremendous amount of fear and anxiety during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. General self-efficacy is considered one of the most influential factors that can modify the impact of anxiety on nurses' mental health. In this study, we aimed to determine the predictors of self-efficacy and anxiety among nurses during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey involving 368 nurses working in a tertiary care hospital. The General Self-Efficacy scale (GSE) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) were used for assessing self-efficacy and anxiety. The chi-square test followed by bivariate and multivariable regression analyses was performed to identify the determinants of self-efficacy and anxiety. Results The mean age of the nurses was 28.91 years (SD=3.68), with a mean working experience in the nursing field of 5.32 years (SD=2.48). The mean self-efficacy and anxiety scores were 32.19 (SD=4.53) and 3.82 (SD=2.87), respectively. Mullivariable analysis showed that higher age (&gt;30 years, p=.(X)3), professional education acquired through a diploma course instead of a graduate degree (p&lt;.001), and lack of training on handling COVID-19 patients (p=.003) were significant determinants of higher anxiety among nurses. Similarly, higher economic status (p=.001), sufficient COVID-19 training (p=.049), having family members tested positive for COVID-19 (p=.012), professional experience (&lt;= 5 years, p&lt;0.001), and quarantine period (s14 days, p=.002) were revealed to be independent determinants of a higher sense of self-efficacy among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion Receiving adequate levels of training on COVID-19 plays a vital role in improving self-efficacy and reducing anxiety among nurses during the ongoing pandemic. Managing anxiety, increasing self-efficacy, and ensuring more exposure to COVID-19-related training may improve nurses' mental health and prepare them for fighting pandemics in a much better and more efficient manner.","output":"Promoting Mental Health of Nurses During the Coronavirus Pandemic: Will the Rapid Deployment of Nurses' Training Programs During COVID-19 Improve Self-Efficacy and Reduce Anxiety?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patient Blood Management (PBM) programs have proven to be successful in reducing overuse and improving patient safety, clinical outcomes and efficiency.

A regional investigation recommended the use of a securing safety strap. The authors evaluate the value of the strap through the experiences of the radiation therapists' who use it. A secondary aim is to explore the potential for using a securing safety strap with UK therapeutic radiographers. METHODS A two-stage design was guided by an evidence-based practice framework. Stage one used a questionnaire to capture treating radiation therapists' experiences and opinions of the strap at a single cancer centre. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively and free-text data via a content analysis. Stage two used semistructured interviews with thematic analysis to explore views of three UK therapeutic radiographers. RESULTS Twenty-five of approximately 130 eligible staff responded to the Canadian questionnaire. Of the respondents, 24% (n = 6) 'strongly disagreed', 28% (n = 7) 'agreed' and 48% (n = 12) 'neither agreed nor disagreed' that they would recommend the strap to other departments. Most of the respondents think strap use should be at the staffs' discretion, with patients with dementia/cognitive impairment ranked as the group benefiting most. Ninety-two percent (n = 23) of respondents confirmed that patients sometimes refuse the strap. Themes arising from stage two interviews are as follows: patient benefit (use for select patients only); patient safety versus control (restraint); and practical implementation issues. CONCLUSION The policy of universal use of the strap should be reviewed. Those who use it are equivocal about its value and feel it should be reserved for select patients at the treating professional's discretion. Full evaluation of the effectiveness and acceptability of the device for different patients may promote both staff enthusiasm towards the device and evidence-based practice.

Recently, cytokine storm by the host immune system has been linked with high viral load, loss of lung function, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure, and subsequent fatal outcome. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify potential FDA approved drugs that can be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment using an in-silico analysis. METHODS: In this study, virtual screening of selected FDA approved drugs was performed by targeting the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 and the key molecules involved in the 'Cytokine storm' in COVID-19 patients. Based on our preliminary screening supported by extensive literature search, we selected FDA approved drugs to target the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and the key players of cytokine storm, TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and IL-1?. These compounds were examined based on systematic docking studies and further validated using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanic/generalized/Born/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/G/P/BSA) free energy calculations. RESULTS: Based on the findings, Rifampicin and Letermovir appeared as the most promising drug showing a very good binding affinity with the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and IL-1?. However, it is pertinent to mention here that our findings need further validation by in vitro analysis and clinical trials.

Thus, the prevalence and clinical importance of virus infections and the need for antiviral drugs differ from place to place and from time to time. National and World Health Statistics of notifications of disease give some index of the incidence of infections but not all virus infections are notifiable. Such statistics can be misleading also through failures to notify from sloth on the part of the physician or, in the absence of pathognomonic symptoms or signs, from errors in diagnosis. Any assessment of the need for new antiviral drugs should consider the availability, safety, effectiveness and cost of alternative measures, including prevention of spread of infection by control of vectors, immunization by use of viral vaccines, or treatment with existing antiviral drugs. Early start of treatment of acute virus infections with existing drugs gives the best results and, where the clinical diagnosis is uncertain, accurate rapid virus diagnosis is of paramount importance. Many virus infections are asymptomatic or of trivial importance and without sequelae.

Five themes have been observed in the interviews: psychological concerns of HCPs while treating COVID-19 patients;feelings towards COVID-19 patients;confidence in government, administration and self-reflection;challenges as female HCPs and coping strategies;and finally, future concerns and recommendations. Many of these themes have also been linked with cultural issues, making the results specific for Pakistan. Conclusions: : During the COVID-19 pandemic, female front-line HCPs have faced immense psychosocial pressure, starting from unsupportive family norms to unwelcoming working environment and insensitive hospital administration. Moreover, rumours among general public, lack of proper training, missing incentives and improper system surveillance had increased the anxiety and stress among HCPs. Hence, legislators are advised to take appropriate actions countrywide in order to improve the still on-going challenges and to support female HCPs in their working environment.","output":"Psychosocial Challenges Faced by Female Health Care Professionals During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Lahore, Pakistan: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that originated in Chinese city of Wuhan has caused around 906,092 deaths and 28,040,853 confirmed cases worldwide (WHO, 11 September, 2020) In a life-threatening situation, where there is no specific and licensed anti-COVID-19 vaccine or medicine available;the repurposed drug might act as a silver bullet Currently, more than 211 vaccines, 80 antibodies, 31 antiviral drugs, 35 cell-based, 6 RNA-based and 131 other drugs are in clinical trials It is therefore utter need of the hour to develop an effective drug that can be used for the treatment of COVID-19 before a vaccine can be developed One of the best-characterized and attractive drug targets among coronaviruses is the main protease (3CLpro) Therefore, the current study focuses on the molecular docking analysis of TAT-peptide47C57 (GRKKRRQRRRP)-conjugated repurposed drugs (i e , lopinavir, ritonavir, favipiravir, and hydroxychloroquine) with SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro) to discover potential efficacy of TAT-peptide (TP) - conjugated repurposing drugs against SARS-CoV-2 The molecular docking results validated that TP-conjugated ritonavir, lopinavir, favipiravir, and hydroxychloroquine have superior and significantly enhanced interactions with the target SARS-CoV-2 main protease In-silico approach employed in this study suggests that the combination of the drug with TP is an excelling alternative to develop a novel drug for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients The development of TP based delivery of repurposing drugs might be an excellent approach to enhance the efficacy of the existing drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 The predictions from the results obtained provide invaluable information that can be utilized for the choice of candidate drugs for in vitro, in vivo and clinical trials The outcome from this work prove crucial for exploring and developing novel cost-effective and biocompatible TP conjugated anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic agents in immediate future","output":"TAT-peptide conjugated repurposing drug against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro): potential therapeutic intervention to combat COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tetanus remains common in many low- and middle-income countries, but as critical care services improve, mortality from tetanus is improving. Nevertheless, patients develop severe syndromes associated with autonomic nervous system disturbance (ANSD) and the requirement for mechanical ventilation (MV). Understanding factors associated with worse outcome in such settings is important to direct interventions. In this study, we investigate risk factors for disease severity and long-term physical outcome in adults with tetanus admitted to a Vietnamese intensive care unit. METHODS: Clinical and demographic variables were collected prospectively from 180 adults with tetanus. Physical function component scores (PCS), calculated from Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), were assessed in 79 patients at hospital discharge, 3 and 6 months post discharge. RESULTS: Age, temperature, heart rate, lower peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and shorter time from first symptom to admission were associated with MV (OR 1.03 [ 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00, 1.05], p = 0.04; OR 2.10 [95% CI 1.03, 4.60], p = 0.04; OR 1.04 [ 95% CI 1.01, 1.07], p = 0.02); OR 0.80 [95% CI 0.66, 0.94], p = 0.02 and OR 0.65 [95% CI 0.52, 0.79, p < 0.001, respectively). Heart rate, SpO(2) and time from first symptom to admission were associated with ANSD (OR 1.03 [95% CI 1.01, 1.06], p < 0.01; OR 0.95 [95% CI 0.9, 1.00], p = 0.04 and OR 0.64 [95% CI 0.48, 0.80], p < 0.01, respectively). Median [interquartile range] PCS at hospital discharge, 3 and 6 months were 32.37 [24.95C41.57, 53.0 [41.6C56.3] and 54.8 [51.6C57.3], respectively. Age, female sex, admission systolic blood pressure, admission SpO(2), MV, ANSD, midazolam requirement, hospital-acquired infection, pressure ulcer and duration of ICU and hospital stay were associated with reduced 0.25 quantile PCS at 6 months after hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: MV and ANSD may be suitable endpoints for future research. Risk factors for reduced physical function at 3 months and 6 months post discharge suggest that modifiable features during hospital management are important determinants of long-term outcome.

Containing the virus has proven difficult, in large part due to its high transmissibility during the pre-symptomatic incubation. The study's aim was to determine if changes in respiratory rate could serve as a leading indicator of SARS-CoV-2 infections. A total of 271 individuals (age = 37.3 {+/-} 9.5, 190 male, 81 female) who experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19 were included - 81 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 190 tested negative; these 271 individuals collectively contributed 2672 samples (days) of data (1856 healthy days, 231 while infected with COVID-19 and 585 while infected with something other than COVID-19). To train a novel algorithm, individuals were segmented as follows; (1) a training dataset of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 (n=57 people, 537 samples); (2) a validation dataset of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 (n=24 people, 320 samples) ; (3) a validation dataset of individuals who tested negative for COVID-19 (n=190 people, 1815 samples). All data was extracted from the WHOOP system, which uses data from a wrist-worn strap to produce validated estimates of respiratory rate and other physiological measures. Using the training dataset, a model was developed to estimate the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on changes in respiratory rate during night-time sleep. The model's ability to identify COVID-positive individuals not used in training and robustness against COVID-negative individuals with similar symptoms were examined for a critical six-day period spanning the onset of symptoms. The model identified 20% of COVID-19 positive individuals in the validation dataset in the two days prior to symptom onset, and 80% of COVID-19 positive cases by the third day of symptoms.","output":"Leveraging wearable technology to predict the risk of COVID-19 infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus discovered in December 2019 and is currently the cause of the global COVID-19 pandemic. A critical aspect of fighting this pandemic is to obtain accurate and timely test results so that patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 can be identified and isolated to reduce the spread of the virus. Research has shown that saliva is a promising candidate for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics because its collection is minimally invasive and can be reliably self-administered. However, little research has been conducted on saliva testing and SARS-CoV-2 self-sampling (SARS-CoV-2SS) in Sub-Saharan Africa. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to comparatively evaluate the clinical sensitivity and specificity of nasal and oral samples self-collected by individuals for SARS-CoV-2 testing against a reference method involving sample collection and testing by a health care professional. The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the usability of nasal self-sampling and saliva self-sampling as a sample collection method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing by using failure mode and error assessment. METHODS: Participants will be recruited from the general population by using various methods, Participants will be screened progressively as they present at the clinical trial sites as well as in primary health care catchment areas in the inner city of Johannesburg, South Africa. In the event that recruitment numbers are low, we will use a mobile van to recruit participants from outlying areas of Johannesburg. We aim to enroll 250 participants into this study in approximately 6 weeks. Two sample types-a self-administered nasal swab and a self-administered saliva sample-will be collected from each participant, and a health care professional will collect a third sample by using a nasopharyngeal swab (ie, the standard reference method). RESULTS: This protocol has been approved by the University of the Witwatersrand Human Research Ethics Committee on July 31, 2020 (Protocol number EzCov003). As of May 13, 2021, 120 participants have been enrolled into the study. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2SS may offer many benefits to individuals, by allowing for initial self-identification of symptoms and collection of samples without involving third parties and potential risk of infection provided the sample can be safely processed via a collection system. The results of this study will provide preliminary data on the acceptability, feasibility, and usability of SARS-CoV-2SS among the general population for its future implementation.

While there have been data about the impact of COVID-19 on adult asthma, much remains unknown about the impact of COVID-19 on childhood asthma. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included all pediatric patients aged 2 to 12 years who were admitted to Abha Maternity and Children Hospital for acute asthma exacerbation between June 1, 2020, and May 31, 2021, and underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Sixty children hospitalized with the diagnosis of asthma were included in the study. Out of these patients, 10 (16.7%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. The enrolled patients were between 2 and 12 years, with a median age of five years (interquartile range, 3.8), and 58% were males (35/60). Cough, shortness of breath, and hypoxia were the most common presenting symptoms and signs. Severe asthma was more prevalent among positive COVID-19 compared with negative COVID-19 patients (60 vs 20%; P= 0.016). In addition, chronic asthma for more than five years was more prevalent among positive COVID-19 than negative COVID-19 patients (60 vs 40%, P= 0.305). Fifty-five percent of the enrolled patients had eosinophilic asthma using a 300cells/L threshold. None of the children required invasive respiratory support (ventilation through an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy), but 12 patients (21.7%) required respiratory support via high-flow nasal cannula. The total days of hospitalization in either PICU or pediatric general ward did not differ between the two groups. All patients were discharged, and there were no reports of serious morbidity or mortality. CONCLUSION: Eosinophilic asthma was the most prevalent asthma phenotype in the study group. Furthermore, there was no difference in the presenting symptoms of an asthma flare-up, laboratory indicators, and hospitalization outcomes (critical care admission and hospital stay) between asthmatics with and without a COVID-19 diagnosis.","output":"Pediatric Asthma Exacerbation in Children with Suspected and Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): An Observational Study from Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Houshold waste is the residue generated daily by people as a result of consuming goods and services The qualitative and quantitative aspects depend on the lifestyle and standard of living of citizens Hence a change in habits, following an economic or health crisis, can influence the production of waste and its composition The objective of the present work is to assess the impact of lockdown on the generation of trash and on the habits related to the consumption of goods in two communes in Morocco More specifically, this study would investigate the behavior of citizens with regard to protective equipment against the coronavirus COVID-19 The results of the survey show that there is an influence of lockdown on the items purchased during this period, with an increase in the purchase of disinfectant products and a decrease in the consumption of meat and canned goods Thus, the results showed that the quantity of organic fractions had decreased in the domestic waste with the appearance of other fractions such as residues of cleaning products In addition, the survey conducted showed that 87% of respondents mix coronavirus protective equipment with household waste, which may contribute to the spread of the virus Concerning the quantitative aspect, the weighups showed that the monthly rate of increase of waste production between the months of February and March 2019 and the corresponding period in 2020 have decreased from +11 41% to +3 8% in the city of Khenifra (from 2,572 ton in Mars 2019 to 2,456 ton in the correspondent period in 2020) and from +4 73% to-1 23% in the center of Tighassaline (from 136 ton in Mars 2019 to 123 ton in the correspondent period in 2020)","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on the qualitative and quantitative aspect of household solid waste"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two recent articles both found that cardiovascular disease was the major comorbidity in patients with COVID-19.

As intermediate traits, protein biomarkers report on underlying disease severity and prognosis in NSTE-ACS. We hypothesized that integration of dense microRNA (miRNA) profiling with biomarker measurements would highlight potential regulatory pathways that underlie the relationships between prognostic biomarkers, miRNAs, and cardiovascular phenotypes. We performed miRNA sequencing using whole blood from 186 patients from the TRILOGY-ACS trial. Seven circulating prognostic biomarkers were measured: NH(2)-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, osteopontin (OPN), myeloperoxidase, growth differentiation factor 15, monocyte chemoattractant protein, and neopterin. We tested miRNAs for association with each biomarker with generalized linear models and controlled the false discovery rate at 0.05. Ten miRNAs, including known cardiac-related miRNAs 25-3p and 423-3p, were associated with NT-proBNP levels (min. P = 7.5  10(?4)) and 48 miRNAs, including cardiac-related miRNAs 378a-3p, 20b-5p and 320a, -b, and -d, were associated with OPN levels (min. P = 1.6  10(?6)). NT-proBNP and OPN were also associated with time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke in the sample.

Methods A total of 383 patients admitted to hospitals for CAP were enrolled from 46 medical centers in mainland China between January 2013 and December 2014. Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for viral detection and DNA-based quantitative loop-mediated isothermal amplification (qLAMP) assays for bacterial detection were implemented to all lower respiratory tract specimens obtained from the patients. Twenty-eight cases (28/383, 7.3%) revealed HRV-positive PCR results. Patients with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) HRV-positive PCR results (n=20) were further enrolled and divided into two groups depending on the status of bacterial co-infection (viral group, n=12; viral-Bacterial group, n=8). Demographic, clinical and microbiological data were reviewed and compared in detail. Results Cases with HRV-infection were remarkably correlated with respiratory failure (14/20) and most of them (13/14) received mechanical ventilation. Fever (17/20), productive cough (15/20) and dyspnea (6/20) were common symptoms while flu-like symptoms were rarely observed in the cohort. Streptococcus pneumoniae (3/8), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3/8) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (2/8) were most frequently identified bacterium in the viral-bacterial group. Compared with the viral group, higher incidence of septic shock (3/8 vs. 1/12, P=0.255), longer ICU length of stay (LOS) (10.0 vs. 6.5 days, P=0.686), longer hospital LOS (18.5 vs. 13.0 days, P=0.208) and higher 28-day mortality (2/8 vs. 2/12, P=1) were observed in the Viral-Bacterial group, although without statistically significant difference.

Evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on quality of life (QOL) and depression symptoms among patients recently diagnosed with lung cancer 2. Apply the results of these analyses to identify patients with newly diagnosed cancer at risk of worse QOL or psychological symptoms during a pandemic or other major crisis in order to allocate supportive care resources Importance Adults with advanced lung cancer commonly experience reduced quality of life (QOL) and psychological symptoms at diagnosis. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused universal distress, but whether it has worsened the experience of patients recently diagnosed with cancer is unclear. Objective(s) This study evaluates associations between the COVID-19 pandemic and QOL and depression among adults with newly diagnosed advanced lung cancer. Method(s) We analyzed baseline data from two randomized controlled trials of early palliative care for patients recently diagnosed with advanced lung cancer (n = 856) to compare QOL and depression among those who enrolled during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 to January 2021) relative to those enrolled prior to the pandemic (March 2018 to January 2019). We used analysis of covariance with the COVID-19 timeframe as the independent variable and QOL (using the Functional Assessment of Cancer TherapyCGeneral score) and depression (using the Patient Health QuestionnaireC9 score) as dependent variables, adjusting for age, gender, relationship status, performance status, lung cancer symptoms, and time since diagnosis. We also tested for an interaction between the COVID-19 timeframe and relationship status. IV. Results There was no difference in QOL (adjusted mean difference C1.78; p = 0.137) or depression (0.06; p = 0.889) between patients enrolled before COVID-19 relative to those enrolled during COVID-19 in adjusted analyses. Relationship status moderated the effect of the COVID-19 timeframe on QOL; unmarried patients enrolled during the pandemic experienced significantly worse QOL relative to unmarried patients enrolled pre-pandemic (adjusted mean difference: C5.25; p = 0.011). V. Conclusion(s) The COVID-19 pandemic did not further reduce QOL or increase depression overall for patients recently diagnosed with lung cancer, which suggests that QOL reflects other factors, such as symptoms, that do not vary with this external crisis. Reduced QOL among unmarried patients points to increased supportive care needs. VI. Impact These results emphasize the profound effect of a new diagnosis of cancer on QOL and highlight the need for psychosocial evaluation and supportive care for all patients.","output":"Quality of Life and Depression Symptoms in a Cross-Section of Patients with Advanced Lung Cancer Before and During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic (RP322)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic represents one of the greatest global health emergencies of the last few decades with indelible consequences for all societies throughout the world The cost in terms of human lives lost is devastating on account of the high contagiousness and mortality rate of the virus Millions of people have been infected, frequently requiring continuous assistance and monitoring Smart healthcare technologies and Artificial Intelligence algorithms constitute promising solutions useful not only for the monitoring of patient care but also in order to support the early diagnosis, prevention and evaluation of Covid-19 in a faster and more accurate way On the other hand, the necessity to realise reliable and precise smart healthcare solutions, able to acquire and process voice signals by means of appropriate Internet of Things devices in real-time, requires the identification of algorithms able to discriminate accurately between pathological and healthy subjects In this paper, we explore and compare the performance of the main machine learning techniques in terms of their ability to correctly detect Covid-19 disorders through voice analysis Several studies report, in fact, significant effects of this virus on voice production due to the considerable impairment of the respiratory apparatus Vocal folds oscillations that are more asynchronous, asymmetrical and restricted are observed during phonation in Covid-19 patients Voice sounds selected by the Coswara database, an available crowd-sourced database, have been e analysed and processed to evaluate the capacity of the main ML techniques to distinguish between healthy and pathological voices All the analyses have been evaluated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score and Receiver Operating Characteristic area These show the reliability of the Support Vector Machine algorithm to detect the Covid-19 infections, achieving an accuracy equal to about 97% CCBY","output":"Exploring the use of Artificial Intelligence techniques to detect the presence of Coronavirus Covid-19 through speech and voice analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the pandemic, several studies were carried out on the short-term effects of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in athletes. As some cases of young athletes with serious complications like myocarditis or thromboembolism and even sudden death were reported, strict recommendations for return to sport were published. However, we have less data about athletes who have already returned to high-intensity trainings after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Athletes underwent cardiology screening (personal history, physical examination, 12-lead resting ECG, laboratory tests with necroenzyme levels and echocardiography) 2 to 3 weeks after suffering a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In case of negative results, they were advised to start low intensity trainings and increase training intensity regularly until achieving maximal intensity a minimum of 3 weeks later. A second step of cardiology screening was also carried out after returning to maximal intensity trainings. The above mentioned screening protocol was repeated and was completed with vita maxima cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) on running treadmill. If the previous examinations indicated, 24h Holter ECG recording, 24h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or cardiac MR imaging were also carried out. Data are presented as meanSD. Two-step screening after SARS-CoV-2 infection was carried out in 111 athletes (male:74, age:22.47.4y, elite athlete:90%, training hours:14.85.8 h/w, ice hockey players:31.5%, water polo players:22.5%, wrestlers:18.9%, basketball players:18.0%). Second screenings were carried out 94.531.5 days after the first symptoms of the infection. A 5% of the athletes was still complaining of tiredness and decreased exercise capacity. Resting heart rate was 70.313.0 b.p.m., During CPET examinations, athletes achieved a maximal heart rate of 187.311.6 b.p.m., maximal relative aerobic capacity of 49.25.5 ml/kg/min, and maximal ventilation of 138.631.2 l/min. The athletes reached their anaerobic threshold at 87.86.3% of their maximal aerobic capacity, with a heart rate of 93.33.7% of their maximal values. Heart rate recovery was 29.99.2/min. During the CPET examinations, short supraventricular runs, repetititve ventricular premature beats + ventricular quadrigeminy and inferior ST depression were found in 1-1 cases. Slightly higher pulmonary pressure was measured on the echocardiography in 4 cases. Hypertension requiring drug treatment was found in 5.4% of the cases. Laboratory examinations revealed decreased vitamin D3 levels in 26 cases, decreased iron storage levels in 18 athletes. No SARS-CoV-2 infection related CMR changes were revealed in our athlete population. Three months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, most of the athletes examined had satisfactory fitness levels. However, some cases of decreased exercise capacity, decreased vitamin D3 or iron storage levels, arrhythmias, hypertension and elevated pulmonary pressure requiring further examinations, treatment or follow-up were revealed.","output":"Cardiopulmonary examinations of athletes returning to high-intensity sport activity following SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We hypothesized that human genes differ by their sensitivity to UV exposure. We used somatic mutations detected by genome-wide screens in melanoma and reported in the Catalog Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC). As a measure of UV sensitivity, we used the number of silent mutations generated by C>T transitions in pyrimidine dimers of a given transcript divided by the number of potential sites for this type of mutations in the transcript. We found that human genes varied by UV sensitivity by two orders of magnitude. We noted that the melanoma associated tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A was among the top five most UV-sensitive genes in the human genome. Melanoma driver genes have a higher UV-sensitivity compared to other genes in the human genome. The difference was more prominent for tumor suppressors compared to oncogene. The results of this study suggest that differential sensitivity of human transcripts to UV light may explain melanoma specificity of some driver genes. Practical significance of the study relates to the fact that differences in UV sensitivity among human genes need to be taken into consideration while predicting melanoma-associated genes by the number of somatic mutations detected in a given gene.

Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging viral infection without any approved treatment. Investigational therapies for COVID-19 may cause clinically important drug-drug interactions (DDIs). We aimed to study drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and their risk factors in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Aim: The aim of our study is to establish an effect on serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) after surgery in lung cancer patients. Methods:This was a prospective study. For the estimation of VEGF, 50 lung cancer patients were studied. Both preoperative and postoperative levels of VEGF were estimated for all subjects. Blood samples were obtained from all cases both preoperatively and postoperatively (four weeks after surgery). Blood samples of 100 age and sex matched healthy controls were collected from the Outpatient Departments of SKIMS to establish normal serum VEGF levels. Conclusion: Our findings show that serum VEGF levels are higher as the tumor stage progresses and tumor size increases, which explains the lower serum VEGF levels observed by us in the operable patient group.","output":"Impact of Surgery on the Hemangiogenic Profile, Especially VEGF Levels, in Lung Cancer Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article we aim to explore the still incipient first steps of the return of extractivism to Europe, examining the geopolitical context that led to a reemergence of metal mining in rural areas.

The present study has tried to identify the potential factors and correlates which affect loneliness vulnerability. METHODS: The data for this study were collected from three different areas of Mumbai (i.e., Dadar, Bandra, and Chembur).This study was conducted through a cross-sectional household survey of household heads in the five different housing typologies/ localities between January and June 2016.A total of 450 household data were collected using the quota sampling method. Loneliness was the main dependent variable. The bivariate analysis was used to see the percentage of loneliness among respondents. Bivariate analysis for categorical data was carried out using the chi-square ((2)) test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the correlates of loneliness among household heads. The probability of significance was set at 5%. RESULTS: It was found that around 7 percent of respondents often feel lonely, and 21 percent of respondents sometimes feel lonely in the last seven days preceding the survey date. Household heads with two or more chronic diseases had higher odds (OR = 4.87, CI = 1.52C15.57) of loneliness than household heads without any chronic disease. The odds of loneliness were almost 3 times higher (OR = 3.05; CI = 1.11C8.38) among females as compared to males. Household heads living alone (single) had higher odds (OR = 19.99; CI = 4.14C96.59) to suffer from loneliness than those living in a joint family. CONCLUSION: Finding reveals that level of loneliness symptomatology in urban dwellers may be attributed significantly by individual (i.e., morbidity status and sex of respondent), social (i.e., personal relation) and residing locality characteristics.

DESIGN: We analyzed data using the 2017-2019 cycles of the CDC Medical Monitoring Project, an annual, cross-sectional study designed to produce nationally representative estimates of characteristics among adults with diagnosed HIV. METHODS: Unmet need was defined as needing, but not receiving, 1 HIV ancillary care service. We estimated prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using predicted marginal means to examine associations between health care coverage type and unmet needs for HIV ancillary care services, adjusting for age. Associations were stratified by receipt of RWHAP assistance. RESULTS: Unmet needs for HIV ancillary care services were highest among uninsured persons (58.7%) and lowest among those with private insurance living 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL; 21.7%). Uninsured persons who received RWHAP assistance were less likely than those who did not receive RWHAP assistance to have unmet needs for HIV clinical support services (aPR: 0.21; 95% CI: 0.16-0.28) and other medical services (aPR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.59-0.96), but not subsistence services (aPR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.74-1.27).

METHODS: This population- and web-based survey was conducted from 2 March to 3 June 2020, in North America, Europe, and Japan. Adults with self-reported healthcare practitioner (HCP)-diagnosed PsO and/or PsA and dermatologists who spent > 50% of time treating patients and treated  20 patients with PsO, including plaque PsO, per month were included. Patient participants were recruited at random from online panels; dermatologists were recruited randomly from representative physician panels. RESULTS: Of 264,054 patient responses, 3806 who self-reported an HCP diagnosis of PsO and/or PsA were included in the final sample; 67% had PsO alone, 28% had PsO and PsA, and 5% had PsA alone. The estimated population prevalence of psoriatic disease was 7% (PsO only: 4%; PsO and PsA: 2%; PsA only: 1%). Most patients (78%) reported PsO-involved body surface area (BSA)  3 palms, and ~ 90% or more reported itching, redness, flaking, and scales. Many PsO patients without diagnosed PsA reported musculoskeletal symptoms suggestive of PsA (63%).

Furthermore, TRIM28 knockdown enhanced interferon- (IFN-)-induced ACE2 expression through a mechanism involving upregulating IFN- receptor 2 (IFNGR2) in both A549 and PAEpiCs. Importantly, the upregulated ACE2 induced by TRIM28 knockdown and co-culture of NK cells was partially reversed by dexamethasone in A549 cells but not PAEpiCs. Our study identified TRIM28 as a novel regulator of ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.","output":"TRIM28 regulates SARS-CoV-2 cell entry by targeting ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus, that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) threatens global health.

We performed fluorescent microscopy and found an enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 replication products double stranded RNA (dsRNA) within mitochondria. The entry process of dsRNA might be mediated by Tom20 as observed by reduced mitochondrial localization of SARS-CoV-2 dsRNA in Tom20 knockdown cells. Importantly, decreased mitochondrial localization of dsRNA, as well as mitochondrial membrane stabilizers mdivi-1 and cyclosporin A, inhibited viral load in cells. Next, we detected mitochondrial dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, including mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening and increased ROS release. In response to mitochondrial damage, we observed an increase in expression and mitochondrial accumulation of Pink1 and Parkin proteins, as well as Pink-1-mediated recruitment of P62 to mitochondria, suggesting initiated mitophagy for mitochondrial quality control and virus clearance. Nevertheless, we observed that mitophagy was inhibited and stayed in early stage with an unchanged Hsp60 expression post SARS-CoV-2 infection. This might be one of the anti-autophagy strategies of SARS-CoV-2 and we used co-immunoprecipitation to found that SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibited P62 and LC3 binding which plays a critical role in selective envelopment of substrates into autophagosomes.

METHODS Eighty-six breast reconstruction patients over a 7-month period answered an anonymous survey, which queried demographics, reconstruction type, internet usage, social media usage, expectations, and impact on decisions. Fisher's exact test was performed to evaluate the use of social media. RESULTS 95% of patients used the internet for breast reconstruction information. The information was easy to understand 70%, helpful 76%, and trustworthy 60%. The information influenced decisions regarding procedure 23%, surgeon 23%, and hospital 22%. Social media was used 71% of the time. 62% found it easy to understand, 57% helpful, and 48% trustworthy. The information influenced decisions regarding procedure 16%, surgeon 11%, and hospital 10%. 26% of women expected final breast reconstruction appearance to look better than their native pre-mastectomy breasts, 55% as good or similar, and 12% reported appearance as being unimportant. Women found social media information to be less helpful than internet information. There was no significant association between expectations and social media versus no social media usage.

Early methods of attenuation were hit-and-miss, now much improved by genetic engineering. However, even current methods operate on the principle of genetic harm, reducing the viruss ability to grow. Reduced viral growth has the undesired side-effect of reducing the host immune response below that of infection with wild-type. Might some methods of attenuation instead lead to an increased immune response? We use mathematical models of the dynamics of virus with innate and adaptive immunity to explore the tradeoff between attenuation of virus pathology and immunity.

For the development of the model, a roundabout situated in Gy?r (Hungary) was selected and field data on the roundabout geometric characteristics as well as traffic volumes were used. Simulations using Vissim were run for various scenarios based on varying input traffic volumes and market penetration rates of AVs to assess queue lengths. The highway capacity manual (HCM) roundabout model was used to estimate the capacity of the existing roundabout. Values of follow-up times and critical gaps were set to decreasing as the penetration rate of AVs increases. The results demonstrated that 20% and 40% AVs in the flow would increase leg capacities by about 10% and 20%, respectively.

In the most compromised cases, COVID-19 infection leads to death due to severe respiratory complications. COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the primary cause of death in these patients. In the present study, we show an ultrastructural analysis on the lungs of a patient affected by COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS Lung specimens obtained at autopsy from a 63-years old patient affected by COVID-19 were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde. Slices of 300 m thickness were dehydrated and dried by Critical Point Drying in CO2. Slices were covered with a conductive gold film approximately 30 nm thick and observed at a Zeiss Sigma 300 SEM FEG in the secondary electron (SE) and backscattered electron (BSE) modes. As case control a lung biopsy from a 60-year-old man was considered. RESULTS At low power in all COVID-19 lung specimens severe changes in the pulmonary architecture were found, due to the collapse of air spaces. Moreover, alveolar cavities were covered by large membranes. At high power, alveolar membranes showed a fibrillar structure, suggestive of a loose network of fibrin. It has been also found that intra-alveolar red blood cells were frequently present in the alveolar spaces, surrounded by a reticular fibrin network, suggestive for fibrin-hemorrhagic alveolitis. Alveolar changes were constantly associated with pathological features related to the pulmonary vessels. Vascular changes were prominent, including endothelial damage and thrombosis of large pulmonary vessels. Fibrinous microthrombi were frequently detected in the inter-alveolar septal capillaries. In addition, it has been frequently detected capillary proliferation in the alveolar septa with finding suggestive for intussusceptive neo-angiogenesis. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, our electron microscopy analysis showed that COVID-19-related lung disease is characterized by a substantial architectural distortion, with the interactions between alveolar and vascular changes. Intra-alveolar hyaline membranes are associated with macro- and micro-thrombotic angiopathy, ending with capillary proliferation. The new blood vessel formation originates from the septa and extends into the surrounding parenchyma.

However, major hepatectomies remain challenging. Laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery is being employed for an increasing variety of surgical sites and indications. PRESENTATION OF CASE Three patients underwent LESS hepatectomy. A 36-year-old woman had LLS for a 38-mm adenoma, an 85-year-old woman an atypical resection of segment VI for a 12-mm hepatocellular carcinoma and a 41-year-old woman an atypical right anterior resection for a 9cm symptomatic FNH. Procedures were performed transperitoneally with a single-port device, via a 20-mm or 30-mm incision. Operative times were 110min for LLS, 100min for the atypical segment VI resection and 120min for the atypical right anterior liver resection. Blood loss was less than 50ml in the first two patients and 150ml in the third. Postoperative courses were uneventful. The first two patients were discharged on postoperative day 3 and the third on postoperative day 1. DISCUSSION To date, some case reports and series of LESS liver surgery have been published. We performed the reported hepatectomies after a considerable experience in laparoscopic hepatic surgery and after applying the LESS approach to other procedures. Our hepatectomy technique was not modified by the use of the single-port and results were very encouraging.

Presenting symptoms are classically those of thyrotoxicosis but with associated tenderness in the thyroid. Treatment of acute symptoms is possible and the thyroid function will generally normalize with time. Subacute thyroiditis has rarely been reported after administration of viral vaccinations such as the seasonal flu vaccine. We present a case of subacute thyroiditis which presented after administration of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Case: Patient is a 42yo female with no past medical history. She received the first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine for COVID-19 on 12/22/20. Five days later, the patient complained of sore throat and palpitations. These symptoms progressed and she was evaluated in an urgent care on 12/31/20 where she was found to have tachycardia. Infectious work-up, including PCR for COVID-19, was negative and she was sent home. She took ibuprofen with some improvement of her symptoms. The following day she went to the ED; she was found to have a heart rate in the 130s with sinus tachycardia on EKG. Thyroid function testing was done which revealed TSH <0.01, fT4 4.58, fT3 11.8. Her TPO antibody was <28 and inflammatory markers were elevated including sed rate of 62. The patient was prescribed prednisone 40mg daily and propranolol 20mg as needed for symptoms. She reports rapid improvement of symptoms with prednisone. On 1/21/20, thyroid function showed TSH <0.01, fT4 down to 3.2, tT3 normal at 135. Thyroglobulin was elevated at 140.8 with negative thyroglobulin antibody, TRAb and TSI. Her inflammatory markers had decreased with sed rate of 26 and normal C-reactive protein. She had improved symptoms. Discussion: Cases of subacute thyroiditis are most commonly associated with upper respiratory viruses but cases have been reported with traditional inactivated viral vaccines or live-attenuated vaccines such as those for annual influenza. We present the case of a 42-year-old female who has presented with a classic case of subacute thyroiditis which occurred in the time frame after receiving the Pfizer mRNA vaccine for COVID-19. Research has been ongoing for decades regarding development of mRNA vaccines but the mRNA vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been the first to be widely distributed to the general population. Thyroiditis has not been reported as a common side effect but the cross recognition between the coronavirus spike protein targeted with the mRNA vaccine and healthy thyroid cell antigens exists as evidenced by this case.

Area-level racial bias has been associated with multiple adverse health outcomes, but its association with COVID-19 is yet unexplored. Combining county-level data from Project Implicit on implicit and explicit anti-Black bias among non-Hispanic Whites, Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, and The New York Times, we used adjusted linear regressions to estimate overall COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates through 01 July 2020, Black and White incidence rates through 28 May 2020, and Black-White incidence rate gaps on average area-level implicit and explicit racial bias. Across 2994 counties, the average COVID-19 mortality rate (standard deviation) was 1.7/10,000 people (3.3) and average cumulative COVID-19 incidence rate was 52.1/10,000 (77.2). Higher racial bias was associated with higher overall mortality rates (per 1 standard deviation higher implicit bias b = 0.65/10,000 (95% confidence interval: 0.39, 0.91); explicit bias b = 0.49/10,000 (0.27, 0.70)) and higher overall incidence (implicit bias b = 8.42/10,000 (4.64, 12.20); explicit bias b = 8.83/10,000 (5.32, 12.35)). In 957 counties with race-specific data, higher racial bias predicted higher White and Black incidence rates, and larger Black-White incidence rate gaps. Anti-Black bias among Whites predicts worse COVID-19 outcomes and greater inequities.

The research team applied a participatory action research approach to work with residents to design and implement the Seeding Plan, a contactless community gardening program. The authors carried out a study to compare the everyday conditions reflecting residents' mental health of the three subject groups during the pandemic: the participants of the Seeding Plan (Group A), the non-participants living in the same communities that had implemented the Seeding Plan (Group B), and the non-participants in other communities (Group C). According to the results, group A showed the best mental health among the three; Group B, positively influenced by seeding activities, was better than Group C. The interview results also confirmed that the community connections established through gardening activities have a significant impact on maintaining a positive social mentality under extraordinary circumstances. From this, the study concluded that gardening activities can improve people's mental health, effectively resist negative impacts, and it is a convenient tool with spreading influence on the entire community, so as to support the collective response to public health emergencies in a bottom-up direction by the community.","output":"Participatory Action Research on the Impact of Community Gardening in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Investigating the Seeding Plan in Shanghai, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tabular data formats (e.g. CSV and spreadsheets) combine ease of use, versatility and compatibility with information management systems.

Our aim was to systematically review and synthesize with a meta-analysis the available observational studies reporting the effect of diabetes in mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: Medline, Embase, Google Scholar, and medRxiv databases were reviewed. A random-effect model meta-analysis was used and I-square was utilized to assess the heterogeneity. In-hospital mortality was defined as the endpoint. Sensitivity, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses were performed. Results: 18,506 patients were included in this meta-analysis (3,713 diabetics and 14,793 non-diabetics). Patients with diabetes were associated with a higher risk of death compared to patients without diabetes (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.35, 1.96; I2 77.4%). The heterogeneity was high. A study level meta-regression analysis was performed for all the important covariates and no significant interactions were found between the covariates and the outcome of mortality. Conclusion: This meta-analysis shows that that the likelihood of death is 65% higher in diabetic hospitalized patients with COVID-19 compared to non-diabetics.

Few cases of prolonged positivity of viral tests and clinical recurrence of COVID-19 have been described. We report the case of a 78-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer who developed possible COVID-19 recurrence in a post-acute and rehabilitation unit. Case presentation: A 78-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer and hypertension developed COVID-19. After symptom improvement and RT-PCR negativation, she regained symptom (fever, fall) and lymphopenia on Day 26 and we note a turned positive RT-PCR even though she was tested positive for antibody against SARS-CoV-2. After the diagnosis of possible COVID-19 recurrence, she was transferred back to an acute COVID-19 unit and she then quickly clinically recovered. Conclusions: : This clinical case allows us to discuss the risk of recurrence and possible specific causes in older patients. Moreover, prolonged symptoms and lymphopenia could be associated to worse outcomes in older patients.

The same inputs are supposed to be measured by DREAMs equipment on Mars (except for the surface roughness length which can be estimated for Mars according the method of Hebrard \\\\cite{Hebrard}). Simulated and experimental values have shown a good agreement. The model was adapted to Martian conditions and applied to the data of Viking lander.

The I-MOVE hospital network measured 2017-18 seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against influenza A(H3N2) and B among hospitalised patients (&#8805;65 years) in Europe. METHODS: Following the same generic protocol for test-negative design, hospital teams in nine countries swabbed patients &#8805;65 years with recent onset (&#8804;7 days) severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), collecting information on demographics, vaccination status and underlying conditions. Cases were RT-PCR positive for influenza A(H3N2) or B; controls: negative for any influenza. \\"Vaccinated\\" patients had SARI onset >14 days after vaccination. We measured pooled IVE against influenza, adjusted for study site, age, sex, onset date and chronic conditions. RESULTS: We included 3483 patients: 376 influenza A(H3N2) and 928 B cases, and 2028 controls. Most (>99%) vaccinated patients received the B lineage-mismatched trivalent vaccine. IVE against influenza A(H3N2) was 24% (95% CI: 2 to 40); 35% (95% CI: 6 to 55) in 65- to 79-year-olds and 14% (95% CI: -22 to 39) in &#8805;80-year-olds. Against influenza B, IVE was 30% (95% CI: 16 to 41); 37% (95% CI: 19 to 51) in 65- to 79-year-olds and 19% (95% CI: -7 to 38) in &#8805;80-year-olds. CONCLUSIONS: IVE against influenza B was similar to A(H3N2) in hospitalised older adults, despite trivalent vaccine and circulating B lineage mismatch, suggesting some cross-protection. IVE was lower in those &#8805;80 than 65-79 years.

It is not yet clear whether this increased association of high blood pressure with COVID-19 and the increased risk of mortality are directly related to high blood pressure or other associated comorbidities, or to antihypertensive treatment.

In this terrible scenario, Italy was one of the most affected countries. ------------ Objective: The aim of this study is to look for significant correlations between COVID-19 cases and demographic, geographical, and environmental statistics of each Italian region from February 26 to August 12, 2020. Finally, we further investigated the link between SARS-CoV-2 spread and particulate matter 2.5 and 10 concentrations before the lockdown in Lombardy. ------------ Methods: All demographic data were taken from the AdminStat Italia website, while the geographic data from the Il Meteo website. The collection frequency was 1 week. Data on PM2.5 and PM10 average daily concentrations were collected from previously published articles. We used Pearson's coefficients to correlate quantities that followed a normal distribution, and Spearman's coefficient to correlate quantities that did not follow a normal distribution. To evaluate this, we used the kurtosis (k) and skewness (s) coefficients according to the following scheme: we considered data compatible with a normal distribution only when t_k=k(24/n)^(-1/2) [] 1.5 and t_s=s(6/n)^(-1/2) [] 1.5; here, the Pearson correlation index was deemed more reliable. When t_k in ]1.5,3],t_s [] 3 or t_k [] 3, t_s in ]1.5,3], we considered it appropriate to evaluate both correlations. Finally, when t_k,t_s > 3, we judged the Spearman correlation index more appropriate. When the linear correlations were significant, we interpolated the data linearly. We reported in round brackets () the week in which the correlation approached the threshold of statistical significance e.g. Abruzzo (4). The chosen p-value threshold was =.05. ------------ Results: We found significant strong correlations between COVID-19 cases and population density in 60.0% of regions, such as Calabria (5), Campania (1), Lazio (1), Liguria (2), Lombardy (4), Piedmont (2), Sardinia (3), Sicily (1), and Veneto (4) (R_best=.935, 95% CI: .830 -1.000,p_best=.046,95% CI:.006-.040). The average of the angular coefficients resulting from the linear interpolations of the pairs (COVID-19 cases, population number) is b=.0037 (95% CI .0009-.0065). We found a significant strong correlation between the angular coefficients b of the various regions and their latitude. This data shows the dependence of COVID-19 on geographical and/or climatic factors (R=.926,p=.001,r=.886,p=.003). in particular, we found a significant correlation with the historical averages (last 30 years) of the minimum temperatures of the Italian regions (R=-.849,p=.008,r=-.940,p=.005 for March, R=-.923,p=.001,r=-.872,p = .005 for February). We found a significant strong correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases until August 12 and the average daily concentrations of PM2.5 in Lombardy until February 29, 2020 (r=.76,p=.004). No significant correlation with PM10 was found in the same periods. Until February 26, 2020, we found both a correlation with PM2.5 (r=.63,p=.029) and PM10 (r=.72,p=.009). In the second week of March, the correlation with PM10 disappeared while that with PM2.5 continued to exist until nowadays. We found that 40 g/m^3 for PM2.5 and 50 g/m^3 for PM10 are plausible thresholds beyond which particulate pollution clearly favors the spread of SARS-CoV-2. ------------ Conclusion: Since SARS-CoV-2 is correlated with historical minimum temperatures and particulate matter 10 and 2.5, health authorities are urged to monitor pollution levels and to invest in precautions for the arrival of autumn. Furthermore, we suggest creating awareness campaigns for the recirculation of air in closed places and to avoid exposure to cold.","output":"Relations between demographic, geographic, and environmental statistics, and the spread of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A higher risk of thrombosis has been described as a prominent feature of COVID-19.

In particular, this assumption implies that the individuals most likely to spread the disease are also the most likely to receive it from others. Here, we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees (\\"risk\\" and \\"spread\\"), including their heterogeneity and the correlation between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random, and some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent superspreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and backward version of the classic \\"friendship paradox\\" -- forward links tend to lead to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals with high spread -- such that a combination of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future cascades of infection.","output":"The role of directionality, heterogeneity and correlations in epidemic risk and spread"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps across the world, healthcare departments must adapt to meet the challenges of service provision and staff/patient protection. Unlike elective surgery, acute care surgery (ACS) workloads cannot be artificially reduced providing a unique challenge for administrators to balance healthcare resources between the COVID-19 surge and regular patient admissions. METHODS: An enhanced ACS (eACS) model of care is described with the aim of limiting COVID-19 healthcare worker and patient cross-infection as well as providing 24/7 management of emergency general surgical (GS) and trauma patients. The eACS service comprised 5 independent teams covering a rolling 1:5 24-hr call. Attempts to completely separate eACS teams and patients from the elective side were made. The service was compared to the existing ACS service in terms of clinical and efficiency outcomes. Finally, a survey of staff attitudes towards these changes, concerns regarding COVID-19 and psychological well-being was assessed. RESULTS: There were no staff/patient COVID-19 cross-infections. Compared to the ACS service, eACS patients had reduced overall length of stay (2-days), time spent in the Emergency Room (46 min) and time from surgery to discharge (2.4-hours). The eACS model of care saved financial resources and bed-days for the organisation. The changes were well received by team-members who also felt that their safety was prioritised. CONCLUSION: In healthcare systems not overwhelmed by COVID-19, an eACS model may assist in preserving psychological well-being for healthcare staff whilst providing 24/7 care for emergency GS and trauma patients.","output":"Development of an enhanced acute care surgery service in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter extends Hermeneutic Liberalism to the International Level.

However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms for controlling memory T cell responses remain incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of respiratory macrophage (M) in regulating CD4 T cell responses to recombinant adenovirus-based (rAd) vaccines. We demonstrated that rAd intranasal (i.n.) vaccination induced migration and accumulation of respiratory M and circulatory monocytes in the mediastinal lymph nodes and lung parenchyma. Under the influence of respiratory M CD4 T cells exhibited slow proliferation kinetics and an increased tendency of generating central memory, as opposed to effector memory, CD4 T cell responses in vitro and in vivo. Correspondingly, depletion of M using clodronate-containing liposome prior to i.n. immunization significantly enhanced CD4 T cell proliferation and increased the frequency of CD4 memory T cells in the airway lumen, demonstrating that M initially serve as a negative regulator in limiting generation of mucosal tissue-resident memory CD4 T cells. However, clodronate-containing liposome delivery following i.n. immunization markedly reduced the frequencies of memory CD4 T cells in the airway lumen and spleen, indicating that respiratory M and potentially circulating monocytes are critically required for maintaining long-term memory CD4 T cells.

The goals of this pilot study were to assess environmental contamination in different areas and at two time periods in the influenza season and to determine the feasibility of using surgical mask contamination to evaluate potential exposure to influenza virus. Bioaerosol samples were collected over 12 days (two 6-day sessions) at 12 locations within a student health center using portable two-stage bioaerosol samplers operating 8 hr each day. Surface samples were collected each morning and afternoon from common high-contact non-porous hard surfaces from rooms and locations where bioaerosol samplers were located. Surgical masks worn by participants while in contact with patients with influenza-like illness were collected. A questionnaire administered to each of the 12 participants at the end of each workday and another at the end of each workweek assessed influenza-like illness symptoms, estimated the number of influenza-like illness patient contacts, hand hygiene, and surgical mask usage. All samples were analyzed using qPCR. Over the 12 days of the study, three of the 127 (2.4%) bioaerosol samples, 2 of 483 (0.41%) surface samples, and 0 of 54 surgical masks were positive for influenza virus. For the duration of contact that occurred with an influenza patient on any of the 12 days, nurse practitioners and physicians reported contacts with influenza-like illness patients >60 min, medical assistants reported 15-44 min, and administrative staff reported <30 min. Given the limited number of bioaerosol and surface samples positive for influenza virus in the bioaerosol and surface samples, the absence of influenza virus on the surgical masks provides inconclusive evidence for the potential to use surgical masks to assess exposure to influenza viruses. Further studies are needed to determine feasibility of this approach in assessing healthcare personnel exposures.

Within a country, such differences provide the opportunity for strategic allocations of health care resources. OBJECTIVE We aim to provide a tool to estimate and visualize differences in the spread of the pandemic at the subnational level. Specifically, we focus on the case of Italy, a country that has been harshly hit by the virus. METHODS We model the number of SARS-CoV-2 reported cases and deaths as well as the number of hospital admissions at the Italian subnational level with Poisson regression. We employ parametric and nonparametric functional forms for the hazard function. In the parametric approach, model selection is performed using an automatic criterion based on the statistical significance of the estimated parameters and on goodness-of-fit assessment. In the nonparametric approach, we employ out-of-sample forecasting error minimization. RESULTS For each province and region, fitted models are plotted against observed data, demonstrating the appropriateness of the modeling approach. Moreover, estimated counts and rates of change for each outcome variable are plotted on maps of the country. This provides a direct visual assessment of the geographic distribution of risk areas as well as insights on the evolution of the pandemic over time.

Non-invasive thermal imaging can hypothetically detect changes in perfusion, inflammation and vascular injury. We sought to develop a new point-of-care, non-contact thermal imaging tool to detect COVID-19 by microvascular dysfunction, based on image processing algorithms and machine learning analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We captured thermal images of the back of 101 individuals, with (n=62) and without (n=39) COVID-19, using a portable thermal camera that connects directly to smartphones. We developed new image processing algorithms that automatically extract multiple texture and shape features of the thermal images (Figure 1A). We then evaluated the ability of our thermal features to detect COVID-19 and systemic changes of heat distribution associated with microvascular disease. We also assessed correlations between thermal imaging to conventional biomarkers and chest X-ray (CXR). RESULTS: Our novel image processing algorithms achieved up to 92% sensitivity in detecting COVID-19 with an area under the curve of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.93; p<0.01). Systemic alterations in blood flow associated with vascular disease were observed across the entire back. Thermal imaging scores were inversely correlated with clinical variables associated with COVID-19 disease progression, including blood oxygen saturation, C- reactive protein, and D-dimer. The thermal imaging findings were not correlated with the results of CXR. CONCLUSIONS: We show, for the first time, that a hand-held thermal imaging device can be used to detect COVID-19. Non-invasive thermal imaging could be used to screen for COVID-19 in out-of-hospital settings, especially in low-income regions with limited imaging resources. Moreover, thermal imaging might detect micro-angiopathies and endothelial dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 and could possibly improve risk stratification of infected individuals (Figure 1B).

Procedures were guided by a proctor either onsite or remotely through telemetry. One-way ANOVA or Chi-square was used to compare perioperative parameters and mixed model ANOVA was used to compare functional outcomes. RESULTS: Our data included 59 patients who underwent a proctored-based Aquablation of which 21 were telementor guided and 38 were onsite guided.

METHODS: In this study, lung and testis tissue was collected from autopsies of COVID-19 positive (n = 10) and negative men (n = 10) and was taken for stereology, immunocytochemistry, and RNA extraction. RESULTS: Evaluation of the lung tissue showed that the SARS-CoV-2 infection caused extensive damage to the lung tissue and also increases inflammation in testicular tissue and destruction of the testicular blood barrier. Autopsied testicular specimens of COVID-19 showed that COVID-19 infection significantly changes the spatial arrangement of testicular cells and notably decreased the number of Sertoli cells. Moreover, the immunohistochemistry results showed a significant reduction in the protein expression of occluding, claudin-11, and connexin-43 in the COVID-19 group.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Community ice hockey teams from Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Parents and coaches of ice hockey players (ages 11-17, all divisions of play). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants completed a questionnaire developed and validated to measure concussion knowledge, beliefs and concussion management behaviour (ie, coaches removing athletes from play; parents taking children with suspected concussions to physicians) consistent with the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA). The questionnaire examined specific HAPA constructs (ie, risk perception, outcome expectancies, action self-efficacy, intention, action planning, maintenance self-efficacy, recovery self-efficacy) relevant to concussion management behaviour. RESULTS: Participants included 786 parents (31.8% with coaching experience) and 10 non-parent coaches. Of the participants, 649 (82.6%) previously received concussion education. Based on a multivariable regression analysis adjusting for coaching experience, previous history of a child sustaining one or more concussions, first aid experience and cluster by team, exposure to concussion education was associated with a mean score difference of 1.36 (95% CI 0.68 to 2.03), p<0.0001, in the knowledge score.

We used Sialodacryoadenitis Virus (SDAV) in rats to model the extent to which immune protection afforded by prior natural infection via high risk (inoculation; direct contact) or low risk (fomite) exposure, or by vaccination, influenced viral shedding and transmission on re-exposure. On initial infection, we confirmed that amount, duration and consistency of viral shedding were correlated with exposure risk. Animals were reinfected after 3.7-5.5 months using the same exposure paradigm. Amount and duration of viral shedding were correlated with re-exposure type and serologic status. 59% of seropositive animals shed virus. Previously exposed seropositive reinfected animals were able to transmit virus to 25% of naive recipient rats after 24-hour exposure by direct contact. Rats vaccinated intranasally with a related virus (Parkers Rat Coronavirus) were able to transmit SDAV to only 4.7% of naive animals after a 7-day direct contact exposure, despite comparable viral shedding. Observed cycle threshold values associated with transmission in both groups ranged from 29-36 cycles, however observed shedding was not a prerequisite for transmission. Results indicate that low-level shedding in both naturally infected and vaccinated seropositive animals can propagate infection in susceptible individuals. Extrapolated to COVID-19, our results suggest that continued propagation of SARS-CoV-2 by seropositive previously infected or vaccinated individuals is possible.","output":"Viral shedding and transmission after natural infection and vaccination in an animal model of SARS-CoV-2 propagation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by pain, bleeding, cramping and altered gastrointestinal (GI) function. Changes in mucosal 5-HT (serotonin) signalling occur in animal models of colitis and in humans suffering from IBD. Melatonin is co-released with 5-HT from the mucosa and has a wide variety of actions in the GI tract. Here, we examined how melatonin signalling is affected by colitis and determined how this relates to 5-HT signalling. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Using electroanalytical approaches, we investigated how 5-HT release, reuptake and availability as well as melatonin availability are altered in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Studies were conducted to explore if melatonin treatment during active colitis could reduce the severity of colitis. KEY RESULTS We observed an increase in 5-HT and a decrease in melatonin availability in DSS-induced colitis. A significant reduction in 5-HT reuptake was observed in DSS-induced colitis animals. A reduction in the content of 5-HT was observed, but no difference in tryptophan levels were observed. A reduction in deoxycholic acid-stimulated 5-HT availability and a significant reduction in mechanically-stimulated 5-HT and melatonin availability were observed in DSS-induced colitis. Orally or rectally administered melatonin once colitis was established did not significantly suppress inflammation. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our data suggest that DSS-induced colitis results in a reduction in melatonin availability and an increase in 5-HT availability, due to a reduction/loss of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 enzyme, 5-HT content and 5-HT transporters. Mechanosensory release was more susceptible to inflammation when compared with chemosensory release.","output":"Alterations in melatonin and 5-HT signalling in the colonic mucosa of mice with dextran-sodium sulfate-induced colitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that was first identified during the outbreak in Wuhan, China in 2019 It is an acute respiratory illness that can transfer among human beings Natural products can provide a rich resource for novel antiviral drugs They can interfere with viral proteins such as viral proteases, polymerases, and entry proteins Several naturally occurring flavonoids were reported to have antiviral activity against different types of RNA and DNA viruses A methanolic extract of Manilkara hexandra (Roxb ) Dubard leaves is rich in phenolic compounds, mainly flavonoids Metabolic profiling of the secondary metabolites of Manilkara hexandra (Roxb ) Dubard leaves methanolic extract (MLME), and bark ethyl acetate (MBEE) extract using LC-HRESIMS resulted in the isolation of 18 compounds belonging to a variety of constituents, among which phenolic compounds, flavones, flavonol glycosides and triterpenes were predominant Besides, four compounds (ICIV) were isolated and identified as myricetin I, myricitrin II, mearnsitrin III, and mearnsetin-3-O--d-rutinoside IV (compound IV is isolated for the first time from genus Manilkara) and dereplicated in a metabolomic study as compounds 3, 5, 6, and 12, respectively The molecular docking study showed that rutin, myricitrin, mearnsitrin, and quercetin 3-O--d-glucoside have strong interaction with SARS-CoV-2 protease with high binding energy of ?8 2072, ?7 1973, ?7 5855, and ?7 6750, respectively Interestingly, the results proved that rutin which is a citrus flavonoid glycoside exhibits the strongest inhibition effect to the SARS-CoV-2 protease enzyme Consequently, it can contribute to developing an effective antiviral drug lead against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","output":"Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 main protease by phenolic compounds from Manilkara hexandra (Roxb.)

Methods In the Val Venosta/Vinschgau district (South Tyrol, Italy), we conducted a population-representative longitudinal study on 697 individuals who completed 4,512 repeated online questionnaires at four week intervals between September 2020 and May 2021. Mixed-effects logistic regression models were fitted to investigate associations between self-reported SARS-CoV-2 testing and both individual characteristics (social, demographic, and biological) and contextual determinants. Results Testing was associated with month of reporting, reflecting the timing of both the pandemic intensity and public health interventions, COVID-19-related symptoms (odds ratio, OR:8.26; 95% confidence interval, CI:6.04-11.31), contacts with infected individuals within home (OR:7.47, 95%CI:3.81-14.62) or outside home (OR:9.87, 95%CI:5.78-16.85), and being retired (OR:0.50, 95%CI:0.34-0.73).

We aimed to develop a nomogram for predicting in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19 with solid tumors. METHODS: We enrolled patients with COVID-19 with solid tumors admitted to 32 hospitals in China between December 17, 2020, and March 18, 2020. A multivariate logistic regression model was constructed via stepwise regression analysis, and a nomogram was subsequently developed based on the fitted multivariate logistic regression model. Discrimination and calibration of the nomogram were evaluated by estimating the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) for the model and by bootstrap resampling, a Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and visual inspection of the calibration curve. RESULTS: There were 216 patients with COVID-19 with solid tumors included in the present study, of whom 37 (17%) died and the other 179 all recovered from COVID-19 and were discharged. The median age of the enrolled patients was 63.0 years and 113 (52.3%) were men. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that increasing age (OR=1.08, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.16), receipt of antitumor treatment within 3 months before COVID-19 (OR=28.65, 95% CI 3.54 to 231.97), peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count &#8805;6.93 109/L (OR=14.52, 95% CI 2.45 to 86.14), derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (dNLR; neutrophil count/(WBC count minus neutrophil count)) &#8805;4.19 (OR=18.99, 95% CI 3.58 to 100.65), and dyspnea on admission (OR=20.38, 95% CI 3.55 to 117.02) were associated with elevated mortality risk. The performance of the established nomogram was satisfactory, with an AUC of 0.953 (95% CI 0.908 to 0.997) for the model, non-significant findings on the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and rough agreement between predicted and observed probabilities as suggested in calibration curves.

METHODS: Focus groups were conducted across four health systems within the University of Colorado Department of Medicine in four affinity groups (administrative staff, medical trainees, research faculty, and clinical faculty). Authentic leadership theory was used for analysis to advance the understanding of the role of leadership style upon participants work experiences and preferences, and to identify opportunities for translation of site-specific results to other academic medical settings. RESULTS: Study participants from each affinity group believed their clinical leaders lacked objectivity with decision-making (lacking balancing processing), which contributed to their overall feeling of powerlessness. The experience of increasing work demands was salient throughout all twelve focus groups, and participants identified leadership that interacted in a more open and self-disclosing manner (relational transparency) as alleviating at least some of this burden. Strong preference discernable alignment between their leaders decision-making and their internal moral compass of values (demonstrating internalized moral perspective) was described, as was clinical leaders demonstrating self-awareness (having a self-reflective process that informs the leaders decision-making). Comparing affinity group experiences within each authentic leadership theory construct identified the relevance of contextual factors, such as work setting and roles, upon employees perceptions and expectations of their leaders. CONCLUSIONS: Use of authentic leadership theory advanced the understanding of the association between leadership traits and experiences of burnout amongst a large group of academic clinicians, researchers, trainees, and administrative staff.

Design: Cohort study. Setting: Four US universities, September 2020 to February 2021. Participants: 3,641 students and staff were identified as close contacts to SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals. They entered strict or non-strict quarantine and were tested on average twice per week for SARS-CoV-2. Strict quarantine included designated housing with a private room, private bathroom and meal delivery. Non-strict quarantine potentially included interactions with household members. Measurements: Dates of exposure and last negative and first positive tests during quarantine. Results: Of the 418 quarantined individuals who eventually converted to positive, 11%, 4.2%, and 1.2% were negative and asymptomatic on days 7, 10 and 14, respectively. The US CDC recently shortened its quarantine guidance from 14 to 7 days based on estimates of 2.3-8.6% post-quarantine transmission risk at day 7, significantly below the 11% risk we report here. Notably, 6% of individuals tested positive after day 7 in strict quarantine, versus 14% in non-strict quarantine.

This mirrors the well-studied exponential decline of both thymus volume and T-cell production, which halve every 16 years. COVID-19 can therefore be added to the list of other diseases with this property, including those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MERS-CoV, West Nile virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and certain cancers, such as chronic myeloid leukaemia and brain cancers. In addition, the incidence of severe disease and mortality due to COVID-19 are both higher in men, consistent with the degree to which thymic involution (and the decrease in T-cell production with age) is more severe in men compared to women. Since these properties are shared with some non-contagious diseases, we hypothesized that the age dependence does not come from social-mixing patterns, i.e. that the probability of hospitalization given infection rises exponentially, doubling every 16 years. A Bayesian analysis of daily hospitalizations, incorporating contact matrices, found that this relationship holds for every age group except for the under 20s. While older adults have fewer contacts than young adults, our analysis suggests that there is an approximate cancellation between the effects of fewer contacts for the elderly and higher infectiousness due to a higher probability of developing severe disease. Our model fitting suggests under 20s have 49C75% additional immune protection beyond that predicted by strong thymus function alone, consistent with increased juvenile cross-immunity from other viruses. We found no evidence for differences between age groups in susceptibility to infection or infectiousness to others (given disease state), i.e. the only important factor in the age dependence of hospitalization rates is the probability of hospitalization given infection. These findings suggest the existence of a T-cell exhaustion threshold, proportional to thymic output and that clonal expansion of peripheral T-cells does not affect disease risk. The strikingly simple inverse relationship between risk and thymic T-cell output adds to the evidence that thymic involution is an important factor in the decline of the immune system with age and may also be an important clue in understanding disease progression, not just for COVID-19 but other diseases as well.","output":"COVID-19 hospitalization rates rise exponentially with age, inversely proportional to thymic T-cell production"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of Ivermectin in COVID 19 infection in terms of virus clearance and symptomatic improvement.

In this online survey, we were interested in measure how much loss of control was perceived regarding online gambling, online shopping, the fruition of online pornographic content and web navigation. DESIGN AND METHODS The online survey was carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic in the post-lockdown and 1232 subjects participated in the survey. In the participating sample, healthcare workers (HW) were 43.1% of the sample, of which 18.7% were directly involved in the Coronavirus emergency, and 52.3% of the sample is not a HW. Only 0.6% of the sample gambled online and 37.5% of those reported losing control of their gambling mode. Most of the sample shopped online during the LD (70.1%), but only 7.2% of those lost control by buying and/or spending more than what they had set themselves. RESULTS Significant data emerged showing that those who lost control while online shopping also lost control regarding the amount of time spent online (p<0.001); 21.6% of the sample, reported making use of online pornographic material during LD, 4.7% of them stated that the frequency increased and 5.1% reported losing control by having spent more money or more time than what was intended. Finally, 44.7% of the sample have experienced loss of control during the web navigation. Furthermore, during the LD 67.8% of the sample reports having experienced unpleasant emotions. Of these, 8.4% state that they enacted behaviors such as online gambling, online shopping, online pornographic material viewing and web navigation to counter their negative emotions. Interestingly, we found a correlation between loss of control during web navigation and online shopping and the emotional states \\"upset\\", \\"scared\\" and \\"restless\\" (p<0.05). CONCLUSION To conclude, there was no significant increase in potentially addictive behaviors, nor an increase in loss of control of these behaviors when enacted online. However, the loss of control in online shopping and web navigation was significantly correlated to the unpleasant emotional states of nervousness, fear and restlessness, whereas those who reported feeling strong and able to handle the situation experienced a lower loss of control in their web navigation. These correlations may suggest that these online behaviors may act as modulators of unpleasant emotional states.","output":"COVID-19 lockdown: impact on online gambling, online shopping, web navigation and online pornography."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New diseases have always been part of humanitys world, and some of them had created severe threat to human kind and challenge to the researchers and medical practitioners.

A distinguishing feature of COVID-19 is that, unlike with previous viral diseases, there is a distinct \\"asymptomatic\\" group A, which does not show any symptoms, but can nevertheless infect others, at the same rate as infected symptomatic patients. This situation is captured in a model known as SAIR (Susceptible, Asymptomatic, Infected, Removed), introduced in Robinson and Stillianakis (2013). The dynamical behavior of the SAIR model is quite different from that of the SEIR model. In this paper, we use Lyapunov theory to establish the global asymptotic stabililty of the SAIR model, both without and with vital dynamics. Then we develop compartmental SAIR models to cater to the migration of population across geographic regions, and once again establish global asymptotic stability. Next, we go beyond long-term asymptotic analysis and present methods for estimating the parameters in the SAIR model. We apply these estimation methods to data from several countries including India, and demonstrate that the predicted trajectories of the disease closely match actual data.

Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have a higher mortality rate than non-DM patients if they get COVID-19. Recent studies have indicated that patients with a history of diabetes can increase the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Additionally, patients without any history of diabetes can acquire new-onset DM when infected with COVID-19. Thus, there is a need to explore the bidirectional link between these two conditions, confirming the vicious loop between DM/COVID-19. This narrative review presents (1) the bidirectional association between the DM and COVID-19, (2) the manifestations of the DM/COVID-19 loop leading to cardiovascular disease, (3) an understanding of primary and secondary factors that influence mortality due to the DM/COVID-19 loop, (4) the role of vitamin-D in DM patients during COVID-19, and finally, (5) the monitoring tools for tracking atherosclerosis burden in DM patients during COVID-19 and COVID-triggered DM patients. We conclude that the bidirectional nature of DM/COVID-19 causes acceleration towards cardiovascular events. Due to this alarming condition, early monitoring of atherosclerotic burden is required in Diabetes patients during COVID-19 or new-onset Diabetes triggered by COVID-19 in non-Diabetes patients.","output":"Abstract 20: Bidirectional link between diabetes mellitus and coronavirus disease 2019 leading to cardiovascular disease: A narrative review.

Paradoxically, the numbers of anti-viral natural killer (NK) cells are increased in males compared to females. Using samples from mice and humans, we demonstrate that while numbers of male NK cells are increased compared to females, they display impaired production of the anti-viral cytokine IFN-. These sex differences were not due solely to divergent levels of gonadal hormones, since these differences persisted in gonadectomized mice. Instead, these differences can be attributed to lower male expression of X-linked Kdm6a (UTX), an epigenetic regulator which escapes X inactivation in female NK cells. NK cell-specific UTX deletion in females phenocopied multiple features of male NK cells, which include increased numbers and reduced IFN- production. Integrative ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analysis revealed a critical role for UTX in the regulation of chromatin accessibility and gene expression at loci important in NK cell homeostasis and effector function. Consequently, NK cell-intrinsic UTX levels are critical for optimal anti-viral immunity, since mice with NK cell-intrinsic UTX deficiency show increased lethality to mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) challenge. Taken together, these data implicate UTX as a critical molecular determinant of NK cell sex differences and suggest enhancing UTX function as a new strategy to boost endogenous NK cell anti-viral responses.","output":"Sex differences in NK cells mediated by the X-linked epigenetic regulator UTX"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Helicobacter pylori is a recognized cancerogenic bacterial agent in humans, associated with gastritis, peptic ulcer, and gastric cancer. Immunoevasive and immunomodulatory mechanisms underlie the chronic persistence of the bacterium and the active proinflammatory effect of life-long H. pylori infection. In contrast to tumorigenic viruses, which frequently possess factors to influence the host ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), nothing is yet known about potential effects of H. pylori in this respect. The majority of H. pylori isolates worldwide possess a pathogenicity island (PAI), the cagPAI, which is involved in IL-8 production and chronic inflammation. We hypothesized that H. pylori and its cagPAI may have an influence on host cell ubiquitin pathways. The effect of H. pylori wild type and isogenic mutants lacking the complete cagPAI (or CagA) on host deubiqutinating enzymes (DUBs) was tested in coincubation experiments with human gastric epithelial cells, using DUB activity profiling. Specific DUBs were identified to be active in gastric cells. Effects on the activity and expression of DUBs were observed in H. pylori-infected cells. In particular, H. pylori caused a strong decrease in the expression and activity of the DUB USP7 which was partially cagPAI- and CagA-dependent. The reduction in USP7 in infected cells at the protein and transcript levels coincided with a decrease in the amounts of the major innate immune hub protein TRAF6 and the tumor suppressor p53. These results are a basis for further investigations into H. pylori modulators of ubiquitin-dependent cellular signaling and their biological function.","output":"Helicobacter pylori affects the cellular deubiquitinase USP7 and ubiquitin-regulated components TRAF6 and the tumour suppressor p53."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION/HYPOTHESIS: Vitamin-D (Vit-D) has an important immunomodulatory role and its deficiency has been linked to increased viral respiratory infections in the pediatric population Recent adult studies have shown an association between lower Vit-D levels and mortality in COVID-19 Low Vit-D levels are common in children with obesity and associated with enhanced systemic inflammation METHODS: This is an IRB approved, retrospective case series of children with COVID-19 admitted to a tertiary pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), describing the clinical features and 25-hydroxy-Vit-D levels Charts were reviewed and pertinent data collected Deidentified data were analyzed using SPSS v 26 Categorical data are presented as frequencies and percentages Continuous data presented as median with interquartile range (IQR) RESULTS: A total of 14 COVID-19 patients who had 25- OH Vit D levels measured were reviewed All patients had MIS-C (fever, inflammation, and 2 or more organ involvement) Demographic data included, females 50% (n=7), Hispanics 64 3% (n=9), whites 78 6% (n=11), and blacks, 21 4% (n=3) The median age was 15 (IQR 4 83) with 64% (n=9) teens Overweight or obese was present in 71 4% (n=10) Median BMI was 31 2 (IQR18 31) Vit-D deficiency (level&lt;30 ng/ml) was present in 71 4% (n=10) Median Vit-D level was 22 5 ng/mL (range 12 8-45) Premorbid conditions were present in 64 3% (n=9) in all and 70% (n=7) in those who were Vit-D deficient Asthma (n=4) and seizure disorder (n=3) were the most common premorbid conditions Pulmonary failure (defined as need for any respiratory support) was seen in 50% (n=7) of all cases and 86% (n=6) of them were Vit-D deficient PARDS (SF ratio&lt;264) was present in 36% (n=5) patients and 80% (n=4) of those were Vit-D deficient Median D-dimer level was 1 67 (IQR 6 7) Anticoagulation was started in 93% (n=13) Lymphopenia was seen in 87% cases with median lowest lymphocyte count of 767 (IQR 574) Mean hospital stay was 10 8 (range 3-29) days One child died All children with low Vit-D levels were given supplementation CONCLUSIONS: Majority of COVID-19 pediatric patients needing ICU admission were obese, Vit-D deficient adolescents Based on these findings in our PICU cohort, it is prudent to screen for Vit-D levels and supplement those with low levels","output":"Vitamin d levels in children with COVID-19 admitted to the PICU"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is an omnipresent proinflammatory cytokine of the IL-1 family with central roles in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and serves as a staple biomarker in the evaluation of inflammation in physiology and disease, including the inflammatory phase of COVID-19.

Since an imbalance in expression and circulating levels of IL-18 is associated with disease, structural insights into how IL-18BP outcompetes binding of IL-18 by its cognate cell-surface receptors are highly desirable; however, the structure of human IL-18BP in complex with IL-18 has been elusive. Here, we elucidate the sequestration mechanism of human IL-18 mediated by IL-18BP based on the crystal structure of the IL-18:IL-18BP complex. These detailed structural snapshots reveal the interaction landscape leading to the ultra-high affinity of IL-18BP toward IL-18 and identify substantial differences with respect to previously characterized complexes of IL-18 with IL-18BP of viral origin. Furthermore, our structure captured a fortuitous higher-order assembly between IL-18 and IL-18BP coordinated by a disulfide-bond distal to the binding surface connecting IL-18 and IL-18BP molecules from different complexes, resulting in a novel tetramer with 2:2 stoichiometry. This tetrapartite assembly was found to restrain IL-18 activity more effectively than the canonical 1:1 complex.

Many opportunities in everyday clinical care are missed to improve care for this susceptible and growing patient group. The aim was to develop expert clinical recommendations on Geriatric Emergency Medicine to be disseminated across Europe. METHODS: A group of multi-disciplinary experts in the field of Geriatric Emergency Medicine in Europe was assembled. Using a modified Delphi procedure, a prioritized list of topics related to Geriatric Emergency Medicine was created. Next, a multi-disciplinary group of nurses, geriatricians and emergency physicians performed a review of recent guidelines and literature to create recommendations. These recommendations were voted upon by a group of experts and placed on visually attractive posters. The expert group identified the following eight subject areas to develop expert recommendations on: Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment in the Emergency Department (ED), age/frailty adjusted risk stratification, delirium and cognitive impairment, medication reviews in the ED for older adults, family involvement, ED environment, silver trauma, end of life care in the acute setting. RESULTS: Eight posters with expert clinical recommendations on the most important topics in Geriatric Emergency Medicine are now available through https://posters.geriemeurope.eu/.

To support clinical development of BMS-986178 (an OX40 agonist antibody), two repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. In the first study, BMS-986178 was administered intravenously (IV) once weekly for one month at doses from 30 to 120a?mg/kg. BMS-986178 was well tolerated; surprisingly, immune function was suppressed rather than increased based on pharmacodynamic (PD) and flow cytometry readouts (e.g. T-cell dependent antibody response [TDAR]). To determine whether immune suppression was due to a bi-phasic response, a follow-up study was conducted at lower doses (1 and 10a?mg/kg). Although receptor engagement was confirmed, immune function was still suppressed at both doses. In addition, treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) at 1a?mg/kg resulted in hypersensitivity reactions and reduced BMS-986178 exposure after repeated dosing, which precluded a full PD assessment at this dose. In conclusion, BMS-986178 was clinically well-tolerated by monkeys at weekly IV doses from 10 to 120a?mg/kg (AUC[0-168]a?&#8804;a?712,000a?gah/mL). However, despite target engagement, PD assays and other immune endpoints demonstrated immune suppression, not stimulation. Due to the inverted immune response at higher doses and the onset of ADAs, additional repeat-dose toxicity studies of BMS-986178 in monkeys (that would typically be required to support Phase 3 clinical trials and registration) would not add value for human safety assessment.","output":"Decreased immune response in monkeys administered a human T-effector cell agonist (OX40) antibody"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Indirect excess morbidity has emerged as a major concern in the COVID-19 pandemic. People with psoriasis may be particularly vulnerable to this because of prevalent anxiety and depression, multimorbidity and therapeutic use of immunosuppression. Objective Characterise the factors associated with worsening psoriasis in the COVID-19 pandemic, using mental health status (anxiety and depression) as the main exposure of interest. Methods Global cross-sectional study using a primary outcome of self-reported worsening of psoriasis. Individuals with psoriasis completed an online self-report questionnaire (PsoProtectMe; Psoriasis Patient Registry for Outcomes, Therapy and Epidemiology of COVID-19 Infection Me) between May 2020 and January 2021. Each individual completed a validated screen for anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-2). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression. Results 4,043 people with psoriasis (without COVID-19) from 86 countries self-reported to PsoProtectMe (mean age 47.2 years [SD 15.1]; mean BMI 27.6kg/m2 [SD 6.0], 2,684 [66.4%] female and 3,016 [74.6%] of white European ethnicity). 1,728 (42.7%) participants (1322 [77%] female) reported worsening of their psoriasis in the pandemic. A positive screen for anxiety or depression associated with worsening psoriasis in age and gender adjusted (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.77-2.36), and fully adjusted (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.72-2.34) logistic regression models. Female sex, obesity, shielding behaviour and systemic immunosuppressant non-adherence also associated with worsening psoriasis. The commonest reason for non-adherence was concern regarding complications related to COVID-19. Conclusions These data indicate an association between poor mental health and worsening psoriasis in the pandemic. Access to holistic care including psychological support may mitigate potentially long-lasting effects of the pandemic on health outcomes in psoriasis.

Our modelling aims to inform optimal public health responses. METHODS: An individual-based simulation model represented SARS-CoV2 transmission in communities ranging from 100 to 3500 people, comprised of large, interconnected households. A range of strategies for case finding, quarantining of contacts, testing, and lockdown were examined, following the silent introduction of a case. RESULTS: Multiple secondary infections are likely present by the time the first case is identified. Quarantine of close contacts, defined by extended household membership, can reduce peak infection prevalence from 60 to 70% to around 10%, but subsequent waves may occur when community mixing resumes. Exit testing significantly reduces ongoing transmission. Concurrent lockdown of non-quarantined households for 14 days is highly effective for epidemic control and reduces overall testing requirements; peak prevalence of the initial outbreak can be constrained to less than 5%, and the final community attack rate to less than 10% in modelled scenarios. Lockdown also mitigates the effect of a delay in the initial response. Compliance with lockdown must be at least 80C90%, however, or epidemic control will be lost. CONCLUSIONS: A SARS-CoV-2 outbreak will spread rapidly in remote communities. Prompt case detection with quarantining of extended-household contacts and a 14 day lockdown for all other residents, combined with exit testing for all, is the most effective strategy for rapid containment.

METHODS: Data were retrieved from the local ICU database from December 2011 to September 2019. The primary analysis was a risk-adjusted logistic regression model. Secondary analyses comprised case/control (transfer/non-transfer) matching. RESULTS: A total of 573 patients were transferred due to a shortage of ICU beds, and 8106 patients were not transferred. Crude 90-day mortality was higher in patients transferred due to a shortage of beds (189 patients (33%) vs 2188 patients (27%), p = 0.002). In the primary, risk-adjusted analysis, the risk of death at 90 days was similar between the groups (odds ratio 0.923, 95% confidence interval 0.75C1.14, p = 0.461).

Specimens positive in 2 assays were considered true positive and examined for concordance with specimen results.

We believe that the variations in results among kits for specimens with low viral loads should not be problematic when these kits are used for screening infectious patients because these variations are more likely to be observed in specimens tested many days after onset (i.e., those that have lost their infectivity). However, for suspected late-stage COVID-19 with a low viral load, it may be better to use a test such as Toyobo M or Cobas.","output":"Negative Results of Nucleic Acid Amplification Test for SARS-CoV-2 in Clinical Practice May Vary among Six Molecular Assays in COVID-19 Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the use of health services among adults living in Manaus, Amazonas. METHODS: This was a panel of two cross-sectional studies conducted in Manaus in 2015 and 2019. Individuals aged  18 years were selected by probabilistic sampling and interviewed at home. The study outcomes were doctor visits and hospitalizations in the previous 12 months, and unmet surgical needs. Variations between 2015 and 2019 were tested using chi-squared goodness-of-fit test. Poisson regression with robust variance was employed to calculate the prevalence ratios (PR) of the outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: The surveys included 5,800 participants in total. Visits to the doctor decreased from 2015 (78.7%) to 2019 (76.3%; p < 0.001), hospital admissions increased from 2015 (7.9%) to 2019 (11.5%; p < 0.001), and unmet surgical needs decreased in the period (15.9% to 12.1%; p < 0.001). These variations were particularly observed in vulnerable individuals C sicker; poorer; non-whites; and those belonging to lower social classes, with less access to education, formal jobs, and health insurance (p < 0.05).

Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 may still face persisting respiratory damage from the virus, necessitating long-term supervision after discharge to closely assess pulmonary function during rehabilitation. Therefore, developing portable spirometers for pulmonary function tests is of great significance for convenient home-based monitoring during recovery. Here, we propose a wireless, portable pulmonary function monitor for rehabilitation care after COVID-19. It is composed of a breath-to-electrical (BTE) sensor, a signal processing circuit, and a Bluetooth communication unit. The BTE sensor, with a compact size and light weight of 2.5 cm3 and 1.8 g respectively, is capable of converting respiratory biomechanical motions into considerable electrical signals. The output signal stability is greater than 93% under 35%-81% humidity, which allows for ideal expiration airflow sensing. Through a wireless communication circuit system, the signals can be received by a mobile terminal and processed into important physiological parameters, such as forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). The FEV1/FVC ratio is then calculated to further evaluate pulmonary function of testers. Through these measurement methods, the acquired pulmonary function parameters are shown to exhibit high accuracy (>97%) in comparison to a commercial spirometer. The practical design of the self-powered flow spirometer presents a low-cost and convenient method for pulmonary function monitoring during rehabilitation from COVID-19.","output":"A portable triboelectric spirometer for wireless pulmonary function monitoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus genome replication is mediated by a multi-subunit protein complex that is comprised of more than a dozen virally encoded and several cellular proteins.

Subsequently, lung vascular repair is characterized by LEC and AEC regeneration and LECCLEC junction re-annealing, which restores nutrient and oxygen delivery to the injured tissue. Pulmonary hypoxia is a characteristic feature of several inflammatory lung conditions, including acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The vascular response to hypoxia is controlled primarily by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) 1 and 2. These transcription factors control the expression of a wide variety of target genes, which in turn mediate key pathophysiological processes including cell survival, differentiation, migration, and proliferation. HIF signaling in pulmonary cell types such as LECs and AECs, as well as infiltrating leukocytes, tightly regulates inflammatory lung injury and repair, in a manner that is dependent upon HIF isoform, cell type, and injury stimulus. The aim of this review is to describe the HIF-dependent regulation of inflammatory lung injury and vascular repair. The review will also discuss potential areas for future study and highlight putative targets for inflammatory lung conditions such as ALI/ARDS and severe COVID-19.

However, because uncertainty is an aversive state, uncertainty reduction theory (URT) holds that employees try to manage it by obtaining information. To date, most evidence for the effectiveness of obtaining information to reduce uncertainty stems from research conducted in relatively stable contexts wherein employees can acquire consistent information. Yet, research on crises and news consumption provides reasons to believe that the potential for information to mitigate uncertainty as specified by URT may break down during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Integrating URT with research on crises and news consumption, we predict that consuming news information during crises-which tends to be distressing, constantly evolving, and inconsistent-will be positively related to uncertainty. This in turn may have negative implications for employee goal progress and creativity; two work outcomes that take on substantial significance in times of uncertainty and the pandemic. We further predict that death anxiety will moderate this relationship, such that the link between employees' news consumption and uncertainty is stronger for those with lower levels of death anxiety, compared to those with higher levels. We test our theorizing via an experience-sampling study with 180 full-time employees, with results providing support for our conceptual model.

Selecting an appropriate workflow has become an important issue for researchers in the field. METHODS: In our study, six popular analytical procedures/pipeline were compared using four RNA-seq datasets from mouse, human, rat, and macaque, respectively. The gene expression value, fold change of gene expression, and statistical significance were evaluated to compare the similarities and differences among the six procedures. qRT-PCR was performed to validate the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from all six procedures. RESULTS: Cufflinks-Cuffdiff demands the highest computing resources and Kallisto-Sleuth demands the least. Gene expression values, fold change, p and q values of differential expression (DE) analysis are highly correlated among procedures using HTseq for quantification. For genes with medium expression abundance, the expression values determined using the different procedures were similar. Major differences in expression values come from genes with particularly high or low expression levels. HISAT2-StringTie-Ballgown is more sensitive to genes with low expression levels, while Kallisto-Sleuth may only be useful to evaluate genes with medium to high abundance. When the same thresholds for fold change and p value are chosen in DE analysis, StringTie-Ballgown produce the least number of DEGs, while HTseq-DESeq2, -edgeR or -limma generally produces more DEGs. The performance of Cufflinks-Cuffdiff and Kallisto-Sleuth varies in different datasets. For DEGs with medium expression levels, the biological verification rates were similar among all procedures. CONCLUSION: Results are highly correlated among RNA-seq analysis procedures using HTseq for quantification.

Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) were applied to illustrate the biological functions of genes in these modules. We constructed the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network by Cytoscape and selected five candidate hub genes. Five potential hub genes were validated in GSE30119 by GraphPad Prism 8.0. The diagnostic values of these genes were calculated and present in the ROC curve based on the GSE13670 dataset. Their gene functions were analyzed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). RESULTS: A co-expression network was built with 5000 genes divided into 11 modules. The genes in green and turquoise modules demonstrated a high correlation. According to the KEGG and GO analyses, genes in the green module were closely related to ubiquitination and autophagy. Subsequently, we picked out the top five hub genes in the green module. And UBB was determined as the hub gene in the GSE30119 dataset. The expression level of UBB, ASB, and MKRN1 could significantly differentiate between Staphylococcus aureus infection and healthy controls based on the ROC curve.

Pathway enrichment analysis of 2dpi platelet proteomes revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulated complement-coagulation networks (F2, F12, CFH, CD55/CD59), platelet activation-adhesion-degranulation proteins (PF4, SELP, PECAM1, HRG, PLG, vWF), and chemokines (CCL8, CXCL5, CXCL12).

Between April and July 2017- 2019 (Period A) a mean of 262 tests were performed monthly, falling to 128 for the corresponding months of 2020 (Period B). A reduction in the monthly mean number of positive tests (Period A 71.5; Period B 2.8) and mean positivity rate (Period A 25.04%; Period B 2.07%) was observed. Rhinovirus/enterovirus was the most prevalent virus, with a monthly mean of 21.6 cases (30.2% of positives) for Period A and 2 cases (72.7% of positives) for Period B. Positivity for a second virus occurred in a mean of 2.1 positive tests (3.3%) in Period A but was absent in Period B. Implementation of distancing and masking coincides with a marked reduction in respiratory virus detection and likely circulation. Data from the fall/winter of 2020 will help clarify the potential role for distancing and masking as a mitigation strategy, not only for SARS-CoV-2 but also in the seasonal battle against common respiratory viruses.","output":"Effectiveness of Physical Distancing: Staying 6 Feet Over to Put Respiratory Viruses 6 Feet Under"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A Monte Carlo simulation in a novel approach is used for studying the problem of the outbreak and spread dynamics of the new virus COVID-19 pandemic in this work.

In the simulation we also take into account the stochastic character of the individuals in a finite population and given densities of people. On the other hand, we include in the simulation the appropriate statistical distributions for the parameters characterizing this disease. An important outcome of our work, apart of the produced epidemic curves, is the methodology of determination of the effective reproductive number during the main part of the new daily cases of the epidemic. Because this quantity constitutes a fundamental parameter of the SIR-based epidemic models, we also studied how it is affected by small variations of the incubation time and the crucial distance distributions, and furthermore, by the degree of quarantine measures.

Because the primary trial endpoint was vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic disease, there are limited data on the extent to which vaccines protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and the ability to infect others (infectiousness). Assumptions about VE against infection and infectiousness have implications for possible changes to infection prevention guidance for vaccinated populations, including testing strategies. METHODS: We use a stochastic agent-based SEIR model of a nursing home to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We model three scenarios, varying VE against infection, infectiousness, and symptoms, to understand the expected impact of vaccination in nursing homes, increasing staff vaccination coverage, and different screening testing strategies under each scenario. RESULTS: Increasing vaccination coverage in staff decreases total symptomatic cases in each scenario. When there is low VE against infection and infectiousness, increasing staff coverage reduces symptomatic cases among residents. If vaccination only protects against symptoms, but asymptomatic cases remain infectious, increased staff coverage increases symptomatic cases among residents through exposure to asymptomatic but infected staff. High frequency testing is needed to reduce total symptomatic cases if the vaccine has low efficacy against infection and infectiousness, or only protects against symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Encouraging staff vaccination is not only important for protecting staff, but might also reduce symptomatic cases in residents if a vaccine confers at least some protection against infection or infectiousness.","output":"Mathematical modeling to inform vaccination strategies and testing approaches for COVID-19 in nursing homes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The risk posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus ?2 (SARS-CoV-2) dictates that live-virus research is conducted in a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility.

In this study, we validated and compared two protocols for inactivating SARS-CoV-2: heat treatment and ultraviolet irradiation. The two methods were optimized to render the virus completely incapable of infection while limiting destructive effects of inactivation. We observed that 15 minutes of incubation at 65C completely inactivates high titer viral stocks. Complete inactivation was also achieved with minimal amounts of UV power (70,000 J/cm2), which is 100-fold less power than comparable studies. Once validated, the two methods were then compared for viral RNA quantification, virion purification, and antibody recognition. We observed that UV irradiation resulted in a 2-log reduction of detectable genomes compared to heat inactivation. Protein yield following virion enrichment was equivalent for all inactivation conditions, but the resulting viral proteins and virions were negatively impacted by inactivation method and time.

However, the thermal techniques require tumescent anaesthesia, which can be uncomfortable during administration. Non-tumescent, non-thermal techniques would, therefore, have potential benefits. This randomised controlled trial is being carried out to compare the degree of pain that patients experience while receiving mechanochemical ablation or radiofrequency ablation. The early results of this randomised controlled trial are reported here. METHODS Patients attending for the treatment of primary varicose veins were randomised to receive mechanochemical ablation (ClariVein?) or radiofrequency ablation (Covidien? Venefit?). The most symptomatic limb was randomised. The primary outcome measure was intra-procedural pain using a validated visual analogue scale. The secondary outcome measures were change in quality of life and clinical scores, time to return to normal activities and work as well as the occlusion rate. RESULTS One-hundred and nineteen patients have been randomised (60 in the mechanochemical ablation group). Baseline characteristics were similar. Maximum pain score was significantly lower in the mechanochemical ablation group (19.3 mm, standard deviation 19 mm) compared to the radiofrequency ablation group (34.5 mm  23 mm; p < 0.001). Average pain score was also significantly lower in the mechanochemical ablation group (13.4 mm  16 mm) compared to the radiofrequency ablation group (24.4 mm  18 mm; p = 0.001). Sixty-six percent attended follow-up at one month, and the complete or proximal occlusion rates were 92% for both groups. At one month, the clinical and quality of life scores for both groups had similar improvements.

In particular, two \\"new\\" communities, /r/China flu and /r/Coronavirus, emerged on Reddit and have been dedicated to COVID- related discussions from the very beginning of this pandemic. With /r/Coronavirus promoted as the official community on Reddit, it remains an open question how users choose between these two highly-related communities. In this paper, we characterize user trajectories in these two communities from the beginning of COVID-19 to the end of September 2020. We show that new users of /r/China flu and /r/Coronavirus were similar from January to March. After that, their differences steadily increase, evidenced by both language distance and membership prediction, as the pandemic continues to unfold. Furthermore, users who started at /r/China flu from January to March were more likely to leave, while those who started in later months tend to remain highly \\"loyal\\". To understand this difference, we develop a movement analysis framework to understand membership changes in these two communities and identify a significant proportion of /r/China flu members (around 50%) that moved to /r/Coronavirus in February.

Here, we quantified hydrogen peroxide in the tumor microenvironment and demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide concentrations are elevated in tumor interstitial fluid isolated from murine breast cancers in vivo, when compared with blood or normal subcutaneous fluid. Therefore, we investigated the effects of increased hydrogen peroxide concentration on immune cell functions. NK cells were more susceptible to hydrogen peroxide than T cells or B cells, and comparing T, B and NK cells' sensitivities to redox stress and their antioxidant capacities identified peroxiredoxin-1 (PRDX1) as a lacking element of NK cells' antioxidative defense. We observed that priming with IL-15 protected NK cells' functions in the presence of high hydrogen peroxide and simultaneously upregulated PRDX1 expression. However, the effect of IL-15 on PRDX1 expression was transient and strictly dependent on the presence of the cytokine. Therefore, we genetically modified NK cells to stably overexpress PRDX1, which led to increased survival and NK cell activity in redox stress conditions. Finally, we generated PD-L1-CAR NK cells overexpressing PRDX1 that displayed potent antitumor activity against breast cancer cells under oxidative stress. These results demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide, at concentrations detected in the tumor microenvironment, suppresses NK-cell function and that genetic modification strategies can improve CAR-NK cells' resistance and potency against solid tumors.","output":"PRDX-1 supports the survival and antitumor activity of primary and CAR-modified NK cells under oxidative stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The proper functioning of the immune system requires a robust control over a delicate equilibrium between an ineffective response and immune overactivation. Poor responses to viral insults may lead to chronic or overwhelming infection, whereas unrestrained activation can cause autoimmune diseases and cancer. Control over the magnitude and duration of the antiviral immune response is exerted by a finely tuned positive or negative regulation at the DNA, RNA, and protein level of members of the type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathways and on the expression and activity of antiviral and proinflammatory factors. As summarized in this review, committed research during the last decade has shown that several of these processes are exquisitely regulated by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), transcripts with poor coding capacity, but highly versatile functions. After infection, viruses, and the antiviral response they trigger, deregulate the expression of a subset of specific lncRNAs that function to promote or repress viral replication by inactivating or potentiating the antiviral response, respectively. These IFN-related lncRNAs are also highly tissue- and cell-type-specific, rendering them as promising biomarkers or therapeutic candidates to modulate specific stages of the antiviral immune response with fewer adverse effects.","output":"LncRNAs in the Type I Interferon Antiviral Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cases of COVID-19 are rising quickly on the African continent.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 12 months, 6 months before and during the pandemic, laboratory errors were assessed via quality indicators (QIs) related to TTP phases. QIs were grouped as pre-, intra- and postanalytical. The results of QIs were expressed in defect percentages and sigma, evaluated with 3 levels of performance quality: 25(th), 50(th) and 75(th) percentile values. RESULTS: When the pre- and during pandemic periods were compared, the sigma value of the samples not received was significantly lower in pre-pandemic group than during pandemic group (4.7 vs. 5.4, P = 0.003).

Here, we aim to identify biological markers and associated biological processes of COVID-19 using a bioinformatics approach to elucidate their potential pathogenesis. The gene expression profile of the GSE152418 dataset was originally produced by using the high-throughput Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were applied to identify functional categories and biochemical pathways. KEGG and GO results suggested that biological pathways such as Cancer pathways and Insulin pathways were mostly affected in the development of COVID-19. Moreover, we identified several genes including EP300, CREBBP, and POLR2A were involved in the virus activities in COVID-19 patients. We further predicted that some inhibitors may have the potential to block the SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the L1000FWD analysis. Therefore, our study provides further insights into the underlying pathogenesis of COVID-19.","output":"Identification of potential biomarkers and inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China. African countries see slower dynamic of COVID-19 cases and deaths. One of the assumptions that may explain this later emergence in Africa, and more particularly in malaria endemic areas, would be the use of antimalarial drugs. We investigated the in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 of several antimalarial drugs. Chloroquine (EC50 = 2.1 M and EC90 = 3.8 M), hydroxychloroquine (EC50 = 1.5 M and EC90 = 3.0 M), ferroquine (EC50 = 1.5 M and EC90 = 2.4 M), desethylamodiaquine (EC50 = 0.52 M and EC90 = 1.9 M), mefloquine (EC50 = 1.8 M and EC90 = 8.1 M), pyronaridine (EC50 = 0.72 M and EC90 = 0.75 M) and quinine (EC50 = 10.7 M and EC90 = 38.8 M) showed in vitro antiviral effective activity with IC50 and IC90 compatible with drug oral uptake at doses commonly administered in malaria treatment. The ratio Clung/EC90 ranged from 5 to 59. Lumefantrine, piperaquine and dihydroartemisinin had IC50 and IC90 too high to be compatible with expected plasma concentrations (ratio Cmax/EC90 < 0.05). Based on our results, we would expect that countries which commonly use artesunate-amodiaquine or artesunate-mefloquine report fewer cases and deaths than those using artemether-lumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. It could be necessary now to compare the antimalarial use and the dynamics of COVID-19 country by country to confirm this hypothesis.","output":"Antimalarial drugs inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2: an in vitro evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, several cases of atypical pneumonia were detected in Wuhan city, Hubei province, inland China. The initial outbreak was of considerable size first in China subsequently spread to the rest of the world. Immediately after the epidemic (which according to the World Health Organization had risen to pandemic status), the problem of whether or not to update the occupational risk assessment arose, also considering how the biological risk from SARS CoV-2 should be understood: specific or generic. To this end, we conducted a literature review to identify national health legislation and policies, examining how Italy has addressed the COVID-19 emergency in occupational health planning, in order to develop considerations on the need to update the Risk Assessment Document following the pandemic status. The data that emerged from the review of current legislation allowed us to conclude that the risk from SARS-CoV-2 is in most work activities to be understood as a generic or aggravated generic risk, requiring the employer to apply and control the preventive measures suggested by health authorities to contain the spread of the virus.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and the Risk Assessment Document in Italian Work; Specific or Generic Risk Even If Aggravated?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The psychological effects of COVID-19 have been documented in the past year, but scarce literature exists on the nature of COVID-19 stressors.

This emergency scenario produced a conflict between personal freedom and public health, highlighting differences in individual behaviours influenced by psychological traits and moral considerations. In this context, a detailed characterisation of the psychological variables predicting adherence to containment measures is crucial to enhance public awareness and compliance. During the first virus outbreak in Italy, we assessed whether adherence to government measures was explained by the interacting effects of personality traits and moral dispositions. Through an online questionnaire, we collected data on individual endogenous variables related to personality traits, locus of control, and moral dispositions, alongside the tendency to breach the lockdown for outdoor physical activity. The results showed that individual measures of novelty-seeking, harm-avoidance and authority concerns interacted in driving the adherence to the national lockdown: MFQ-Authority moderated the facilitatory effect of novelty-seeking on lockdown violation, but this moderation was itself moderated by higher TCI-harm-avoidance. By assessing a model forecasting the likelihood of violating restrictive norms, these findings show the potential of personality and moral foundation assessments in informing prevention policies and emergency interventions by political and scientific institutions.","output":"Psychological precursors of individual differences in COVID-19 lockdown adherence: Moderated-moderation by personality and moral cognition measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Since December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been discovered in Wuhan and spread rapidly across China and worldwide.

METHODS: Epidemiological and clinical information of 1738 diagnosed patients during February 7-26, 2020 in Wuhan Dongxihu Fangcang Hospital were analyzed. A total of 709 patients were followed up on symptom, mental health, isolation site, and medication after discharge. RESULTS: There were 852 males and 886 females in the cohort. The average age of the patients was 48.8 y. A total of 79.98% of the patients were from Wuhan, Hubei Province. The most common initial symptoms were fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Among all the patients, 1463 had complications, with respiratory distress as the most common complication. The average duration of hospitalization was 15.95  14.69 d. The most common postdischarge symptom is cough. After discharge, most patients were full of energy and chose hotel as their self-isolation site.

Further, a hallmark symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection is shortness of breath, even at rest, which may be exaggerated during periods of exertion. However, the lasting effects of COVID-19 on quantitative measures of exertional breathlessness in otherwise healthy individuals is unknown. Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine the sensory and affective dimensions of exertional dyspnea (i.e., shortness of breath during exercise) in otherwise healthy, young adults who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 over a period of three months. Methods Otherwise healthy, young adults (4M/3F, age: 21  1 y, body mass index: 24.11.4 kg?m-2, aerobic fitness: 35.7 11.3 mLkg-1min-1) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 completed an incremental exercise test to voluntary exhaustion on a cycle ergometer three-to-four weeks after the positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (BL), as well as one and two months following baseline testing (1M and 2M, respectively). Subjective ratings of perceived breathlessness (RPB) and unpleasantness of breathing (RPU) were collected at rest and during each stage of exercise. Following exercise completion, subjects rated the unpleasantness and accompanying negative emotions (depression, anxiety, frustration, anger, and fear) associated with their exertional dyspnea using a visual analog scale (VAS). Results RPB at rest, during cycling at 60W, and at peak exercise were similar across visits (p &gt; 0.05). RPB during cycling at 120W tended to decrease across time (BL: 2.90.9;1M: 2.11.1;2M: 2.01.4;p = 0.06). RPU at rest, during cycling at 60W, 120W, and at peak exercise were not different between visits (p &gt; 0.05). VAS ratings of anxiety (BL: 1.82.1 cm;1M: 3.13.2 cm;2M: 0.80.7 cm;p = 0.05), but not those of depression, unpleasantness, anger, frustration, or fear differed across visits (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion These data suggest that the sensory dimension of exertional dyspnea during moderate intensity exercise improves (i.e., decreases) during recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, the affective dimension of exertional dyspnea appears to be largely maintained throughout recovery, as only anxious emotions related to exertional dyspnea fluctuated over the three-month time period.","output":"Evaluation of Exertional Dyspnea During Recovery From SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Young Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may be a useful treatment strategy for patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia but its effectiveness in preventing mechanical ventilation is unknown We aimed to evaluate the outcomes of COVID-19 patients treated with CPAP and determine predictors of CPAP response Methods This was a retrospective observational cohort study which took place in the intensive care unit at Royal Papworth Hospital (RPH) in Cambridge, UK We included all consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia who were transferred from neighbouring hospitals between 14th March and 6th May, 2020 for consideration of ventilatory support We instituted the use of CPAP for all patients who arrived in RPH not intubated and were not making satisfactory progress on supplemental oxygen alone Results Of 33 self-ventilating patients included in this study, 22 (66 7%) were male and the mean age was 5413 23 patients received CPAP They were more hypoxaemic than those treated with oxygen alone (PaO2/FiO2 ratio;84 319 0 vs 170 046 0 mmHg, p= 0 001) There was a significant improvement in PaO2/FiO2 ratio 1-2 hours after CPAP initiation (167 449 0 from 84 319 0 mmHg, p= 0 001) with no indication that CPAP augmented minute ventilation (pH actually fell from 7 480 04 to 7 450 04, p=0 000 and PaCO2 increased from 4 550 78 mmHg to 4 880 83 mmHg, p=0 001) 14 (61%) patients responded to CPAP and 9 required intubation There was no difference between these two groups in terms of the severity of baseline hypoxaemia but CPAP responders had significantly lower C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and D-dimer (see table 1) CT pulmonary angiogram was performed in 6 out of 9 intubated patients and demonstrated pulmonary emboli in 5 of them All patients were discharged from ICU and there were no fatalities Conclusions In this cohort, CPAP was an effective treatment modality to improve hypoxaemia and prevent invasive ventilation in a substantial proportion of patients with severe respiratory failure Accepting the small sample size, we also found that raised biomarkers of inflammation (CRP and IL-6) and coagulopathy (D-Dimer) to be more useful predictors of CPAP responsiveness than the severity of hypoxaemia, and could help to guide intubation decisions in this clinical setting","output":"Positive role of continuous positive Airway pressure for intensive care unit Patients with severe hypoxaemic respiratory Failure due to covid-19 pneumonia: A single Centre experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Social media chatter in 2020 has been largely dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing research shows that COVID-19 discourse is highly politicized, with political preferences linked to beliefs and disbeliefs about the virus. As it happens with topics that become politicized, people may fall into echo chambers, which is the idea that one is only presented with information they already agree with, thereby reinforcing one's confirmation bias. Understanding the relationship between information dissemination and political preference is crucial for effective public health communication. Objective: We aimed to study the extent of polarization and examine the structure of echo chambers related to COVID-19 discourse on Twitter in the United States. Methods: First, we presented Retweet-BERT, a scalable and highly accurate model for estimating user polarity by leveraging language features and network structures. Then, by analyzing the user polarity predicted by Retweet-BERT, we provided new insights into the characterization of partisan users. Results: We observed that right-leaning users were noticeably more vocal and active in the production and consumption of COVID-19 information. We also found that most of the highly influential users were partisan, which may contribute to further polarization. Importantly, while echo chambers exist in both the right- and left-leaning communities, the right-leaning community was by far more densely connected within their echo chamber and isolated from the rest. Conclusions: We provided empirical evidence that political echo chambers are prevalent, especially in the right-leaning community, which can exacerbate the exposure to information in line with pre-existing users' views. Our findings have broader implications in developing effective public health campaigns and promoting the circulation of factual information online.","output":"Social Media Polarization and Echo Chambers in the Context of COVID-19: Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zimbabwe currently faces several healthcare challenges, most notably HIV and associated infections including tuberculosis (TB), malaria and recently outbreaks of cholera, typhoid fever and COVID-19.

The purpose of the current study was to examine the effectiveness and acceptability of wearable activity trackers for promoting physical activity (PA) in older adults living in retirement communities. METHODS: Forty older adult participants (mean age = 85.4 years) used a wearable activity tracker (Fitbit InspireHR) for 12 weeks. Participants were provided with personalized activity goals and weekly feedback of PA during the 12 weeks. The main outcomes were daily step counts collected at baseline and the end of the intervention, and participants experiences of using the wearable activity tracker assessed after the 12-week intervention through an 8-item questionnaire and individual interviews. RESULTS: Participants used the activity tracker on 97.5% of measured days and had an average increase of 900 steps/day (p < 0.001). The Acceptance questionnaire revealed that the wearable activity tracker was acceptable, useful, and easy to use. Participants found that wearable activity trackers helped improve self-awareness and motivation of PA but reported a few concerns regarding the comfort of wearing the activity trackers and the ease of reading visual feedback. CONCLUSIONS: Wearable activity trackers lead to a small but significant increase of PA and are perceived as acceptable and useful in older adults. Given the rapidly growing older population, wearable activity trackers are promising tools that could be used in large-scale interventions to improve PA and health in older adults.

Trabectedin is currently being investigated as a potential adjunct to immunotherapy as it has been previously shown to kill tumor-associated macrophages. In this retrospective study, we sought to identify biomarkers that would be relevant to trials combining trabectedin with immunotherapy. We performed a single-center retrospective study of sarcoma patients treated with trabectedin with long-term follow-up. Multiplex gene expression analysis using the NanoString platform was assessed, and an exploratory analysis using the lasso-penalized Cox regression and kernel association test for survival (MiRKAT-S) methods investigated tumor-associated immune cells and correlated their gene signatures to patient survival. In total, 147 sarcoma patients treated with trabectedin were analyzed, with a mean follow-up time of 5 years. Patients with fewer prior chemotherapy regimens were more likely to stay on trabectedin longer (pairwise correlation = -0.17, p = 0.04). At 5 years, increased PD-L1 expression corresponded to worse outcomes (HR = 1.87, p = 0.04, q = 0.199). Additionally, six immunologic gene signatures were associated with up to 7-year survival by MiRKAT-S, notably myeloid-derived suppressor cells (p = 0.023, q = 0.058) and M2 macrophages (p = 0.03, q = 0.058). We found that the number of chemotherapy regimens prior to trabectedin negatively correlated with the number of trabectedin cycles received, suggesting that patients may benefit from receiving trabectedin earlier in their therapy course. The correlation of trabectedin outcomes with immune cell infiltrates supports the hypothesis that trabectedin may function as an immune modulator and supports ongoing efforts to study trabectedin in combination with immunotherapy. Furthermore, tumors with an immunosuppressive microenvironment characterized by macrophage infiltration and high PD-L1 expression were less likely to benefit from trabectedin, which could guide clinicians in future treatment decisions.","output":"Immunologic Gene Signature Analysis Correlates Myeloid Cells and M2 Macrophages with Time to Trabectedin Failure in Sarcoma Patients"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(O,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"doctor/11.md","filePath":"doctor/11.md"}'),R={name:"doctor/11.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
