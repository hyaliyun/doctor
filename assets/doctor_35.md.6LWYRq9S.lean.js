However, despite its high pathogenicity and transmissibility, the severity of the associated disease, COVID-19, varies widely. While the prognosis is favorable in most patients, critical illness, manifested by respiratory distress, thromboembolism, shock, and multi-organ failure, has been reported in about 5% of cases. Several studies have associated poor COVID-19 outcomes with the exhaustion of natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells, lymphopenia, and elevated serum levels of D-dimer. In this article, we propose a common pathophysiological denominator for these negative prognostic markers, endogenous, angiotensin II toxicity. We hypothesize that, like in avian influenza, the outlook of COVID-19 is negatively correlated with the intracellular accumulation of angiotensin II promoted by the viral blockade of its degrading enzyme receptors. In this model, upregulated angiotensin II causes premature vascular senescence, leading to dysfunctional coagulation, and immunity. We further hypothesize that angiotensin II blockers and immune checkpoint inhibitors may be salutary for COVID-19 patients with critical illness by reversing both the clotting and immune defects (Graphical Abstract).","output":"Intoxication With Endogenous Angiotensin II: A COVID-19 Hypothesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Small linear motifs targeting protein interacting domains called PSD\\\\95/Dlg/ZO\\\\1 (PDZ) have been identified at the C terminus of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) proteins E, 3a, and N.

Cox-regression analyses were used to determine associations between obesity (body mass index> 30), tumor (location, histology, Breslow-thickness, ulceration, mitotic rate, SLN-status) and patient-related variables (gender, age, and social-economic-status [SES]) and disease-free interval (DFI), melanoma-specific survival (MSS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Of the 715 patients, 355 (49.7%) were women, median age was 55 (range 18.6-89) years, 149 (20.8%) were obese. Obesity did not significantly affect DFI (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.98-2.00; p = 0.06), MSS (adjusted HR = 1.48;95%CI = 0.97-2.25; p = 0.07), and OS (adjusted HR = 1.25; 95% CI = 0.85-1.85; p = 0.25). Increased age, arm location, increased Breslow-thickness, ulceration, increased mitotic rate, and positive SLN-status were significantly associated with decreased DFI, MSS, and OS. Histology, sex, and SES were not associated. CONCLUSION: Obesity was not associated with DFI, MSS, or OS in patients with clinical stage IB-II melanoma who underwent SLNB.","output":"Obesity is not associated with disease-free interval, melanoma-specific survival, or overall survival in patients with clinical stage IB-II melanoma after SLNB"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction. The pathophysiology of infection with SARS-CoV-2 involves the lower airways and host-launched aggressive inflammatory responses leading to exacerbated lung damage in these vital tissues. Early clinical studies found that COVID-19 patients have higher levels of neutrophils in the circulation. Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocyte in circulation and are known to be highly proinflammatory due to production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETosis). NETs are web-like chromatin structures coated with histones and proteases that both capture and kill invading pathogens. However, while being an effective countermeasure towards foreign microbes, this process also causes undesirable damage in host tissues. Therefore, we sought to characterize NETosis in circulating neutrophils from COVID-19 patients to determine whether this immunological response might be exacerbating or driving the disease state in COVID-19, rather than mitigating the virus. Methods.Blood was drawn daily from critically ill COVID-19 patients (n=16) after consent was obtained. Healthy controls (n=13) were screened for COVID-19 and gave blood once a week. Blood was drawn into lithium heparin tubes (BD Vacutainer). Neutrophils were isolated using PolymorphprepTM(PROGEN) per manufacturer's instructions. Cells were resuspended at 2x106 cells/ml for functional assays. Neutrophils were stimulated with increasing concentrations of PMA (Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) of 2.5nM, 25nM and 250nM to stimulate NETosis via the canonical pathway, and nigericin at 15uM for the non-canonical pathway. NETosis was quantified using the Quant-iT? PicoGreen? dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen) and by NET visualization via myeloperoxidase and nuclear staining (using Polyclonal Rabbit Anti-Human Myeloperoxidase by Dako and Hoescht stain by Invitrogen). Results.Functional NETosis assays of circulating neutrophils from COVID-19 patients demonstrate overall increased NETosis determined by increased release of dsDNA. This enhanced NETosis occurred at baseline and after stimulation with PMA when compared to healthy controls (Figure 1A, p &lt;0.0001). Fluorescent microscopy also demonstrated increased NETosis in neutrophils from COVID-19 patients (Figure 1B;MPO-green and nucleus-blue). NETosis via the non-canonical pathway (induction with nigericin) was also increased in COVID-19 patients versus controls (p=0.02). Conclusions.Circulating neutrophils from critically ill COVID-19 patients are more prone to produce NETs than circulating neutrophils from healthy individuals. This is likely to lead to NETmediated tissue injury once neutrophils enter inflamed tissue, where they can potentially drive acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome, common causes of mortality in COVID-19. The finding of increased production of NETs by both canonical and non-canonical pathways is consistent with an overall hyper-activated state in COVID-19.","output":"Circulating neutrophils from critically ill covid-19 patients have increased netosis via canonical and non-canonical pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With massive spread of COVID-19 infection, people often experience anxiety symptoms and increased levels of anxiety.

However, no study has yet summarized the full body of evidence for the use of propolis and honey in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study systematically reviews the mechanisms of propolis and honey against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and current evidence for the use of propolis and honey in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Search strategy: A systematic search was conducted of electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library from their inceptions to April 2021. Inclusion criteria: Studies that evaluated the effect of propolis or bee products against SARS-CoV-2 using in silico methods, clinical studies, case reports and case series were included. Data extraction and analysis: A standardized data extraction form was used, and data were extracted by two independent reviewers. Narrative synthesis was used to summarize study results concerning the use of propolis or honey in COVID-19 prevention and treatment and their potential mechanisms of action against SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies were included. Nine studies were in silico studies, two studies were case reports, one study was a case series, and three studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In silico studies, using molecular docking methods, showed that compounds in propolis could interact with several target proteins of SARS-CoV-2, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the main protease enzyme, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and spike protein. Propolis may have a positive effect for clinical improvement in mild and moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients, according to case reports and case series. The included RCTs indicated that propolis or honey could probably improve clinical symptoms and decrease viral clearance time when they were used as adjuvant therapy to standard of care. CONCLUSION: In silico studies showed that compounds from propolis could interact with target proteins of SARS-CoV-2, interfering with viral entry and viral RNA replication, while clinical studies revealed that propolis and honey could probably improve clinical COVID-19 symptoms and decrease viral clearance time. However, clinical evidence is limited by the small number of studies and their small sample sizes. Future clinical studies are warranted.

The effectiveness of oseltamivir on COVID-19 suspected outpatients without hypoxia was evaluated. METHODS: A total of 16 COVID-19 suspected medical personnel and their cohabitation families without hypoxia, who came to the adult fever clinic from March to June 2020 were studied. All patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir) and antibacterial therapy together. RESULTS: Most of the infected patients were female (10, 63%), 1 had diabetes (6%) and 3 hypertension (19%). The median age was 45 years (interquartile range [IQR] 31-60 years). Oseltamivir administration made the temperature fall within 24a?h in part (10, 63%). Clinical data were compared between patients receiving early treatment (ET) with oseltamivir, initiated within 24a?h, and patients administered late treatment (LT), initiated after this time point. Duration of fever was shorter in the ET group than in the LT group (31a? 21a?h versus 94a? 38a?h; pa?< 0.001). The time from fever onset to treatment initiation correlated with duration of fever (ra?= 0.77; pa?< 0.001) and the time from peak to decline (ra?= 0.58; pa?< 0.05).

Mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients, including 19 cases of nucleic acid false-negative patients and 31 cases of nucleic acid positive patients, were enrolled. Their epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory examination data and imaging characteristics were analyzed. Risk factors for false negatives were discussed. Compared with the nucleic acid positive group, the false-negative group had less epidemiological exposure (52.6% vs 83.9%; P = .025), less chest discomfort (5.3% vs 32.3%; P = .035), and faster recovery (10 [8, 13] vs 15 [11, 18.5] days; P = .005). The number of involved lung lobes was (2 [1, 2.5] vs 3 [2, 4] days; P = .004), and the lung damage severity score was (3 [2.5, 4.5] vs 5 [4, 9] days; P = .007), which was lighter in the nucleic acid false-negative group. Thus, the absence of epidemiological exposure may be a potential risk factor for false-negative nucleic acids. The false-negative cases of COVID-19 are worth noting because they have a risk of viral transmission without positive test results, lighter clinical manifestations, and less history of epidemiological exposure.","output":"Clinical characteristics and risk factors of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients with false-negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive evidence on risk factors for transmission, disease severity and COVID-19 related deaths in Africa. DESIGN: A systematic review has been conducted to synthesise existing evidence on risk factors affecting COVID-19 outcomes across Africa. DATA SOURCES: Data were systematically searched from MEDLINE, Scopus, MedRxiv and BioRxiv. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies for review were included if they were published in English and reported at least one risk factor and/or one health outcome. We included all relevant literature published up until 11 August 2020. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We performed a systematic narrative synthesis to describe the available studies for each outcome. Data were extracted using a standardised Joanna Briggs Institute data extraction form. RESULTS: Fifteen articles met the inclusion criteria of which four were exclusively on Africa and the remaining 11 papers had a global focus with some data from Africa. Higher rates of infection in Africa are associated with high population density, urbanisation, transport connectivity, high volume of tourism and international trade, and high level of economic and political openness. Limited or poor access to healthcare are also associated with higher COVID-19 infection rates. Older people and individuals with chronic conditions such as HIV, tuberculosis and anaemia experience severe forms COVID-19 leading to hospitalisation and death. Similarly, high burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, high prevalence of tobacco consumption and low levels of expenditure on health and low levels of global health security score contribute to COVID-19 related deaths.

Methods: Twelve healthcare workers performed a cardiopulmonary exercise test while wearing a surgical mask, an N95 mask, or no mask. Variables were collected at rest, warm-up, anaerobic threshold, and maximal exercise. Results: From rest to maximal exercise, both the surgical and N95 masks decreased inspiratory flow, minute ventilation, and prolonged inspiratory time compared to the no mask condition. Oxygen uptake (VO(2)) and oxygen pulse (VO(2)/HR) decreased at rest, warm-up, and maximal exercise in both the surgical and N95 mask conditions (vs. no mask). At the anaerobic threshold, the surgical mask also led to a reduction of oxygen uptake and oxygen pulse compared to no mask. The maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2)% predicted) also decreased in both the surgical and N95 mask conditions. In addition, the severity of dyspnea increased, and exercise time decreased for both surgical and N95 masks. Compared to no mask, wearing an N95 mask led to lower breathing frequency and lower ventilation efficacy (assessed by VE/VCO(2) and VE/VO(2)) from rest to maximal exercise (all p < 0.05 for trend). Wearing an N95 also led to retention of carbon dioxide (p < 0.05 for trend). Conclusions: Wearing a surgical mask leads to a somewhat negative impact on cardiopulmonary function, and this effect is more serious with an N95 mask.

Yet, it is unknown to what degree these risk factors alone or in combination can accurately predict who is most at risk. It is also worthwhile to consider serological antibody titers to non COVID-19 infectious diseases, which may influence host immunity to COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective study of multicenter UK Biobank participants, as of May 26(th) 2020, all COVID-19 testing data was collected by Public Health England for older adult in- and out-patients (69.6  8.8 years). We used linear discriminant analysis with cross-validation and bootstrapping to determine the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of baseline data from 2006C2010 to predict COVID-19 infection and presumptive severity (i.e., testing at hospital). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to derive the area under the curve (AUC). FINDINGS: This retrospective study included 4,510 unique participants and 7,539 testing instances (i.e., test cases). Testing resulted in 5,329 negative cases and 2,210 positive cases, split into 996 mild and 1,214 severe disease outcomes. Baseline data including demographics, bioimpedance-derived body composition, vitals, serum biochemistry, self-reported illness/disability, and complete blood count. A randomized subset of 80 participants with 124 test cases also had antibody titers for 20 common to rare infectious diseases. Among all test cases, accuracy was modest for final diagnostic models of COVID-19 infection (70.2%; AUC=0.570, CI=0.556C0.584) and severity (58.3%; AUC=0.592, CI=0.568C0.615). In the serology sub-group, by contrast, final models predicted infection and severity with an accuracy of 93.5% (AUC=0.969, CI=0.934C1.000) and 74.4% (AUC=0.803, CI=0.663C0.943) respectively. Models included titers to common pathogens (e.g., human cytomegalovirus), age, blood cell counts, lipids, and other biochemical markers.

METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated adult COVID-19 patients who underwent chest CT, clinical scores, laboratory findings, and length of hospital stay. Two independent radiologists visually evaluated the pneumonia severity on chest CT (VSQS). Quantitative CT (QCT) assessment was performed using a free DICOM viewer, and the percentage of the well-aerated lung (%WAL), high-attenuation areas (%HAA) at different threshold values, and mean lung attenuation (MLA) values were calculated. The relationship between CT scores and the clinical, laboratory data, and length of hospital stay were evaluated in this cross-sectional study. The student's t-test and chi-square test were used to analyze the differences between variables. The Pearson correlation test analyzed the correlation between variables.

This has resulted in the proliferation of several apps that used a variety of technologies. With the absence of a standardized approach used by the authorities, policy makers, and developers, many of these apps were unique. Therefore, they varied by function and the underlying technology used for contact tracing and infection reporting. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to analyze most of the COVID-19 contact tracing apps in use today. Beyond investigating the privacy features, design, and implications of these apps, this research examined the underlying technologies used in contact tracing apps. It also attempted to provide some insights into their level of penetration and to gauge their public reception. This research also investigated the data collection, reporting, retention, and destruction procedures used by each of the apps under review. METHODS: This research study evaluated 13 apps corresponding to 10 countries based on the underlying technology used. The inclusion criteria ensured that most COVID-19-declared epicenters (ie, countries) were included in the sample, such as Italy. The evaluated apps also included countries that did relatively well in controlling the outbreak of COVID-19, such as Singapore. Informational and unofficial contact tracing apps were excluded from this study. A total of 30,000 reviews corresponding to the 13 apps were scraped from app store webpages and analyzed. RESULTS: This study identified seven distinct technologies used by COVID-19 tracing apps and 13 distinct apps. The United States was reported to have released the most contact tracing apps, followed by Italy. Bluetooth was the most frequently used underlying technology, employed by seven apps, whereas three apps used GPS. The Norwegian, Singaporean, Georgian, and New Zealand apps were among those that collected the most personal information from users, whereas some apps, such as the Swiss app and the Italian (Immuni) app, did not collect any user information. The observed minimum amount of time implemented for most of the apps with regard to data destruction was 14 days, while the Georgian app retained records for 3 years. No significant battery drainage issue was reported for most of the apps. Interestingly, only about 2% of the reviewers expressed concerns about their privacy across all apps. The number and frequency of technical issues reported on the Apple App Store were significantly more than those reported on Google Play; the highest was with the New Zealand app, with 27% of the reviewers reporting technical difficulties (ie, 10% out of 27% scraped reviews reported that the app did not work). The Norwegian, Swiss, and US (PathCheck) apps had the least reported technical issues, sitting at just below 10%.

Namely, we developed an algorithm for tools and hands localization as well as identifying the interactions between them based on simple webcam video data, calculating motion metrics for assessment of surgical skill. METHODS: Twenty-five participants performed multiple suturing tasks using our simulator. The YOLO network was modified to a multi-task network for the purpose of tool localization and toolChand interaction detection. This was accomplished by splitting the YOLO detection heads so that they supported both tasks with minimal addition to computer run-time. Furthermore, based on the outcome of the system, motion metrics were calculated. These metrics included traditional metrics such as time and path length as well as new metrics assessing the technique participants use for holding the tools. RESULTS: The dual-task network performance was similar to that of two networks, while computational load was only slightly bigger than one network. In addition, the motion metrics showed significant differences between experts and novices. CONCLUSION: While video capture is an essential part of minimal invasive surgery, it is not an integral component of open surgery. Thus, new algorithms, focusing on the unique challenges open surgery videos present, are required. In this study, a dual-task network was developed to solve both a localization task and a handCtool interaction task. The dual network may be easily expanded to a multi-task network, which may be useful for images with multiple layers and for evaluating the interaction between these different layers.

For men and women, increased frequency of drinking was associated with being less likely to believe alcohol drinking would lead to greater chance of catching COVID-19 (men: OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.98, 1.00; women: OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.99, 1.00) and deterioration in psychological wellbeing (OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.04, 1.54; OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.11, 1.51); increased unit consumption was associated with deterioration in financial situation (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.21, 1.86; OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.64) and physical health (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.67; OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.31, 2.10). Finally, increases in the frequency of HED were associated with deterioration in psychological wellbeing (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.25, 2.18; OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.17, 1.82) and being furloughed (OR = 3.25, 95% CI = 1.80, 5.86; OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.19, 3.56). Other gender differences were detected, for example, living with children was associated with an increase in units consumed (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.09, 2.73) and the frequency of HED (OR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.44, 3.99) for men, but not women. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: In this self-selected UK sample, a significant proportion of individuals reported drinking more frequently in lockdown, drinking more units per drinking occasion and more frequent HED. There were consistent predictors of increased consumption across men and women, but other gender differences were detected. This study identifies groups that may require targeted support in future lockdowns.","output":"Characterising the patterns of and factors associated with increased alcohol consumption since COVID-19 in a UK sample"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has led to the global COVID-19 pandemic and a lockdown was introduced in Ukraine in March 2020.

The present study is concerned with the genetic discrimination of fifteen alfalfa cultivars from three different countries (Egypt, Australia, and USA) using two molecular approaches: inter-retrotransposon-amplified polymorphism (IRAP) markers and two chloroplast DNA barcodes matK and the trnH in addition to the analysis of fifteen morpho-agronomic traits. The genetic relatedness, based on analysis of IRAP marker polymorphism and produced using eleven primers by clustering via principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate heatmap biostatistical methods differentiated the two Egyptian cultivars EGY1-Ismailia1 and EGY2-Nubaria1 from the three Australian and seven American cultivars, with some distinction of the cv. USA6-SW9720 and cv. AUS4-SuperFast. The results were also supported by the sequence analysis of the matK and the trnH genes on the genetic relatedness between eight cultivars. Moreover, it might be suggested that breeding lines from M. sativa cultivars may provide novel insights and a better understanding of the domestication of M. sativa genetic diversity. The classification of the eight cultivars, as revealed by morpho-agronomic traits, confirmed the close genetic relationship between the two Egyptian cultivars and indicated some resemblance between them and the AUS2-Siri Nafa, whereas the two American cultivars, USA1-Super supreme and USA4-Cuf101, were clearly isolated from a cluster of other three cultivars USA7-SW9628, USA8-Magna901, and USA9-Perfect.

COVID-19 has caused widespread anxiety, which at healthy levels leads to adaptive, protective behavioral changes. For some individuals, a pandemic outbreak can lead to excessive, maladaptive levels of anxiety, particularly among those with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and health anxiety. In the present paper, we review past research studies that examined anxiety in response to other disease outbreaks (including Swine Flu, Zika, and Ebola) to serve as a guide for expectable responses to COVID-19. Our review focused on the role of belief-based cognitive variables (obsessive beliefs, contamination cognitions), transdiagnostic processes (disgust sensitivity, anxiety sensitivity, an intolerance of uncertainty), social factors, and environmental/situational variables as contributing factors to excessive concerns about past pandemics. These factors in combination with unique characteristics of the virus (disease, behavioral, social and economic factors) and media consumption might enhance vulnerability to excessive anxiety about COVID-19, in line with a diathesis-stress model. COVID-19 is also unique from past pandemics due to its severity, easy transmissibility, and the nature of prescribed behavioral responses (i.e., hand washing and social distancing). We therefore discuss the ways in which COVID-19 may disproportionately affect individuals with OCD and health anxiety. We conclude with important topics for clinical and research attention to help mental health professionals respond in this time of crisis.","output":"A Perfect Storm?

To prepare for public availability, the acceptability of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine and willingness to pay (WTP) were assessed to provide insights into future demand forecasts and pricing considerations. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 3 to 12 April 2020. The health belief model (HBM) was used to assess predictors of the intent to receive the vaccine and the WTP. RESULTS A total of 1,159 complete responses was received. The majority reported a definite intent to receive the vaccine (48.2%), followed by a probable intent (29.8%) and a possible intent (16.3%). Both items under the perceived benefits construct in the HBM, namely believe the vaccination decreases the chance of infection (OR = 2.51, 95% CI 1.19-5.26) and the vaccination makes them feel less worry (OR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.03-4.65), were found to have the highest significant odds of a definite intention to take the vaccine. The mean  standard deviation (SD) for the amount that participants were willing to pay for a dose of COVID-19 vaccine was MYR$134.0 (SD79.2) [US$30.66  18.12]. Most of the participants were willing to pay an amount of MYR$100 [US$23] (28.9%) and MYR$50 [US$11.5] (27.2%) for the vaccine. The higher marginal WTP for the vaccine was influenced by no affordability barriers as well as by socio-economic factors, such as higher education levels, professional and managerial occupations and higher incomes.

This study aimed to compare the specificity and sensitivity of available triage systems for COVID-19 among trauma patients. Furthermore, it aimed to develop a novel triage system for SARS-CoV-2 detection among trauma patients in centers with limited resources. Methods All patients referred to our center from February to May 2020 were enrolled in this prospective study. We evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 triage protocols from the WHO, the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME), and the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) for their effectiveness in finding COVID-19 infected individuals among trauma patients. We then used these data to design a stepwise triage protocol to detect COVID-19 positive patients among trauma patients. Results According to our findings, the WHO protocol showed 100% specificity and 13.3% sensitivity. The MOHME protocol had 99% specificity and 23.3% sensitivity. While the ECDC protocol showed 93.3% sensitivity and 89.5% specificity, it did not prioritize patients based on traumatic injuries and unstable conditions. Our stepwise triage protocol, which prioritizes traumatic injuries, had 93.3% sensitivity and 90.3% specificity. Conclusion Our study shows that the triage protocols from the WHO, MOHME and ECDC are not best equipped to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals among trauma patients. In our proposed stepwise triage system, patients are triaged according to their hemodynamic conditions, COVID-19 related clinical states, and COVID-19 related laboratory findings.

An aptamer is a nucleotide sequence that screened in vitro by the technology named systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment technology (SELEX). Similar to antibodies, aptamers can bind to the targets with high specificity and affinity. Besides, emerging aptamers have many advantages comparing with antibodies, such as ease of synthesis and modification, having a wide variety of target materials, low manufacturing cost and easy flexibility in amending. Therefore, aptamers are promising in virus detection and anti-virus therapy. METHODS: Aptamers were selected by SELEX. Specificity, affinity and second structure were used to characterize the selected aptamers. Chemiluminescence was adopted to build an aptamer-based detection method for EV-A71. Cytopathogenic effects trial, the level of intracellular EV-A71 RNA and protein expression were used to evaluate the antiviral effect of the selected aptamers. RESULTS: Three DNA aptamers with high specificity and affinity for EV-A71structual protein VP1 were screened out. A rapid chemiluminutesescence aptamer biosensor for EV-A71 detection was designed out. The selected aptamers could inhibit the RNA replication and protein expression of EV-A71 in RD cells and ameliorate the cytopathogenic effects.

In this study, we employed whole-genome alignment and digital DNACDNA hybridization analyses to assess genomic linkage between 2019-nCoV and other coronaviruses. To understand the pathogenetic behavior of 2019-nCoV, we compared gene expression datasets of viral infections closest to 2019-nCoV with four COVID-19 clinical presentations followed by functional enrichment of shared dysregulated genes. Potential chemical antagonists were also identified using proteinCchemical interaction analysis. Based on phylogram analysis, the 2019-nCoV was found genetically closest to SARS-CoVs. In addition, we identified 562 upregulated and 738 downregulated genes (adj. P  0.05) with SARS-CoV infection. Among the dysregulated genes, SARS-CoV shared 19 upregulated and 22 downregulated genes with each of different COVID-19 complications. Notably, upregulation of BCL6 and PFKFB3 genes was common to SARS-CoV, pneumonia and severe acute respiratory syndrome, while they shared CRIP2, NSG1 and TNFRSF21 genes in downregulation.

METHODS: We conducted a cohort study in all consecutive adults ventilated for more than 48 hours admitted to a 22-bed medical intensive care unit during a 12-month period. Respiratory samples at the time of intubation were assessed by culture, by indirect immunofluorescence assay or by molecular methods in systematic tracheobronchial aspirates. Patients with a virus-negative respiratory sample at the time of intubation were considered unexposed and served as the control group. RESULTS: Forty-five viruses were isolated in 41/187 (22%) patients. Rhinovirus was the most commonly isolated virus (42%), followed byherpes simplex virus type 1 (22%) and virus influenza A (16%). In multivariate analysis controlling for the Acute Pathophysiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, patients with respiratory disorder at admission (adjusted odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.8C5.1; P = 0.12), with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma patients (adjusted odds ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.3C6.7; P = 0.01) and with admission between 21 November and 21 March (adjusted odds ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3C5.9; P = 0.008) were independently associated with a virus-positive sample. Among the 122 patients admitted with respiratory disorder, a tracheobronchial aspirate positive for respiratory viruses at the time of intubation (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.273; 95% confidence interval, 0.096C0.777; P < 0.006) was independently associated with better survival, controlling for the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and admission for cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. Among the remaining 65 patients, a virus-positive sample on intubation did not predict survival. CONCLUSION: We confirmed the pathogenic role of respiratory viruses in the intensive care unit, particularly rhinovirus. We suggest, however, that the prognostic value of virus-associated respiratory disorder is better than that of other causes of respiratory disorder.","output":"Epidemiology and clinical outcome of virus-positive respiratory samples in ventilated patients: a prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surfactant proteins A (SP-A) and D (SP-D) are soluble innate immune molecules which maintain lung homeostasis through their dual roles as anti-infectious and immunomodulatory agents. SP-A and SP-D bind numerous viruses including influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), enhancing their clearance from mucosal points of entry and modulating the inflammatory response. They also have diverse roles in mediating innate and adaptive cell functions and in clearing apoptotic cells, allergens and other noxious particles. Here, we review how the properties of these first line defense molecules modulate inflammatory responses, as well as host-mediated immunopathology in response to viral infections. Since SP-A and SP-D are known to offer protection from viral and other infections, if their levels are decreased in some disease states as they are in severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), this may confer an increased risk of viral infection and exacerbations of disease. Recombinant molecules of SP-A and SP-D could be useful in both blocking respiratory viral infection while also modulating the immune system to prevent excessive inflammatory responses seen in, for example, RSV or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Recombinant SP-A and SP-D could have therapeutic potential in neutralizing both current and future strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus as well as modulating the inflammation-mediated pathology associated with COVID-19. A recombinant fragment of human (rfh)SP-D has recently been shown to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Further work investigating the potential therapeutic role of SP-A and SP-D in COVID-19 and other infectious and inflammatory diseases is indicated.","output":"SP-A and SP-D: Dual Functioning Immune Molecules With Antiviral and Immunomodulatory Properties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Even though it is known that fear and poor sleep quality trigger emotional eating, whether fear and poor sleep quality are associated with emotional eating during the COVID-19 pandemic is not clear. This study aimed to evaluate the association of fear of COVID-19, sleep quality, and some sociodemographic characteristics with emotional eating during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: This cross-sectional descriptive study was completed with 495 participants in Turkey. The participants filled out a questionnaire that asked about sociodemographic characteristics, fear of COVID-19, nutritional behaviors, sleep quality, and self-reported weight and height through email or social media. RESULTS: The fear of COVID-19 score (: 0.090, p < 0.05) and sleep quality score (: 0.289, p < 0.001) were associated with the emotional eating score at the rate of 0.8% and 8.3%, respectively. The association of fear of COVID-19 with emotional eating disappeared when combined with various factors. The collective association of all factors, fear of COVID-19 (: 0.042, p > 0.05), sleep quality (: 0.246, p < 0.001), BMI (: 0.275, p < 0.001), age (: C 0.259, p < 0.001) and gender (: C 0.169, p < 0.001) were associated with the emotional eating score at the rate of 18.3%.

In analogy to broad-spectrum antibiotics as antibacterial agents, developing broad spectrum antiviral agents would buy us time for the development of vaccines and treatments for future viral infections. In addition to targeting viral factors, a possible strategy is to understand host immune defense mechanisms and develop methods to boost the antiviral immune response. Here we summarize the role of NAD(+)-consuming enzymes in the immune defense against viral infections, with the hope that a better understanding of this process could help to develop better antiviral therapeutics targeting these enzymes. These NAD(+)-consuming enzymes include PARPs, sirtuins, CD38, and SARM1. Among these, the antiviral function of PARPs is particularly important and will be a focus of this review. Interestingly, NAD(+) biosynthetic enzymes are also implicated in immune responses. In addition, many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 contain a macrodomain-containing protein (NSP3 in SARS-CoV-2), which serves to counteract the antiviral function of host PARPs. Therefore, NAD(+) and NAD(+)-consuming enzymes play crucial roles in immune responses against viral infections and detailed mechanistic understandings in the future will likely facilitate the development of general antiviral strategies.","output":"NAD(+)-consuming enzymes in immune defense against viral infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The health workforce is a key component of any health system and the present crisis offers a unique opportunity to better understand its specific contribution to health system resilience.

However, steroid administration in the setting of a viral respiratory infection can worsen maternal outcomes. Therefore, the decision to administer corticosteroids must balance the neonatal benefits with the potential harm to the mother if she is infected with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to determine the gestational ages for which administering antenatal corticosteroids to women at high risk of preterm labor with concurrent COVID-19 infection results in improved combined maternal and infant outcomes. Study Design A decision-analytic model using TreeAge (2020) software was constructed for a theoretical cohort of hospitalized women with COVID-19 in the United States. All model inputs were derived from the literature. Outcomes included maternal intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death, along with infant outcomes of death, respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, and neurodevelopmental delay. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were assessed from the maternal and infant perspectives. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine if the results were robust over a range of assumptions. Results In our theoretical cohort of 10,000 women delivering between 24 and 33 weeks of gestation with COVID-19, corticosteroid administration resulted in 2,200 women admitted to the ICU and 110 maternal deaths. No antenatal corticosteroid use resulted in 1,500 ICU admissions and 75 maternal deaths. Overall, we found that corticosteroid administration resulted in higher combined QALYs up to 31 weeks of gestation in all hospitalized patients, and up to 29 weeks of gestation in ICU patients. Conclusion Administration of antenatal corticosteroids at less than 32 weeks of gestation for hospitalized patients and less than 30 weeks of gestation for patients admitted to the ICU resulted in higher combined maternal and infant outcomes compared with expectant management for women at high risk of preterm birth with COVID-19 infection. These results can guide clinicians in their counseling and management of these pregnant women. Key Points: Antenatal steroids reduce adverse neonatal outcomes.

The status of COVID-19 hospital acquired infections (HAIs) in low-income settings is unclear. We aimed to identify and summarize the existing evidence on COVID-19 HAIs amongst patients, prior to the rollout of vaccines in countries worldwide. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of English peer-reviewed literature in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus using a combination of selected search terms. Full texts articles presenting results on COVID-19 HAIs in hospitalised patients before the rollout of vaccines in countries worldwide were eligible. Data extracted from eligible articles included estimates of COVID-19 HAIs, country, and type of hospital setting, and was summarized narratively. Quality assessment of included articles was not possible. RESULTS: Literature searches generated a total of 5920 articles, and 45 were eligible for analysis. Eligible articles were from Europe, North America, Asia, and Brazil and none were from low-income countries. The proportion of COVID-19 HAIs ranged from 0% when strict NPPIs were applied, to 65% otherwise. The estimates of COVID-19 HAIs did not differ by country but were lower in studies conducted after implementation of NPPIs and in specialized hospital settings for operative surgery. Studies conducted before the implementation of NPPIs or in long-term care and psychiatric wards often reported high estimates of HAI. Although there was no clear trend in general wards, those situated in academic hospitals managed to reduce HAI rates under strict NPPI protocols. Operative surgery settings, unlike psychiatric settings, effectively prevented COVID-19 HAI using tailored NPPIs. CONCLUSION: The available evidence shows a high risk of COVID-19 HAIs, the feasibility of preventing HAIs in different healthcare settings and the importance of appropriately tailored NPPIs. There were no data from low-income settings, therefore, it is unclear whether the reported NPPI approaches could be equally effective elsewhere. We recommend routine monitoring of COVID-19 HAIs in countries with low vaccination coverage, to identify and close gaps in NPPIs and understand gains made from vaccinating healthcare workers and hospitalized patients.

To test a proposed inactivation mechanism, media containing thiosulfate or bovine serum albumin (BSA) were put in impingers to quench and consume I(2) released from the filter. In direct plating experiments, treated filters presented significantly higher VREs than did untreated filters; however, collection in excess BSA decreased VRE by half and in thiosulfate the apparent VRE decreased drastically. No significant difference in infectivity of retained viruses on treated and untreated filters was observed at the same environmental condition. Conclusions: Evidence presented herein for competition by dissolved I(2) in infectivity assays supports a mechanism of induced displacement and capture of I(2.) It also requires that dissociation of iodine from the filter and capture of iodine by MS2 aerosols as they pass through the filter be factored in the design of the assessment methodology.

We used retrospectively collected data from the UCLA Health System in Los Angeles, California. We included all emergency room or inpatient cases receiving SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing who also had a set of ancillary laboratory features (n = 1,455) between 1 March 2020 and 24 May 2020. We tested seven machine learning models and used a combination of those models for the final diagnostic classification. In the test set (n = 392), our combined model had an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.87C0.96). The model achieved a sensitivity of 0.93 (95% CI 0.85C0.98), specificity of 0.64 (95% CI 0.58C0.69).

AREAS COVERED: Although our knowledge about the SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 is largely based on the very limited data, the information is growing rapidly. The renewed answers to the specific research questions concerning updating data not only reveal gaps for future research but also re-categorized our information. Here, we attempt to briefly discuss 10 important questions about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. EXPERT OPINION: Since our knowledge about different aspects of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be in its infancy and is rapidly changing, the provision of the right data is more difficult in this regard. However, we try to rely on results from more extensive research to answer the main questions about this new virus. Therefore, further studies, particularly in the context of the virus pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine development, are warranted.","output":"Ten challenging questions about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel Coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has developed a pandemic condition all over the world.

Since, the side effects of plant-derived compounds will be lower compared to synthetic/chemical drugs. The Main protease (3CLpro or NSP5) and endoribonuclease (NSP15) proteins are necessity for viral replication and its survival in the host cell. In the present study, in-silico approach of drug development was used to search for potential antiviral plant-derived compounds as inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 replication proteins. Eight plant-derived compounds of which the antiviral activity was known and available, and two reported drugs against SARS-CoV-2 selected for the molecular docking analysis. The docking results suggested that bisdemethoxycurcumin, demethoxycurcumin, scutellarin, quercetin and myricetin showed least binding energy, i.e., greater than -6.5 Kcal/mol against 3CLpro and endoribonuclease of SARS-CoV-2. Further studies of ADME-Tox and bioavailability of drugs were also performed that exhibited efficient parameters of drug likeness. Molecular dynamics simulation calculations were performed for the most negative binding affinity of the compound to evaluate the dynamic behavior,and stability of protein-ligand complex. Our findings suggest that these compounds could be potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease and endoribonuclease. However, further in-vitro and pre-clinical experiments would validate the potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 proteins.","output":"In-silico screening of plant-derived antivirals against main protease, 3CLpro and endoribonuclease, NSP15 proteins of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Head and neck cancer patients are at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection; surgery in them involves risk for patients, surgeons, health personnel, medical institutions and society, since it is associated with prolonged and inadvertent production of aerosols and emergency procedures that facilitate the breach of protective measures by health personnel.

The total amount of PPCPs (ranging from 2.61 to 1122 ng/L in water and 0.11 to 164 ng/g dry weight in sediments) were comparable to historical reports in Yangtze River basin, whereas the detection frequency and concentrations of ribavirin and azithromycin were higher than those of historical studies. The distribution of concerned drugs varied with space, season, media and water types: sampling sites located at WWTPs-river-estuary system around two hospitals (Regions L and J) usually had relatively high waterborne contamination levels, most of which declined in autumn; lakes had relatively low waterborne contamination levels in summer but increased in autumn. The potential risks of detected PPCPs were further evaluated using the multiple-level ecological risk assessment (MLERA): sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin were found to pose potential risks to aquatic organisms according to a semi-probabilistic approach and classified as priority pollutants based on an optimized risk assessment. In general, the COVID-19 pandemic did not cause serious pollution in lakes and WWTPs-river-estuary system in Wuhan City.

It focusses on urban mobility, or the dynamic movement of people in relation to crime risk. Moreover, it questions how to best measure this risk using an appropriate crime denominator. Building on the work of Sarah Boggs, this special issue contends that we need more than an appropriate denominator related to the type of crime we are measuring, for example violence based on the number of potential victims present (the exposed or ambient population), or the number of burglaries per households in an area, or the number of shoplifting offences per number of shops present. It argues that this denominator needs to be both crime type appropriate, and to be spatially and temporally appropriate. When considering urban mobility as flows of people, the challenge is that the denominator can not be considered as a fixed or static concept, and that we need to consider the dynamic denominator challenge. Indeed, crime hot spots which do not account for dynamic denominators may be misleading for resource prioritisation.

Markers of circulating progenitor epithelial cells and mechanisms for their trafficking remain to be elucidated. We demonstrate that a population of progenitor epithelial cells exists in the bone marrow and the circulation of mice that is positive for the early epithelial marker cytokeratin 5 (CK5) and the chemokine receptor CXCR4. We used a mouse model of sex-mismatched tracheal transplantation and found that CK5+ circulating progenitor epithelial cells contribute to re-epithelialization of the airway and re-establishment of the pseudostratified epithelium. The presence of CXCL12 in tracheal transplants provided a mechanism for CXCR4+ circulating progenitor epithelial cell recruitment to the airway. Depletion of CXCL12 resulted in the epithelium defaulting to squamous metaplasia, which was derived solely from the resident tissue progenitor epithelial cells. Our findings demonstrate that CK5+CXCR4+ cells are markers of circulating progenitor epithelial cells in the bone marrow and circulation and that CXCR4/CXCL12-mediated recruitment of circulating progenitor epithelial cells is necessary for the re-establishment of a normal pseudostratified epithelium after airway injury.

In-person teaching was replaced by distance learning, which was an unknown challenge for students. In this context, little is known about the perceived distress of nursing students and the relationship between psychological capital, perceived distress, and psychological stress. This study examined the relationship between psychological capital, psychological distress, and perceived stress, and the mediating role of psychological capital in the relationship between perceived stress and psychological distress among nursing students. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was conducted between January and December 2020 using a convenience sampling method involving 359 undergraduate and specialist nursing students at a tertiary hospital in Shandong Province. Standardised instruments were used to measure psychological capital, psychological stress, and perceived stress. We used SPSS 24.0 and PROCESS macro to analyse the data. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in perceived stress among students based on whether they liked the nursing profession (P < 0.01). Relative to nursing college students, undergraduates experienced significantly higher levels of perceived stress (P < 0.01). Nevertheless, there were no significant differences in perceived stress according to gender, place of residence, and being an only child. Psychological distress was positively correlated (r = 0.632, p < 0.001) with perceived stress (r =-0.662, p < 0.001), whereas it was negatively correlated with psychological capital. Psychological capital played a potential mediating role in the relationship between psychological distress and perceived stress. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological distress was negatively correlated with psychological capital, and positively correlated with perceived stress. Mediation analyses indicated that psychological capital partially mediated the relationship between perceived stress and psychological distress. Educators should therefore heed students perceived stress and develop appropriate mental health counselling programmes for students in the curriculum that could help them reduce their psychological distress. In clinical practice, nursing managers must take effective measures, such as skills training, to improve the psychological capital of nursing students and reduce the negative impact of their psychological distress.","output":"The mediating effect of psychological capital on the relationship between psychological stress and distress among chinese nursing students: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: The Australian Treatment Outcomes Profile (ATOP) is a brief clinical tool measuring recent substance use, health and wellbeing among clients attending alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment services.

DESIGN AND METHODS: We recruited a sample of 107 AOD clients across public sector specialist AOD treatment services in New South Wales, Australia between 2016 and 2018. Participants had a mean age of 47 years and 46% were female. Participants completed a face-to-face ATOP and a phone ATOP with a researcher within 5 days. Comparisons between the two administration modes were undertaken using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for continuous or ordinal variables, and Cohen's Kappa for nominal variables.

Nineteen medical students who completed their fifth-year medical curriculum and 23 age- and sex-matched nonmedical students participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Inside a brain scanner, all participants read empathy-eliciting scenarios while adopting either the patient or doctor perspective. Brain activation and self-reported ratings during the experience of empathy were obtained. Behavioral results indicated that all participants reported greater emotional negativity and empathic concern in association with the patient perspective condition than with the doctor perspective condition. Functional brain imaging results indicated that neural activity in the posterior superior temporal region implicated in goal-relevant attention reorienting was overall increased under the patient perspective than the doctor perspective condition. Relative to nonmedical students, medical students showed decreased activity in the temporoparietal region implicated in mentalizing under the patient perspective versus doctor perspective condition. Notably, this same region showed increased activity under the doctor versus patient condition in medical students relative to nonmedical students.

Two additional studies by the same first author were inspected as well C one that was published in the same journal and one that relied on the same dataset. Results: Seven manipulations and spins were identified, including inappropriate operational definitions, misrepresentations, and omissions that produced bogus results and might have concealed potential adverse effects of medications on COVID-19 outcomes. Without correcting for these distortions, it is therefore not possible to determine that ADHD increases the risk of COVID-19 and that stimulant medications reduce this risk. Conclusions: The manipulations and spins identified in this article may raise awareness to poor methodologies and biases that occur in the field of attention disorders, mainly due to the contaminating influences of the pharmaceutical industry.

As a result, many individuals have experienced a disruption in the frequency and type of their interactions. Given the importance of intergenerational transmission and intergenerational interaction for promoting language maintenance, and the importance of peer-to-peer interaction for promoting language shift, we ask how these abrupt changes necessitated by social distancing will affect language use and attitudes, specifically short- and long-term language maintenance or shift involving heritage languages. We examine principles of language maintenance and shift in the context of the COVID-19 lockdown for university students, people still involved in critical acts of identity creation. Here we describe a survey designed to learn how the lockdown is affecting young people's language ecologies and attitudes. Using both quantitative and qualitative interpretive methods, we document the experiences of over 400 students, focusing on changes in their perceptions of their language use and the causes of these changes.","output":"Disruptions due to COVID-19: using mixed methods to identify factors influencing language maintenance and shift"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study covers topical issues of digitalization of higher legal education in Russia. Even though the process of digital transformation of higher education (including law schools) was launched before the Covid-19 pandemic, it was the coronavirus that acted as a catalyst for digitalization of almost all spheres of public life. Universities were faced with the need to create a comfortable and high-quality digital information and educational environment as soon as possible, and many enterprises (including their legal departments) decided to switch for remote work due to the self-isolation regime, which triggered further digitalization of the legal profession. In turn, digitalization of the legal profession can affect the labor market, and, therefore, higher education, as universities must consider the needs of future employers. The authors applied both general methods and methodological techniques (analysis, synthesis, deduction, induction, etc.) and special legal methods (formal legal and comparative legal). While analyzing, the authors conclude that the potential digitalization of legal education is widespread, since it is not only about the use of digital technologies in education, but changing the content of legal education due to digital transformation of the legal profession.","output":"Digitalization of Higher Legal Education in Russia in the Age of Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fine particle fraction (FPF) is defined in general terms as the fraction or percentage of the drug mass contained in an aerosol cloud that may be small enough to enter the lungs and exert a clinical effect. An aerodynamic diameter of 5 m represents the approximate border between \\"fine\\" and \\"coarse\\" particles, but there is no universally agreed upon definition of FPF in terms of an aerodynamic particle size range. FPF alone does not adequately describe a heterodisperse aerodynamic particle size distribution, and it needs to be combined with another measure or measures indicating the width of the distribution. When determined using techniques specified in United States and European Pharmacopeias, FPF is measured by cascade impactors that have straight-sided ninety degree inlets through which air is drawn at a constant rate. It is not the purpose of in vitro tests to predict in vivo behavior, and FPF is primarily a measure of aerosol quality. Despite this, FPF broadly predicts the amount of drug from an inhaler device depositing in the lungs, but it systematically overestimates whole lung deposition and may not correctly predict the relative lung depositions for two inhalers of different types. The relationship between FPF and both drug pharmacokinetics and clinical response is incompletely understood at the present time, and more studies are needed to investigate these relationships. Modifications to impactor technologies, including inlets that mimic the human extrathoracic airways and the use of realistic breathing patterns, would be expected to improve the predictive power of in vitro tests for drug delivery in vivo.","output":"Fine Particle Fraction: The Good and the Bad"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Active case finding (ACF) of individuals with tuberculosis (TB) is a key intervention to find the 30% of people missed every year. However, ACF requires screening large numbers of individuals who have a low probability of positive results, typically <5%, which makes using the recommended molecular tests expensive. METHODS: We conducted two ACF surveys (in 2020 and 2021) in high TB burden areas of Lao PDR. Participants were screened for TB symptoms and received a chest X-ray. Sputum samples of four consecutive individuals were pooled and tested with Xpert Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)/rifampicin (RIF) (Xpert-MTB/RIF) (2020) or Xpert-Ultra (2021). The agreement of the individual and pooled samples was compared and the reasons for discrepant results and potential cartridge savings were assessed. RESULTS: Each survey included 436 participants, which were tested in 109 pools. In the Xpert-MTB/RIF survey, 25 (sensitivity 89%, 95% CI 72.8% to 96.3%) of 28 pools containing MTB-positive samples tested positive and 81 pools containing only MTB-negative samples tested negative (specificity 100%, 95% CI 95.5% to 100%). In the Xpert-Ultra survey, all 32 (sensitivity 100%, 95% CI 89.3% to 100%) pools containing MTB-positive samples tested positive and all 77 (specificity 100%, 95% CI 95.3% to 100%) containing only MTB-negative samples tested negative. Pooling with Xpert-MTB/RIF and Xpert-Ultra saved 52% and 46% (227/436 and 199/436, respectively) of cartridge costs alone. CONCLUSION: Testing single and pooled specimens had a high level of agreement, with complete concordance when using Xpert-Ultra.

The purpose of this study is to identify the causes of elderly poverty problems and to seek countermeasures. According to a systematic analysis of the economic difficulties of the elderly population that applies a socioecological model, the cause of elderly poverty is complicated by the specificity of the labor market and pension system in Korean society. This is compounded by the lack of a public support system that can overcome insufficient family care and a lack of individual preparation. To alleviate elderly poverty, this paper recommends three policy alternatives. First, a robust multipillar retirement income security system must be established. To secure a minimal retirement income for the elderly in poverty, who have been marginalized from the public pension system design, the basic pension should be raised for the bottom 70% of senior citizens. Second, in order to tackle labor market duality and early retirement, the seniority-oriented wage system should be reformed into a job-based wage system. Third, to minimize unemployment and promote quality among re-employment jobs, the government should strengthen vocational skills development by expanding programs tailored to older people.","output":"Inclusive Aging in Korea: Eradicating Senior Poverty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several studies investigating environmental navigation require participants to navigate in virtual environments, in which the proprioceptive and vestibular components present during real environmental navigation are lost. Here, we aimed to provide a novel computerized ecological navigational battery, investigating whether the absence of proprioceptive and vestibular inputs yields a representation of the navigational space comparable to that acquired ecologically. In Study 1, 38 participants underwent two sets of tasks, one performed in a laboratory-based setting (LBS) and the other in an ecological environment (EE), with both including evaluation of route, landmark, and survey knowledge and a landmark ordering task. All tasks, except the route task, significantly correlated between EE and LBS. In LBS, performance in the landmark ordering task was predicted by that in the survey task, but not by those in the route and landmark tasks. Results of Study 1 were replicated in Study 2, in which 44 participants completed a modified and shorter online version of LBS tests. Reliability of the online LBS tests was also tested and showed a moderate-to-high internal consistency. Overall, results show that the conditions in which tasks are performed affect the acquisition of route knowledge, likely due to the lack of proprioceptive and vestibular information in LBS. However, LBS tasks presented here provide a standard battery of tests that can overcome the replicability problems encountered by ecological navigation tests, while taking into consideration all the complexities of navigational processes in terms of the use of landmark, route, and survey strategies.","output":"Overcoming navigational challenges: A novel approach to the study and assessment of topographical orientation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The government of India imposed a strict nationwide lockdown on March 24, 2020, to arrest the spread of Covid-19 (1).

A recent surge in HAdV cases, including five deaths, amongst a haematopoietic stem cell transplant population led us to use whole genome sequencing (WGS) to investigate. Methods: To gain a complete transmission picture, we compared outbreak and non-outbreak sequences (54 sequences from 37 patients) with GenBank sequences and our own database of previously sequenced HAdVs (132 sequences from 37 patients). An improved bait set for WGS was used. Maximum likelihood trees and pairwise differences were used to evaluate genotypic relationships paired with epidemiological data from routine Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC) activity. Results: Nine monophyletic clusters were identified, seven of which were corroborated by epidemiological evidence and by comparison of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Two incomplete patient clusters were identified by IPC over the same time period. Of the five patients who died, one had a mixed HAdV infection and two were the source of transmission events. Conclusions: The clinical consequences of unmitigated HAdV transmission events are high. Focusing on two high risk wards using WGS we identified six transmission events, over prolonged periods, that would have gone unnoticed using traditional polymerase chain reaction and epidemiology. Mixed infection is frequent (10% of patients), providing a sentinel source of recombination and superinfection. Immunosuppressed patients harbouring a high rate of HAdV positivity require comprehensive surveillance. As a consequence of these findings, HAdV WGS is being incorporated routinely into a clinical algorithm to prevent transmission and influence IPC policy in real-time.","output":"Using Whole Genome Sequences to Investigate Adenovirus Outbreaks, Including Five Deaths in a Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reflections on challenges and promises of COVID-19 vaccine development show opportunities for innovation and collaboration between stakeholders.","output":"COVID-19 vaccines: challenges and promises of trials, manufacturing and allocation of doses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed stress on the health and well-being of both Chinese people and the public worldwide. Global public interest in this new issue largely reflects people's attention to COVID-19 and their willingness to take precautionary actions. This study aimed to examine global public awareness of COVID-19 using Google Trends. Methods: Using Google Trends, we retrieved public query data for terms of \\"2019-nCoV + SARS-CoV-2 + novel coronavirus + new coronavirus + COVID-19 + Corona Virus Disease 2019\\" between the 31st December 2019 and the 24th February 2020 in six major English-speaking countries, including the USA, the UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Dynamic series analysis demonstrates the overall change trend of relative search volume (RSV) for the topic on COVID-19. We compared the top-ranking related queries and sub-regions distribution of RSV about COVID-19 across different countries. The correlation between daily search volumes on the topic related to COVID-19 and the daily number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed. Results: The overall search trend of RSV regarding COVID-19 increased during the early period of observing time and reached the first apex on 31st January 2020. A shorter response time and a longer duration of public attention to COVID-19 was observed in public from the USA, the UK, Australia, and Canada, than that in Ireland and New Zealand. A slightly positive correlation between daily RSV about COVID-19 and the daily number of confirmed cases was observed (P < 0.05). People across countries presented a various interest to the RSV on COVID-19, and public awareness of COVID-19 was different in various sub-regions within countries. Conclusions: The results suggest that public response time to COVID-19 was different across countries, and the overall duration of public attention was short. The current study reminds us that governments should strengthen the publicity of COVID-19 nationally, strengthen the public's vigilance and sensitivity to COVID-19, inform public the importance of protecting themselves with enough precautionary measures, and finally control the spread of COVID-19 globally.","output":"More effective strategies are required to strengthen public awareness of COVID-19: Evidence from Google Trends"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Compensatory changes in energy expenditure occur in response to positive and negative energy balance, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Under low energy demand, the mitochondrial electron transport system (ETS) is particularly sensitive to added energy supply (i.e., reductive stress) which exponentially increases the rate of H2O2 (JH2O2) production. H2O2 is reduced to H2O by electrons supplied by NADPH. NADP+ is reduced back to NADPH by activation of mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT). The coupling of reductive stress-induced JH2O2 production to NNT-linked redox buffering circuits provides a potential means of integrating energy balance with energy expenditure. To test this hypothesis, energy supply was manipulated by varying flux rate through -oxidation in muscle mitochondria minus/plus pharmacological or genetic inhibition of redox buffering circuits. Here we show during both non-ADP and low-ADP stimulated respiration that accelerating flux through -oxidation generates a corresponding increase in mitochondrial JH2O2 production, that the majority (70-80%) of H2O2 produced is reduced to H2O by electrons drawn from redox buffering circuits supplied by NADPH, and that the rate of electron flux through redox buffering circuits is directly linked to changes in oxygen consumption mediated by NNT. These findings provide evidence that redox reactions within -oxidation and the ETS serve as a barometer of substrate flux relative to demand, continuously adjusting JH2O2 production and, in turn, the rate at which energy is expended via NNT-mediated proton conductance. This variable flux through redox circuits provides a potential compensatory mechanism for fine-tuning energy expenditure to energy balance in real-time.","output":"Flux through mitochondrial redox circuits linked to nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase generates counterbalance changes in energy expenditure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its foundation, Apidologie has steadily gained recognition as a journal that reports results from high-quality scientific research on the biology of bees, and this means Apidae in general, not only on its most prominent species, the Western honey bee, Apis mellifera.

This vaccine showed 94% efficacy in prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 disease in a phase 3 clinical study. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged, some of which have shown decreased susceptibility to neutralization by vaccine-induced antibody, most notably the B.1.351 variant, although the overall impact on vaccine efficacy remains to be determined. In addition, recent evidence of waning antibody levels after infection or vaccination point to the need for periodic boosting of immunity. Here we present the preliminary evaluation of a clinical study on the use of the prototype mRNA-1273 or modified COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, designed to target emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants as booster vaccines in participants previously vaccinated approximately 6 months earlier with two doses of the prototype vaccine, mRNA-1273. The modified vaccines include a monovalent mRNA-1273.351 encoding for the S protein found in the B.1.351 variant and multivalent mRNA-1273.211 comprising a 1:1 mix of mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351. As single 50 g booster vaccinations, both mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351 had acceptable safety profiles and were immunogenic. Antibody neutralization titers against B.1.351 and P.1 variants measured by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) assays before the booster vaccinations, approximately 6 to 8 months after the primary series, were low or below the assay limit of quantification, although GMTs versus the wild-type strain remained above levels likely to be protective. Two weeks after the booster vaccinations, titers against the wild-type original strain, B.1.351, and P.1 variants increased to levels similar to or higher than peak titers after the primary series vaccinations. Although both mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351 boosted neutralization of the wild-type original strain, and B.1.351 and P.1 variants, mRNA-1273.351 appeared to be more effective at increasing neutralization of the B.1.351 virus versus a boost with mRNA-1273.

METHODS Nineteen pediatric critical care and complex care attending physicians and nurse practitioners from a PICU in a tertiary, freestanding children's hospital in the Midwest completed a semistructured, qualitative interview. Transcripts were analyzed by using thematic analysis. RESULTS For both PICU providers and patients and families, participants described a negative overall impact of the pandemic, especially relating to increased stress and fear of contracting the disease. Disease precautions such as visitor restrictions and restricting movement were reported to be particularly stressful for families because they limited coping strategies (eg, in-person social support).

The study was aimed to explore the association between ivermectin prophylaxis and the development of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers. METHODS: A hospital-based matched case-control study was conducted among healthcare workers of AIIMS Bhubaneswar, India, from September to October 2020. Profession, gender, age and date of diagnosis were matched for 186 case-control pairs. Cases and controls were healthcare workers who tested positive and negative, respectively, for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. Exposure was defined as the intake of ivermectin and/or hydroxychloroquine and/or vitamin-C and/or other prophylaxis for COVID-19. Data collection and entry was done in Epicollect5, and analysis was performed using STATA version 13. Conditional logistic regression models were used to describe the associated factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Ivermectin prophylaxis was taken by 76 controls and 41 cases. Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis (AOR 0.27, 95% CI, 0.15C0.51) was associated with a 73% reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers for the following month. Those involved in physical activity (AOR 3.06 95% CI, 1.18C7.93) for more than an hour/day were more likely to contract SARS-CoV-2 infection.

To address the underlying etiology, we examined post mortem thoracic lymph nodes and spleens in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and observed the absence of germinal centers and a striking reduction in Bcl-6+ germinal center B cells but preservation of AID+ B cells. Absence of germinal centers correlated with an early specific block in Bcl-6+ TFH cell differentiation together with an increase in T-bet+ TH1 cells and aberrant extra-follicular TNF-&#945; accumulation. Parallel peripheral blood studies revealed loss of transitional and follicular B cells in severe disease and accumulation of SARS-CoV-2-specific \\"disease-related\\" B cell populations.

The MOP has been used in recent years in the fields of energy, climate change, and development studies. Public health practitioners involved with advocacy activities and creating alliances to amplify health promotion actions will be familiar with the general MOP concept if not the formal name. Methods: This paper introduces the MOP conceptual framework and customises it for a public health audience by positioning it among existing concepts and theories for actions within public health. Using two UK case studies (increasing signalised crossing times for pedestrians and the campaign for smoke-free legislation), we illustrate who middle actors are and what they can do to result in better public health outcomes. Results: These cases studies show that involving a wider range of middle actors, including those not traditionally involved in improving the public's health, can broaden the range and reach of organisations and individuals involving in advocating for public health measures. They also demonstrate that middle actors are not neutral. They can be recruited to improve public health outcomes, but they may also be exploited by commercial interests to block healthy policies or even promote a health-diminishing agenda. Conclusions: Using the MOP as a formal approach can help public health organisations and practitioners consider potential 'allies' from outside traditional health-related bodies or professions. Formal mapping can expand the range of who are considered potential middle actors for a particular public health issue. By applying the MOP, public health organisations and staff can enlist the additional leverage that is brought to bear by involving additional middle actors in improving the public's health.","output":"The Middle-Out Perspective -- an approach to formalise 'normal practice' in public health advocacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the spread of SARS-Cov-2, Germany imposed various restrictions, including the closure of schools on March 16 2020, and an extensive lockdown on March 23 2020. In this paper, we show how the influential simulation of the purported beneficial effects of this lockdown in Germany was based on wrong data, but nevertheless played a decisive role in shaping the future by allegedly producing evidence for the effectiveness of these measures, lending scientific credibility to policies. We point out that the evaluation of the success of such policies depends critically on data quality. Using publicly reported confirmed cases for the calculation of time series statistics is apt to produce misleading results because these data come with unknown variable time lags. Using data on incident cases, i.e., dates of the onset of symptoms, produces results that are much more reliable. Using this method demonstrates that previous analyses stating that the mitigation strategies of the German government were necessary and effective are indeed flawed.

To this end, a comparative analysis was conducted with a focus on the forms of participation and age of sport activity participants. For the final comparative analysis, a 2  3 factorial multivariate analysis of variance was conducted after confirming the validity and reliability of data based on 229 questionnaires collected from healthy respondents who have never been infected with COVID-19. The results showed statistically significant differences between worry about illness, which is a subscale of hypochondriasis, disease phobia, thanatophobia, and intent to continue according to age. Statistically significant differences were also found when considering the type of sport for worry about illness, which is a subscale of hypochondriasis, disease phobia, symptom preoccupation, and intent to continue. Furthermore, interaction effects between the two independent variables, i.e., age and type of sport, were found for disease phobia, a subscale of hypochondriasis, and thanatophobia. In summary, age and type of sport, which are important factors for the COVID-19 infection and symptoms, were found to affect the sport activity patterns. These results proved that COVID-19 may have caused the participants to have different perceptions depending on their characteristics and change their form of continuous participation. These findings will provide useful data for predicting the perception and behavioral patterns of sports participants if diseases like COVID-19 occur in the future.

This paper presents a detailed study of environmental evidence of possible airborne transmission in a hospital ward during the largest nosocomial SARS outbreak in Hong Kong in March 2003. Retrospective on-site inspections and measurements of the ventilation design and air distribution system were carried out on July 17, 2003. Limited on-site measurements of bio-aerosol dispersion were also carried out on July 22. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed to analyze the bio-aerosol dispersion in the hospital ward. We attempted to predict the air distribution during the time of measurement in July 2003 and the time of exposure in March 2003. The predicted bio-aerosol concentration distribution in the ward seemed to agree fairly well with the spatial infection pattern of SARS cases. Possible improvement to air distribution in the hospital ward was also considered. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS Our study revealed the need for the development of improved ventilation and air-conditioning systems in an isolation ward or a general hospital ward for infectious respiratory diseases. The outbreak in Ward 8A, which was in a general hospital and could house nearly 40 patients, demonstrated the cross-infection risks of respiratory infectious diseases in hospitals if a potential highly infectious patient was not identified and isolated. Our example simulation, which extended the SARS Busters' design for an isolation room to Ward 8A, demonstrated that there was room for improvement to minimize cross-infection in large general hospital wards.","output":"Role of air distribution in SARS transmission during the largest nosocomial outbreak in Hong Kong."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM OF STUDY Like other respiratory viruses, COVID-19 has extrapulmonary manifestations.

This is advantageous compared to bulk polymeric structures, as nanofibrils increase the area over which materials can be transported into and out of a system, via diffusion and active transport. On the other hand, since hydrogels possess a degree of flexibility very similar to natural tissue, due to their significant water content, hydrogels made from natural or biodegradable macromolecular systems can even be injectable into the human body. Due to unique interactions with water, hydrogel transport properties can be easily modified and tailored. As a result, combining nanofibers with hydrogels would truly advance biomedical applications of hydrogels, particularly in the area of sustained drug delivery. In fact, certain nanofiber networks can be transformed into hydrogels directly without the need for a hydrogel enclosure. This review discusses recent advances in the fabrication and application of biomedical nanofiber hydrogels with a strong emphasis on drug release. Most of the drug release studies and recent advances have so far focused on self-gelling nanofiber systems made from peptides or other natural proteins loaded with cancer drugs. Secondly, polysaccharide nanofiber hydrogels are being investigated, and thirdly, electrospun biodegradable polymer networks embedded in polysaccharide-based hydrogels are becoming increasingly popular. This review shows that a major outcome from these works is that nanofiber hydrogels can maintain drug release rates exceeding a few days, even extending into months, which is an extremely difficult task to achieve without the nanofiber texture. This review also demonstrates that some publications still lack careful rheological studies on nanofiber hydrogels; however, rheological properties of hydrogels can influence cell function, mechano-transduction, and cellular interactions such as growth, migration, adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and morphology. Nanofiber hydrogel rheology becomes even more critical for 3D or 4D printable systems that should maintain sustained drug delivery rates.","output":"A Review of Sustained Drug Release Studies from Nanofiber Hydrogels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In January 2020, the subclade 2.3.4.4h of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N6) virus infected migratory whooper swans and mute swans in Xinjiang, western China.

Almost 20% of women will elect surgical correction of this condition by age 85. Removal of the uterus (hysterectomy) with concomitant vaginal vault suspension is a long-standing practice in POP surgery to address apical (uterine) prolapse. Yet, contemporary evidence on the merits of this approach relative to preservation of the uterus through suspension is needed to better inform surgical decision making by patients and their healthcare providers. The objective of this study is to evaluate POP-specific health outcomes and service utilisation of women electing uterine suspension compared with those electing hysterectomy and vaginal vault suspension for POP surgery up to 1-year postsurgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a prospective cohort study planning to enrol 321 adult women with stage 2 POP from multiple sites in Alberta, Canada. Following standardised counselling from study surgeons, participants self-select either a hysterectomy based or uterine preservation surgical group. Data are being collected through participant questionnaires, medical records and administrative data linkage at four time points spanning from the presurgical consultation to 1-year postsurgery. The primary outcome is anatomic failure to correct POP, and secondary outcomes include changes in positioning of pelvic structures, retreatment, subjective report of bulge symptoms, pelvic floor distress and impact, sexual function and health service use.

The emergence of novel viruses is attributed to the status of co-existence of multiple types and subtypes of viruses in the reservoir hosts. For effective prediction of future viral epidemic or pandemic an in-depth understanding of the virome status in the key reservoir species is highly essential. METHODS: To obtain an unbiased measure of viral diversity in the enteric tract of ducks by viral metagenomic approach, we deep sequenced the viral nucleic acid extracted from cloacal swabs collected from the flock of 23 ducks which shared the water bodies with wild migratory birds. RESULT: In total 7,455,180 reads with average length of 146 bases were generated of which 7,354,300 reads were de novo assembled into 24,945 contigs with an average length of 220 bases and the remaining 100,880 reads were singletons. The duck virome were identified by sequence similarity comparisons of contigs and singletons (BLASTx E score, <10(?3)) against viral reference database. Numerous duck virome sequences were homologous to the animal virus of the Papillomaviridae family; and phages of the Caudovirales, Inoviridae, Tectiviridae, Microviridae families and unclassified phages.

DESIGN: Agent-based transmission model parameterized with disease-specific estimates, temporal sensitivity of nasopharyngeal (NP) and saliva testing, preliminary results of vaccine efficacy trials, and data from initial COVID-19 outbreaks in LTCFs in Ontario, Canada. SETTING: Characteristics of staff and residents were included in the model with age-dependent risk of hospitalization and deaths, calibrated to the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 reported in these settings. PARTICIPANTS: Synthetic staff and resident populations. INTERVENTIONS: Routine NP and saliva testing of staff; vaccination of residents and staff. MEASUREMENTS: Daily incidence and attack rates in the LTCF using large-scale model simulations; estimates of hospitalizations and deaths and their 95% credible intervals. RESULTS: Weekly routine testing of staff with 2-day turnaround time reduced infections among residents by at least 20.3% (95% CrI: 18.7C21.8%), compared to baseline measures of mask-wearing, symptom screening, and staff cohorting alone. A similar reduction of hospitalizations and deaths was achieved in residents. Vaccination averted 2C4 times more infections in both staff and residents as compared to routine testing, and markedly reduced hospitalizations and deaths among residents by 81.4% (95% CrI: 80.6C82.2%), and 82.1% (95% CrI: 81.5C82.7%), respectively. LIMITATIONS: Timelines of vaccine distribution and compliance rates with routine testing are key parameters affecting strategy outcomes.

Nearly half of the tools were used to define patient inclusion or exclusion in a study (48%, n = 50), followed by examination of a change after an intervention (26%, n = 27). Two articles attempted to study the validity of the MMSE and MoCA for screening patients with mild to moderate hearing loss and found mixed effects of the auditory components. There were no validation studies identified from the search. CONCLUSION Many different cognitive screening tools have been used to study patients with postlingual hearing loss. The effects of the auditory components of these tools may be deleterious but ultimately remain unclear from the available evidence. To date, there has been no validation of any cognitive screening tool to be used for adults with postlingual hearing loss.","output":"Cognitive Screening of Adults With Postlingual Hearing Loss: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Sick leave and turnover of nurses exacerbate an already existing nursing shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany and other countries. Frequency and associated factors of sick leave and intention to quit among nurses need to be examined to maintain healthcare. Methods: An online survey among nursing staff (N = 757) in German hospitals was conducted between May and July 2021. Sick leave days, intention to quit, working conditions, depression, anxiety and sleep disorder symptoms, effort-reward imbalance (ERI), COVID-19-related and sociodemographic variables were measured. Regression analyses were performed. Results: The intention to quit was present in 18.9%. One third (32.5%) reported sick leave of 10 and 12.3% more than 25 days in 12 months. Significant predictors for 10 sick leave days were infection with SARS-CoV-2, a pre-existing illness, exhaustion, trust in colleagues and fear of becoming infected. Higher ERI reward levels, perception of sufficient staff and contact with infected patients were associated with lower odds for 10 sick leave days. Lower reward levels, having changed work departments during the pandemic, working part-time and higher depression levels significantly predicted turnover intention. Conclusion: Alarmingly, many nurses intend to quit working in healthcare. Perceived reward seems to buffer both sick leave and turnover intention. Enhancing protection from COVID-19 and reducing workload might also prevent sick leave. Depression prevention, improved change management and support of part-time workers could contribute to reducing turnover intention among nurses.","output":"Sick Leave and Intention to Quit the Job among Nursing Staff in German Hospitals during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Standard precautions prevent the spread of infections in healthcare settings. Incompliance with infection control guidelines of healthcare workers (HCWs) may increase their risk of exposure to infectious disease, especially under pandemics. The purpose of this study was to assess the level of compliance with the infection prevention and control practices among HCWs in different healthcare settings and its relationship with their views on workplace infection control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Nurses in Hong Kong were invited to respond to a cross-sectional online survey, in which their views on workplace infection and prevention policy, compliance with standard precautions and self-reported health during pandemics were collected. Results: The respondents were dissatisfied with workplace infection and prevention policy in terms of comprehensiveness (62%), clarity (64%), timeliness (63%), and transparency (60%). For the protective behavior, the respondents did not fully comply with the standard precautions when they were involved in medical care. Their compliance was relatively low when having proper patient handling (54%) and performing invasive procedures (46%). A multivariate analysis model proved that the level of compliance of the standard precautions was positively associated with the satisfaction on infection control and prevention policy among high risk group (0.020; 95% CI: 0.005-0.036), while older respondents had higher level of compliance among the inpatient and outpatient groups (coefficient range: 0.065-0.076). The higher level of compliance was also significantly associated with working in designated team and having chronic condition of the respondents among high-risk and inpatient groups. Conclusions: Standard precautions are the most important elements to reduce cross-transmission among HCWs and patients while the satisfaction on infection control and prevention policy would increase the compliance among the high-risk group.

We highlight the main issues surrounding molecular diagnosis of COVID-19, including false negatives from the detection of viral RNA, temporal variations of viral loads, selection and treatment of specimens, and limiting factors in detecting viral proteins. We discuss critical research needs, such as improvements in RT-PCR, development of alternative nucleic acid amplification techniques, incorporating CRISPR technology for point-of-care (POC) applications, validation of POC tests, and sequencing of viral RNA and its mutations. Improved assays are also needed for environmental surveillance or wastewater-based epidemiology, which gauges infection on the community level through analyses of viral components in the communitys wastewater.

The vast majority of these cases are seen with mRNA vaccines especially in male patients under 30 years of age. Mechanisms are largely theoretical, but molecular mimicry and dysregulated innate immune reactions have been proposed.

Instead, we found that mice with iBALT exhibited delayed Th2 accumulation in the lung, reduced eosinophil recruitment, reduced goblet cell hyperplasia and reduced mucus production. The presence of iBALT did not alter Th2 priming, but instead delayed the accumulation of Th2 cells in the lung following challenge and altered the spatial distribution of T cells in the lung. These results suggest that the formation of iBALT and sequestration of effector T cells in the context of chronic pulmonary inflammation may be a mechanism by which the immune system attenuates pulmonary inflammation and prevents excessive pathology.","output":"Inducible BronchusCAssociated Lymphoid Tissue (iBALT) Attenuates Pulmonary Pathology in a Mouse Model of Allergic Airway Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has brought great challenges to healthcare resources around the world. Patients with COVID-19 exhibit a broad spectrum of clinical characteristics. In this study, the Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD)-based cluster analysis was applied to demographic information, laboratory indicators at the time of admission, and symptoms presented before admission. Three COVID-19 clusters with distinct clinical features were identified by FAMD-based cluster analysis. The FAMD-based cluster analysis results indicated that the symptoms of COVID-19 were roughly consistent with the laboratory findings of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, symptoms for mild patients were atypical. Different hospital stay durations and survival differences among the three clusters were also found, and the more severe the clinical characteristics were, the worse the prognosis. Our aims were to describe COVID-19 clusters with different clinical characteristics, and a classifier model according to the results of FAMD-based cluster analysis was constructed to help provide better individualized treatments for numerous COVID-19 patients in the future.","output":"Exploring the Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 Clusters Identified Using Factor Analysis of Mixed Data-Based Cluster Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is an international public health crisis. The risk of getting an infection with COVID-19 might impact the emotional well-being in patients with cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate quality of life (QoL) for patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey, including questions about demographics, concerns of COVID-19 impact on cancer treatment and outpatient clinic visits, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire was sent to patients with cancer at the Department of Oncology, Odense University Hospital, Denmark. The survey was open from 15th May to 29th May 2020, and 4.571 responded. Results were compared to the Danish 'Barometer Study' conducted by the Danish Cancer Society to elucidate experiences with the Danish healthcare system prior to COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 9% of patients with cancer had refrained from consulting a doctor or the hospital due to fear of COVID-19 infection, and 80% were concerned about contracting COVID-19 to some extent. Seventeen patients were tested positive for COVID-19. The mean global QoL and emotional functioning (EF) scores were 71.3 and 82.8, respectively. In comparison to the 'Barometer Study', no clinical significant differences in QoL and EF scores were observed. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that being 'Concerned about contracting corona-virus' was correlated with lower QoL and EF scores. Factors associated with being concerned of contracting COVID-19 were comorbid conditions, incurable cancer, receiving medical cancer treatment and female gender. CONCLUSION: Danish patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic did not have lower scores of QoL and emotional functioning compared to the Danish 'Barometer Study'. However, the study suggests that concerns of contracting COVID-19 was correlated with lower scores of QoL.","output":"Quality of life in patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic - a Danish cross-sectional study (COPICADS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the summer of 2020, a survey-based study was conducted at North Carolina State University, a land-grant university, to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on pre-veterinary students' ability to gain experience hours for Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) admissions.

Consequently, viruses recruit host ribosomes to translate viral mRNAs, typically using virally encoded functions to seize control of cellular translation factors and the host signalling pathways that regulate their activity. This not only ensures that viral proteins will be produced, but also stifles innate host defences that are aimed at inhibiting the capacity of infected cells for protein synthesis. Remarkably, nearly every step of the translation process can be targeted by virally encoded functions.

One of the main limitations of DGP research is the lack of isolation methods that are specific to interstitial cells, and therefore conducting functional studies is not feasible. The present study aims (i) to differentiate telomerase transformed mesenchymal stromal cells (iMSCs) into platelet-derived growth factor receptor--positive cells (PDGFR-positive cells) using connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and L-ascorbic acids; (ii) to investigate the effects of NO donor and inhibitor on the survival rate of differentiated PDGFR-positive cells; and (iii) to evaluate the impact of increased glucose concentrations, mimicking diabetic hyperglycemia, on the gene expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). A fibroblastic differentiation-induction medium supplemented with connective tissue growth factor was used to differentiate iMSCs into PDGFR-positive cells. The medium was changed every day for 21 days to maintain the biological activity of the growth factors. Gene and protein expression, scanning electron and confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry analysis of several markers were conducted to confirm the differentiation process. Methyl tetrazolium cell viability, nitrite measurement assays, and immunostaining were used to investigate the effects of NO on PDGFR-positive cells. The present study, for the first time, demonstrated the differentiation of iMSCs into PDGFR-positive cells. The outcomes of the functional studies showed that SNAP (NO donor) increased the survival rate of differentiated PDGFR-positive cells whereas LNNA (NO inhibitor) attenuated these effects. Further experimentations revealed that hyperglycemia produced a significant increase in expression of nNOS in PDGFR-positive cells. Differentiation of iMSCs into PDGFR-positive cells is a novel model to conduct functional studies and to investigate the involvement of NO pathways.

Health care professionals involved in the wheelchair service provision process require a specific set of skills and knowledge to enable wheelchair use that meets individual posture, mobility and daily living requirements. However, inconsistencies exist in academic programmes globally about providing comprehensive education and training programmes. The planned scoping review aims to review and synthesize the global literature on wheelchair service provision education for healthcare professional students, healthcare personnel and educators offered by universities, organizations and industries. METHODS This scoping review will be guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodological framework. Comprehensive literature searches will be conducted on various global electronic databases on health to seek out how wheelchair service provision education is organized, integrated, implemented and evaluated. Two independent reviewers will perform eligibility decisions and key data extractions. Data from selected studies will be extracted and analysed using conventional content analysis. Information related to wheelchair service provision education including curriculum development, content, teaching methods, evaluation and models of integration will be synthesized. IMPLICATIONS AND DISSEMINATION The planned scoping review will be the first to examine all aspects of wheelchair service provision education across professionals, settings and countries. We anticipate that results will inform the content of a Wheelchair Educators' Package, and if appropriate, a follow-up systematic review. An article reporting the results of the scoping review will be submitted for publication to a scientific journal. Implications for Rehabilitation A comprehensive examination of wheelchair service provision education could help develop strategies to address the unmet need for wheelchair services globally. Findings for this review will facilitate the planning and development of an evidence-based education package that could bridge the existing knowledge gaps related to safe and effective wheelchair service provision among health professionals involved.

Public health authorities are developing vaccination programmes with priorities that minimize the risk of mortality and severe events in individuals and communities. We propose an evidence-based strategy that targets the frailest subjects whose timely vaccination is likely to minimize future deaths and preserve the resilience of the health service by preventing infections. METHODS: The cohort includes 146,087 cases with COVID-19 diagnosed in 2020 in Milan (3.49 million inhabitants). Individual level data on 42 chronic diseases and vital status updated as of January 21, 2021, were available in administrative data. Analyses were performed in three sub-cohorts of age (16C64, 65C79 and 80+ years) and comorbidities affecting mortality were selected by means of LASSO cross-validated conditional logistic regression. Simplified models based on previous results identified high-risk categories worth targeting with highest priority. Results adjusted by age and gender, were reported in terms of odds ratios and 95%CI. RESULTS: The final models include as predictors of mortality (7,667 deaths, 5.2%) 10, 12, and 5 chronic diseases, respectively. The older age categories shared, as risk factors, chronic renal failure, chronic heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson disease and psychiatric diseases. In the younger age category, predictors included neoplasm, organ transplantation and psychiatric conditions. Results were consistent with those obtained on mortality at 60 days from diagnosis (6,968 deaths). CONCLUSION: This approach defines a two-level stratification for priorities in the vaccination that can easily be applied by health authorities, eventually adapted to local results in terms of number and types of comorbidities, and rapidly updated with current data. After the early phase of vaccination, data on effectiveness and safety will give the opportunity to revise prioritization and discuss the future approach in the remaining population.","output":"Strategy to identify priority groups for COVID-19 vaccination: A population based cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (the cause of COVID-19) uses PCR to detect viral RNA (vRNA) in respiratory samples. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in other sample types, but there is limited understanding of the clinical or laboratory significance of its detection in blood. Methods: We undertook a systematic literature review to assimilate the evidence for the frequency of vRNA in blood, and to identify associated clinical characteristics. We performed RT-PCR in serum samples from a UK clinical cohort of acute and convalescent COVID-19 cases (n=212), together with convalescent plasma samples collected by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) (n=462 additional samples). To determine whether PCR-positive blood samples could pose an infection risk, we attempted virus isolation from a subset of RNA-positive samples. Results: We identified 28 relevant studies, reporting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 0-76% of blood samples; pooled estimate 10% (95%CI 5-18%). Among serum samples from our clinical cohort, 27/212 (12.7%) had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by RT-PCR. RNA detection occurred in samples up to day 20 post symptom onset, and was associated with more severe disease (multivariable odds ratio 7.5). Across all samples collected 28 days post symptom onset, 0/494 (0%, 95%CI 0-0.7%) had vRNA detected. Among our PCR-positive samples, cycle threshold (ct) values were high (range 33.5-44.8), suggesting low vRNA copy numbers. PCR-positive sera inoculated into cell culture did not produce any cytopathic effect or yield an increase in detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA. There was a relationship between RT-PCR negativity and the presence of total SARS-CoV-2 antibody (p=0.02). Conclusions: vRNA was detectable at low viral loads in a minority of serum samples collected in acute infection, but was not associated with infectious SARS-CoV-2 (within the limitations of the assays used).

Additionally, we have no well-established guidelines for management of these patients during pandemic, in terms of treatment of 'cancer' and treatment of 'COVID 19'. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are given without any break in cancer patients to have better survival outcomes in daily routine. However, there is no well-established data to continue or delay ALK inhibitors in lung cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV2. Concomittant use of ALK inhibitors and COVID 19 antiviral treatment is a dilemma because of the lack of data in this area. CASE REPORT: A 47-year old female metastatic ALK positive nonsquamous cell lung cancer patient on alectinib, a second generation ALK inhibitor was diagnosed with symptomatic COVID 19. She was given favipiravir for COVID 19 while continuing alectinib.Management and outcome: The patient continued alectinib during COVID 19 antiviral treatment without any break. She tolerated 'concomittant' alectinib & favipiravir. She had partial remission after three months of alectinib without any dose adjustment despite active COVID 19 medication. DISCUSSION: To best of our knowledge, this is the first case who continued alectinib without dose adjustment during antiviral COVID-19 medication without clinically worsening. There is limited data about 'concomittant' use of TKIs and antiviral COVID 19 medication in the literature. There are some case reports, but they generally tended to delay or suspend TKIs during COVID 19 antiviral medication. Our case differs from them in terms of continuation of alectinib without any break or additional side effects during favipiravir for symptomatic COVID 19.

Experimental units were assigned to either a control (CON, n = 15) or a blend of essential oil supplementation (BEO, n = 14) treatment, maintaining a balance of genetic composition. The BEO was supplemented in the MR with 1 g/d/calf of a blend of essential oils (Apex Calf, Adisseo, China) composed by plant extracts derived from anise, cinnamon, garlic, rosemary, and thyme. During the pre-weaning phase, all heifers were fed 5 L of MR/d reconstituted to 15% (dry matter basis), divided into two equal meals. Water and starter were provided ad libitum. During the post-weaning, animals received a maximum of 3 kg of starter/d, and ad libitum corn silage, divided into two meals. Feed intake, fecal and respiratory scores were evaluated daily. The BW was measured every three days, while body development was recorded weekly.

An ANOVA procedure was used for continuous outcomes, and a non-parametric test was used for the ordered categorical outcomes, both adopting a CI = 95%. Results indicated that there was not enough evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis of the effect of BEO in MR on feed intake, performance, body development, and blood metabolites during both pre-weaning and post-weaning periods.

Similarly, the effect was significant for basophil (P  0.001), and platelet (P = 0.04) counts pre-weaning. The interaction between week and treatment was also significant for lymphocytes (P  0.001), revealing a cumulative effect. Lastly, fecal scores were also significant (P = 0.04) during pre-weaning, with lower values for BEO.

CCHFV causes a potentially severe, or even fatal, human disease, and it is widely distributed in Africa, Asia, eastern Europe and, more recently, in South-western Europe. Until a few years ago, no cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) had been reported in western Europe, with the exception of several travel-associated cases. In 2010, the CCHFV was reported for the first time in South-western Europe when viral RNA was obtained from Hyalomma lusitanicum ticks collected from deer in Cceres (Spain). Migratory birds from Africa harboring CCHFV-infected ticks and flying to Spain appear to have contributed to the establishment of the virus (genotype III, Africa-3) in this country. In addition, the recent findings in a patient and in ticks from deer and wild boar of viral sequences similar to those from eastern Europe (genotype V, Europe-1), raise the possibility of the introduction of CCHFV into Spain through the animal trade, although the arrival by bird routes cannot be ruled out (Africa-4 has been also recently detected). The seropositive rates of animals detected in regions of South-western Spain suggest an established cycle of tick-host-tick in certain areas, and the segment reassortment detected in the sequenced virus from one patient evidences a high ability to adaptation of the virus. Different ixodid tick genera can be vectors and reservoirs of the virus, although Hyalomma spp. are particularly relevant for its maintenance. This tick genus is common in Mediterranean region but it is currently spreading to new areas, partly due to the climate change and movement of livestock or wild animals. Although to a lesser extent, travels with our pets (and their ticks) may be also a factor to be considered. As a consequence, the virus is expanding from the Balkan region to Central Europe and, more recently, to Western Europe where different genotypes are circulating.

Methods An online questionnaire type of survey was conducted on a convenien ce sample of anonymous participants. The questionnaire, in Chinese (Mandarin), comprised 5 sections. Sections 1 to 3 included demographic, epidemical, and orthodontic status of the patients. Section 4 assessed the mental health related to orthodontics. Section 5 was the Kessler-10 mental distress scale. A total of 48 orthodontists were invited to distribute the questionnaires to their patients. Descriptive statistics, principle component analysis, k-means cluster analysis and bivariate logistics regression analysis were performed with statistical significance set at P<0.05. Result s: Questionnaires were collected from 558 patients (104 males, 354 females; age 24.78  6.33 years [mean  standard deviation]). The prevalence of mental distress was 38% (174/458).

STUDY DESIGN We collected serial MOM samples and pumped MOM volume data for 14 days postpartum in mothers who delivered at <33 weeks of gestation. Regression models and Mann-Whitney tests were used to evaluate associations. RESULTS Of 40 mothers, 39 (mean gestational age 28.8 weeks; 67% overweight/obese; 59% non-white) had paired MOM volume and biomarker data; 33% achieved CTV between days 6-14 postpartum. In univariate models, MOM Na on day 5 and Na:K ratios on days 3 and 5 were associated with CTV. Mothers achieving CTV were more likely to have postpartum Na:K ratios 1 on day 3 (75% vs. 25%, P = .06) and 0.8 on day 5 (69% vs 10%, p<0.01) compared with mothers not achieving CTV.

These data show that a large proportion of workers suffered a wage cut (60.93%) and temporary job suspension (31.6%), and the smallest proportion suffered job loss (7.47%). The results of the logistic regression show that lower frequency of outgoings to work, difficulties in accessing transport services and the loss of customer confidence have a strong negative impact on both wage cuts and temporary suspensions of work. The closure (total or partial) of activities has increasingly enhanced job loss. Further, the log of odds show that workers in private firms are more affected than their peers in public firms, and the middle-aged are the most affected group. So, it is recommended to revamp the old methods of activity into digital innovation that enables less physical touch and find an appropriate way to support those who have lost their jobs during this Covid-19 pandemic, particularly in the private sector.","output":"The adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the labor market in Cameroon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become the dominant health-care issue of this generation and has reached every corner of the health-care delivery spectrum.

This method enables high-throughput identification and isolation of low-frequency TCRs specific for any antigen. As a proof of principle, intracellular staining for TNF and IFN identified cytomegalovirus (CMV)- and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-reactive TCRs with efficiencies similar to state-of-the-art peptide-MHC multimer methodology. In a separate experiment, regulatory T cells were profiled based on intracellular FOXP3 staining, demonstrating the ability to examine phenotypes based on transcription factors. We further optimized the intracellular staining conditions to use a chemically cleavable primary amine cross-linker compatible with current single-cell sequencing technology.

Even before the 2014 Ebola outbreak, preventable harm was routinely felt by health workers, most visibly through the fatal collusion between the HIV/AIDS epidemic and tuberculosis (TB) infection in high endemic countries. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to examine the analyses of the health sector workforce by development and public health agencies regarding its sustainability, threats from workers personal health risks and discussion of protections to address those risks. METHODS: Development and public health agency reports assessing the sustainability of and threats to the health workforce both pre-and post the 2014 Ebola outbreak were examined with a focus on low and middle- income countries (LMICs). FINDINGS: Reviews of the health sector workforce have largely focused on its role as a necessary component of sustainable development. Hence, staff competency, numbers and productivity have been emphasized with little notice of the conditions of work and the highly hazardous environment contributing to worker out-migration, illness and death. CONCLUSIONS: Going forward, the 2016 World Health Assembly campaign to advance human resources for health and other UN efforts on health employment may offer some opportunities to address needed health worker protections.

AIMS AND/OR HYPOTHESIS To find out the safety of intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke patients who harbor unruptured intracranial aneurysms. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and cerebrovascular images of all the patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke in our center from the beginning of 2006 till the end of April 2014. Those with unruptured intracranial aneurysm present on cerebrovascular images prior to acute reperfusion therapy were identified. Post-thrombolysis brain imaging was reviewed to evaluate for any intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage related or unrelated to the aneurysm. RESULTS A total of 637 patients received intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke in our center during an 83-year period. Thirty-three (52%) were found to have at least one intracranial aneurysms. Twenty-three (70%) of those received only intravenous thrombolysis, and 10 patients received combination of intravenous and intra-arterial thrombolysis. The size of the largest aneurysm was 10 mm in maximum diameter (range: 2-10 mm). The mean size of aneurysms was 48 mm. No symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred among the 23 patients receiving only intravenous thrombolysis. Out of those who received a combination of intravenous and intra-arterial thrombolysis, one developed symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in the location of acute infarct, distant to the aneurysm location. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that neither intravenous thrombolysis nor combination of intravenous and intra-arterial thrombolysis increases the risk of aneurysmal hemorrhage in acute ischemic stroke patients who harbor unruptured intracranial aneurysms less than 10 mm in diameter. Their listing in exclusion criteria for intravenous thrombolysis should be reconsidered to assure appropriate use of acute reperfusion therapy in this group of patients.","output":"Is acute reperfusion therapy safe in acute ischemic stroke patients who harbor unruptured intracranial aneurysm?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The classification of whole slide images (WSIs) provides physicians with an accurate analysis of diseases and also helps them to treat patients effectively.

It is caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV), a novel Phlebovirus in family Bunyaviridae. Although the viral pathogenesis remains largely unknown, hemopoietic cells appear to be targeted by the virus. In this study we report that human monocytes were susceptible to SFTSV, which replicated efficiently, as shown by an immunofluorescence assay and real-time reverse transcription-PCR. We examined host responses in the infected cells and found that antiviral interferon (IFN) and IFN-inducible proteins were induced upon infection. However, our data also indicated that downregulation of key molecules such as mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) or weakened activation of interferon regulatory factor (IRF) and NF-B responses may contribute to a restricted innate immunity against the infection. NSs, the nonstructural protein encoded by the S segment, suppressed the beta interferon (IFN-) and NF-B promoter activities, although NF-B activation appears to facilitate SFTSV replication in human monocytes. NSs was found to be associated with TBK1 and may inhibit the activation of downstream IRF and NF-B signaling through this interaction. Interestingly, we demonstrated that the nucleoprotein (N), also encoded by the S segment, exhibited a suppressive effect on the activation of IFN- and NF-B signaling as well.

With the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a desperate need for treatment against the SARS CoV-2 virus. Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is one proposed medication that has received substantial public attention. However, the package insert states that these medications may provoke seizures in patients with epilepsy, and this has resulted in increased questions and anxiety in the epilepsy community. METHODS: PubMed (1970 to March 27, 2020) and the Embase (1970 to March 27, 2020) were searched with the terms chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine and seizure or epilepsy, convulsions, or status epilepticus. Selected studies were reviewed, and the adverse drug reaction was classified. RESULTS: Only eleven out of 31 studies were deemed eligible for systematic analysis. For chloroquine, eligible studies were- one prospective study(n = 109), two case series(n = 6), and six case reports. The dose of chloroquine ranged between 100-500 mg/day, except in one patient with a seizure, who was after taking 1000 mg. For hydroxychloroquine, there was one prospective observational study(n = 631) and one case report. The clinical trials failed to find any significant relation between seizures and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. CONCLUSION: Although the package insert describes an increased risk of seizure, the systematic review highlights that such a statement is not supported by class I studies. Clinicians, therefore, need to understand that data regarding this specific topic is limited to case series and case reports.

However, data are limited on public compliance with those guidelines in Sudan. Therefore, this study assessed face mask-wearing practice and technique during the COVID-19 pandemic among residents of Sudan. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from July to September 2021 among Sudanese aged 18 years. A web-based questionnaire was shared through different social media platforms. Personal characteristics, four knowledge-associated items, three attitude-associated items, one item concerning mask-wearing practice, and five items related to mask-wearing technique were determined. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariable analyses were performed using STATA v17. RESULTS: The survey included 1059 participants (48% males, 52% females) from different regions of Sudan. The overall mean  SD was 3  0.73 for knowledge of COVID-19 transmission; 2.3  0.71 for attitude toward wearing face masks; 0.38  0.49 for the practice of wearing a face mask; and 4.17  0.97 for face mask-wearing technique. Approximately one-third (38%) of participants always wore a face mask during the pandemic, with age, sex, education level, family income, face mask attitude, occupation, and history of COVID-19 infection affecting the practice. All steps of face mask-wearing technique were performed by 46% of participants (59% performed hand hygiene before putting on a mask and 86% after removing it; 98% covered mouth and nose; 90% adjusted masks at the nose bridge, and 84% tied masks securely), and associated with age, occupation, family income, history of COVID-19 infection, and face-mask attitude. CONCLUSION: Although knowledge and attitude were relatively good, the practice of wearing a face mask and using proper techniques among participants were low. To ensure optimal face mask use and proper mask-wearing techniques, educational intervention and establishing governmental regulations are highly recommended.","output":"Face Mask Practice and Technique During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Nonrepresentative Cross-Sectional Study in Sudan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the Netherlands, the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic had a significant impact on daily life, with two extensive lockdowns enforced to combat the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These measures included the closure of bars and restaurants, and the transition from face-to-face to online education. A survey was conducted among Dutch pharmacy students and PhD-candidates to investigate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on alcohol consumption, hangovers, and academic functioning. The analysis revealed a significant reduction in both quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 lockdown periods. This was accompanied with a significant reduction in hangover frequency and lower hangover severity during COVID-19 lockdown periods. The distribution of scores on academic performance showed great variability between respondents: while some participants reported impairment, others reported improved performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, or no change. Women reported that significantly more time investment was associated with maintaining these performance levels. Consistent among participants was the notion of reduced interactions with teachers and other students. Participants who reported more hangovers and most severe hangovers before COVID-19 benefited from the lockdown periods in terms of improved academic performance. Positive correlations were found between study grades/output and both the frequency and severity of hangovers experienced before COVID-19, suggesting that heavier drinkers, in particular, improved academic performance during the lockdown periods. In conclusion, COVID-19 lockdowns were associated with a significant reduction in both alcohol consumption and experiencing hangovers, which was, among heavier drinkers particularly, associated with significantly improved academic functioning.","output":"Transition to Online Education during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Impact of Changes in Alcohol Consumption and Experiencing Hangovers on Academic Functioning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads rapidly and widely in the world, which is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact with contaminated media In this study, SARS-CoV-2 was found to have a similar stability to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) by analyzing its survival time on different subject surfaces and main influencing factors in related research SARS-CoV-2 can survive for several days at various subject surfaces or media at room temperature (stainless steel: 2 days, plastic: 3 days, glass: 4 days, etc ), and SARS-CoV-2 can persist for longer time at low temperature and low relative humidity, which has caused severe threat to public health and has posed severe challenges to the prevention and control of COVID-19 According to available data, SARS-CoV-2 has the characteristics of high infectiousness and high covertness, similar to influenza A virus By understanding the survival potential and infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 in environment, targeted disinfection and effective protection can be implemented to reduce the incidence of COVID-19","output":"Survival potential and infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 in environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to analyse data from the marine pilots bio-sensor readings to determine how experience affects their biometrical response during the port approach.

Considered essential workers, ABA providers are exempt from government directives to close, so they have both the freedom and the great responsibility to make their own decisions about how best to keep their clients safe while continuing to provide medically necessary services. In the coming weeks and months, ABA providers will be faced with the decision about whether to reopen centers. This article does not address that decision, except to acknowledge the urgency to reopen, both to help clients and to remain solvent. Political rhetoric and contradictory public information further complicate this daunting decision. Because ABA providers do not have legal guidance to shift the burden of such decisions to local and state regulators, the burden is theirs alone. The unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic means that no decision is clearly wrong or right, and every decision has consequences. Although ABA providers do not have their own state guidance, many states have issued guidelines for childcare providers whose operations have continued throughout the pandemic.

Hardwood smoke was generated from an uncertified wood stove, burning wood of mixed oak species. Animals were exposed to clean air (control) or dilutions of whole emissions based on particulate (30, 100, 300, and 1000 micromg/m3). F344 rats, SHR rats, strain A/J mice, and C57BL/6 mice were exposed by whole-body inhalation 6 h/day, 7 days/wk, for either 1 wk or 6 mo. Effects of exposure on general indicators of toxicity, bacterial clearance, cardiac function, and carcinogenic potential were mild. Exposure-related effects included increases in platelets and decreases in blood urea nitrogen and serum alanine aminotransferase. Several other responses met screening criteria for significant exposure effects but were not consistent between genders or exposure times and were not corroborated by related parameters. Pulmonary histopathology revealed very little accumulation of hardwood smoke particulate matter.

Combining human data, mathematical and computational analysis of both spiking and mean-field models, we investigated the spectral dynamics of encephalographic (EEG) beta-alpha oscillations, observed in human patients undergoing general anaesthesia. The effect of anaesthetics can be modelled as a reduction of neural fluctuation intensity, and/or an increase in inhibitory synaptic gain in the thalamo-cortical circuit. Unlike previous work, which suggested the primary importance of gamma-amino-butryic-acid (GABA) augmentation in causing a shift to low EEG frequencies, our analysis demonstrates that a non-linear transition, triggered by a simple decrease in neural fluctuation intensity, is sufficient to explain the clinically-observed appearance - and subsequent slowing - of the beta-alpha narrowband EEG peak. In our model, increased synaptic inhibition alone, did not correlate with the clinically-observed encephalographic spectral changes, but did cause the anaesthetic-induced decrease in neuronal firing rate. Taken together, our results show that such a non-linear transition results in functional fragmentation of cortical and thalamic populations; highly correlated intra-population dynamics triggered by anaesthesia decouple and isolate neural populations. Our results are able to parsimoniously unify and replicate the observed anaesthetic effects on both the EEG spectra and inter-regional connectivity, and further highlight the importance of neural activity fluctuations in the genesis of altered brain states.","output":"Suppression of underlying neuronal fluctuations mediates EEG slowing during general anaesthesia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective(s) To evaluate the effectiveness of National Council on Aging (NCOA) evidence based fall prevention programs that can be completed in the home setting.

Study Selection Criteria were chosen to capture all studies that included NCOA fall prevention programs that can be implemented in the home setting. Inclusion criteria identified studies from peer-reviewed journals including NCOA fall prevention programs with elements allowing for individualized training and implementation. Studies with only community based, group provision were excluded. Data Extraction For articles included in this review, the following information was extracted: type of study, methodological quality review, level of evidence, number of subjects, outcome measures used, interventions, primary positive and negative results, and setting. Data Synthesis Four NCOA evidence based fall prevention programs were identified as appropriate to be provided in the home setting: CAPABLE, FallScape, FallsTalk and the Otago Exercise Program. Data extracted from included articles demonstrated improvements with falls efficacy, reduction in the number of falls, and increased recognition of fall risk.

We implemented and tested 13 spatial data-driven Bayesian network (BN) learning algorithms to examine the factors that determine the spatial distribution of COVID-19 transmission risk. All the BN models performed very well in predicting the COVID-19 cases as evidenced by low log loss (0.705C0.683) and high recall values (0.821C0.836). The tree-augmented na?ve (TAN) model outperformed all other BN learning algorithms. The proximity to major health facilities, churches, shopping centres and supermarkets as well as average annual traffic density were the strongest predictors of transmission risk during strict lockdown. After gradual relaxation of the lockdown, the proportion of the youth (15C40 years old) in an area became the strongest predictor of COVID-19 transmission in addition to the proximity to areas where people congregate, excluding churches. The study provides useful insights on the spatio-temporal dynamics of COVID-19 transmission drivers thereby aiding the design of geographically-targeted interventions.

It can be prevented and self-managed if expert support, such as education on lifestyle and treatment, is provided. Our aim was to conduct a process evaluation to investigate how ambulance staff and PWD perceived the Hypos can strike twice booklet-based ambulance clinician intervention, including acceptability, understandability, usefulness, positive or negative effects, and facilitators or barriers to implementation. METHODS: We used an explanatory sequential design with a self-administered questionnaire study followed by interviews of people with diabetes and ambulance staff. We followed the Medical Research Council framework for process evaluations of complex interventions to guide data collection and analysis. Following descriptive analysis (PWD and staff surveys), exploratory factor analysis was conducted to identify staff questionnaire subscales and multiple regression models were fitted to identify demographic predictors of overall and subscale scores. RESULTS: 113 ambulance staff members and 46 PWD completed the survey. We conducted interviews with four ambulance staff members and five PWD who had been attended by an ambulance for a hypoglycaemic event. Based on surveys and interviews, there were positive attitudes to the intervention from both ambulance staff and PWD. Although the intervention was not always implemented, most staff members and PWD found the booklet informative, easy to read and to use or explain. PWD who completed the survey reported that receiving the booklet reminded and/or encouraged them to test their blood glucose more often, adjust their diet, and have a discussion/check up with their diabetes consultant. Interviewed PWD felt that the booklet intervention would be more valuable to less experienced patients or those who cannot manage their diabetes well. Overall, participants felt that the intervention could be beneficial, but were uncertain about whether it might help prevent a second hypoglycaemic event and/or reduce the number of repeat ambulance attendances. CONCLUSIONS: The Hypos may strike twice intervention, which had demonstrable reductions in repeat attendances, was found to be feasible, acceptable to PWD and staff, prompting reported behaviour change and help-seeking from primary care.

Recent studies showed that AMPs perpetuate great potential that is not limited to antimicrobial activity. They are also crucial regulators of host immune responses that can modulate a wide range of activities, such as immune regulation, wound healing, and apoptosis. However, a microorganism's ability to adapt and to resist existing antibiotics triggered the scientific community to develop alternatives to conventional antibiotics. Therefore, to address this issue, we proposed Co-AMPpred, an in silico-aided AMP prediction method based on compositional features of amino acid residues to classify AMPs and non-AMPs. RESULTS: In our study, we developed a prediction method that incorporates composition-based sequence and physicochemical features into various machine-learning algorithms. Then, the boruta feature-selection algorithm was used to identify discriminative biological features. Furthermore, we only used discriminative biological features to develop our model. Additionally, we performed a stratified tenfold cross-validation technique to validate the predictive performance of our AMP prediction model and evaluated on the independent holdout test dataset. A benchmark dataset was collected from previous studies to evaluate the predictive performance of our model. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental results show that combining composition-based and physicochemical features outperformed existing methods on both the benchmark training dataset and a reduced training dataset. Finally, our proposed method achieved 80.8% accuracies and 0.871 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve by evaluating on independent test set.

Public health response includes a rapid reorganization of the Italian National Healthcare System in order to reduce transmission of COVID-19 within hospitals and healthcare facilities, while optimizing the assistance to patients with severe COVID-19 complications. METHODS: We analysed the actions that were taken in three ophthalmology centres in northern Italy during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and how these measures affected patients attendance. In addition, due to the rapidly evolving scenario, we reviewed the evidence available during the course of this pandemic. RESULTS: A full reorganization of ophthalmology services is mandatory according to current existing infection containment measures in order to continue dispensing urgent procedures without endangering the community with amplification of the diffusion chain. Ophthalmologists are considered at elevated risk of exposure when caring patients and vice versa, due to their close proximity during eye examination. High volumes of procedures typically generated by ophthalmologists with concurrent implications on the risk of infection are considered when re-assessing healthcare facilities reorganization. CONCLUSION: Containment measures in the event of pandemic due to infective agents should be well known by healthcare professionals and promptly applied in order to mitigate the risk of nosocomial transmission and outbreak.","output":"Infection control measures in ophthalmology during the COVID-19 outbreak: A narrative review from an early experience in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Die Pneumonie ist auch in unserer Zeit eine schwere Infektionskrankheit.

METHODS: Fifty-five patients following knee surgery with suspicion of IPBSN neuralgia were retrospectively included. Ultrasound reports were assessed for neuroma and postsurgical scarring (yes/no). Responders and non-responders were assigned following anesthetic injection of the IPBSN. The type of procedure (neurectomy/interventional pain procedure/other than nerve-associated therapy) and pain score at initial follow-up were recorded and patients were assigned as positive (full pain relief) or negative (partial/no pain relief) to therapeutic nerve treatment. Factors associated with a relevant visual analog scale (VAS) reduction were assessed using uni- and multivariate logistic regression models and chi-square for quantitative and qualitative variables (p  0.05). RESULTS: Responders (37/55) more often had an entrapment or an evident neuroma of the IPBSN (97% vs. 6%). A positive Hoffmann-Tinel sign (p = 0.002) and the absence of knee joint instability (p = 0.029) predicted a positive response of the diagnostic nerve block (90%; 26/29). In the follow-up after therapeutic nerve treatment, all patients with full pain relief showed neuromas or entrapment of the IPBSN. Patients negatively responding to therapeutic nerve treatment more frequently showed an additional knee joint instability (25% vs. 4%). CONCLUSION: Selective denervation for neuropathic knee pain is beneficial in selected patients with significant VAS reduction after diagnostic nerve block.

An example is the nervous system, which is adversely affected by decreased physical activity resulting in increased incidence of neurological problems such as chronic pain. We sought to better understand how this might occur by conducting RNA sequencing experiments on muscle biopsies from human volunteers in a 5\\\\week bed\\\\rest study with an exercise intervention arm. We also used a computational method for examining ligandCreceptor interactions between muscle and human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, the latter of which play a key role in nociception and are generators of signals responsible for chronic pain. We identified 1352 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in bed rest subjects without an exercise intervention but only 132 DEGs in subjects with the intervention. Among 591 upregulated muscle genes in the no intervention arm, 26 of these were ligands that have receptors that are expressed by human DRG neurons. We detected a specific splice variant of one of these ligands, placental growth factor (PGF), in deconditioned muscle that binds to neuropilin 1, a receptor that is highly expressed in DRG neurons and known to promote neuropathic pain. We conclude that exercise intervention protects muscle from deconditioning transcriptomic changes, and prevents changes in the expression of ligands that might sensitize DRG neurons, or act on other cell types throughout the body. Our work creates a set of actionable hypotheses to better understand how deconditioned muscle may influence the function of sensory neurons that innervate the entire body.","output":"RNA sequencing on muscle biopsy from a 5\\\\week bed rest study reveals the effect of exercise and potential interactions with dorsal root ganglion neurons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the frequently changing guidelines on Pregnancy care, management of obstetric patients remains a major challenge during COVID-19 Pandemic The department of Obstetrics and Gynecology had a huge responsibility to provide respectable maternity care to all women irrespective of their virologic status and at the same time protect the frontline warriors dealing with patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic We would like to share our perspective regarding the challenges faced and the solutions sought for, in both patient care and teaching and research [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Family Medicine & Primary Care is the property of Wolters Kluwer India Pvt Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"'How COVID 19 imposed a new normal outlook in reproductive health care of patients, research, teaching and assessment'- Perspective of a Gynecologist"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer patients experience high rates of chronic pain throughout the treatment process.

Other analyses included one-way analysis of variance and chi-square tests to assess relationships between years of experiences, primary work setting, and other relevant variables, as well as a thematic analysis of one free-text response detailing how respondents defined caregiver burden. Results: Respondents associated caregiver burden with physical, psychological, financial, and social strain, loss of personal time, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The most described theme (80%) was physical strain. Almost all respondents (92%) believed that caregiver burden is a prominent issue and reported using strategies such as education and training to reduce burden. Most respondents (86%) would consider adopting a standardized tool to identify caregiver burden. Common barriers to addressing caregiver burden were lack of tools, time, and expertise. Additionally, less than half of respondents reported being confident in their ability to appropriately refer caregivers for support (45%). Conclusions: Most SLPs interacted with caregivers and used strategies such as education and training within their areas of expertise to try and address caregiver burden.

All 26 (100%) participants successfully performed cricothyroidotomy in the introducer group, whereas only 24 (92%) participants were successful in the scalpel group. The introducer group required fewer attempts to access the trachea compared with the scalpel group (p = 0.046). False passages occurred eight (31%) times in the introducer group compared with 17 (65%) times in the scalpel group (p = 0.022). There were no statistical differences in tracheal trauma (p = 0.490), ease of use (p = 0.220) and device preference (p = 0.240). This novel cricothyroidotomy introducer has shown promising results in securing the airway in an emergency front-of-neck access situation. With robust training, this introducer could potentially be complementary to the scalpel-bougie cricothyroidotomy technique.","output":"Evaluation of a novel cricothyroidotomy introducer in a simulated obese porcine model: a randomised crossover comparison with scalpel cricothyroidotomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children.

The timing of oxygen therapy was considered to have a great influence on the symptomatic relief of hypoxemia and seeking medical intervention, especially in situations with insufficient medical resources, but the evidence on the timing of oxygen therapy is limited. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Medical charts review was carried out to collect the data of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed in Tongji hospital, Wuhan from 30th December 2019 to 8th March 2020. In this study, the appropriate timing of oxygen therapy and risk factors associated with severe and fatal illness were identified and the effectiveness of antivirus on disease progression was assessed. Among 1362 patients, the prevalence of hypoxia symptoms was significantly higher in those patients with severe and fatal illness than in those with less severe disease. The onset of hypoxia symptoms was most common in the second to third week after symptom onset, and patients with critical and fatal illness experienced these symptoms earlier than those with mild and severe illness. In multivariable analyses, the risk of death increased significantly when oxygen therapy was started more than 2 days after hypoxia symptoms onset among critical patients (OR, 1.92; 95%CI, 1.20 to 3.10). Compared to the critically ill patients without IFN-a, the patients who were treated with IFN-a had a lower mortality (OR, 0.60; 95%CI, 0.39 to 0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of oxygen therapy was associated with lower mortality among critical patients. This study highlighted the importance of early oxygen therapy after the onset of hypoxia symptoms.

Vaccines are critical tools to limit COVID-19 spread, but antiviral drug development is an ongoing global priority due to fast spreading COVID-19 variants that may elude vaccines efficacies. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 is an essential enzyme of viral replication and transcription machinery complex. Therefore, the RdRp is an attractive target for the development of effective anti-COVID-19 therapeutics. In this study, we developed a cell-based assay to determine the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp through luciferase reporter system. The SARS-CoV-2 RdRp reporter assay was validated using a known inhibitors of RdRp polymerase, remdesivir along with other anti-virals including ribavirin, penciclovir, rhoifolin, 5CT, and dasabuvir. Among these inhibitors, dasabuvir (FDA-approved drug) exhibited promising RdRp inhibitory activity. Anti-viral activity of dasabuvir was also tested on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 through infection of Vero E6 cells. Dasabuvir inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2, USA-WA1/2020 as well as B.1.617.2 (delta variant) in Vero E6 cells in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 values 9.47 M and 10.48 M, for USA-WA1/2020 and B.1.617.2 variants, respectively). Our results suggests that dasabuvir can be further evaluated as a therapeutic drug for COVID-19. In addition, our assays provide robust, target-specific, and high-throughput screening compatible (z- and z-factors of > 0.5) platforms that will be a valuable tool for the screening SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitors. Significance SARS-CoV-2 has caused a major public crisis world has seen in recent history. Development of vaccines and emergency use authorization of anti-virals are helping in reducing the burden of SARS-CoV-2 caused hospitalization and deaths. However, there is still need for optimal anti-viral(s) that can efficiently block viral propagation, and targeting viral polymerase (RdRp) is an among the most suitable targets for clamping viral replication. In this study, we developed a cell-based assay to screen potential compounds capable of blocking RdRp activity. The efficacy of our assay was validated by using already approved anti-virals, which reduced RdRp activity and slowed the replication of two SARS-CoV-2 variants (WA1 USA-WA1/2020 and B.1.617.2) in a cell culture model.

We retrospectively compared the clinical features of adult coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients without risk factors for severe COVID-19 who entered residential treatment centers (RTCs) before and after the delta variant outbreak. METHODS: We collected medical information from two RTCs in South Korea. On the basis of nationwide delta variant surveillance, we divided the patients into two groups: 1) the delta-minor group (diagnosed from December 2020CJune 2021, detection rate < 10%) and 2) the delta-dominant group (diagnosed during August 2021, detection rate > 90%). After propensity-score matching, the incidences of pneumonia, hospital transfer and need for supplemental oxygen were compared between the groups. In addition, risk factors for hospital transfer were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 1,915 patients were included. The incidence of pneumonia (14.6% vs. 9.2%, P = 0.009), all-cause hospital transfer (10.4% vs. 6.3%, P = 0.020) and COVID-19-related hospital transfer (7.5% vs. 4.8%, P = 0.081) were higher in the delta-dominant group than those in the delta-minor group. In the multivariate analysis, the delta-dominant group was an independent risk factor for all-cause (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16C3.13; P = 0.011) and COVID-19-related hospital transfer (aOR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.04C3.32; P = 0.036).

RESULTS: A total of 51 patients were included in the study (46 women, mean age at diagnosis of infection of 60 years). According to the number of patients with primary SS evaluated in the Registry (n = 8211), the estimated frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.62% (95% CI 0.44, 0.80). All but two presented with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, including fever (82%), cough (57%), dyspnoea (39%), fatigue/myalgias (27%) and diarrhoea (24%), and the most frequent abnormalities included raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (88%), CRP (81%) and D-dimer (82%) values, and lymphopenia (70%). Infection was managed at home in 26 (51%) cases and 25 (49%) required hospitalization (five required admission to ICU, four died). Compared with patients managed at home, those requiring hospitalization had higher odds of having lymphopenia as laboratory abnormality (adjusted OR 21.22, 95% CI 2.39, 524.09).

Consequently, the palm kernel cake has been proposed as an alternative raw material for animal feeds to reduce importation dependency. The chemical composition of palm kernel cake varies depending on the method of oil extraction. The crude fiber content of palm kernel cake is acceptable to most ruminants but is considered high for poultry. Biodegradation of palm kernel cake through solid-state fermentation can improve its nutritional quality, improving broiler health status and growth performance. ABSTRACT: Palm kernel cake (PKC), a by-product of oil extracted from palm nuts through expeller press or solvent extraction procedures is one of the highest quantities of locally available and potentially inexpensive agricultural product. PKC provides approximately 14C18% of crude protein (CP), 12C20% crude fiber (CF), 3C9% ether extract (EE), and different amounts of various minerals that feasible to be used as a partial substitute of soybean meal (SBM) and corn in poultry nutrition. Poultrys digestibility is reported to be compromised due to the indigestion of the high fiber content, making PKC potentially low for poultry feeding. Nevertheless, solid-state fermentation (SSF) can be applied to improve the nutritional quality of PKC by improving the CP and reducing CF content. PKC also contains -mannan polysaccharide, which works as a prebiotic. However, there is a wide variation for the inclusion level of PKC in the broiler diet. These variations may be due to the quality of PKC, its sources, processing methods and value-added treatment. It has been documented that 10C15% of treated PKC could be included in the broilers diets. The inclusion levels will not contribute to a negative impact on the growth performances and carcass yield. Furthermore, it will not compromise intestinal microflora, morphology, nutrient digestibility, and immune system. PKC with a proper SSF process (FPKC) can be offered up to 10C15% in the diets without affecting broilers production performance.","output":"Is Palm Kernel Cake a Suitable Alternative Feed Ingredient for Poultry?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To summarise the psychological impacts of social isolation amongst older adults during COVID\\\\19 and review the benefits and limitations of online interventions used to combat social isolation.

This regulation is commonly used by viruses such as coronaviruses and retroviruses but rarely by host human cells, and for this reason, it has long been considered as a therapeutic target for antiviral drug development. Understanding the molecular mechanism of ?1 PRF is one step toward this goal. Minus-one PRF occurs with a certain efficiency when translating ribosomes encounter the specialized mRNA signal consisting of the frameshifting site and a downstream stimulatory structure, which impedes translocation of the ribosome. The impeded ribosome can still undergo profound conformational changes to proceed with translocation; however, some of these changes may be unique and essential to frameshifting. In addition, most stimulatory structures exhibit conformational dynamics and sufficient mechanical strength, which, when under the action of ribosomes, may in turn further promote ?1 PRF efficiency. In this review, we discuss how the dynamic features of ribosomes and mRNA stimulatory structures may influence the occurrence of ?1 PRF and propose a hypothetical frameshifting model that recapitulates the role of conformational dynamics.","output":"Programmed ?1 ribosomal frameshifting from the perspective of the conformational dynamics of mRNA and ribosomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of serologic testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in both the clinical and public health settings, will continue to evolve as we gain increasing insight into our immune response to the virus. Here, we evaluated four high-throughput serologic tests for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, from Abbott Laboratories (Abbott Park, IL), Epitope Diagnostics, Inc. (San Diego, CA), Euroimmun (Lubeck, Germany), and Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics (Rochester, NY), using a panel of serially collected serum samples (n = 224) from 56 patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), healthy donor sera from 2018, and a cross-reactivity serum panel collected in early 2020. The sensitivities of the Abbott, Epitope, Euroimmun, and Ortho-Clinical IgG assays in convalescent-phase serum samples collected more than 14 days post-symptom onset or post-initial positive reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) result were 92.9% (78/84), 88.1% (74/84), 97.6% (82/84), and 98.8% (83/84), respectively. Among unique convalescent patients, sensitivities of the Abbott, Epitope, Euroimmun, and Ortho-Clinical anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays were 97.3% (36/37), 73% (27/37), 94.6% (35/37), and 97.3% (36/37), respectively.

Several antiviral drugs are currently undergoing clinical trial studies to evaluate their safety and efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. Previous studies showed the efficacy of anti-RNA virus, single strand RNA inhibiting antisense RNAs (asRNAs), on silencing of virus replication, in vitro. To transfer the anti-SARS-CoV-2 asRNAs to human respiratory epithelium, exosomes can be suggested as a promising candidate. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) secret exosomes and they can be loaded by anti-RNA virus asRNAs. MSCs-secreted exosomes as a nano-cargo of anti-SARS-CoV-2 asRNAs have other therapeutic potentials such as immunomodulatory effects of their cytokine contents, affinity to respiratory epithelial attachment, anti-fibrotic activity in lung, non-toxicity for normal cells, and do not trigger an immune response. Inhalation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 asRNAs may stop SARS-CoV-2 replication.

Elderly-onset RA can be assumed as a benign form of RA. Until recently, face-to-face therapeutic sessions between health professionals and patients are usually the method of its treatment. However, during pandemics, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), teletherapeutic sessions can extensively increase the patient safety especially in elderly patients who are more vulnerable to these infections. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate a novel teletherapy approach for management of elderly patients suffering from RA by utilizing laser acupuncture. METHODS: A teletherapy system was used for management of elderly patients suffering from RA. Sixty participants were allocated randomly into two groups and the ratio was 1:1. Patients in the first group were treated with laser acupuncture and telerehabilitation sessions, which consisted of aerobic exercise and virtual reality training. Patients in the second group received telerehabilitation sessions, which consisted of aerobic exercise and virtual reality training. Evaluation of patients was done by using the Health Assessment questionnaire (HAQ), the Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life (RAQoL) questionnaire, and the analysis of interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum C-reactive protein (CRP), plasma adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA). RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found in CRP, RAQoL, IL-6 and MDA between the pre- and post-treatments in the first group (p < 0.05) favouring the post-treatment group, while the HAQ showed a statistically significant difference between pre- and post-treatments (p < 0.05) in both groups. Statistically significant post-treatment differences were also observed between the two groups (p < 0.05) in RAQoL, CRP, ATP and MDA, favouring the first group. DISCUSSION: Laser acupuncture teletherapy could be suggested as a reliable treatment method for elderly patients suffering from RA, as it can provide a safe and effective therapeutic approach. Teletherapy provided safer access to health professionals and patients while giving a high patient satisfaction value with a relatively lower cost (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04684693).","output":"A novel approach utilizing laser acupuncture teletherapy for management of elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis: A randomized clinical trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Second Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Nanomedicine (AANM) was held at the National Acadmy of Science Building in Washinton, DC, September 9C10, 2006.

There is an urgent unmet need for safe, affordable, and effective therapeutics against COVID-19. In this regard, drug repurposing is considered as a promising approach. We assessed the compounds that affect the endosomal acidic environment by applying human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)- expressing cells infected with a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-pseudotyped HIV reporter virus and identified that obatoclax resulted in the strongest inhibition of S protein-mediated virus entry. The potent antiviral activity of obatoclax at nanomolar concentrations was confirmed in different human lung and intestinal cells infected with the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype system as well as clinical virus isolates. Furthermore, we uncovered that obatoclax executes a double-strike against SARS-CoV-2. It prevented SARS-CoV-2 entry by blocking endocytosis of virions through diminished endosomal acidification and the corresponding inhibition of the enzymatic activity of the endosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L. Additionally, obatoclax impaired the SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated membrane fusion by targeting the MCL-1 protein and reducing furin protease activity. In accordance with these overarching mechanisms, obatoclax blocked the virus entry mediated by different S proteins derived from several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern such as, Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Delta (B.1.617.2). Taken together, our results identified obatoclax as a novel effective antiviral compound that keeps SARS-CoV-2 at bay by blocking both endocytosis and membrane fusion. Our data suggested that obatoclax should be further explored as a clinical drug for the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Obatoclax inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry by altered endosomal acidification and impaired cathepsin and furin activity in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We develop methodology for three-dimensional (3D) radial visualization (RadViz) of multidimensional datasets. The classical two-dimensional (2D) RadViz visualizes multivariate data in the 2D plane by mapping every observation to a point inside the unit circle. Our tool, RadViz3D, distributes anchor points uniformly on the 3D unit sphere. We show that this uniform distribution provides the best visualization with minimal artificial visual correlation for data with uncorrelated variables. However, anchor points can be placed exactly equi-distant from each other only for the five Platonic solids, so we provide equi-distant anchor points for these five settings, and approximately equi-distant anchor points via a Fibonacci grid for the other cases. Our methodology, implemented in the R package $radviz3d$, makes fully 3D RadViz possible and is shown to improve the ability of this nonlinear technique in more faithfully displaying simulated data as well as the crabs, olive oils and wine datasets. Additionally, because radial visualization is naturally suited for compositional data, we use RadViz3D to illustrate (i) the chemical composition of Longquan celadon ceramics and their Jingdezhen imitation over centuries, and (ii) US regional SARS-Cov-2 variants' prevalence in the Covid-19 pandemic during the summer 2021 surge of the Delta variant.","output":"Fully Three-dimensional Radial Visualization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sanitary emergency generated by the pandemic COVID-19, instigates the search for scientific strategies to mitigate the damage caused by the disease to different sectors of society. The disease caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, reached 216 countries/territories, where about 20 million people were reported with the infection. Of these, more than 740,000 died. In view of the situation, strategies involving the development of new antiviral molecules are extremely important. The present work evaluated, through molecular docking assays, the interactions of 4'-acetamidechalcones with enzymatic and structural targets of SARS-CoV-2 and with the host's ACE2, which is recognized by the virus, facilitating its entry into cells. Therefore, it was observed that, regarding the interactions of chalcones with Main protease (Mpro), the chalcone N-(4'[(2E)-3-(4-flurophenyl)-1-(phenyl)prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAPF) has the potential for coupling in the same region as the natural inhibitor FJC through strong hydrogen bonding. The formation of two strong hydrogen bonds between N-(4[(2E)-3-(phenyl)-1-(phenyl)-prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAB) and the NSP16-NSP10 heterodimer methyltransferase was also noted. N-(4[(2E)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-(phenyl)prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAPM) and N-(4-[(2E)-3-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-1-(phenyl)prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAPE) chalcones showed at least one strong intensity interaction of the SPIKE protein. N-(4[(2E)-3-(4-dimetilaminophenyl)-1-(phenyl)-prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAPA) chalcone had a better affinity with ACE2, with strong hydrogen interactions. Together, our results suggest that 4'-acetamidechalcones inhibit the interaction of the virus with host cells through binding to ACE2 or SPIKE protein, probably generating a steric impediment. In addition, chalcones have an affinity for important enzymes in post-translational processes, interfering with viral replication.","output":"In silico study of the potential interactions of 4'-acetamidechalcones with protein targets in SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The properties and activities of chemicals are strongly related to their molecular structures.

We aimed to explore the role of socioeconomic status and religion, sexual double standards, erotophobia-erotophilia, sexual dysfunctional beliefs, and relationship satisfaction to explain sexual function and satisfaction in Ecuador. METHOD: 599 participants (431 women and 159 men) completed an online survey. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The Female sexual function was predicted by sexual satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, sexual dysfunctional beliefs, and sexual double standards, while the male sexual function was predicted solely by sexual satisfaction. Additionally, female sexual satisfaction was predicted by sexual function, relationship satisfaction, and sexual dysfunctional beliefs, while male sexual satisfaction was predicted by sexual function and relationship satisfaction. RESULTS: Female Sexual Function Index, International Index of Erectile Function, Brief Sexual Opinion Survey, Sexual Double Standards Scale, Sexual Dysfunctional Beliefs Questionnaire, New Sexual Satisfaction Scale, and Couple Satisfaction Index. CONCLUSION: This study provided novel information on the determinants of sexual function and satisfaction within a culture in which conservative religious beliefs still prevail. Results should be interpreted with caution given the unequal distribution of men and women, social desirability and volunteer biases, and the specific COVID-19 pandemic context during which the survey took place. Markers of sexual conservatism were inversely related to sexual function and satisfaction, mainly in women, and may, therefore, be important targets of treatment. Female sexuality seemed more context-dependent than male sexuality, although enhancing the general climate of the relationship may benefit feeling sexually satisfied in both men and women.

First, adjusting to technology-driven fieldwork posed restrictions but also enhanced the agency and comfort of participants in some ways. Study design changes attributable to COVID-19 restrictions were brought about, but also gave us critical insight into the impact of COVID-19 and related outbreaks.

The present knowledge is mainly based on available numerator data of confirmed positive cases only. The asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases are not brought into picture for testing at all, which is a major contributor to the pandemicity and hence creating bias in the documentation and understanding of the disease. The magnitude of the exposure of Healthcare Workers (HCW) and their potential for asymptomatic transmission makes it critical to know the incidence of infection in the healthcare population. Aim: The aim of the study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) SARS-CoV-2 among the asymptomatic HCW. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted during January 2021 and February 2021 in SRM Medical College Hospital and Research Centre (SRM MCH & RC), a tertiary care hospital in Potheri, Chengalpattu district, Tamil Nadu, India. The HCW were asked to complete the standardised questionnaire including the basic information, symptoms of COVID-19 illness and utility of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) based on World Health Organization (WHO) risk assessment and management of exposure of HCW in the context of COVID-19. They were divided into two groups, the staff who had direct patient exposure as group 1 with 82 participants and staff without direct patient exposure as group 2 with 46 participants. The serodetection of IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was done using the Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (CLIA). The obtained results were statistically analysed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 20.0. A chi-square test (2) was performed and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 128 HCW were studied. In group 1, there were 64.1% (n=82) of HCWs and in group 2 there were 35.9% (n=46) of HCWs. There were total of 74 (57.8%) males and 54(42.2%) females. No gender-specific differences were observed. The mean age in group 1 was 28.93 years and group 2 was 32.2 years. The staffs older than 40 years were more commonly affected. Adherence to strict PPE protocol was observed in 92.6% (76/82) in group 1 and 82.6% (38/46) in group 2. The difference between the groups were statistically significant (p=0.025). In this study, though the seroprevalence of COVID-19 infection was 9.8% (n=8) in group 1 and 13% (n=6) in group 2, it was statistically not significant. Conclusion: SARS-CoV2 Serology study helps to identify the asymptomatic (unestimated) cases.

Our objective was to develop a reusable, mobile-friendly application for collecting PROs and experiences to support COVID-19 symptom self-monitoring and data sharing with appropriate public health agencies, using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) for interoperability.

Here we present MouseView.js, an alternative to eye tracking that can be employed in web-based research. Inspired by the visual system, MouseView.js blurs the display to mimic peripheral vision, but allows participants to move a sharp aperture that is roughly the size of the fovea. Like eye gaze, the aperture can be directed to fixate on stimuli of interest. We validated MouseView.js in an online replication (N = 165) of an established free viewing task (N = 83 existing eye-tracking datasets), and in an in-lab direct comparison with eye tracking in the same participants (?N = 50). Mouseview.js proved as reliable as gaze, and produced the same pattern of dwell time results. In addition, dwell time differences from MouseView.js and from eye tracking correlated highly, and related to self-report measures in similar ways.

According to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), our emissions are estimated to have caused 0.8 deg C-1.2 deg C of anthropogenic global warming (AGW) above pre-industrial levels. AGW is likely to reach 1.5 degrees C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate. As the climate change is driven by the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere, there is a broad consensus that the mitigation of climate change requires transition to low GHG emission energy sources, technologies and practices. Implementing such changes systematically from individual to community-wide scales together with the resulting cultural changes and leadership towards environmental consciousness and responsibility are crucial to mitigate the looming damage of AGW. Given planetary scientists' wide recognition of the realities of climate change, and the need for us to maintain credibility by leading by example, it is appropriate to make own professional behavior more environmentally responsible. While scientists are few in numbers, and planetary scientists far fewer, high volumes of academic travel to conferences, panels, colloquia, and research collaboration visits together with extensive use of large, energetically demanding infrastructures make the\\"carbon footprint\\"of scientists much higher than that of an average citizen. This White Paper focuses on how modifying our activities, particularly associated with academic travel, can affect the carbon footprint of the planetary science community, and it makes recommendations on how the community and the funding agencies could best participate in the cultural change required to mitigate the damage that AGW will cause.","output":"Pathways to Sustainable Planetary Science"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its establishment as one of the major authorities on the human body, Anatomy has played a crucial role in social and political spheres.

As observations show, children have the flow of infection easier than adults.

In domestic practice, the term \\"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19\\" is used to indicate the disease. Among the local symptoms of MIS are inflammations of the skin and mucous membranes, as well as various lymphadenopathy. The article presents the results of our clinic's observation of 205 patients with MIS for the period from May 2020 to May 2021. In some patients, the clinical manifestations of MIS-C required differential diagnosis with parapharyngeal abscesses (PPA). For this purpose, the children were consulted by an otorhinolaryngologist and a CT scan of the neck with contrast enhancement was performed. Despite the striking clinical manifestations similar to PPA, in no case was a pharyngeal abscess revealed. Both of these diseases are potentially fatal if treatment is not started on time, and therefore we believe that the awareness of otorhinolaryngologists about the manifestations of MIS-C will be useful in modern clinical practice.","output":"[Differential diagnosis of parapharyngeal abscess with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has spread widely throughout the world.

METHODS 1377 patients with RMD who received two-dose SARS-CoV-2-mRNA vaccination between 16 December 2020 and April 15, 2021 completed questionnaires detailing local and systemic reactions experienced within 7 days of each vaccine dose (D1, D2), and one month after D2 detailing flare of RMD. Associations between demographic/clinical characteristics and flare requiring treatment were evaluated using modified Poisson regression. RESULTS 11 percent reported flare requiring treatment; there were no reports of severe flares. Flare was associated with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (IRR 2.09, p=0.02), flare in the six months preceding vaccination (IRR 2.36, p<0.001) and use of combination immunomodulatory therapy (IRR 1.95, p<0.001). The most frequently reported local and systemic reactions included injection site pain (D1 87%, D2 86%) and fatigue (D1 60%, D2 80%); reactogenicity increased after D2, particularly for systemic reactions. No allergic reactions or SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses were reported. CONCLUSION Flare of underlying RMD following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was uncommon. There were no reports of severe flare.

METHODS: This was a prospective European observational study (the COVIP study) in ICU patients aged 70 years and older admitted with COVID-19 disease from March to December 2020 to 159 ICUs in 14 European countries. An electronic database was used to register a number of parameters including: SOFA score, Clinical Frailty Scale, co-morbidities, usual ICU procedures and survival at 90 days. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04321265). RESULTS: In total, 2625 patients were included, 1327 from the first and 1298 from the second surge. Median age was 74 and 75 years in surge 1 and 2, respectively. SOFA score was higher in the first surge (median 6 versus 5, p < 0.0001). The PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio at admission was higher during surge 1, and more patients received invasive mechanical ventilation (78% versus 68%, p < 0.0001). During the first 15 days of treatment, survival was similar during the first and the second surge. Survival was lower in the second surge after day 15 and differed after 30 days (57% vs 50%) as well as after 90 days (51% vs 40%). CONCLUSION: An unexpected, but significant, decrease in 30-day and 90-day survival was observed during the second surge in our cohort of elderly ICU patients. The reason for this is unclear. Our main concern is whether the widespread changes in practice and treatment of COVID-19 between the two surges have contributed to this increased mortality in elderly patients. Further studies are urgently warranted to provide more evidence for current practice in elderly patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04321265, registered March 19th, 2020.

Exaggerated pulmonary vascular response to hypoxia may be related to endothelial dysfunction in hypoxia susceptible. We hypothesize that baseline BNP levels can predict hypoxia susceptibility in healthy individuals. MAIN METHODS: The pulmonary vascular response to hypoxia was compared in 35 male healthy individuals divided into two groups based on BNP levels (Group 1  15 and Group 2 > 15 pg/ml). Acute normobaric hypoxia was administered to both the groups, to confirm hypoxia susceptibility in Group 2. KEY FINDINGS: Unlike Group 1, Group 2 had elevated post hypoxia BNP levels (26 vs 33.5 pg/ml, p = 0.002) while pulmonary artery pressure was comparable. A negative correlation with tissue oxygen consumption (delta pO(2)) and compartmental fluid shift was seen in Group 1 only. Endothelial dysfunction in Group 2 resulted in reduced vascular compliance leading to elevation of mean blood pressure on acute hypoxia exposure. BNP showed a positive correlation with endothelial dysfunction in Group 2 and has been linked to pre-diabetic disorder (HbA1c 6  0.44%) and may additionally represent a lower cross-sectional area of vascular bed related to vascular remodeling mediated by chronic hypoxia. SIGNIFICANCE: Hypoxia susceptibility in healthy individuals may be related to endothelial dysfunction that limits vascular compliance during hypoxic stress. BNP level showed positive correlation with HbA1c (r = 0.49, p = 0.04) and negative correlation with delta pO(2) (r = ?0.52, p = 0.04) can predict reduced microvascular compliance due to endothelial dysfunction contributing to hypoxia susceptibility in healthy individuals.

PARTICIPANTS: The study will be conducted at National Cancer Institute (NCI), Jhajjar, Haryana, which is a part of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, and has been converted into a dedicated COVID-19 management centre since the outbreak of the pandemic. All RT-PCR confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with age &#8805; 40 years and < 75 years requiring hospital admission (patients with WHO clinical improvement ordinal score 3 to 5) will be included in the trial. Written informed consent will be taken for all recruited patients. Patients with a critical illness (WHO clinical improvement ordinal score > 5), documented significant liver disease/dysfunction (aspartate transaminase [AST] / alanine aminotransferase [ALT] > 240), myopathy and rhabdomyolysis (creatine phosphokinase [CPK] > 5x normal), allergy or intolerance to statins or aspirin, prior statin or aspirin use within 30 days, history of active gastrointestinal bleeding in past three months, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100000/ dl), pregnancy, active breastfeeding, or inability to take oral or nasogastric medications will be excluded. Patients refusing to give written consent and taking drugs that are known to have a significant drug interaction with statin or aspirin [including cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors, hepatitis C protease inhibitor, telaprevir, fibric acid derivatives (gemfibrozil), niacin, azole antifungals (itraconazole, ketoconazole), clarithromycin and colchicine] will also be excluded from the trial. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: In this study, the benefit and safety of atorvastatin (statin) and/or aspirin as adjuvant therapy will be compared with the control group receiving usual care for management of COVID-19. Atorvastatin will be prescribed as 40 mg oral tablets once daily for ten days or until discharge, whichever is earlier. The dose of aspirin will be 75 mg once daily for ten days or until discharge, whichever is earlier. All other therapies will be administered according to the institute's COVID-19 treatment protocol and the treating physician's clinical judgment. MAIN OUTCOMES: All study participants will be prospectively followed up for ten days or until hospital discharge, whichever is longer for outcomes. The primary outcome will be clinical deterioration characterized by progression to WHO clinical improvement ordinal score &#8805; 6 (i.e., endotracheal intubation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, pressor agents, renal replacement therapy, ECMO requirement, and mortality). The secondary outcomes will be change in serum inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and Interleukin-6), Troponin I, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) from time zero to 5th day of study enrolment or 7th day after symptom onset, whichever is later. Other clinical outcomes that will be assessed include progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), shock, ICU admission, length of ICU admission, length of hospital admission, and in-hospital mortality. Adverse drug effects like myalgia, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity, and bleeding will also be examined in the trial to assess the safety of the interventions. RANDOMISATION: The study will use a four-arm parallel-group design. A computer-generated permuted block randomization with mixed block size will be used to randomize the participants in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to group A (atorvastatin with conventional therapy), group B (aspirin with conventional therapy), group C (aspirin + atorvastatin with conventional therapy), and group D (control; only conventional therapy). BLINDING (MASKING): The study will be an open-label trial. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): As there is no existing study that has evaluated the role of aspirin and atorvastatin in COVID-19 patients, formal sample size calculation has not been done. Patients satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited during six months of study period. Once the first 200 patients are included in each arm (i.e., total 800 patients), the final sample size calculation will be done on the basis of the interim analysis of the collected data.

This work uses mathematical modelling to simulate the levels of COVID-19 in North East London (NEL) and inform the level of social distancing necessary to protect the public and the healthcare demand from future COVID-19 waves. We used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model describing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in NEL, calibrated to data on hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19, hospital discharges and in-hospital deaths in NEL during the first epidemic wave. To account for the uncertainty in both the infectiousness period and the proportion of symptomatic infection, we simulated nine scenarios for different combinations of infectiousness period (1, 3 and 5 days) and proportion of symptomatic infection (70%, 50% and 25% of all infections). Across all scenarios, the calibrated model was used to assess the risk of occurrence and predict the strength and timing of a second COVID-19 wave under varying levels of daily contact rate from July 04, 2020. Specifically, the daily contact rate required to suppress the epidemic and prevent a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, and the daily contact rate required to stay within the acute bed capacity of the NEL system without any additional intervention measures after July 2020, were determined across the nine different scenarios. Our results caution against a full relaxing of the lockdown later in 2020, predicting that a return to pre-COVID-19 levels of social contact from July 04, 2020, would induce a second wave up to eight times the original wave. With different levels of ongoing social distancing, future resurgence can be avoided, or the strength of the resurgence can be mitigated. Keeping the daily contact rate lower than 5 or 6, depending on scenarios, can prevent an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, could keep the effective reproduction number R(e) below 1 and a secondary COVID-19 wave may be avoided in NEL. A daily contact rate between 6 and 7, across scenarios, is likely to increase R(e) above 1 and result in a secondary COVID-19 wave with significantly increased COVID-19 cases and associated deaths, but with demand for hospital-based care remaining within the bed capacity of the NEL health and care system. In contrast, an increase in daily contact rate above 8 to 9, depending on scenarios, will likely exceed the acute bed capacity in NEL and may potentially require additional lockdowns. This scenario is associated with significantly increased COVID-19 cases and deaths, and acute COVID-19 care demand is likely to require significant scaling down of the usual operation of the health and care system and should be avoided. Our findings suggest that to avoid future COVID-19 waves and to stay within the acute bed capacity of the NEL health and care system, maintaining social distancing in NEL is advised with a view to limiting the average number of social interactions in the population. Increasing the level of social interaction beyond the limits described in this work could result in future COVID-19 waves that will likely exceed the acute bed capacity in the system, and depending on the strength of the resurgence may require additional lockdown measures.","output":"Determining the level of social distancing necessary to avoid future COVID-19 epidemic waves: a modelling study for North East London"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This article examines ways COVID-19 health surveillance and algorithmic decision-making (ADM) are creating and exacerbating workplace inequalities that impact post-treatment cancer survivors. Cancer survivors ability to exercise their right to work often is limited by prejudice and health concerns. While cancer survivors can ostensibly elect not to disclose to their employers when they are receiving treatments or if they have a history of treatment, the use of ADM increases the chances that employers will learn of their situation regardless of their preferences. Moreover, absent significant change, inequalities may persist or even expand. METHODS: We analyze how COVID-19 health surveillance is creating an unprecedented amount of health data on all people. These data are increasingly collected and used by employers as part of COVID-19 regulatory interventions. RESULTS: The increase in data, combined with the health and economic crisis, means algorithm-driven health inequalities will be experienced by a larger percentage of the population. Post-treatment cancer survivors, as for people with disabilities generally, are at greater risk of experiencing negative outcomes from algorithmic health discrimination. CONCLUSIONS: Updated and revised workplace policy and practice requirements, as well as collaboration across impacted groups, are critical in helping to control the inequalities that flow from the interaction between COVID-19, ADM, and the experience of cancer survivorship in the workplace. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: The interaction among COVID-19, health surveillance, and ADM increases exposure to algorithmic health discrimination in the workplace.","output":"Workplace health

renorrhaphy in patients who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (RALPN) for small renal mass. MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed the surgical videos and medical charts of 31 patients who had undergone RALPN with the SLT renorrhaphy performed by two surgeons (CWJ and CK) between January 2014 and October 2014. SLT renorrhaphy was performed after tumor excision and renal parenchymal defect repair. Assessed outcomes included renorrhaphy time (RT), warm ischemic time, perioperative complications, and perioperative renal function change. RT was defined as interval from the end of bed suture to the renal artery declamping. RESULTS In all patients, sliding loop renorrhaphy was successfully conducted without conversions to radical nephrectomy or open approaches. Mean renorrhaphy and warm ischemic time were 9.0 and 22.6 minutes, respectively. After completing renorrhaphy, there were no adverse events such as dehiscence of approximated renal parenchyma, renal parenchymal tearing, or significant bleeding. Furthermore, no postoperative complications or significant renal function decline were observed as of the last follow-up for all patients. The limitations of this study include the small volume case series, the retrospective nature of the study, and the heterogeneity of surgeons. CONCLUSIONS From our initial clinical experience, SLT may be an efficient and safe renorrhaphy method in real clinical practice. Further large scale, prospective, long-term follow-up, and direct comparative studies with other techniques are required to confirm the clinical applicability of SLT.","output":"The clinical application of the sliding loop technique for renorrhaphy during robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy: Surgical technique and outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Social media has become a ubiquitous part of daily life during the COVID-19 pandemic isolation. However, the role of social media use in depression and suicidal ideation of the general public remains unclear. Related empirical studies were limited and reported inconsistent findings. Little is known about the potential underlying mechanisms that may illustrate the relationship between social media use and depression and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study tested the mediation effects of social loneliness and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms on the relationship between social media use and depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, as well as the moderation effect of age on the mediation models. METHODS: We administered a population-based random telephone survey in May and June 2020, when infection control measures were being vigorously implemented in Hong Kong. A total of 1070 adults (658 social media users and 412 nonusers) completed the survey. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and multigroup SEM were conducted to test the mediation and moderation effects. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of probable depression was 11.6%; 1.6% had suicidal ideation in the past 2 weeks. Both moderated mediation models of depressive symptoms (&#967;262=335.3; P<.05; comparative fit index [CFI]=0.94; nonnormed fit index [NNFI]=0.92; root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA]=0.06) and suicidal ideation (&#967;234=50.8; P<.05; CFI=0.99; NNFI=0.99; RMSEA=0.02) showed acceptable model fit. There was a significantly negative direct effect of social media use on depressive symptoms among older people (?=-.07; P=.04) but not among younger people (?=.04; P=.55). The indirect effect via PTSD symptoms was significantly positive among both younger people (?=.09; P=.02) and older people (?=.10; P=.01). The indirect effect via social loneliness was significant among older people (?=-.01; P=.04) but not among younger people (?=.01; P=.31). The direct effect of social media use on suicidal ideation was not statistically significant in either age group (P>.05). The indirect effects via PTSD symptoms were statistically significant among younger people (?=.02; P=.04) and older people (?=.03; P=.01). Social loneliness was not a significant mediator between social media use and suicidal ideation among either age group (P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: Social media may be a \\"double-edged sword\\" for psychosocial well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic, and its roles vary across age groups.

In the event of the virus outbreak, it is crucial to get the carriers of the virus timely and precisely, then the animal origins can be isolated for further infection.

With the development of machine learning, the efficiency of predicting the viral hosts has been demonstrated by recent researchers. However, the problems of the limited annotated virus data and imbalanced hosts information restrict these approaches to obtain a better result. To assure the high reliability of predicting the animal origins on COVID-19, we extend transfer learning and ensemble learning to present a hybrid transfer learning model. When predicting the hosts of newly discovered virus, our model provides a novel solution to utilize the related virus domain as auxiliary to help building a robust model for target virus domain. The simulation results on several UCI benchmarks and viral genome datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the general classical methods under the condition of limited target training sets and class-imbalance problems. By setting the coronavirus as target domain and other related virus as source domain, the feasibility of our approach is evaluated.

We have already reported gastric tube (GT) reconstruction after PG and performed it on more than 100 patients. No studies have reported long-term outcomes after PG-GT. The aim of this study was to investigate long-term outcomes, including nutrition indices, such as body weight, serum albumin, total protein, hemoglobin, and ferritin after PG, and observe recovery of upper gastrointestinal tract motility. METHODS We analyzed body weight loss and laboratory findings at our outpatient clinic at 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months postoperatively. Manometric recording was carried out at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after surgery. RESULTS The percentage change in body weight in the PG-GT group was significantly larger than that in the PG-JI and TG-RY groups at 2.5, 3, 4, and 5 years after surgery. The levels of hemoglobin and ferritin in the PG-GT and PG-JI groups were significantly higher than those in the TG-RY group at all time points except 6 months after surgery. In the fasted state, the phase III originated at the gastric tube was propagated to the duodenum 3 years after surgery. In the fed state, phasic contractions of the duodenum were in harmony with gastric tube contractions 3 years after surgery.

METHODS: A total of 845 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were analyzed with the RespiFinder Smart 22 kit (PathoFinder BV, Netherlands) and the Rotor-Gene 6000 real-time PCR system. RESULTS: At least one pathogen was detected in 612 (72.4%) of the specimens. Overall, 902 pathogens were detected; 821 (91%) were viruses and 81 (9%) were bacteria. The most commonly detected pathogens were influenza A virus (IFV-A) (n = 219), influenza B virus (IFV-B) (n=157), rhinovirus/enterovirus (n = 107), human bocavirus (HBoV) (n = 91), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A/B (n = 64), adenovirus (n = 56), human coronaviruses (n = 51), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 49), parainfluenza viruses (n = 40), human metapneumovirus (n = 36), Bordetella pertussis (n = 15), Legionella pneumophila (n = 11), and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (n = 6), respectively.

Consumer-grade wearables may present a solution to detect the presence of infections in the population, but the current paradigm requires collecting physiological data continuously and for long periods of time on each individual, which poses limitations in the context of rapid screening. Technology: Here, we propose a novel paradigm based on recording the physiological responses elicited by a short (~2 minutes) sequence of activities (i.e. \\"snapshot\\"), to detect symptoms associated with COVID-19. We employed a novel body-conforming soft wearable sensor placed on the suprasternal notch to capture data on physical activity, cardio-respiratory function, and cough sounds. RESULTS: We performed a pilot study in a cohort of individuals (n=14) who tested positive for COVID-19 and detected altered heart rate, respiration rate and heart rate variability, relative to a group of healthy individuals (n=14) with no known exposure. Logistic regression classifiers were trained on individual and combined sets of physiological features (heartbeat and respiration dynamics, walking cadence, and cough frequency spectrum) at discriminating COVID-positive participants from the healthy group. Combining features yielded an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI=[0.92, 0.96]) using a leave-one-subject-out cross validation scheme.

High complication rates associated with surgery have sparked considerable interest in endovascular techniques, though not well-studied, to treat blister aneurysms. OBJECTIVE To evaluate our experience using various endovascular approaches to treat blister aneurysms. METHODS All consecutive blister aneurysms treated using an endovascular approach by the study authors over a 3-year period were retrospectively analyzed. A literature review was also performed. RESULTS Nine patients with blister aneurysms underwent 11 endovascular interventions. In various combinations, stents were used in 8/11, coils in 5/11, and Onyx in 3/11 procedures. At mean angiographic follow-up of 200 days, 8/9 aneurysms were completely occluded by endovascular means alone requiring no further treatment and 1/9 aneurysms required surgical bypass/trapping after one failed surgical and two failed endovascular treatments. At mean clinical follow-up of 416 days, modified Rankin Scale scores were improved in six patients, stable in two, and worsened in one patient. One complication occurred in 11 procedures (9%), resulting in a permanent neurologic deficit. No unintended endovascular parent vessel sacrifice, intraprocedural aneurysmal ruptures, antiplatelet-related complications, post-treatment aneurysmal re-ruptures, or deaths occurred. CONCLUSION This series highlights both the spectrum and limitations of endovascular techniques currently used to treat blister aneurysms, including a novel application of stent-assisted Onyx embolization.

However, the role of a novel circRNA, circ_0079593, in melanoma is unclear. The expression levels of circ_0079593 and miR-516b were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell proliferation was measured by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, and cell migration and invasion were evaluated using transwell assay. Meanwhile, western blot (WB) analysis was employed to determine the levels of proliferation and metastasis-related proteins, as well as metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (GRM3) protein. Furthermore, cell apoptosis was tested by detecting the cell apoptosis rate and Caspase-3 activity. The glucose consumption and lactate production of cells were measured to evaluate cell glucose metabolism. Moreover, dual-luciferase reporter assay and biotin-labeled RNA pull-down assay were used to confirm the interaction between miR-516b and circ_0079593 or GRM3. In addition, mice xenograft models were constructed to explore the effect of circ_0079593 on melanoma tumor growth in vivo. Our results discovered that circ_0079593 was highly expressed in melanoma, and its silencing suppressed melanoma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, glucose metabolism and promoted apoptosis.

The rescue experiments revealed that both miR-516b inhibitor and GRM3 overexpression could reverse the inhibition effect of circ_0079593 knockdown on melanoma progression. Additionally, in vivo experiments also revealed that circ_0079593 interference suppressed melanoma tumor growth. Our study concluded that circ_0079593 accelerated melanoma progression via upregulating GRM3 by sponging miR-516b, which suggested that circ_0079593 had the potential to be a new therapeutic biomarker for melanoma.","output":"Circ_0079593 facilitates proliferation, metastasis, glucose metabolism and inhibits apoptosis in melanoma by regulating the miR-516b/GRM3 axis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: The clinical efficacy of antiobesity medications (AOMs) as adjuncts to lifestyle intervention is well characterized, but data regarding their use in conjunction with workplace wellness plans are lacking, and coverage of AOMs by US private employers is limited. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of combining AOMs with a comprehensive, interdisciplinary, employer-based weight management program (WMP) compared with the WMP alone on weight loss, treatment adherence, and work productivity and limitations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 1-year, single-center, open-label, parallel-group, real-world, randomized clinical trial was conducted at the Cleveland Clinics Endocrinology and Metabolism Institute in Cleveland, Ohio, from January 7, 2019, to May 22, 2020. Participants were adults with obesity (body mass index [BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared] 30) enrolled in the Cleveland Clinic Employee Health Plan. INTERVENTIONS: In total, 200 participants were randomized 1:1, 100 participants to WMP combined with an AOM (WMP+Rx), and 100 participants to WMP alone. The WMP was the Cleveland Clinic Endocrinology and Metabolism Institutes employer-based integrated medical WMP implemented through monthly multidisciplinary shared medical appointments. Participants in the WMP+Rx group initiated treatment with 1 of 5 US Food and Drug AdministrationCapproved medications for chronic weight management (orlistat, lorcaserin, phentermine/topiramate, naltrexone/bupropion, and liraglutide, 3.0 mg) according to standard clinical practice. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was the percentage change in body weight from baseline to month 12. RESULTS: The 200 participants were predominately (177 of 200 [88.5%]) women, had a mean (SD) age of 50.0 (10.3) years, and a mean (SD) baseline weight of 105.0 (19.0) kg. For the primary intention-to-treat estimand, the estimated mean (SE) weight loss was ?7.7% (0.7%) for the WMP+Rx group vs ?4.2% (0.7%) for the WMP group, with an estimated treatment difference of ?3.5% (95% CI, ?5.5% to ?1.5%) (P < .001). The estimated percentage of participants achieving at least 5% weight loss was 62.5% for WMP+Rx vs 44.8% for WMP (P = .02). The rate of attendance at shared medical appointments was higher for the WMP+Rx group than for the WMP group. No meaningful differences in patient-reported work productivity or limitation measures were observed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Clinically meaningful superior mean weight loss was achieved when access to AOMs was provided in the real-world setting of an employer-based WMP, compared with the WMP alone. Such results may inform employer decisions regarding AOM coverage and guide best practices for comprehensive, interdisciplinary employer-based WMPs.

During treatment, we found that the majority of patients had a decrease in hemoglobin (Hb). Interferon-2b (IFN-2b) was the primary suspected drug that was related to Hb reduction. Thus, the study aimed to investigate whether IFN-2b could induce Hb reduction in severe patients with COVID-19 and its potential mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 50 patients who were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University with severe COVID-19 infection were enrolled from February 12th to 24th, 2020. The demographics, baseline characteristics, clinical data, and therapeutic regimen were collected retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups according to the declined use of IFN-2b on day 14. The Hb levels on admission, day 7, day14, and day 21 were collected and analyzed. The primary endpoint was the level of Hb on day 21. RESULTS: A total of 31 patients in the IFN-stop group and 19 patients in the non-IFN-stop group were reviewed. The age, gender, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, nutritional status, disease severity, complications, and other factors of the patients were compared, no difference was found between the IFN-stop group and the non-IFN-stop group. The Hb levels of all patients significantly decreased on day 7 compared with that on admission (p < .0001). In the IFN-stop group, the Hb level was increased in 7 days after IFN-2b was stopped (p = .0008), whereas no difference was found between day 14 and day 21 in the non-IFN-stop group (p = .3152). CONCLUSIONS: IFN-2b was associated with Hb reduction in the treatment of severe patients of COVID-19. Clinicians should be aware of the high incidence of Hb reduction for patients treated by IFN-2b.","output":"Interferon-2b induced anemia in severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients: a single centered, retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter introduces basic concepts of virology and exemplifies the usage of current technology for identifying and tracking viral pathogens. Virus structure, lifestyle, replication strategies, classication, the varied modes of transmission, infection, and disease manifestations are focussed upon in the chapter. Viruses are extremely simple life forms without metabolic capacity, organelles, translational machinery, or autonomous replicative potential; the essential elements of a virus are consequently minimal. A virus enters the host through any opportunistic opening of the body; such as minute breaks in the skin barrier or mucosal linings of the eye, nose, etc. Antibodies produced during an infection often have the ability to bind the virus and reduce infectivity. An immediate question to solve during a virus outbreak is the mechanism by which the virus spreads. Viruses frequently infect animal or insect vectors that serve to pass the virus to humans. By identifying the virus through sequence analysis, a hypothetical reservoir can be predicted by the placement of the sequence on the phylogenetic treeE The varied modes of transmission, infection, and disease manifestations as they relate to the different diagnostic methods for virus identification are highlighted. Examples of naturally emerging viruses; such as Sin Nombre, Nipah, West Nile conclude the chapter. New technologies that allow the creation of manmade or engineered viruses, new frontiers in viral diagnostics, and a few thoughts on the future of virology are also presented. The global eradication of smallpox ranks as one of humankind's greatest accomplishments yet many viral challenges remain.

These polymers offer the possibility to develop nanostructured antigen carriers that can be easily internalized by antigen presenting cells, due to their nanometric size. Besides, the incorporation of an adjuvant allows increasing and modulating the immune response for both, polymers with or without self-adjuvant properties. AREAS COVERED The historical background and the state-of-the-art in the use of polymers as antigen carriers are addressed in the first part of this review. Then, an overview of the immunology of vaccination is provided. Finally, the main advances in the field, based on the prototypes that are licensed or undergoing clinical trials, but also the challenges that limit the translation of many polymer-based nanostructure vaccines with promising preclinical results, are discussed. EXPERT OPINION Polymeric nanostructured-vaccines have a great potential in modern vaccinology. However, the translation into the market is hampered due to several limitations. Studies on correlates of protection to provide suitable biomarkers, new and better methods of synthesis to produce more reproducible nanovaccines, a deeper knowledge in the immune system and in the physiopathology of the infectious diseases will surely improve and boost the field in the next years.","output":"Polymeric nanostructure vaccines: applications and challenges."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interplay between susceptibility genes and environmental factors is considered important player in the genesis of multiple sclerosis (MS).

First, researchers must abandon the starting assumption that acts of mass violence are driven primarily by diagnosable psychopathology in isolated lone wolf individuals. The destructive motivations must be situated, instead, within larger social structures and cultural scripts. Second, mental health professionals and scholars must carefully scrutinize any apparent correlation of violence with mental illness for evidence of racial bias in the official systems that define, measure, and record psychiatric diagnoses, as well as those that enforce laws and impose criminal justice sanctions. Third, to better understand the role of firearm access in the occurrence and lethality of mass shootings, research should be guided by an overarching framework that incorporates social, cultural, legal, and political, but also psychological, aspects of private gun ownership in the United States. Fourth, effective policies and interventions to reduce the incidence of mass shootings over timeand to prevent serious acts of violence more generallywill require an expanded body of well-funded interdisciplinary research that is informed and implemented through the sustained engagement of researchers with affected communities and other stakeholders in gun violence prevention. Emerging evidence that the coronavirus pandemic has produced a sharp increase both in civilian gun sales and in the social and psychological determinants of injurious behavior adds special urgency to this agenda.","output":"Mental Illness, Mass Shootings, and the Future of Psychiatric Research into American Gun Violence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the time of writing, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is seriously threatening human lives and health throughout the world. Many epidemic models have been developed to provide references for decision-making by governments and the World Health Organization. To capture and understand the characteristics of the epidemic trend, parameter optimization algorithms are needed to obtain model parameters. In this study, the authors propose using the LevenbergCMarquardt algorithm (LMA) to identify epidemic models. This algorithm combines the advantage of the GaussCNewton method and gradient descent method and has improved the stability of parameters. The authors selected four countries with relatively high numbers of confirmed cases to verify the advantages of the LevenbergCMarquardt algorithm over the traditional epidemiological model method. The results show that the Statistical-SIR (Statistical-SusceptibleCInfectedCRecovered) model using LMA can fit the actual curve of the epidemic well, while the epidemic simulation of the traditional model evolves too fast and the peak value is too high to reflect the real situation. ժҪ , ¹ڷ(COVID-19)в.вѧģѾΪƶߺ֯ṩ߲ο.Ϊ˸̵Ƶı仯, Ż㷨ڷģͲ.ʹý˸˹-ţٷݶ½LevenbergCMarquardt(LMA)㷨ŻģͲ.ʹĸԽ϶Ĺ֤һ㷨:ڴͳвѧģģ߹ĵֵ, ӦLMAStatistical-SIR(Statistical-SusceptibleCInfectedCRecovered)ģͿԸõʵ.","output":"Optimal parameterization of COVID-19 epidemic models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recognition of activities, such as preparing meal or watching TV, performed by a smart home resident, can promote the independent living of elderly in a safe and comfortable environment of their own homes, for an extended period of time.

We propose a Local Feature Weighting approach (LFW) that assigns weights based on both inter-class and intra-class importance of a feature in an activity. Multiple sensors are deployed at different locations in a smart home to gather information. We exploit the obtained information, such as frequency and duration of activation of sensors, and the total sensors in an activity for feature weighting. The weights for the same features vary among activities, since a feature may have more importance for one activity but less for the other. For the classification, we exploit the two variants of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Evidence Theoretic KNN (ETKNN) and Fuzzy KNN (FKNN).

We aimed to quantitatively measure self-reported metrics of fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and sleep and identify factors associated with these metrics among United States residents with or without COVID-19. METHODS: We solicited 1000 adult United States residents for an online survey conducted February 3C5, 2021 utilizing a commercial crowdsourcing community research platform. The platform curates eligible participants to approximate United States demographics by age, sex, and race proportions. COVID-19 was diagnosed by laboratory testing and/or by exposure to a known positive contact with subsequent typical symptoms. Prolonged COVID-19 was self-reported and coded for those with symptoms  1 month following initial diagnosis. The primary outcomes were NIH PROMIS/Neuro-QoL short-form T-scores for fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and sleep compared among those with prolonged COVID-19 symptoms, COVID-19 without prolonged symptoms and COVID-19 negative subjects. Multivariable backwards step-wise logistic regression models were constructed to predict abnormal Neuro-QoL metrics. RESULTS: Among 999 respondents, the average age was 45 years (range 18C84), 49% were male, 76 (7.6%) had a history of COVID-19 and 19/76 (25%) COVID-19 positive participants reported prolonged symptoms lasting a median of 4 months (range 1C13). Prolonged COVID-19 participants were more often younger, female, Hispanic, and had a history of depression/mood/thought disorder (all P < 0.05). They experienced significantly higher rates of unemployment and financial insecurity, and their symptoms created greater interference with work and household activities compared to other COVID-19 status groups (all P < 0.05). After adjusting for demographics, past medical history and stressor covariates in multivariable logistic regression analysis, COVID-19 status was independently predictive of worse Neuro-QoL cognitive dysfunction scores (adjusted OR 11.52, 95% CI 1.01C2.28, P = 0.047), but there were no significant differences in quantitative measures of anxiety, depression, fatigue, or sleep. CONCLUSION: Prolonged symptoms occurred in 25% of COVID-19 positive participants, and NeuroQoL cognitive dysfunction scores were significantly worse among COVID-19 positive subjects, even after accounting for demographic and stressor covariates.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the epidemiological history and initial clinical characteristics of 10 patients with family aggregation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Western Chongqing, China. STUDY DESIGN: Ten patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection by real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), were collected from The People's Hospital of Dazu District, Chongqing. Epidemiological data and laboratory and imaging results were collected on the first day of admission, and analyzed based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline for COVID-19 (5th edition, China). RESULTS: Of the 10 cases, case A had a history of a temporary stay in Wuhan and transmitted the virus to the others through family gathering, living together, and sharing vehicles. The average age was 56.5 years ( 11.16), six patients were males, and the incubation period was 2C14 days. Dry cough was the main symptom, followed by fever and fatigue. Most patients were clinically classified as ordinary-type, with three cases being severe-type. Chest computed tomography results were nonspecific, mainly with ground-glass attenuation and/or shadow images. Extensive lesion distribution was seen in severe cases. CD4+ lymphocyte counts were 61, 180, and 348 cells/uL in severe-type patients, respectively. Notably, viral nucleic acid values in nasopharyngeal swabs were lower (19, 25, and 26) than those of ordinary-type patients, suggesting a higher viral load. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was also higher in severe-type patients CONCLUSIONS: Initial examination results of lower CD4+ lymphocyte counts and RT-PCR-CT values coupled with higher NLR may indicate the severity of COVID-19 infection for these family clusters.","output":"Epidemiological and initial clinical characteristics of patients with family aggregation of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a result of armed conflict, head trauma from exposure to blasts is an increasing critical health issue, particularly among military service members. Whilst numerous studies examined the burden of blast-related brain injuries on service members', few systematic reviews have been published. This work provides a comprehensive summary of the evidence on blast-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) burden in active U.S. military service members and inactive Veterans, describing characteristics and outcomes. Records published up to April 2017 were identified through a search of PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library. Records-based and original research reporting on U.S. military service members and Veterans with mild blast TBI were included. Data on subject characteristics, exposure, diagnostic criterion, and outcomes were extracted from included studies using a standardized extraction form and were presented narratively. Of the 2,290 references identified by the search, 106 studies with a total of 37,515 participants met inclusion criteria for blast-related mTBI. All but nine studies were based out of military or Veteran medical facilities. Unsurprisingly, men were over-represented (75-100%). The criteria used to define blast-related mTBI were consistent; however, the methodology used to ascertain whether individuals met those criteria for diagnosis were inconsistent. The diagnosis, most prevalent among the Army, heavily relied on self-reported histories. Commonly reported adverse outcomes included hearing disturbances and headaches. The most frequently associated comorbidities were post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, attention disorders, and cognitive disorders. The primary objective of this review was to provide a summary of descriptive data on blast-related mTBI in a U.S. military population.

This created a massive shortage of advanced health facilities with inadequate medicinal supply, further deteriorating human health conditions. On the basis of adverse effects of the ongoing pandemic, this review has been proposed to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of plant- based therapeutics, against SARS-CoV-2 (commonly called COVID-19) infection. It highlights the possible action of the mechanism of phytotherapeutic drugs against coronavirus inhibition, further validated by clinical trials on herbal formulas is reviewed. Though the experimental studies on COVID-19 treatment are limited, the undesirable side effects of herbal drugs and unidentified compounds cannot be ignored. OBJECTIVE: We have made an effort to study the prospective plant-derived bioactive entities and their effectiveness in the treatment of COVID-19 and also emphasize on safety and regulatory concerns of phytomedicines. METHODS: The methodology involves relevant studies on COVID-19 treatment based on herbal extracts and the purified bioactive metabolites. The e-literature survey has been done by downloading research articles available on PubMed (National Library of medicine), Elsevier, and Google scholar search engines. The keywords used are plant metabolites, natural bioactive, phytotherapeutic drugs, clinical trials, SARS-CoV-2, Coronavirus inhibitors and herbal extracts. RESULTS: The review pays particular attention to the etiological study of the COVID-19 virus and its inhibition using medicinal plant metabolites as immunomodulatory agents. The application of valuable bioactives like phenolic compounds, saponins, alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids and terpenoids in preparing herbal formula/drug has been focused on. The drug resistance of bioactive compounds and their side effects on human health were discussed for effective phytomedicine, thus, emphasizing the perspectives of phytotherapeutic drugs as a safe remedy to boost immunomodulatory functions and antiviral activity against COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Altogether, the review presents the action mechanism of plant extracts rich in bioactive compounds and depicted potential antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.

Virtual cardiac rehabilitation (VCR) offers an alternate mechanism of care delivery, capable of providing similar patient outcomes and safety profiles compared with centre-based programs. To minimize care gaps, all centres should consider developing and implementing a VCR program. The process of this rapid implementation, however, can be daunting. Centres should initially focus on the collation, utilization, and repurposing of existing resources, equipment, and technology. Once established, programs should then focus on ensuring that quality indicators are met and care processes are protocolized.

Although plant species ranges are tightly linked with their climatic tolerances, there is considerable variability in the magnitude by which biotic factors like competition and facilitation may also influence range shifts. Changes in mangrove and marsh plant abundance can alter both the above and belowground environment, which may in turn influence ecosystem services typically associated with these systems such as storm surge abatement and carbon storage. Therefore, it is key to understand (1) how the above and belowground environment of established salt marshes influences establishment of mangroves, and (2) how above and belowground environments shift in response to mangrove encroachment. Using a semi-natural mangrove planting experiment, we investigated the impact of four distinct marsh plant community structures (Batis maritima, Spartina alterniflora, mixture of B. maritima and S. alterniflora, mudflat) on mangrove survivorship and decomposition rate. In mixed marsh plots, mangrove survivorship was 42 % higher compared to survivorship in mudflat plots, and decomposition rate was 47 % greater in mixed marsh plots compared to mudflat. However, percent cover of vegetation differed across treatments, and was highest in mixed marsh plots. High survivorship in mixed marsh plots is likely due to increased protection from physical stressors by the dense aboveground cover, and belowground plant root-driven effects such as nutrient availability and oxygen delivery. Our findings suggest that above and below ground differences in salt marsh plant community structure can have an impact on the survival of encroaching mangroves, which may have implications for predicting future mangrove encroachment and improving mangrove restoration techniques.","output":"Salt Marsh Plant Community Structure Influences Success of Avicennia germinans During Poleward Encroachment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biopsy is one of the histological diagnostic techniques used to assess cells and tissues to determine the presence and extent of a simple nonneoplastic growth to complicated malignancies.

Biomedical informatics relies for the most part on structured data, which require a preexisting data or knowledge model; however, novel diseases do not have preexisting knowledge models. In an emergent epidemic, language processing can enable rapid conversion of unstructured text to a novel knowledge model. However, although this idea has often been suggested, no opportunity has arisen to actually test it in real time. The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents such an opportunity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the added value of information from clinical text in response to emergent diseases using natural language processing (NLP). METHODS: We explored the effects of long-term treatment by calcium channel blockers on the outcomes of COVID-19 infection in patients with high blood pressure during in-patient hospital stays using two sources of information: data available strictly from structured electronic health records (EHRs) and data available through structured EHRs and text mining. RESULTS: In this multicenter study involving 39 hospitals, text mining increased the statistical power sufficiently to change a negative result for an adjusted hazard ratio to a positive one. Compared to the baseline structured data, the number of patients available for inclusion in the study increased by 2.95 times, the amount of available information on medications increased by 7.2 times, and the amount of additional phenotypic information increased by 11.9 times. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, use of calcium channel blockers was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection. This finding was obtained by quickly adapting an NLP pipeline to the domain of the novel disease; the adapted pipeline still performed sufficiently to extract useful information. When that information was used to supplement existing structured data, the sample size could be increased sufficiently to see treatment effects that were not previously statistically detectable.","output":"Natural Language Processing for Rapid Response to Emergent Diseases: Case Study of Calcium Channel Blockers and Hypertension in the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global increase in cancer mortality and economic losses necessitates the cautious quest for therapeutic agents with compensatory advantages over conventional therapies.

Survivorship care services vary by geography, health system, and insurance coverage. We aimed to understand the state of survivorship care services in Wisconsins cancer facilities. METHODS: The selection of cancer treatment facilities sought to provide a geographically representative sample. An adapted Patient-Centered Survivorship Care Index was comprised of questions regarding different aspects of survivorship practices. Areas of interest included disciplines incorporated, services provided, standards of care, and discussion of late-term effects, among others. RESULTS: Out of 90 sites invited, 40 responded (44.4%). Oncologists, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners were the most common follow-up care disciplines. Risk reduction services, dietary services, access to physical activity, and behavioral health specialist referral were described as standards of care in less than half of sites. All sites reported working with community partners, 92.5% of which worked with YMCA-related programs. Discussion of long-term effects was a standard of care for all sites. Effects such as emotional distress and health practice changes were frequently discussed with almost all patients, while sexual functioning and fertility were not. CONCLUSIONS: Services and specialties related to behavioral health, fertility/sexual health, and rehabilitation and physical activity varied between sites. Such services may be offered less often due to variable insurance coverage.

Previous work has indicated that PVN dysregulation is associated with a variety of cardiometabolic diseases including those related to obesity. However, investigations have focused primarily on molecular alterations. Importantly, changes in the anatomical structure of brain networks also leads to functional alterations. While electron microscopy (EM) can provide nanometer resolution of normal/abnormal brain structures, an inherent limitation of traditional transmission EM is the random sampling of an object within a large region of interest (i.e. PVN). To overcome the inherent limitations of EM, we introduce an approach that utilizes large field of view high-resolution focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the PVN. Six week old male C57Bl/6J mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) or normal chow for 10 weeks (n=4/group), and brains prepared for SEM imaging. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which required social distancing, SEM imaging and analysis was conducted remotely (i.e. at home) using a virtual network computing approach. We first acquired interactive, zoomable maps of the PVN at a low magnification. This image was then used to navigate precisely to the PVN and acquire a high-resolution image encompassing ~30-40% of the nucleus (Figure). With this approach, we could rapidly scan for any visually apparent anatomical alterations. This initial evaluation revealed more electron dense regions within PVN neuronal nuclei, potentially indicative of heterochromatin clusters, in HFD mice relative to normal chow counterparts. Thus, we performed subsequent analysis on 80-120 neurons from each diet group by outlining neuronal nuclear envelopes and quantifying pixel distribution. This provided an indirect estimate of heterochromatin (i.e. dark pixels) and euchromatin (lighter pixels), with a shift towards darker pixels suggestive of increased chromatin ?clustering?. The area and perimeter of analyzed PVN neuronal nuclei between groups was similar (e.g. area: 4.02.9 vs 3.71.4 m2x106, normal chow vs HFD, p&lt;0.05). However, histogram analysis of pixel intensities revealed positive kurtosis, indicating that HFD resulted in a redistribution of nuclear pixels to dark and light pixel intensities (-0.050.03 vs 0.120.03 a.u., normal chow vs HFD, p&lt;0.05). Measures of skew, an indicator of curve symmetry, further revealed a leftward pixel shift (i.e. more negative skew toward dark pixels) in diet-induced obese mice (-0.480.01 vs -0.640.01 a.u., normal chow vs HFD, p&lt;0.05). Finally, we created a PVN ?map? to examine where the most altered neurons were located. In short, following HFD feeding, ?altered? neurons were distributed throughout the entire PVN and not located in discrete PVN sub-nuclei. Collectively, these findings present an approach that allows for the precise placement of PVN cells within the overall region (i.e. locating a house within a city). Moreover, they suggest that HFD feeding may disrupt PVN neuronal chromatin structure, which may be reflective of epigenetic modifications and/or transcriptional alterations.","output":"Large Field of View Scanning Electron Microscopy of the Paraventricular Nucleus of the Hypothalamus During Diet-Induced Obesity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: To analyze incidence, clinical characteristics, procedures, and in-hospital outcomes among patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) according to the presence of T2DM in Spain (2016C2019) and to assess the role of gender among those with T2DM. (2) Methods: Using the Spanish National Hospital Discharge Database, we estimated hospitalized CAP incidence. Propensity score matching was used to compare population subgroups. (3) Results: CAP was coded in 520,723 patients, of whom 140,410 (26.96%) had T2DM. The hospitalized CAP incidence was higher in patients with T2DM (both sexes) (IRR 4.25; 95% CI 4.23C4.28). The hospitalized CAP incidence was higher in men with T2DM than in women with T2DM (IRR 1.46; 95% CI 1.45C1.47). The hospitalized CAP incidence among T2DM patients increased over time; however, the in-hospital mortality (IHM) decreased between 2016 and 2019.

Objective: This study was designed to use a statistical model to elucidate dynamics of severe cases in Tokyo and to discuss the timing of effective policy activation. Methods: The study extended from April 27 through October 18, 2020 in Tokyo Metropolitan area in Japan. Medical exhaustion was defined as use of more than half of the ventilator capacity available before the COVID-19 outbreak. We regressed the number of severe cases on the newly onset patients of more than 14 days prior. As earlier research indicated, the COVID-19 severity changed at the end of May. Therefore, we added dummy variables to reflect changing severity from June and its product with newly onset patients as the explanatory variable. Then we calculated the threshold using R(t): R(t)=0.99 for the number of patients 14 days prior was used as a threshold at which strong countermeasures should be activated to keep to avoid medical exhaustion. Results: The critical number signaling medical exhaustion in Tokyo was defined as 655 cases. We selected 15, 30, 60 and 90 days prior as explanatory variables for explaining the number of severe cases. A coefficient of determination larger than 0.95 was inferred as indicating good fit. The threshold was estimated as more than 4500 cases for R(t)=1.1 and monotonically decreasing by R(t) to be 600 cases for R(t)=2.5. Discussion and Conclusion: Results showed that newly onset patients reported more than 14 days prior can explain the number of severe cases very well. We also confirmed the threshold number of patients 14 days prior by R(t) for which strong countermeasures should be activated to avoid medical exhaustion with R(t)=0.99.

METHODS An observational study based on a prospective database of patients with ultrasound (US) and computerized tomography (CT) confirmed ALCD was conducted at our center from April 2018 to May 2019. The primary outcome was the success rate of outpatient management. Secondary outcomes were the association between different WSES stages, clinical and analytical parameters, treatments modalities, and outcomes, and the accuracy of US for management decisions. RESULTS A total of 230 patients were included. Outpatient management was successful in 51/53 (96.23%) cases with ALCD stage 0 and 62/72 (86.11%) patients with stage 1A. There were no differences in age (p = 0.076) or the presence of pericolic air bubbles (p = 0.06) between patients who underwent admission or outpatient management. Clinical and analytical data, treatment decisions, and outcomes showed statistically significant differences between WSES stages. In 7/12 patients with stage 2A, percutaneous drainage or emergency surgery was required. All cases with stage 2B (distant air) underwent conservative management without the need for emergency or elective surgery. The accuracy of US WSES stages for management decisions, when compared with CT, was 96.96%. CONCLUSION The WSES classification for ALCD seemed to be valid helping clinicians in the decision-making process to select between admission or outpatient management. Differences in clinical and analytical data, elected treatments, and outcomes were found between WSES stages.

Quantitative PCR of the 16S rRNA gene and high throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was performed on DNA extracted from PM10 samples. Results showed that, despite the bacterial abundance (mean = 2.82  105 16S rRNA genes/m3 of air) being, on average, higher during day-time and weekdays, compared to night-time and weekends, respectively, the differences were not statistically significant. The average PM10 mass concentration on the platform was 107 g/m3. However, there was no significant correlation between 16S rRNA gene abundance and overall PM10 levels.

Here we report changes from 2013 to 2018 in PrEP and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) awareness and use among HIV-negative gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) and assess predictors of PrEP initiation. METHODS: In the prospective cohort study Attitudes to, and Understanding of Risk of Acquisition of HIV 2 (AURAH2), MSM were recruited from three sexual health clinics in England: two in London and one in Brighton, UK. Men were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older and HIV-negative or of unknown HIV status. Participants self-completed a baseline paper questionnaire at one of the three clinics between July 30, 2013, and April 30, 2016, and were subsequently able to complete 4-monthly and annual online questionnaires, which were available between March 1, 2015, and March 31, 2018, and collected information on sociodemographics, health and wellbeing, HIV status, and sexual behaviours. PrEP and PEP use in the previous 12 months was obtained at baseline and in annual questionnaires. We assessed trends over calendar time in 3-month periods from first enrolment to the end of the study period (July-December, 2013, was counted as one period) in use of PrEP and PEP using generalised estimating equation logistic models. We used age-adjusted Poisson models to assess factors associated with PrEP initiation among participants who reported never having used PrEP at baseline. FINDINGS: 1162 men completed a baseline questionnaire, among whom the mean age was 34 years (SD 104), and of those with available data, 942 (82%) of 1150 were white, 1076 (94%) of 1150 were gay, and 857 (74%) of 1159 were university educated. 622 (54%) of 1162 men completed at least one follow-up online questionnaire, of whom 483 (78%) completed at least one annual questionnaire. Overall, PrEP use in the past year increased from 0% (none of 28 respondents) in July to December, 2013, to 43% (23 of 53) in January to March, 2018. The corresponding increase in PrEP use among men who reported condomless sex with two or more partners was from 0% (none of 13 respondents) to 78% (21 of 27). PEP use peaked in April to June, 2016, at 28% (41 of 147 respondents), but decreased thereafter to 8% (four of 53) in January to March, 2018. Among 460 men who had never used PrEP at baseline, predictors of initiating PrEP included age 40-44 years (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 425, 95% CI 114-1579) and 45 years and older (359, 108-1197) versus younger than 25 years; and after adjustment for age, recent HIV test (517, 189-1408), condomless sex (501, 216-1163), condomless sex with two or more partners (543, 299-986), group sex (169, 101-284), and non-injection chemsex-related drugs use (286, 167-491) in the past 3 months, PEP use (469, 283-779) in the past 12 months, and calendar year (Jan 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018 vs July 30, 2013, to Dec 31, 2015: 2119, 948-4735). Non-employment (035, 014-091) and unstable or no housing (vs homeowner 013, 002-095) were associated with reduced rates of PrEP initiation after adjustment for age. About half of PrEP was obtained via the internet, even after the PrEP Impact trial had started (11 [48%] of 23 respondents in January to March, 2018). INTERPRETATION: PrEP awareness and use increased substantially from 2013 to 2018 among a cohort of MSM in England. Improving access to PrEP by routine commissioning by National Health Service England could increase PrEP use among all eligible MSM, but should include public health strategies to target socioeconomic and demographic disparities in knowledge and use of PrEP.

Coagulation necrosis was created in the pig livers by the use of one of three RFA protocols: 1) group A, monopolar RFA using a 15-G Octopus? electrode with a 5-mm inter-electrode distance (n = 4); 2) group B, monopolar RFA using a 15-G Octopus? electrode with a 10-mm inter-electrode distance (n = 6); and 3) group C, switching monopolar RFA using two 15-G Octopus? electrodes (n = 8). The energy efficiency, shape, maximum and minimum diameters (Dmx and Dmi), and the volume of the coagulation volume were measured in each group. The Summary statistics were obtained and Mann-Whitney test was were performed. RESULTS The mean ablated volume of each group was 49.23 cm(3) in A, 64.11 cm(3) in B, and 72.35 cm(3) in C. The mean Dmx and Dmi values were 5.68 cm and 4.58 cm in A and 5.97 cm and 4.97 cm in B, respectively. In group C, the mean diameters of Dmx and Dmi were 6.80 cm and 5.11 cm, respectively. The mean ratios of Dmi/Dmx were 1.25, 1.20, and 1.35 in groups A, B, and C, respectively. There was one animal death during the RFA procedure, the cause of which could not be subsequently determined. However, there were no other significant, procedure-related complications during the seven-hour-delayed CT scans.

How IL-35 functions in ARDS is unclear. The purpose of our study was to determine what role IL-35 played in the development of ARDS. Here we found serum IL-35 concentrations were significantly elevated in patients with ARDS relative to healthy people. Moreover, we established a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide- and cecal ligation and puncture-induced ARDS treated with neutralizing antibodies (anti-IL-35 Ebi3 or anti-IL-35 P35); the results showed that lung injury occurred more often than in untreated models and the inflammatory cytokines CXCL-1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-6, and IL-17A increased significantly after neutralizing antibody treatment in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum. Therefore IL-35 can protect against the development of ARDS. Even more interesting in our study was that we discovered IL-35 expression differed between lung and spleen across different ARDS models, which further demonstrated that the spleen likely has an important role in extrapulmonary ARDS model only, improving the ratio of CD4(+)/CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)(Tregs). Meanwhile in our clinical work, we also found that the concentration of IL-35 and the ratio of CD4(+)/Treg in the serum are higher and the mortality is lower than those with the spleen deficiency in patients with extrapulmonary ARDS.

However, endotoxin contamination, plasmid vector instability, and the requirement for antibiotic supplementation are frequent bottlenecks in the successful production of recombinant proteins that are safe for industrial-scaled applications. To overcome these drawbacks, we focused on interrupting the expression of several key genes involved in the synthesis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin frequently responsible for toxicity in recombinant proteins, to eliminate endotoxin contamination and produce better recombinant proteins with E. coli. RESULTS: Of 8 potential target genes associated with LPS synthesis, we successfully constructed 7 LPS biosynthesis-defective recombinant strains to reduce the production of LPS. The endotoxin residue in the protein products from these modified E. coli strains were about two orders of magnitude lower than that produced by the wild-type strain. Further, we found that 6 locilpxM, lpxP, lpxL, eptA, gutQ and kdsDwere suitable for chromosomal integrated expression of HPV L1 protein. We found that a single copy of the expression cassette conferred stable expression during long-term antibiotic-free cultivation as compared with the more variable protein production from plasmid-based expression. In large-scale fermentation, we found that recombinant strains bearing 3 to 5 copies of the expression cassette had 1.5- to 2-fold higher overall expression along with lower endotoxin levels as compared with the parental ER2566 strain. Finally, we engineered and constructed 9 recombinant E. coli strains for the later production of an HPV 9-valent capsid protein with desirable purity, VLP morphology, and antigenicity. CONCLUSIONS: Reengineering the LPS synthesis loci in the E. coli ER2566 strain through chromosomal integration of expression cassettes has potential uses for the production of a 9-valent HPV vaccine candidate, with markedly reduced residual endotoxin levels.

Moreover, the expression of TGEV N gene promoted translocation of Bax to mitochondria, which in turn caused the release of cytochrome c, followed by activation of caspase-3, resulting in cell apoptosis in the transfected PK-15 cells following cell cycle arrest. Further studies showed that p53 inhibitor attenuated TGEV N protein induced cell cycle arrest at S and G2/M phases and apoptosis through reversing the expression changes of cdc2, cdk2 and cyclin B1 and the translocation changes of Bax and cytochrome c induced by TGEV N protein. Taken together, these results demonstrated that TGEV N protein might play an important role in TGEV infection-induced p53 activation and cell cycle arrest at the S and G2/M phases and apoptosis occurrence.","output":"TGEV nucleocapsid protein induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through activation of p53 signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic suddenly affected all countries and health care systems from different perspectives including severe disruption of chronic disease services including diabetes. Diabetes is a serious condition and highly present in Bosnia and Herzegovina population, so provision of diabetes care is a important part of good control. Countries had different responses to adopt diabetes care under new circumstances as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina. AIM: To investigate and evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of diabetology care in Bosnia and Herzegovina from the perspective of patients and diabetologists. METHODS: Online survey for diabetologists and patient organizations have been developed with adopted question for different perspectives. The survey has been conducted online early September 2020. Collected data were analyzed in SPSS software for descriptive statistics. RESULTS: 25 diabetologists and 24 diabetes patient organizations responded. 72% of diabetologists believe that pandemic has partially altered work with patients and 56% believe that the organization of diabetes care has successfully responded to the new circumstances but 80% believe that the diabetes care system should change. 75% of patient organizations thought that the organization of diabetes care did not adequately respond and 87.5% believe system should change. CONCLUSION: No significant differences found between RS and FBiH when it comes to majority of questions. Both diabetologists and patients consider that system of diabetes care in Bosnia and Herzegovina should be improved in future. It has been also found that diabetologists in Bosnia and Herzegovina responded and adopted their practices similar to other countries.","output":"Diabetology Care During COVID-19 Lockdown in Bosnia and Herzegovina C Diabetologists and Patients Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper discusses the techniques which are currently implemented for vaccine production based on virus-like particles (VLPs).

As a result, the focus of attention has shifted from the approaches to VLP production to the development of a precise interface between the organisms immune system and the peptides inducing a strong immune response to pathogens or the organisms own pathological cells.

However, there is a paucity of evidence quantifying PTSD status globally during confinement in quarantine/isolation facilities during COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to assess the PTSD status and factors contributing to PTSD development in quarantined/isolated people during pandemic. Using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) scale, our multicentre, multinational, and cross-sectional online survey assessed the psychological impacts on the quarantine/isolation experience of participants suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19, their PTSD status, and various correlates with developing PTSD. We had 944 (35.33%) valid responses (51.1% from females), mostly from Asian countries (635, 71.4%), and 33.9% were healthcare workers. The number of quarantine days in the PTSD symptoms group (using the IES-R cutoff of 24 for symptomatic or full PTSD) was significantly shorter compared to the non-PTSD group (14 (range 14C40) vs. 14 (14C23.75), p = 0.031). Lower rates of PTSD symptoms were observed in participants practicing Buddhist religion than in participants having no religion (OR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.13C0.68; p = 0.005); individuals with vocational training had a higher risk of developing PTSD symptoms (OR: 2.28 (1.04C5.15); p = 0.043) compared to university graduates. Individuals forced to be quarantined/isolated had higher odds of developing PTSD symptoms than those voluntarily quarantined/isolated (OR: 2.92 (1.84C4.74); p < 0.001). We identified several PTSD correlations among individuals quarantined/isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic, including religious practice, reason for quarantine/isolation, education level, and being a case of the infection.

Forecasting the number of cases infected with this virus can help authorities make accurate decisions on the interventions that must be implemented to control the pandemic. Investigation of the studies on COVID-19 forecasting indicates that various techniques such as statistical, mathematical, and machine and deep learning have been utilized. Although deep learning models have shown promising results in this context, their performance can be improved using auxiliary features. Therefore, in this study, we propose two hybrid deep learning methods that utilize the statistical features as auxiliary inputs and associate them with their main input. Specifically, we design a hybrid method of the multihead attention mechanism and the statistical features (ATT_FE) and a combined method of convolutional neural network and the statistical features (CNN_FE) and apply them to COVID-19 data of 10 countries with the highest number of confirmed cases. The results of experiments indicate that the hybrid models outperform their conventional counterparts in terms of performance measures.

The state of the population is described as a vector in the tensor product space of $N$ individual probability vector spaces, whose dimension equals the number of compartments of the epidemiological model $n_c$. The transition rate matrix for the $n_c^N$-dimensional Markov chain is obtained by taking suitable linear combinations of tensor products of $n_c$-dimensional matrices. The resulting transition rate matrix is a sum over bilocal linear operators, which gives insight in the microscopic dynamics of the system. The more familiar and non-linear node-based mean-field approximations are recovered by restricting the exact models to uncorrelated (separable) states. We show how the exact transition rate matrix for the susceptible-infected (SI) model can be used to find analytic solutions for SI outbreaks on trees and the cycle graph for finite $N$.","output":"Exact epidemic models from a tensor product formulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged researchers working in physical contact with research participants.

These mutations cluster within three functionally important regions of the S-gene at sites that will likely impact (1) interactions between subunits of the Spike trimer and the predisposition of subunits to shift from down to up configurations, (2) interactions of Spike with ACE2 receptors, and (3) the priming of Spike for membrane fusion. We show here that, based on both the rarity of these 13 mutations in intrapatient sequencing reads and patterns of selection at the codon sites where the mutations occur in SARS-CoV-2 and related sarbecoviruses, prior to the emergence of Omicron the mutations would have been predicted to decrease the fitness of any virus within which they occurred. We further propose that the mutations in each of the three clusters therefore cooperatively interact to both mitigate their individual fitness costs, and, in combination with other mutations, adaptively alter the function of Spike. Given the evident epidemic growth advantages of Omicron overall previously known SARS-CoV-2 lineages, it is crucial to determine both how such complex and highly adaptive mutation constellations were assembled within the Omicron S-gene, and why, despite unprecedented global genomic surveillance efforts, the early stages of this assembly process went completely undetected.","output":"Selection Analysis Identifies Clusters of Unusual Mutational Changes in Omicron Lineage BA.1 That Likely Impact Spike Function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Naringenin (NRG) is a polyphenolic phytochemical belonging to the class of flavanones and is widely distributed in citrus fruits and some other fruits such as bergamot, tomatoes, cocoa, and cherries.

Gavi-supported countries continue to implement and report strategies that aim to address implementation challenges and improve equity. This paper summarizes the first mapping of these strategies from country reports. METHODS: Thirteen Gavi-supported countries were purposively selected with emphasis on Gavi's priority countries. Following a scoping of different documents submitted to Gavi by countries, 47 Gavi Joint Appraisals (JAs) for the period 2016-2019 from the 13 selected countries were included in the mapping. We used a consolidated framework synthesized from 16 different equity and health systems frameworks, which incorporated UNICEF's coverage and equity assessment approach - an adaptation of the Tanahashi model. Using search terms, the mapping was conducted using a combination of manual search and the MAXQDA qualitative analysis tool. Pro-equity strategies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified and compiled in an Excel database, and then populated on a tableau visualization dashboard. RESULTS: In total, 258 pro-equity strategies were implemented by the 13 sampled Gavi-supported countries between 2016 and 2019. The framework determinants of social norms, utilization, and management and coordination accounted for more than three-quarters of all pro-equity strategies implemented in these countries. The median number of strategies reported per country was 17. Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Uganda reported the highest number of strategies that we considered as pro-equity. CONCLUSION: Findings from this mapping can be useful in addressing equity gaps, reaching partially immunized, and 'zero-dose' vaccinated children, and valuable resource for countries planning to implement pro-equity strategies, especially as immunization stakeholders reimagine immunization delivery in light of COVID-19, and as Gavi finalizes its fifth organizational strategy.

Bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) is the most applicable bedside technique. However, bioimpedance has not been validated in the critically ill, and the interpretation of the measurements poses challenges. This review discusses the potential clinical applications of BIA and explores caveats and solutions to its use in the intensive care setting. RECENT FINDINGS: A correlation is repeatedly found between raw impedance parameters, fluid ratios, overhydration, and adverse outcome of critical illness. However, cut-off and reference values remain elusive. Experience with BIA-guided fluid management in the ICU is limited. BIA-derived muscle mass appears a promising biomarker for sarcopenia, correlating well with CT-analysis. Body cell mass and fat-free mass provide potential use in estimation of metabolic rate, protein requirements and pharmacokinetics. Several methods of reducing bias in BIA parameters in critical illness require validation. SUMMARY: There are currently too many uncertainties and discrepancies regarding interpretation of bioimpedance in critical illness, to justify therapeutic consequences.

Health information intermediaries play a critical role in assisting consumers with navigating the complexities of the United States health care system and the ever-changing health care policy landscape. Not much is known about the health insurance literacy (HIL) levels of information intermediaries and their ability to assist consumers with making informed decisions about their health insurance. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the association between information intermediary levels of HIL, sociodemographic factors, and confidence and behaviors in assisting consumers with health insurance needs. METHODS: We surveyed 118 information intermediaries from various roles to assess objective and subjective HIL, frequency, and confidence in assisting consumers, and confidence in understanding changes in federal health reform policies and state Medicaid waiver programs. KEY RESULTS: Less than one-half (39%) of information intermediaries had high subjective HIL and much fewer (13%) had high objective HIL. The average frequency of assisting consumers with health insurance scores were somewhat low, and confidence in assisting consumers with health insurance scores and confidence with understanding state and federal policies were modest. Results from our logistic regression model indicated that confidence in assisting consumers was found to be the only significant contributor to high subjective HIL. For every one-point increase on the confidence assisting subscale, there was a 35% increase in the information intermediaries having high subjective HIL. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study, coupled with rising uninsured rates, indicate the need for tailored training programs and resources to equip our information intermediaries to provide timely and appropriate health insurance support for consumers.

However, the effects of the pandemic were likely not felt evenly across the religious landscape. PURPOSE: We used data from the fourth wave of the National Congregations Study, gathered on the eve of the coronavirus pandemic in 2018C19, to identify the kinds of congregations that may have been especially vulnerable to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using bivariate and multiple regression analysis, we examined two aspects of congregations' preparedness for the pandemic: technological infrastructure and financial stability. RESULTS: We found that, while many congregations were technologically and financially equipped for a time of social distancing and economic recession, there were stark inequalities in levels of preparedness among congregations on the basis of race, class, size, urban/rural location, religious tradition, and the age of congregations' parishioners. In particular, Catholic congregations and congregations with older attendees tended to lack streaming or online communication capacities, and both rural and small congregations had more limited technological infrastructure and less financial cushion. Somewhat surprisingly, predominantly Black congregations were more likely to have worship streaming systems set up prior to the pandemic, though these congregations were more likely to lack other kinds of technological and financial infrastructure.

METHODS Using data (n = 495; mean age 62.9 years (SD 18.6), 50.5% female) from a prospective cohort study of patients discharged from medical wards at two university hospitals, the prognostic ability of EQ-5D-3L was examined using C-statistic, Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI) Index, and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). The associations between EQ-5D-3L dimensions, total sum, index and VAS scores at the time of discharge and 30-day post-discharge ED visits, readmission, and readmission/death were examined using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS At the time of discharge, 58.6% of participants reported problems in mobility, 28.3% in self-care, 62.1% in usual activities, 62.7% in pain/discomfort, and 42.4% in anxiety/depression. Mean (SD) total sum score was 7.9 (2.0), index score was 0.69 (0.21), and VAS score was 63.7 (18.4). In adjusted analyses, mobility, self-care, usual activities, and the total sum score were significantly associated with 30-day readmission and readmission/death. Differences in C-statistic for LACE readmission prediction models with and without EQ-5D-3L were small. AIC analysis suggests that readmission prediction models containing EQ-5D-3L dimensions or scores were more often preferred to those with the LACE index only. IDI analysis indicates that the discrimination slope of readmission prediction models is significantly improved with the addition of mobility, self-care, or the total sum score of the EQ-5D-3L.

Our primary hypotheses were that RV-C target ciliated airway epithelial cells (AECs), and that cell specificity is determined by restricted and high expression of the only known RV-C cell-entry factor, cadherin related family member 3 (CDHR3). METHODS: RV-C15 (C15) infection in differentiated human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) cultures was assessed using immunofluorescent and time-lapse epifluorescent imaging. Morphology of C15-infected differentiated AECs was assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: C15 produced a scattered pattern of infection, and infected cells were shed from the epithelium. The percentage of cells infected with C15 varied from 1.4 to 14.7% depending on cell culture conditions. Infected cells had increased staining for markers of ciliated cells (acetylated-alpha-tubulin [aat], p < 0.001) but not markers of goblet cells (wheat germ agglutinin or Muc5AC, p = ns). CDHR3 expression was increased on ciliated epithelial cells, but not other epithelial cells (p < 0.01). C15 infection caused a 27.4% reduction of ciliated cells expressing CDHR3 (p < 0.01). During differentiation of AECs, CDHR3 expression progressively increased and correlated with both RV-C binding and replication. CONCLUSIONS: The RV-C only replicate in ciliated AECs in vitro, leading to infected cell shedding. CDHR3 expression positively correlates with RV-C binding and replication, and is largely confined to ciliated AECs. Our data imply that factors regulating differentiation and CDHR3 production may be important determinants of RV-C illness severity.

Moreover, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance and AMS have been deprioritised with diversion of health system resources to the pandemic response. This experience highlights deficiencies in AMR containment and mitigation strategies that require urgent attention from clinical and scientific communities. These include the need to implement diagnostic stewardship to assess the global incidence of coinfections and secondary infections in COVID-19 patients, including those by multidrug-resistant pathogens, to identify patients most likely to benefit from antibiotic treatment and identify when antibiotics can be safely withheld, de-escalated or discontinued. Long-term global surveillance of clinical and societal antibiotic use and resistance trends is required to prepare for subsequent changes in AMR epidemiology, while ensuring uninterrupted supply chains and preventing drug shortages and stock outs. These interventions present implementation challenges in resource-constrained settings, making a case for implementation research on AMR.

Thyroid hormones play a key role in modulating metabolism and the immune system. However, the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction (TD) and its association with the prognosis of COVID-19 have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we seek to address this gap and understand the link between TD and COVID-19. METHODS: Herein, we enrolled patients who were hospitalised with COVID-19 and had normal or abnormal thyroid function test results at the West Court of Union Hospital in Wuhan, China, between 29 January and 26 February 2020. We carried out follow up examinations until 26 April 2020. Data on clinical features, treatment strategies, and prognosis were collected and analysed. TD was defined as an abnormal thyroid function test result, including overt thyrotoxicosis, overt hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism, and euthyroid sick syndrome. RESULTS: A total of 25 and 46 COVID-19 patients with and without TD, respectively, were included in the study. COVID-19 patients with TD had significantly higher neutrophil counts and higher levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, serum creatine kinase, aspartate transaminase, and high-sensitive troponin I and a longer activated partial thromboplastin time but lower lymphocyte, platelet, and eosinophil counts. A longitudinal analysis of serum biomarkers showed that patients with TD presented persistently high levels of biomarkers for inflammatory response and cardiac injury. COVID-19 patients with TD were more likely to develop a critical subtype of the disease. Patients with TD had a significantly higher fatality rate than did those without TD during hospitalisation (20% vs 0%, P<0.0001). Patients with TD were more likely to stay in the hospital for more than 28 days than were those without TD (80% vs 56.52%, P=0.048).

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: No therapies exist for ARDS and treatment is purely supportive. Interleukin-22 (IL-22) plays an integral component in recovery of the lung from infection. IL-22:Fc is a recombinant protein with a human FC immunoglobulin that increases the half-life of IL-22. STUDY DESIGN: ARDS was induced in C57BL/6 mice with intra-tracheal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at a dose of 33.3 or 100 ug. In the low-dose LPS group (LDG), IL-22:FC was administered via tail vein injection at 30 minutes (n = 9) and compared to sham (n = 9). In the high-dose LPS group (HDG), IL-22:FC was administered (n = 11) then compared to sham (n = 8). Euthanasia occurred after bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) on post-injury day 4. RESULTS: In the LDG, IL-22:FC resulted in decreased protein leak (0.15 vs. 0.25 ug/uL, p = 0.02). BAL protein in animals receiving IL-22:Fc in the HDG was not different. For the HDG, animals receiving IL-22:Fc had lower BAL cell counts (539,636 vs 3,147,556 cells/uL, p = 0.02). For the HDG, IL-6 (110.6 vs. 527.1 pg/mL, p = 0.04), TNF- (5.87 vs. 25.41 pg/mL, p = 0.04), and G-CSF (95.14 vs. 659.6, p = 0.01) levels were lower in the BAL fluid of IL-22:Fc treated animals compared to sham.

The COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique natural experiment because the source of unemployment is very likely to be exogenous to the individual. This study assessed the effect of job loss and job furlough on the mental health of individuals in South Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. DATA AND METHODS: The data for the study came from the first and second waves of the national survey, the National Income Dynamics-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (NIDS-CRAM), conducted during May-June and July-August 2020, respectively. The sample for NIDS-CRAM was drawn from an earlier national survey, conducted in 2017, which had collected data on mental health. Questions on depressive symptoms during the lockdown were asked in Wave 2 of NIDS-CRAM, using a 2-question version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). The PHQ-2 responses (0-6 on the discrete scale) were regrouped into four categories making the ordered logit regression model the most suited for assessing the impact of employment status on depressive symptoms. RESULTS: The study revealed that adults who retained paid employment during the COVID-19 lockdown had significantly lower depression scores than adults who lost employment. The benefits of employment also accumulated over time, underscoring the effect of unemployment duration on mental health. The analysis revealed no mental health benefits to being furloughed (on unpaid leave), but paid leave had a strong and significant positive effect on the mental health of adults. CONCLUSIONS: The economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unprecedented job losses, which impaired mental wellbeing significantly.

CRC and Immunotherapy cohorts from public repository were used to determine the prognosis and immune response of TME clusters. RESULTS The fibroblasts, macrophages, T and B cells were respectively grouped into 4 to 5 subclusters and then classified according to various biological processes and different marker genes. Furthermore, it revealed that the m6A RNA methylation regulators might be significantly related to the clinical and biological features of CRC, as well as the pseudotime trajectories of main TME cell types. Bulk-seq analysis suggested that these m6A-mediated TME cell subclusters had significant prognostic value for CRC patients and distinguished immune response for patients who underwent ICB therapy, especially for the CAFs and macrophages. Notably, CellChat analysis revealed that RNA m6A methylation-associated cell subtypes of TME cells manifested diverse and extensive interaction with tumor epithelial cells. Further analysis showed that ligand-receptor pairs, including MIF - (CD74 + CXCR4), MIF - (CD74 + CD44), MDK-NCL and LGALS9 - CD45, etc. mediated the communication between m6A associated subtypes of TME cells and tumor epithelial cells.

METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was performed involving patients histologically diagnosed with multicentric lesions between January 2018 and October 2019. Controls were patients histologically diagnosed with single cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and admitted during the same period. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to assess the risk factors for multicentric lesions.

Host-targeting antivirals could therefore be considered as an alternative or complementary strategy in the management of HSV infections. To contribute to this advancement, here we report on the ability of a new generation inhibitor of a key cellular enzyme of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), to inhibit HSV-1 and HSV-2 in vitro replication, with a potency comparable to that of the reference drug acyclovir. Analysis of the HSV replication cycle in MEDS433-treated cells revealed that it prevented the accumulation of viral genomes and reduced late gene expression, thus suggesting an impairment at a stage prior to viral DNA replication consistent with the ability of MEDS433 to inhibit DHODH activity. In fact, the anti-HSV activity of MEDS433 was abrogated by the addition of exogenous uridine or of the product of DHODH, the orotate, thus confirming DHODH as the MEDS433 specific target in HSV-infected cells. A combination of MEDS433 with dipyridamole (DPY), an inhibitor of the pyrimidine salvage pathway, was then observed to be effective in inhibiting HSV replication even in the presence of exogenous uridine, thus mimicking in vivo conditions. Finally, when combined with acyclovir and DPY in checkerboard experiments, MEDS433 exhibited highly synergistic antiviral activity. Taken together, these findings suggest that MEDS433 is a promising candidate as either single agent or in combination regimens with existing direct-acting anti-HSV drugs to develop new strategies for treatment of HSV infections.","output":"Effective deploying of a novel DHODH inhibitor against herpes simplex type 1 and type 2 replication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text].","output":"Annals for Hospitalists Inpatient Notes - Preparing for Battle: How Hospitalists Can Manage the Stress of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the spread of COVID-19, many cultural and artistic institutions around the world have been forced to temporally close doors to protect attendees from the transmission risks.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study collected the DDC data from Department of Dentistry, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan. The data including age, sex, geographic locations, place of residence, grade of disability, and type of dental treatment for the patients were obtained and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 419 patients (168 females and 251 males) who received dental treatment were included in the study. The average age was 57.4 years old. The total DDC services were up to 2444 visits. The top of place of residence for DDC is patient's home (231/419; 55.13%). Scaling was the most common type of dental treatment for DDC (317/419; 75.67%). The male patients whose age <60 years old had received more DDC (p = 0.002). The profound grade of disability had higher DDC in age <60 years old group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Taken together, this study demonstrates the demographic data of DDC in central Taiwan. The results may be valuable for governmental policy to improve the availability of DDC and in turn to facilitate oral health in this specific group of dental patients.","output":"The implementation of domiciliary dental care from a university hospital: A retrospective review of the patients and performed treatments in central Taiwan from 2010 to 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate testing to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA is key to counteract the virus spread.

Swab samples were collected from infected patients and from laboratory personnel using a commercially available viral transport solution and the in-house DS. Samples were tested by RT-qPCR, and exposure to infective viruses was also accessed by ELISA. The DS used did not interfere with viral genome detection and was able to maintain RNA integrity for up to 16 days at room temperature. Furthermore, virus loaded onto DS were inactivated, as attested by attempts to grow SARS-CoV-2 in cell monolayers after DS desalt filtration to remove toxic residues.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis was confirmed by a SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) on nasal swab. On day 14, pulmonary examination deteriorated with haemoptysis and a major increase of inflammatory response. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed nodules highly suggestive of IA. Aspergillus antigen was found highly positive in sputum and blood, as was Aspergillus spp PCR on serum. Sputum cultures remained negative for Aspergillus. This patient died rapidly from severe respiratory failure, despite the addition of voriconazole. Considering SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as an acquired immunodeficiency, we report here a new case of probable IA based on clinical and biological arguments, in accordance with the last consensus definition of invasive fungal disease. On a routine basis, we have detected 30% of aspergillosis carriage (positive culture and antigen in tracheal secretions) in critically ill patients with COVID-19 in our centre.

However, current methods of identification rely on cumbersome paper-based assessments, which are lengthy and time-consuming to complete and resource-intensive for schools to manage. Artemis-A is a prototype web app that uses computerized adaptive testing technology to shorten the length of the assessment and provides schools with a simple and feasible solution for mental health assessment. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are to coproduce the main components of the Artemis-A app with stakeholders to enhance the user interface, to carry out usability testing and finalize the interface design and functionality, and to explore the acceptability and feasibility of using Artemis-A in schools. METHODS: This study involved 2 iterative design feedback cyclesan initial stakeholder consultation to inform the app design and user testing. Using a user-centered design approach, qualitative data were collected through focus groups and interviews with secondary school pupils, parents, school staff, and mental health professionals (N=48). All transcripts were thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Initial stakeholder consultations provided feedback on preferences for the user interface design, school administration of the assessment, and outcome reporting. The findings informed the second iteration of the app design and development. The unmoderated usability assessment indicated that young people found the app easy to use and visually appealing. However, school staff suggested that additional features should be added to the school administration panel, which would provide them with more flexibility for data visualization. The analysis identified four themes relating to the implementation of the Artemis-A in schools, including the anticipated benefits and drawbacks of the app. Actionable suggestions for designing mental health assessment apps are also provided. CONCLUSIONS: Artemis-A is a potentially useful tool for secondary schools to assess the mental health of their pupils that requires minimal staff input and training.

It consists of a robot with 6 degrees of freedom that is manipulated using an operation interface to perform needle insertions under CT-guidance. The procedure includes robot positioning, needle targeting, and needle insertion.

Most subjects produced, over the foot area, significant event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns around Cz when performing MI and receiving passive pedaling. The sharpest decrease was found for the low beta band. The connectivity results revealed an exchange of information between the supplementary motor area (SMA) and parietal regions during MI and passive pedaling.

Although ultrasound-guided (USG) TPVB has been described, there are no reports of USG multilevel TPVB for surgical anesthesia during PBCS. The aim of this prospective observational study was to determine the feasibility of performing USG multilevel TPVB, at the T1-T6 vertebral levels (6m-TPVB), and to evaluate its efficacy in providing surgical anesthesia for PBCS. Patients and Methods Twenty-five female patients undergoing PBCS received an USG 6m-TPVB for surgical anesthesia. Four milliliters of ropivacaine 0.5% (with epinephrine 1:200,000) was injected at each vertebral level. Dexmedetomidine infusion (0.1-0.5 g.kg-1.h-1) was used for conscious sedation. Success of the block, for surgical anesthesia, was defined as being able to complete the PBCS without having to resort to rescue analgesia or convert to GA. Results The USG 6m-TPVB was successfully performed on all 25 patients but it was effective as the sole anesthetic in only 20% (5/25) of patients. The remaining 80% (20/25) reported pain during separation of the breast from the pectoralis major muscle and its fascia. Surgery was successfully completed using small doses of intravenous ketamine (mean total dose, 38.020.5 mg) as supplementary analgesia. Conclusion USG 6m-TPVB is technically feasible but does not consistently provide complete surgical anesthesia for PBCS that involves surgical dissection on the pectoralis major muscle and its fascia.

However, Taiwan is a country with a low COVID-19 threat, and peoples daily lives have remained mostly unchanged during this period. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the trend of trauma incidence and the service of trauma care is affected by the relatively minor COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan. DESIGN: A single-institute, retrograde cohort study. SETTING: An observational study based on the trauma registry of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH). PARTICIPANTS: Trauma patients presented to the emergency department of CGMH in the period of 1 January to 30 June 2020 (week 1 to week 26) were designated as the COVID-19 group, with 1980 patients in total. Patients of the same period in 2015C2019 were designated as the pre-COVID-19 group, with 10 334 patients overall. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome is the incidence of trauma admission. Differences in trauma mechanism, severity, location and outcome were also compared in both groups. RESULTS: A decrease in trauma incidence during March and April 2020 was noticed. Significant change (p<0.001) in trauma mechanisms was discovered, with decreased burn (5.8% vs 3.6%) and assault (4.8% vs 1.2%), and increased transport accidents (43.2% vs 47.2%) and suicide (0.2% vs 1.0%) in the COVID-19 cohort. A shift in injury locations was also found with a 5% decrement of workplace injuries (19.8% vs 14.8%, p<0.001).

The results of hospital-based surveillance aiming at describing the aetiology and epidemiology of respiratory distress among children <5 years of age are presented. METHODS Children admitted to the H?pital d'Enfants de Rabat, Morocco, and meeting the World Health Organization clinical criteria for severe pneumonia were recruited over a period of 14 months and were thoroughly investigated to ascertain a definitive diagnosis. RESULTS In total, 700 children were recruited for the study. Most frequent clinical diagnoses included wheezing-related conditions (bronchitis/asthma, 46%; bronchiolitis, 15%), while typical bacterial pneumonia was infrequent (only 19% of the cases). Invasive bacterial disease detected by classical microbiology or molecular methods was also uncommon, affecting only 3.5% of the patients, and with an overall low detection of pneumococcal or Haemophilus influenzae type b disease. Conversely, coverage of respiratory viral detection in the nasopharynx was almost universal among cases (92%), with the three most frequent viruses detected being rhinovirus (53%), respiratory syncytial virus (18%) and adenovirus (17%). The overall case fatality rate (CFR) among recruited patients with a known outcome was 4.1% (28/690).

DESIGNThis work is based on data collected by the National Child Mortality Database (NCMD) which collates data on all children who die in England. The number of deaths, and their characteristics, from 1st April 2020 until 31st of March 2021 (2020-21), were compared to those from the same period of 2019-20. Relative risk and excess mortality were derived for deaths in 2020-21 vs 2019-20. SETTINGAll deaths reported to NCMD in England of children under 18 years of age, between April 2019 and March 2021. PARTICIPANTS6490 deaths of children, under the age of 18 years, reported to the NCMD over the study period. RESULTSChildren who died between April 2020 and March 2021 had similar demographics to those who died in 2019-20. Overall, there were 356 (198 to 514) fewer deaths in 2020-21 than in 2019-20 (RR 0.90 (0.85-0.94), p<0.001). Repeating the analysis by category of death, suggested that deaths from infection (RR 0.49 (0.38-0.64)) and from other underlying medical conditions (RR 0.75 (0.68-0.82)) were lower in 2020-21 than 2019-20, and weak evidence (p=0.074) that this was also true of deaths from substance abuse. CONCLUSIONSChildhood mortality in England during the first year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was the lowest on record, with over 300 fewer deaths than the preceding 12 months. The greatest reduction was seen in children less than 10 years old.

This study aims to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and child healthcare use and evaluate data on stillbirths and infant mortality. METHODS: In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, a retrospective analysis was performed on 293 stillbirths and 324 infant deaths, which occurred in Samsun Province of Turkey between 1 March 2018 and 1 March 2021. The study period was examined in three groups as pre-pandemic period 1 (1 March 2018-28 February 2019), pre-pandemic period 2 (1 March 2019-29 February 2020) and pandemic period (1 March 2020-28 February2021). RESULTS: The study found that the share of difficulties in delivering health-care services to the families (may be due to reasons such as difficulty in accessing health services for those living in rural areas, disruption of the referral chain) in stillbirths and infant deaths has decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous years (p = 0.037 in stillbirths, p = 0.002 in infant deaths). The mean number of follow-up visits during pregnancy has partially reduced during the pandemic (p > 0.05). Other variables of the health-care services have remained similar to years before the pandemic (p > 0.05). The rate of families without health insurance (p = 0.001 in stillbirths, p = 0.001 in infant deaths) and unemployed persons contributing to family budget (p = 0.012 in stillbirths, p = 0.016 in infant deaths) has significantly decreased during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, it was determined that the variables of stillbirth and infant mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic period, and maternal and child health services in primary care and hospitals continued to provide services in a similar way to the pre-pandemic period. Compared to pre-pandemic periods during the COVID-19 pandemic, it was found that while the number of stillbirths was similar, there was a significant decrease in infant mortality.","output":"Evaluation of stillbirths and infant mortality before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic (SARS-CoV-2) has caused multiple consequences globally, and all can be re-searched and addressed multidisciplinary, ie from a health (medical), legal, economic and security aspect.

We report a retrospective descriptive study of the clinical course and maternal-fetal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a single-centre, retrospective study performed in a tertiary care hospital for pregnant women with COVID-19 in India. The medical records of all women who delivered in the COVID facility from May 5, 2020, to June 5, 2020, were reviewed independently. Data extracted from the records included demographic characteristics, obstetric details, comorbidities, disease severity, investigations, management, and information on neonates (birthweight, Apgar score, and perinatal complications). RESULTS: Among 348 women tested for SARS-CoV-2, 57 women (16.3%) were confirmed as positive based on quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of the nasopharyngeal specimen. Most women (45; 78.9%) had a mild infection with favourable maternal-fetal outcomes. Three maternal deaths were associated with comorbidities. Five neonates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, remained hemodynamically stable, and were subsequently discharged. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of pregnant women with COVID-19 had mild disease and recovered with good perinatal outcomes. Women with comorbidities may have an increased risk of severe morbidity and mortality. The cycle threshold signifying the viral load and degree of infectivity can modify management during pregnancy.

There is uncertainty about its predisposing factors and the extent of the resultant public health burden, with estimates of prevalence and duration varying widely. MethodsWithin rounds 3-5 of the REACT-2 study, 508,707 people in the community in England were asked about a prior history of COVID-19 and the presence and duration of 29 different symptoms. We used uni-and multivariable models to identify predictors of persistence of symptoms (12 weeks or more). We estimated the prevalence of symptom persistence at 12 weeks, and used unsupervised learning to cluster individuals by symptoms experienced. FindingsAmong the 508,707 participants, the weighted prevalence of self-reported COVID-19 was 19.2% (95% CI: 19.1,19.3). 37.7% of 76,155 symptomatic people post COVID-19 experienced at least one symptom, while 14.8% experienced three or more symptoms, lasting 12 weeks or more. This gives a weighted population prevalence of persistent symptoms of 5.75% (5.68, 5.81) for one and 2.22% (2.1, 2.26) for three or more symptoms. Almost a third of people (8,771/28,713 [30.5%]) with at least one symptom lasting 12 weeks or more reported having had severe COVID-19 symptoms (\\"significant effect on my daily life\\") at the time of their illness, giving a weighted prevalence overall for this group of 1.72% (1.69,1.76). The prevalence of persistent symptoms was higher in women than men (OR: 1.51 [1.46,1.55]) and, conditional on reporting symptoms, risk of persistent symptoms increased linearly with age by 3.5 percentage points per decade of life. Obesity, smoking or vaping, hospitalisation, and deprivation were also associated with a higher probability of persistent symptoms, while Asian ethnicity was associated with a lower probability. Two stable clusters were identified based on symptoms that persisted for 12 weeks or more: in the largest cluster, tiredness predominated, while in the second there was a high prevalence of respiratory and related symptoms. InterpretationA substantial proportion of people with symptomatic COVID-19 go on to have persistent symptoms for 12 weeks or more, which is age-dependent. Clinicians need to be aware of the differing manifestations of Long COVID which may require tailored therapeutic approaches. Managing the long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population will remain a major challenge for health services in the next stage of the pandemic. FundingThe study was funded by the Department of Health and Social Care in England. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSRecent systematic reviews have documented the wide range of symptoms and reported prevalence of persistent symptoms following COVID-19. A dynamic review of Long COVID studies (NIHR Evidence) in March 2021 summarised the literature on the prevalence of persistent symptoms after acute COVID19, and reported that most studies (14) were of hospitalised patients, with higher prevalence of persistent symptoms compared with two community-based studies. There was limited evidence from community studies beyond 12 weeks. Another systematic review reported a median of over 70% of people with symptoms lasting at least 60 days. A review of risk factors for Long COVID found consistent evidence for an increased risk amongst women and those with high body mass index (BMI) but inconsistent findings on the role of age and little evidence concerning risks among different socioeconomic or ethnic groups which are often not well captured in routine healthcare records. Long COVID is increasingly recognised as heterogenous, likely underpinned by differing biological mechanisms, but there is not yet consensus on defining subtypes of the condition. Added value of this studyThis community-based study of over half a million people was designed to be representative of the adult population of England. A random sample of adults ages 18 years and above registered with a GP were invited irrespective of previous access to services for COVID-19, providing an estimate of population prevalence that was representative of the whole population. The findings show substantial declines in symptom prevalence over the first 12 weeks following Covid-19, reported by nearly one fifth of respondents, of whom over a third remained symptomatic at 12 weeks and beyond, with little evidence for decline thereafter. Risk factors identified for persistent symptoms (12 weeks or more) suggestive of Long COVID confirm some previous findings - an increased risk in women, obese and overweight individuals and those hospitalised for COVID-19, with strong evidence for an increasing risk with age. Additional evidence was found for an increased risk in those with lower income, smoking or vaping and healthcare or care home workers. A lower risk was found in those of Asian ethnicity. Clustering identified two distinct groups of individuals with different symptom profiles at 12 weeks, highlighting the heterogeneity of clinical presentation. The smaller cluster had higher prevalence of respiratory and related symptoms, while for those in the larger cluster tiredness was the dominant symptom, with lower prevalence of organ-specific symptoms. Implications of available evidenceThere is a high prevalence of persistent symptoms beyond 12 weeks after acute COVID-19, with little evidence of decline thereafter. This highlights the needs for greater support for patients, both through specialised services and, for those from low-income settings, financial support. The understanding that there are distinct clusters of persistent symptoms, the most common of which is dominated by fatigue, is important for the recognition and clinical management of the condition outside of specialised services.","output":"Persistent symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection in a random community sample of 508,707 people"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused ~ 2 million fatalities.

Although younger physicians need to learn the competencies and entrustable professional activities (EPAs) to conduct death pronouncement independently, both of which have not been clarified. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a list of competencies and EPAs necessary for death pronouncement practice, which resident physicians need to acquire by the end of their residency training (postgraduate year 2). METHODS: An anonymous modified Delphi study was conducted with a panel of 31 experts. The experts were invited online from general wards in hospitals with resident physicians across Japan to participate in the study using the purposive and snowball sampling method. A non-anonymous web conference was held with three additional external evaluators to finalize the item list. The consensus criterion was defined as a mean response of at least 4 points on a 5-point Likert scale for each competency and EPA item and a rating of 4 or 5 points by at least 80% of the participants. RESULTS: Consensus was achieved, with consistently high levels of agreement across panel members, on 11 competencies and 9 EPA items. Additionally, a correspondence matrix table between competencies and EPAs was developed.

Health and social management of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, responsible for the COVID-19 disease, requires both screening tools and diagnostic procedures. Reliable screening tests aim at identifying (truely) infectious individuals that can spread the viral infection and therefore are essential for tracing and harnessing the epidemic diffusion. Instead, diagnostic tests should supplement clinical and radiological findings, thus helping in establishing the diagnosis. Several analytical assays, mostly using RT-PCR-based technologies, have become commercially available for healthcare workers and clinical laboratories. However, such tests showed some critical limitations, given that a relevant number of both false-positive and false-negative cases have been so far reported. Moreover, those analytical techniques demonstrated to be significantly influenced by pre-analytical biases, while the sensitivity showed a dramatic time dependency. Aim. Herein, we critically investigate limits and perspectives of currently available RT-PCR techniques, especially when referring to the required performances in providing reliable epidemiological and clinical information. Key Concepts. Current data cast doubt on the use of RT-PCR swabs as a screening procedure for tracing the evolution of the current SARS-COV-2 pandemic. Indeed, the huge number of both false-positive and false-negative results deprives the trustworthiness of decision making based on those data. Therefore, we should refine current available analytical tests to quickly identify individuals able to really transmit the virus, with the aim to control and prevent large outbreaks.","output":"Analytical Performance of COVID-19 Detection Methods (RT-PCR): Scientific and Societal Concerns ?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The Novel Coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, Hubei, China, has raised global concerns and has been declared a pandemic. The infection shows the primary symptoms of pneumonia and has an incubation period, with the majority of people showing symptoms within 14 days. Online Social Networks are the closest simulations of real-world networks and have similar topology characteristics. This article simulates the spread and control of the nCoV-19 using the SIQR-t model to highlight the importance of self-quarantine and exercise of proper health care as a method to prevent the spread of the virus. Method The article uses the Susceptible-Infected-Quarantined-Recovered model with modification, introducing 14 different Infected states depending on the number of days the host has been carrying the infection. We simulate the spread of 2019-nCoV on human interaction similar graph taken from Online Social Network Epinions, of about 75000 nodes, similar to a small town or settlement. The infection rates depend on the sanitation and cleanliness these people exercise. Results When people practice self-quarantine and hygiene, aided by the governmental efforts of testing and quarantine, the cumulative number of affected people fall drastically. The decrease is apparent in time-based simulations of the spread received from the study. Conclusion The 2019-nCoV is a highly infectious zoonotic virus.

Chronic and uncontrolled neuroinflammation triggers neuronal injury and neuronal death resulting in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, fine tuning of the immune response in the nervous system is now extensively considered as a potential therapeutic intervention for those diseases. The immune cells of the nervous system express Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) together with myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD-2) to protect against the pathogens. Over the last 10 years, antagonists targeting the functional domains of MD-2 have become attractive pharmacological intervention strategies in pre-clinical studies into neuroinflammation and its associated brain pathologies. This review aims to summarize and discuss the roles of TLR4-MD-2 signaling pathway activation in various models of neuroinflammation.

The worldwide consensus that physical distancing is an effective instrument for mitigating the spread of the virus has led policymakers to temporarily limit the freedom of movement of people between and within countries, cities, and even neighborhoods. These public health-related restrictions on human mobility yielded an unprecedented fragmentation of international and national food distribution systems. Focusing on food retailing - usually being modestly oligopolistic - we take a micro-economic perspective as we analyze the potential consequences this disruption has for the physical as well as for the economic access of households to food at the local level. As the mobility constraints implemented substantially reduced competition, we argue that food retailers might have been tempted to take advantage of the implied fragmentation of economic activity by exploiting their temporarily raised market power at the expense of consumers and farmers. We illustrate our point by providing empirical evidences of rising wholesale-retail as well as farm-retail price margins observed during the Covid-19 crisis. Subsequently, we review existing empirical approaches that can be used to quantify and decompose the micro-economic effects of crises on food demand and supply as well as the size and structure of the market, costs of trade, and economic welfare. The employment of such approaches facilitates policymakers' understanding of micro-economic effects of public health-induced mobility restrictions on economic activity.","output":"Imperfect food markets in times of crisis: economic consequences of supply chain disruptions and fragmentation for local market power and urban vulnerability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are hundreds of coronaviruses, most of which circulate among animals, yet there are seven types that infect humans. Three of them can cause severe acute respiratory illness-SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV. Other HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 usually cause only mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections. These four coronaviruses are called seasonal, because they are continuously circulating among human population and are responsible for up to 30% of all respiratory tract infections. Genetically, these low-pathogenic types are related to SARS-CoV-2. That is why questions concerning the cross-reactivity and cross-neutralization between antibodies against different types of coronaviruses have been raised. We addressed these questions by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). We established the upper respiratory infection etiology for three patients who had been vaccinated with Sputnik V and tested positive on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The symptoms included sore throat, nasal congestion, and myalgia. Their blood serum was analyzed for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in dynamics: before vaccination, and after the first and second dose of the vaccine. After the second dose, all patients were positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The targeted NGS panel sequencing data analysis showed that these patients were infected with common coronavirus HCoV-OC43. These results suggest that S protein-targeted vaccine-induced antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are not protective against seasonal coronavirus HCoV-OC43.","output":"Do Sputnik V Vaccine-Induced Antibodies Protect Against Seasonal Coronaviruses?

These findings will be complemented with selected results from the longitudinal Swiss Corona Stress Study that focuses on stress, anxiety and depression, the longitudinal COVID-19 Social Monitor that contains indicators on well-being and mental health, and the longitudinal <<Health in Students during the Corona Pandemic >> study that assesses student depression and anxiety during the pandemic. As a major finding, all three studies observed significant increases in psychological stress during the second Covid-19 wave. In the Swiss Corona Stress Study, for instance, 18% of participants reported severe depression symptoms in November 2020 relative to 12% in May, 9% in April during the lock-down, and 3% prior to the pandemic. The presentation will then describe the specific mental health responses. For instance, psychiatrists and psychotherapists were allowed to bill treatment by telephone and the recommendations and billing options have been regularly adapted in response to the developments. However, these changes have not yet affected medium-term mental health policies. Similarly, the continuous screening of the scientific literature is established as a short-term measure. It is reviewed periodically and extended only as needed. The presentation will discuss policy changes in relation to the long-term strategies and their present implementation state.

Italy has been the first European country recording an elevated number of infected forcing the Italian Government to call for total lockdown. The lockdown had the aim to limit the spread of infection through social distancing. The purpose of this study is to analyze how the pandemic has affected the patient's accesses to the Ophthalmological Emergency Department of a tertiary referral center in central-northern Italy, during the lockdown period.

We developed an agent-based simulation model to project the infection spread. The model utilizes COVID19-specific parameters and data from Georgia on population interactions and demographics. The simulation study covered a seven and a half-month period, testing different social distancing scenarios, including baselines (no-intervention or school closure only) and combinations of shelter-in-place and voluntary quarantine with different timelines and compliance levels. The following outcomes are compared at the state and community levels: the number and percentage of cumulative and daily new symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths; COVID19-related demand for hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. The results suggest that shelter-in-place followed by voluntary quarantine reduced peak infections from approximately 180K under no intervention and 113K under school closure, respectively, to below 53K, and delayed the peak from April to July or later. Increasing shelter-in-place duration from four to five weeks yielded 2-9% and 3-11% decrease in cumulative infection and deaths, respectively. Regardless of the shelter-in-place duration, increasing voluntary quarantine compliance decreased daily new infections from almost 53K to 25K, and decreased cumulative infections by about 50%. The cumulative number of deaths ranged from 6,660 to 19,430 under different scenarios. Peak infection date varied across scenarios and counties; on average, increasing shelter-in-place duration delayed the peak day by 6 days.

Although direct injection of exosomes can have a curative effect similar to that of stem cell transplantation, high clearance hinders its application in clinical practice. Previous reports suggested that induction of coronary collateralization can be a desired method of adjunctive therapy for someone who had missed the optimal operation time to attenuate myocardial ischemia. In this study, to mimic the paracrine and biological activity of stem cells, we developed artificial stem cells that can continuously release T4-exosomes (T4-ASCs) by encapsulating specific exosomes within microspheres using microfluidics technology. The results show that T4-ASCs can greatly promote coronary collateralization in the periphery of the myocardial infarcted area, and its therapeutic effect is superior to that of directly injecting the exosomes. In addition, to better understand how it works, we demonstrated that the T4-ASC-derived exosomes can enhance the angiogenic capacity of coronary endothelial cells (CAECs) via the miR-17-5p/PHD3/Hif-1 pathway. In brief, as artificial stem cells, T4-ASCs can constantly release functional exosomes and stimulate the formation of collateral circulation after myocardial infarction, providing a feasible and alternative method for clinical revascularization.","output":"Fabrication of T4-Exosome-releasing artificial stem cells for myocardial infarction therapy by improving coronary collateralization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The efficacy of an inactivated CCoV vaccine (Duramune PC) was evaluated in four pups.

A number of institutes have already integrated digital imaging into routine workflow, relying on AI algorithms for the detection of various cancers and mitotic activity quantification. Despite the use of whole slide imaging (WSI) for tissue evaluation, the field of hematology has lagged behind. While many hospitals rely on limited technologies for automated peripheral blood evaluation (e.g. CellavisionTM), the Scopio LabsTM X100 digital scanner provides high resolution oil-immersion level dynamic images of large scanned areas (https://scopiolabs.com/hematology/). With recent FDA-clearance and newly implemented AI capabilities, the Scopio Labs scanner allows for clear and accurate cytomorphologic characterization and cell quantification for peripheral blood smears (PBS). To this end, we aimed to be one of the few pioneering institutes in the United States to adopt early and implement this technology into our routine workflow as a 'hub and spoke' model for optimized case assessment, data sharing and result reporting across multiple satellite locations within our hospital health system. DESIGN A Scopio x100 digital scanner was deployed at our main hospital site, with an anticipated secondary scanner for installment at a satellite laboratory. PBS flagged for hematopathologist review from two satellite laboratories were scanned, and full-field digitalized slides were evaluated by hematopathologists following AI automated analyses. RESULTS 311 peripheral smears were scanned since April 2021 and representative slides were digitalized at 100x magnification (Figure 1, weblink: https://demo.scopiolabs.com/#/view-scan/9231acaf-f898-4649-950d-a41c26c2baaa) with rapid monolayer, monolayer, fullfield, and full-field cytopenia scan options available. The automated AI capabilities classified cells into lineage-specific categories with quantification based on cytomorphologic features (Figure 2). Other AI features include additional cell assignment, cell annotation and comments accessible to all users, finalized report PDF generation, export, upload into our current PowerPath TM software with linkage to the corresponding flow cytometry and bone marrow biopsy reports;and the ability to share digitalized slides with clinicians, laboratory personnel and trainees using uniquely generated weblinks. Images can be used for lectures and tumor boards. Additionally, an 80-case study set for PBS was created for medical students, residents and fellow teaching purposes, including cases displaying acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMML), hypersegmented neutrophils in COVID-19(+) patients, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), atypical lymphocytes, hemoglobinopathies, platelet disorders and various lymphomas. Overall improvements were made to the following areas: CLINICAL WORK/DIAGNOSIS 1. Time-saving due to pre-categorization of cells into lineage-specific groups for pathologist review 2. Minimizes subjectivity in cell counting and cellularity assessment EDUCATION 1. Case-based collection with flow and molecular being maintained here 2. Efficient case retrieval with retained annotations/comments for teaching purposes 3. Wide array of digitalized images for hematology atlas and publications ARCHIVING 1. Collection of reference images (intra/inter departmental) for an array of morphological entities for clinical reference and refined diagnosis (e.g. Bethesda reference images for pap by ASC) 2. Digital catalogue for long-term case follow-up and retrospective review CONCLUSION The Scopio Labs X100 digital system provides an efficient and cost-effective web-based tool to streamline clinical workflow and enhance PBS evaluation. With its recent AI capabilities of cell quantification, lineage-assignment and report-generation, we aim to continue our efforts to fully integrate Scopio Labs into our routine daily clinical workflow for reviewing PBS specimens.

A random cohort of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia numbered 209 people. Mathematical analysis addressed the physiological characteristics of patients recorded at the time of hospital admission, as well as blood coagulation parameters and those reflecting the development of an inflammatory reaction. The analyzed parameters were categorized relative to the reference ranges of physiologically normal values. Correlation analysis was carried out using categorical data on the disease outcome. The algorithms for calculating statistical characteristics, as well as results visualization, were programmed in Python. When comparing patient groups, the significance of differences between the determined parameters was assessed using the Pearsons (2) test with Yates correction. The study showed that the age over 50 and male sex can be considered risk factors for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (p < 0.05). The disease outcome was found to be significantly affected by cardiovascular pathologies (p < 0.01) and to a lesser extent by diabetes mellitus (p < 0.10). There were revealed maximal correlation coefficients between the oxygen saturation level (C0.43), as well as the breathing rate (0.43), and a fatal outcome of the disease. For patients over 50 years of age, oxygen saturation below 80% at the time of hospital admission turned out to be a marker of mortality. It was shown that D-dimer blood levels above 625 ng/mL in patients over 80 years of age correlated with mortal outcomes. No correlation was found between the C-reactive protein (CRP) level and the disease outcome. The effect of corticosteroids on the disease outcome was analyzed in patients with different CRP levels. It was found that, while using corticosteroids, the mortality rate in patients with CRP  12.5 mg/L is 2.7 times higher than in those with CRP > 12.5 mg/L (p < 0.01).

To probe the relations between rotation and activity for fully convective stars, we extract rotation periods for fast rotators and lower-bound period estimates of slow rotators. These rotation periods span from 2.2 hours to 65 days, and we find that the proportion of flaring stars increases for the very fastest rotators. Finally, we discuss the impact of our flare sample on planets orbiting ultra-cool stars.

SCOPE AND APPROACH: This review focuses on deciphering the potential of different secondary metabolites from medicinal plants as therapeutic options either as inhibitors of therapeutic targets of SARS-CoV-2 or as blockers of viral particles entry through host cell receptors. The use of medicinal plants containing specific phytomoieties could be seen in providing a safer and long-term solution for the population with lesser side effects. Key Findings and Conclusions: Considering the high cost and time-consuming drug discovery process, therapeutic repositioning of existing drugs was explored as treatment option in COVID-19, however several molecules have been retracted as therapeutics either due to no positive outcomes or the severe side effects. These effects call for exploring the alternate treatment options which are therapeutically effective as well as safe.

Eventually, this research indicates the contours for a praxis that views preaching with clairvoyant eyes for listeners concrete experiences. I discovered that preaching offers the opportunity to approach disorienting dilemmas that evoke intriguing self-reflection to answer the question: Where do we go from here? A homiletical praxeology, therefore, also has to deal with the experiences of listeners. To address this research question, the notion of critical correlation offers a methodological framework for operating within. It allows the researcher to set up a dialogue between questions related to the homiletical praxis on the one hand, and perspectives that come forth in reflecting the reality of the COVID-19 pandemic on the other. A second phase involves providing a theological perspective on God who can perform new deeds amidst the unusual. Deliberating on this will pave the way for a homiletical theory at the end of the article. Contribution: This article aims to engage with the basic tenet of preaching, viewed from a Reformational paradigm and wants to contribute towards a better understanding of a homiletical praxeology within a post-pandemic world.","output":"Practical theological perspectives on preaching to listeners experiencing angst or nothingness within the present reality of a post-pandemic world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: An outbreak of a new coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) has resulted in more than two million infected people and tens of thousands of deaths (the situation quickly evolves on daily basis). Fortunately, majority of patients experience only mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, or no symptoms at all, loss of smell and taste being the predominant complaint.But, unfortunately, even asymptomatic individuals can unknowingly spread the infection, which makes the pandemic very difficult to get under control. While lockdowns for entire country populations have shut down economies and international trade, the WHO has warned they may not be enough despite their high long-term economic and social costs.However, little or no scientific information has circulated reviewing already existing effective science- and evidence-based preventive/prophylactic measures that \\"kill\\" SARS-CoV-1 and are likely also to inactivate the current SARS- CoV-2.Our personal communication aims to fill this void.Method: First, we review the scientific literature and the evidence on preventive/prophylactic measures that neutralize SARS-CoV-1 virus. Second, our analysis looks into the scientific evidence on the use of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) in mouthwash/gargling/spray forms, as these represent the only innovatively developed, tested and available practical solution to inactivate SARS-CoV viruses (e.g. SARS-CoV-1, Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome virus or MERS, and SARS-CoV-2).Findings: Multiple evidence (mainly in vitro/cell cultures) demonstrate that the use of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) inactivates SARS-CoV-1 in matter of seconds. Preliminary test results suggest it may also similarly kill the current new SARS-CoV-2.Update [1 January 2021]: new evidence confirms that PVP-I inactivates SARS-CoV-2.Discussion: The use of PVP-I for decontamination of the nose/mouth/throat has a well-established tolerability profile, is low-cost and has limited downside risks. It is an evidence-based and highly cost-effective health intervention. Our analysis suggests that PVP-I utilization merits being considered as an additional preventive measure (in clinical and in population settings) against getting infected by, and infecting others with, the current SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, the real-world evidence (in vivo) of their effectiveness in the form of mouthwashes/gargles/sprays for the decontamination of the nose, mouth and throat, is rather scarce.

This retrospective national cohort study analyses the epidemiological status of DFU patients in relation to urgent and elective hospitalizations, amputation rates, and deaths in Poland from 2017 to 2019, and during 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic began. The data were obtained from national medical records gathered by the National Health Fund (NHF). Discharge diagnoses were categorized according to ICD-10 and ICD-9 codes. Analysis of the data showed a statistically significant decrease in elective hospital admissions (from 29.6% to 26.3%, p = 0.001). There was a decrease in the percentage of hospitalizations related to limb-salvage procedures (from 79.4% to 71.3%, p = 0.001). The opposite tendency was observed among urgent hospital admissions (from 67.0% to 73.2%, p = 0.01), which was related to a significant increase in the number of minor amputations (from 3146 to 4269, p = 0.017). This rise was in parallel with the increase in the percentage of patients who died during hospitalization due to DFU (from 3.9% to 4.8%, p = 0.03).

METHODS CsA self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) were encapsulated into SmPill? minispheres. Varying degrees of coating thickness (low, medium and high) were applied using ethylcellulose and pectin (E:P) polymers. In vitro CsA release was evaluated in simulated gastric and intestinal media. Bioavailability of CsA in vivo following oral administration to pigs of SmPill? minispheres was compared to Neoral? po and Sandimmun? iv in a pig model. CsA concentrations in blood and intestinal tissue were determined by HPLC-UV. RESULTS In vitro CsA release from coated minispheres decreased with increasing coating thickness. A linear relationship was observed between in vitro CsA release and in vivo bioavailability (r(2) = 0.98). CsA concentrations in the proximal, transverse and distal colon were significantly higher following administration of SmPill?, compared to Neoral? po and Sandimmun? iv (p < 0.05). Analysis of transverse colon tissue subsections also revealed significantly higher CsA concentrations in the mucosa and submucosa using SmPill? minispheres (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Modulating E:P coating thickness controls release of CsA from SmPill? minispheres. Coated minispheres limited CsA release in the small intestine and enhanced delivery and uptake in the colon.

In response to different viral infections, NK cells fight viruses in different ways, and different NK subsets proliferate. For instance, cytomegalovirus (CMV) induces NKG2C + CD57 + KIR+ NK cells to expand 3C6 months after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), but human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) induces KIR3DS1+/KIR3DL1 NK cells to expand in the acute phase of infection. However, the similarities and differences among these processes and their molecular mechanisms have not been fully discussed. In this article, we provide a summary and comparison of antiviral mechanisms, unique subset expansion and time periods in peripheral blood and tissues under different conditions of CMV, HIV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), COVID-19 and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections.

METHODS: Multivariate regression with bootstrapping was used to identify independent mortality predictors in patients admitted to an acute hospital with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Predictions were externally validated in a large random sample of the ISARIC cohort (N=14 231) and a smaller cohort from Aintree (N=290). RESULTS: 983 patients (median age 70, IQR 53-83; in-hospital mortality 29.9%) were recruited over an 11-week study period. Through sequential modelling, a five-predictor score termed SOARS (SpO2, Obesity, Age, Respiratory rate, Stroke history) was developed to correlate COVID-19 severity across low, moderate and high strata of mortality risk. The score discriminated well for in-hospital death, with area under the receiver operating characteristic values of 0.82, 0.80 and 0.74 in the derivation, Aintree and ISARIC validation cohorts, respectively. Its predictive accuracy (calibration) in both external cohorts was consistently higher in patients with milder disease (SOARS 0-1), the same individuals who could be identified for safe outpatient monitoring. Prediction of a non-fatal outcome in this group was accompanied by high score sensitivity (99.2%) and negative predictive value (95.9%). CONCLUSION: The SOARS score uses constitutive and readily assessed individual characteristics to predict the risk of COVID-19 death. Deployment of the score could potentially inform clinical triage in preadmission settings where expedient and reliable decision-making is key. The resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission provides an opportunity to further validate and update its performance.","output":"Early prognostication of COVID-19 to guide hospitalisation versus outpatient monitoring using a point-of-test risk prediction score"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Conservation of the environment has taken a prime position among areas of concern for managers and practitioners worldwide.

This paper reports the construction of the pVAX-RBD plasmid containing the Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) of the S protein and a unique signal sequence 176 which promotes target protein secretion into the extracellular space thereby increasing the efficiency of humoral immune response activation. A polyglucine-spermidine conjugate (PGS) was used to deliver pVAX-RBD into the cells. The comparative immunogenicity study of the naked pVAX-RBD and pVAX-RBD enclosed in the PGS envelope showed that the latter was more efficient in inducing an immune response in the immunized mice. In particular, RBD-specific antibody titers were shown in ELISA to be no higher than 1 : 1000 in the animals from the pVAX-RBD group and 1 : 42 000, in the pVAX-RBD-PGS group. The pVAX-RBD?PGS construct effectively induced cellular immune response. Using ELISpot, it has been demonstrated that splenocytes obtained from the immunized animals effectively produced INF- in response to stimulation with the S protein-derived peptide pool.

The droplets were found to evaporate within a short timeframe (less than 3 s), which is consistent with previous reports concerning the drying kinetics of picolitre droplets. Using fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy, we found that the surface deposited microdroplet nuclei present two distinctive morphological features as the result of their drying mode, which is controlled by both interfacial energy and surface roughness. Nanomechanical measurements confirm that the nuclei deposited on all substrates possess similar surface adhesion (approx. 20 nN) and Young's modulus (approx. 4 MPa), supporting the proposed coreCshell structure of the nuclei.

It may be complicated by interstitial pneumonia leading to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome(1). The COVID-19 outbreak has increased concerns in those with rheumatological diseases(2). Objectives: To present the clinical course of COVID-19 infection in patients with rheumatological disease and comorbid conditions of patients and drug use. Methods: 70 COVID-19 patients with autoimmune and autoinflammatory rheumatic diseases over the age of 18 who were followed up in the internal diseases-rheumatology department of Sivas Cumhuriyet University Hospital and Sivas Numune Hospital between April 2020 and January 2021 were included in this study. An application was made to the ethics committee of Sivas Cumhuriyet University Hospital and approval was obtained. Demographic data, comorbidities, smoking, treatments for their diseases, symptoms and hospitalization status of the patients were evaluated. Results: The median age of the women patients was 48 years (min: 20-max: 73), 41 years in men (min: 21-max: 78). 15 patients (21.4%) were male, 55 patients (78.6%) were female. The most common rheumatic disease was rheumatoid arthritis (RA, 21, 30%) followed by ankylosing spondylitis (19, 27.1%), familial Mediterranean fever (13, 18.6%), Behet's disease (12, 17.1%). 22 (31.4%) patients hydroxychloroquine sulfate, 14 (20%) leflunomide, 7 (10%) patients methotrexate, 6 (8.6%) patients sulfasalazine, 10 (14.3%) patients azathioprine/ mycophenolate mofetil, 22 (31.4%) patients were using colchicine. As a biological medicine;20 (28.6%) patients were using infliximab, 5 (7.1%) patients were using adalimumab, 6 (8.6%) patients were using rituximab, and 4 (5.7%) patients were using tocilizumab. Other are summarized in Table 1. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (25.7%) and diabetes mellitus (DM 17.1%). While 56 patients (80%) had symptoms of COVID-19, 14 patients (20%) were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms was fever (32, 45.7%) followed by cough (29, 41.4%), dyspnea (28, 40%), myalgia (25, 35.7%), loss of taste and smell (18, 25.7%). 21 pneumonia cases were diagnosed. 22 (31.4%) patients were hospitalized. Mortality rate was 2/70, 2.9%. Two RA patients who just treated with rituximab and tocilizumab were died. 10 cases were using >10 mg/day prednisolone, 2 died, 8 cases were hospitalized and had severe disease. They had hypertension and DM. Characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 2. Conclusion: The course of COVID-19 in rheumatic diseases is not clearly. Meta-analysis has shown that the frequency of COVID-19 is increased in autoimmune diseases. However, this increase was mostly associated with the use of> 10mg/day prednisolone. It has been stated that the use of biological drugs and Dmard causes the SARS-CoV 2 process with a milder course and therefore their use is safe (3). Similar results have been obtained in global registry registers (4). In our data, there was no increase in the mortality rate compared to the normal population. However, especially the use of rituximab may increase the rate of severe disease and mortality, so its use should be careful.

During the threating deficit, healthcare institutions sought an approach to reuse face masks or to acquire imported masks. The objective of this study is to assess the quality of sterilised and imported FFP2/KN95 face mask materials. Design: prospective, bench to bedside Setting: General healthcare including 19 hospitals in the Netherlands Interventions: Face masks were reprocessed using a medical autoclave at 121 0C. Methods A 48 minutes steam sterilization process of single-use face masks with 15 min holding time at a 121 0C was developed, validated and implemented in 19 different hospitals. Steam and H2O2 plasma sterilized as well as new, imported masks are tested in a custom-made, non-standard EN-149, test set-up that measures Particle Filtration Efficiency (PFE) and pressure drops. Results PFE validation data of 84 masks indicated differences of 2.3 +/- 2 % (mean +/- SD) between the custom build test set-up and a continues flow according to the EN-149. Test data showed the mean PFE values of 444 sterilised FFP2 face masks from 19 CSSD were 90 +/- 11% (mean +/- SD) and of 474 imported KN95/FFP2 face masks 83 / 16% (mean +/- SD). Differences in PFE between sterilisation departments were found. Conclusion Face masks can be reprocessed with 121 0C steam or H2O2 plasma sterilization with minimum reduction of PFE. PFE comparison between sterilised mask and new, imported mask filter material indicates that most reprocessed masks of high quality brands outperform new imported face masks of unknown brands. Although the PFE of tested face mask material from different sterilisation departments remained efficient, different types of sterilisation equipment can result in different PFE outcomes.","output":"Sterilization of disposable face masks with respect to COVID-19 shortages; a nationwide field study including 19 sterilisation departments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory illness called COVID-19 leading to a pandemic. An effective preventive vaccine against this virus is urgently needed. As the most critical step during infection, SARS-CoV-2 uses its Spike protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) to engage with the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)1,2. Here we showed that a recombinant vaccine comprising residues 319-545 of the S-RBD could induce a potent functional antibody response in the immunized mice, rabbits and non-human primates (Macaca mulatta) as early as 7 or 14 days after a single dose injection. The sera from the immunized animals blocked RBD binding to ACE2 expressed on the cell surface and neutralized the infection by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Importantly, the vaccination also provided protection in non-human primates from SARS-CoV-2 challenge in vivo. The elevated RBD-specific antibodies were also found in the sera from patients with COVID-19. Several immune pathways and CD4 T lymphocytes were implicated in the induction of the vaccine antibody response. Our finding highlights the importance of the RBD domain in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design and provides the rationale for the development of a protective vaccine through the induction of antibody against the RBD domain.","output":"A vaccine targeting the RBD of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 induces protective immunity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As verminoses s?o doen?as frequentes causadas por diferentes tipos de vermes.

Improved etiological insight is needed to improve clinical management and prevention. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a three-year prospective descriptive study of severe respiratory illness among children from 2 months to 13 years of age within the largest referral hospital for infectious diseases in southern Vietnam. METHODS: Molecular detection for 15 viral species and subtypes was performed on three types of respiratory specimens (nose, throat swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates) using a multiplex RT-PCR kit (Seeplex? RV detection, Seegene) and additional monoplex real-time RT-PCRs. RESULTS: A total of 309 children were enrolled from November 2004 to January 2008. Viruses were identified in 72% (222/309) of cases, including respiratory syncytial virus (24%), influenza virus A and B (17%), human bocavirus (16%), enterovirus (9%), human coronavirus (8%), human metapneumovirus (7%), parainfluenza virus 1C3 (6%), adenovirus (5%), and human rhinovirus A (4%). Co-infections with multiple viruses were detected in 20% (62/309) of patients. When combined, diagnostic yields in nose and throat swabs were similar to nasopharyngeal aspirates. CONCLUSION: Similar to other parts in the world, RSV and influenza were the predominant viral pathogens detected in Vietnamese hospitalized children. Combined nasal and throat swabs are the specimens of choice for sensitive molecular detection of a broad panel of viral agents. Further research is required to better understand the clinical significance of single versus multiple viral coinfections and to address the role of bacterial (co-)infections involved in severe respiratory illness.","output":"Viral Etiologies of Acute Respiratory Infections among Hospitalized Vietnamese Children in Ho Chi Minh City, 2004C2008"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A retrospective look at how clinical research trials were prioritized in New York City in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic provides insights for future clinical research efforts.","output":"Prioritizing clinical research studies during the COVID-19 pandemic: lessons from New York City."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Canadian fruit and vegetable markets were significantly impacted by the spread of the novel coronavirus SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 (and COVID\\\\19 disease), beginning in March 2020.

Therefore, we sought to characterize the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 in a live registry of heart failure patients across an integrated health care system in Connecticut. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, the Yale Heart Failure Registry (NCT04237701) that includes 26,703 patients with heart failure across a 6-hospital integrated health care system in Connecticut was queried on April 16th, 2020 for all patients tested for COVID-19. Sociodemographic and geospatial data as well as, clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality were obtained via the real-time registry. Data on COVID-19 specific care was extracted by retrospective chart review. RESULTS: COVID-19 testing was performed on 900 symptomatic patients, comprising 3.4% of the Yale Heart Failure Registry (N = 26,703). Overall, 206 (23%) were COVID- 19+. As compared to COVID-19-, these patients were more likely to be older, black, have hypertension, coronary artery disease, and were less likely to be on renin angiotensin blockers (P<0.05, all). COVID-19- patients tended to be more diffusely spread across the state whereas COVID-19+ were largely clustered around urban centers. 20% of COVID-19+ patients died, and age was associated with increased risk of death [OR 1.92 95% CI (1.33C2.78); P<0.001]. Among COVID-19+ patients who were 85 years of age rates of hospitalization were 87%, rates of death 36%, and continuing hospitalization 62% at time of manuscript preparation. CONCLUSIONS: In this real-world snapshot of COVID-19 infection among a large cohort of heart failure patients, we found that a small proportion had undergone testing. Patients found to be COVID-19+ tended to be black with multiple comorbidities and clustered around lower socioeconomic status communities.

However, a combination of two HIV-1 protease inhibitors, lopinavir and ritonavir, has been found to be effective against SARS-CoV, and both drugs could bind well to the SARS-CoV 3C-like protease (SARS-CoV 3CL(pro)). In this work, molecular complexation between each inhibitor and SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) was studied using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, free energy calculations, and pair interaction energy analyses based on MM/PB(GB)SA and FMO-MP2/PCM/6-31G* methods. Both anti-HIV drugs interacted well with the residues at the active site of SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro). Ritonavir showed a somewhat higher number atomic contacts, a somewhat higher binding efficiency, and a somewhat higher number of key binding residues compared to lopinavir, which correspond with the slightly lower water accessibility at the 3CL(pro) active site. In addition, only ritonavir could interact with the oxyanion hole residues N142 and G143 via the formation of two hydrogen bonds.

Even low levels of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in khat could induce public health concern. In a market-based study, from five popular khat varieties, a total of 35 composite khat samples were analyzed for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its main transformation products, and four hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) isomers. Extraction was carried out by quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe method (QuEChERS). OCP concentrations were determined by head space solid phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPMECGCCMS). Every sample contained -HCH above the maximum residue limit set by the European Commission. For total DDT, this was the case for 25.7% of the samples. The ratios of (p,p-p,p-DDE) to p,p-DDT were less than one for 85% of khat samples, demonstrating recent use of DDT in khat farmlands. Conversely, the ratio of -HCH to total HCH varied from 0.56 to 0.96, implying historical input of technical HCH. Assuming a daily chewable portion of 100 g, dietary intakes of p,p-DDT, total DDT and total HCH by adults ranged from 3.12 to 57.9, 6.49 to 80.2 and 39.2 to 51.9 ng (kg body weight)(?1) day(?1), respectively. These levels are below acceptable levels suggested by international organizations. Chewing khat showed lower non-cancer health risk, but showed relatively higher cancer risk in terms of OCPs. Because khat is chewed without being subjected to any treatment, uncertainties associated with estimated intakes and health risks should be low. Therefore, this practice is of great concern.

METHODS Eighty-five patients were followed up to assess recurrence (main endpoint), reoperation, mesh complications and death, from the date of index until recurrence, death or study completion, whichever was first. Recurrence, reoperation rates and death were estimated by intention to treat. Mesh-related complications were only assessed in the LVHR group, excluding conversions (intraperitoneal onlay; n = 40). Quality of life, using the European Hernia Society Quality of Life score, was assessed in surviving non-reoperated patients (n = 47). RESULTS The incidence rates with 10 person-years of follow-up were 21.01% (CI 13.24-33.36) for recurrence, 11.92% (CI: 6.60-21.53) for reoperation and 24.88% (CI 16.81-36.82) for death. Sixty-two percent of recurrences occurred within the first 2 years of follow-up. No significant differences between arms were found in any of the outcomes analyzed. Incidence rate of intraperitoneal mesh complications with 10 person-years of follow-up was 6.15% (CI 1.99-19.09).

However, this method can involve inadvertent resection of additional gastric tissue and cause gastric deformation. To minimize the volume of resected gastric tissue, we have developed a laparoscopic partial gastrectomy with seromyotomy which we call the 'lift-and-cut method' for gastric GIST. Here, we report a case series of this surgery. METHOD First, the seromuscular layer around the tumor is cut. Because the mucosa and submucosa are extensible, the tumor is lifted toward the abdominal cavity. After sufficient lifting, the gastric tissue under the tumor is cut at the submucosal layer with a linear stapler (thus 'lift-and-cut method'). Finally, the defect in the seromuscular layer is closed with a hand-sewn suture. RESULTS From April 2011 to December 2015, 28 patients underwent laparoscopic partial gastrectomy by this method at Osaka Red Cross Hospital. Average operation time was 126 min (range 65-302 min) and average blood loss was 10 ml (range 0-200 ml). No intraoperative complications including tumor rupture or postoperative complications regarded as Clavien-Dindo Grade II or higher occurred. All patients took sufficient solid diet at discharge. Median postoperative hospital stay was 7 days (range 5-21 days). On median follow-up of 26.6 months (range 6-54 months), no recurrence was reported.

Some shutdowns remain in place, yet the extent of the needs of US working parents is largely unknown. Objective: To identify and address the career development, work culture, and childcare needs of faculty, staff, and trainees at an academic medical center during a pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: For this survey study, between August 5 and August 20, 2020, a Qualtrics survey was emailed to all faculty, staff, and trainees at University of Utah Health, an academic health care system that includes multiple hospitals, community clinics, and specialty centers. Participants included 27a?700 University of Utah Health faculty, staff, and trainees who received a survey invitation. Data analysis was performed from August to November 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes included experiences of COVID-19 and their associations with career development, work culture, and childcare needs. Results: A total of 5030 participants completed the entire survey (mean [SD] age, 40 [12] years); 3738 (75%) were women; 4306 (86%) were White or European American; 561 (11%) were Latino or Latina (of any race), Black or African American, American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander; and 301 (6%) were Asian or Asian American. Of the participants, 2545 (51%) reported having clinical responsibilities, 2412 (48%) had at least 1 child aged 18 years or younger, 3316 (66%) were staff, 791 (16%) were faculty, and 640 (13%) were trainees. Nearly one-half of parents reported that parenting (1148 participants [49%]) and managing virtual education for children (1171 participants [50%]) were stressors. Across all participants, 1061 (21%) considered leaving the workforce, and 1505 (30%) considered reducing hours. Four hundred forty-nine faculty (55%) and 397 trainees (60%) perceived decreased productivity, and 2334 participants (47%) were worried about COVID-19 impacting their career development, with 421 trainees (64%) being highly concerned. Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey of 5030 faculty, staff, and trainees of a US health system, many participants with caregiving responsibilities, particularly women, faculty, trainees, and (in a subset of cases) those from racial/ethnic groups that underrepresented in medicine, considered leaving the workforce or reducing hours and were worried about their career development related to the pandemic.

Machine learning models have been proposed to accurately predict COVID-19 disease severity. Previous studies have typically tested only one machine learning algorithm and limited performance evaluation to area under the curve analysis. To obtain the best results possible, it may be important to test different machine learning algorithms to find the best prediction model. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to use automated machine learning (autoML) to train various machine learning algorithms. We selected the model that best predicted patients' chances of surviving a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we identified which variables (ie, vital signs, biomarkers, comorbidities, etc) were the most influential in generating an accurate model. METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from all patients who tested positive for COVID-19 at our institution between March 1 and July 3, 2020. We collected 48 variables from each patient within 36 hours before or after the index time (ie, real-time polymerase chain reaction positivity). Patients were followed for 30 days or until death. Patients' data were used to build 20 machine learning models with various algorithms via autoML. The performance of machine learning models was measured by analyzing the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPCR). Subsequently, we established model interpretability via Shapley additive explanation and partial dependence plots to identify and rank variables that drove model predictions. Afterward, we conducted dimensionality reduction to extract the 10 most influential variables. AutoML models were retrained by only using these 10 variables, and the output models were evaluated against the model that used 48 variables. RESULTS: Data from 4313 patients were used to develop the models. The best model that was generated by using autoML and 48 variables was the stacked ensemble model (AUPRC=0.807). The two best independent models were the gradient boost machine and extreme gradient boost models, which had an AUPRC of 0.803 and 0.793, respectively. The deep learning model (AUPRC=0.73) was substantially inferior to the other models. The 10 most influential variables for generating high-performing models were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, pulse oximetry level, blood urea nitrogen level, lactate dehydrogenase level, D-dimer level, troponin level, respiratory rate, and Charlson comorbidity score. After the autoML models were retrained with these 10 variables, the stacked ensemble model still had the best performance (AUPRC=0.791). CONCLUSIONS: We used autoML to develop high-performing models that predicted the survival of patients with COVID-19. In addition, we identified important variables that correlated with mortality. This is proof of concept that autoML is an efficient, effective, and informative method for generating machine learning-based clinical decision support tools.","output":"Using Automated Machine Learning to Predict the Mortality of Patients With COVID-19: Prediction Model Development Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To date, over 2 million people worldwide have died with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. To describe the experience in Ireland, this study examined associations between underlying conditions and the following outcomes: mortality, admission to hospital or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) among those infected with COVID-19. METHODS: This study used data from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre in Ireland and included confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the first wave of the pandemic between March and July 2020. Two cohorts were included: all cases (community and hospital) and hospital admissions only. For all cases, health outcome data included mortality and hospitalisation. For hospitalised cases, outcome data included mortality and ICU admission. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between underlying conditions and outcomes across both cohorts. Results are presented as adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). FINDINGS: There were 19,789 cases included in analysis, which encompassed 1,476 (7.5%) deaths, 2,811 (14.2%) hospitalisations, and 438 (2.2%) ICU admissions of whom 90 (20.5%) died. Significantly higher risk of mortality, hospitalisation and ICU admission was associated with having chronic heart disease, a BMI 40kg/m(2) and male sex. Additionally, diagnosis of a chronic neurological condition (OR 1.41; 95%CI:1.17, 1.69), chronic kidney disease (OR 1.74; 95%CI:1.35, 2.24) and cancer (OR 2.77; 95%CI:2.21, 3.47) were significantly associated with higher risk of mortality among all cases, with similar patterns of association observed for mortality among hospitalised cases. INTERPRETATION: The identification of underlying conditions among COVID-19 cases may help identify those at highest risk of the worst health outcomes and inform preventive strategies to improve outcomes.

A broad differential should be considered for every single patient who is currently ill (eg, all patients with respiratory illnesses); without it, there will likely be an increase of misdiagnosis, unnecessary patient suffering, and an influx of patients to the emergency department. The COVID-19 response has forced many of these basic medical values aside, like providing differential diagnosis or practicing bedside manner through social interaction, while physicians struggle to continue care for patients. As a result, newly formed hospital and clinical policies may have dangerously traded everyday diagnosis and treatment of patients for the pandemic and quarantine recommendations. This type of assumptive medicine is based on a singular differential that can be detrimental to patients, who are more likely affected with more common illnesses, like bronchitis or pneumoniaor perhaps, even more threatening illnesses, like a pulmonary embolism, COPD exacerbation, congestive heart failure and even lung cancer. Although these new policies and reactions to COVID-19 are proactive, these actions could be at the cost of providing quality patient care for people who have not contracted COVID-19.","output":"A Bottom-Up Approach Addressing Patient Care and Differential Diagnosis Amidst the Covid-19 Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the magnitude and spatial distribution of household food and nutrition security (FNS) during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic in Tucumn (Argentina) and identify factors associated with food insecurity.

OBJECTIVE To assess community emergency preparedness linkages among hospitals, public health officials, and first responders and to investigate the influence of community hazards, previous preparation for an event requiring national security oversight, and experience responding to actual disasters. DESIGN With expert advice from an advisory panel, a mailed questionnaire was used to assess linkage issues related to training and drills, equipment, surveillance, laboratory testing, surge capacity, incident management, and communication. SETTING A simple random sample of 1750 U.S. medical-surgical hospitals. PARTICIPANTS Of 678 hospital representatives that agreed to participate, 575 (33%) completed the questionnaire in early 2004. Respondents were hospital personnel responsible for environmental safety, emergency management, infection control, administration, emergency services, and security. MEASUREMENTS Prevalence and breadth of participation in community-wide planning; examination of 17 basic elements in a weighted analysis. RESULTS In a weighted analysis, most hospitals (88.2% [95% CI, 84.1% to 92.3%]) engaged in community-wide drills and exercises, and most (82.2% [CI, 77.8% to 86.5%]) conducted a collaborative threat and vulnerability analysis with community responders. Of all respondents, 57.3% (CI, 52.1% to 62.5%) reported that their community plans addressed the hospital's need for additional supplies and equipment, and 73.0% (CI, 68.1% to 77.9%) reported that decontamination capacity needs were addressed.

METHODS: Healthy adults (n = 64) and migraine patients (n = 73) filled out self-report questionnaires online. A multiple linear regression model was used to test whether depressive rumination (i.e. brooding and reflection) and COVID-related rumination explained perceived stress among adults with and without migraine during the times of COVID-19, after controlling for gender, age, migraine/control group status and migraine disability. RESULTS: Although we did not find any difference in the level of perceived stress among migraineurs and the control group, perceived stress was more strongly associated with brooding as well as COVID-related rumination among migraineurs than healthy controls. COVID-related rumination and brooding (but not reflection) explained the level of perceived stress after controlling for gender, age, migraine/control group status and migraine disability. CONCLUSIONS: The similar degree of perceived stress among migraineurs and the control group may imply that there is great variation in the personal experience of people regarding the pandemic, that may be determined by numerous other factors. Our results demonstrate that ruminating about the pandemic and related difficulties, as well as brooding (but not reflection) appear to be associated with higher level of perceived stress during the times of the coronavirus. This association was slightly stronger among migraineurs, hinting at the increased vulnerability of this patient group in stressful situations like the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results also suggest that ruminating about the pandemic and its consequences is weakly associated with trait-level depressive rumination, thus may be more contingent on specific factors.","output":"Perceived stress in the time of COVID-19: the association with brooding and COVID-related rumination in adults with and without migraine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article evaluates the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) approach to the right to water, drawing on three key aspects characterizing a minimum core right to water: quality, availability and accessibility.

METHODS Confirmed or probable cases of certain infectious diseases required to be notified to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Victoria in 2013, excluding elevated blood lead, foodborne or water-borne illness with 2 or more related cases and chlamydial infection, were analysed according to: notification source of doctor  laboratory vs. laboratory-only; routine follow-up by public health staff for selected conditions vs. not routine; priority for Indigenous status reporting for 18 priority conditions with a target of  95% completeness vs. other conditions with a target of  80% completeness; and urgency of notification (conditions requiring immediate [same day] notification vs. conditions requiring notification within 5 days). RESULTS Almost half (49%) the 34,893 confirmed and probable cases were notified by laboratory report alone. Indigenous status was complete for 48% of cases. Indigenous status was more likely to be completed for conditions with active vs. no active follow-up (RR 1.88 (95% CI 1.84-1.92)) and priority conditions for Indigenous status reporting vs. other conditions (RR 1.62 (95% CI 1.59-1.66)). Among conditions without active follow-up, doctor-notified cases had more complete Indigenous status reporting than laboratory-only notified cases (86% vs. 6%, RR 15.06 (95% CI 14.15-16.03)). Fewer notifications requiring same day notification were received within the legislated time frame (59%) than notifications required to be notified within 5 days (90%).

Over time, there have been improvements to the process by providing electronic systems that generate sequenced numbers to ensure fairness. Other advances have also led to enhancements of the waiting area environment to make it more relaxing and hospitable. Such efforts have been successful to some extent, but still, they rely on the customers' physical presence in a waiting area. The recent crisis due to the COVID19 pandemic and the necessity for everyone to observe social distancing posed a new challenge. The space provided by the waiting areas has become insufficient. On several occasions, it has been noticed that people had to break social distancing restrictions due to space limitations to complete a public service, causing health risks to themselves and others, including service staff. Such risks are propagated in healthcare facilities involving diseased, sick, and reduced immunity people. To address this new challenge and provide a more compliant environment for social distancing restrictions, a design-thinking approach is used to design a digital service to address social distancing while queuing/waiting in public healthcare centres in the Kingdom of Bahrain. The proposed solution enhances the queuing process and reduces the dependency on physical presence within the waiting area in exchange for a much dynamic digital application. The application enables customers to enter the queue remotely and synchronize their physical location and attendance with the service availability time and distance, allowing customers to utilize their time better and even being physically elsewhere. At the same time, they are still counted on the service queue. The system determines who should be available at the waiting area according to space and service availability, ensuring fairness. This solution is expected to reduce the number of people physically available at the service area;thus, social distancing can be better observed. At the same time, the solution provides customers with a waiting location of their choice and comfort;and is expected to increase customers' service satisfaction while maintaining their safety. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Social Distancing Compliant Virtual Queuing System for Public Services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 first emerged in China during late 2019 and rapidly spread all over the world. Alterations in the inflammatory cytokines pathway represent a strong signature during SARS-COV-2 infection and correlate with poor prognosis and severity of the illness. The hyper-activation of the immune system results in an acute severe systemic inflammatory response named cytokine release syndrome (CRS). No effective prophylactic or post-exposure treatments are available, although some anti-inflammatory compounds are currently in clinical trials. Studies of plant extracts and natural compounds show that polyphenols can play a beneficial role in the prevention and the progress of chronic diseases related to inflammation. The aim of this manuscript is to review the published background on the possible effectiveness of polyphenols to fight SARS-COV-2 infection, contributing to the reduction of inflammation. Here, some of the anti-inflammatory therapies are discussed and although great progress has been made though this year, there is no proven cytokine blocking agents for COVID currently used in clinical practice. In this regard, bioactive phytochemicals such as polyphenols may become promising tools to be used as adjuvants in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The consistent monitoring of blood alcohol concentration through breathalyzers is critical to identifying relapse or misuse. Smartphone apps as a replacement of or in conjunction with breathalyzers have shown limited effectiveness. Yet, there has been little research that has effectively utilized wireless or Wi-FiCenabled breathalyzers that can accurately, securely, and reliably measure blood alcohol concentration. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a wireless blood alcohol concentration device in collaboration with long-term treatment on dropout rates, psychological distress, treatment motivation, quality of life, and need for higher levels of follow-up care for patients with alcohol use disorder. METHODS: The randomized clinical trial will include two arms, access to the wireless breathalyzer versus no access to the breathalyzer, while both groups have access to treatment. Evaluation will last 3 months with a 6-week follow-up, during which each participant will be interviewed at admission, 1 month in, 2 months in, 3 months in, and follow-up. Individuals will be recruited online through a secure telehealth meeting invitation. Outcomes will focus on the impact of the wireless breathalyzer within the alcohol use disorder population, and the combined effect on psychological distress, treatment motivation, and quality of life. In addition, we intend to investigate the impact of the breathalyzer on dropout rates and participants need for higher levels of follow-up care and treatment. RESULTS: The recruitment of this study started in July 2020 and will run until 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This information will be important to develop cost-effective treatments for alcohol dependence. Ongoing monitoring allows treatment providers to take an individualized disease management approach and facilitates timely intervention by the treatment provider.

Exposure to any given antigen can either improve or worsen the outcome of subsequent lung infections, depending on the immunological history of the host. Thus, an ability to impart transient alterations in the lung environment in anticipation of future insult could provide an important novel therapy for emerging infectious diseases. In this study, we show that nasal administration of virus-like particles (VLPs) before, or immediately after, lethal challenge with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) of mice i) ensures complete recovery from lung infection and near absolute clearance of bacteria within 12 hours of challenge, ii) reduces host response-induced lung tissue damage, iii) promotes recruitment and efficient bacterial clearance by neutrophils and CD11c(+) cells, and iv) protects macrophages from MRSA-induced necrosis. VLP-mediated protection against MRSA relied on innate immunity. Complete recovery occurred in VLP-dosed mice with severe combined immunodeficiency, but not in wild-type mice depleted of either Ly6G(+) or CD11c(+) cells. Early IL-13 production associated with VLP-induced CD11c(+) cells was essential for VLP-induced protection. These results indicate that VLP-induced alteration of the lung environment protects the host from lethal MRSA pneumonia by enhancing phagocyte recruitment and killing and by reducing inflammation-induced tissue damage via IL-13Cdependent mechanisms.","output":"Virus-Like Particle-Induced Protection Against MRSA Pneumonia Is Dependent on IL-13 and Enhancement of Phagocyte Function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Militaries are commonly deployed in response to domestic disasters.

We aimed to investigate the potential impact of different testing and isolation strategies on transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission based on infectiousness and PCR test sensitivity over time since infection. We estimated the reduction in the effective reproduction number (R) achieved by testing and isolating symptomatic individuals, regular screening of high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms, and quarantine of contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases identified through test-and-trace protocols. The expected effectiveness of different testing strategies was defined as the percentage reduction in R. We reviewed data on the performance of antibody tests reported by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics and examined their implications for the use of so-called immunity passports. FINDINGS: If all individuals with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 self-isolated and self-isolation was 100% effective in reducing onwards transmission, self-isolation of symptomatic individuals would result in a reduction in R of 47% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 32-55). PCR testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection soon after symptom onset could reduce the number of individuals needing to self-isolate, but would also reduce the effectiveness of self-isolation (around 10% would be false negatives). Weekly screening of health-care workers and other high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms by use of PCR testing is estimated to reduce their contribution to SARS-CoV-2 transmission by 23% (95% UI 16-40), on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms, assuming results are available at 24 h. The effectiveness of test and trace depends strongly on coverage and the timeliness of contact tracing, potentially reducing R by 26% (95% UI 14-35) on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms, if 80% of cases and contacts are identified and there is immediate testing following symptom onset and quarantine of contacts within 24 h. Among currently available antibody tests, performance has been highly variable, with specificity around 90% or lower for rapid diagnostic tests and 95-99% for laboratory-based ELISA and chemiluminescent assays. INTERPRETATION: Molecular testing can play an important role in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially among health-care workers and other high-risk groups, but no single strategy will reduce R below 1 at current levels of population immunity. Immunity passports based on antibody tests or tests for infection face substantial technical, legal, and ethical challenges.

Here we discuss the disease-modifying agents approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) within this context. Interferon (IFN)-1a and -1b, which display antiviral activity, could be protective in the early stage of COVID-19 infection, although SARS-CoV-2 may have developed resistance to IFNs. However, in the hyper inflammation stage, IFNs may become detrimental by facilitating macrophage invasion in the lung and other organs. Glatiramer acetate and its analogues should not interfere with the development of COVID-19 and may be considered safe. Teriflunomide, a first-line oral drug used in the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) may display antiviral activity by depleting cellular nucleotides necessary for viral replication. The other first-line drug, dimethyl fumarate, may afford protection against SARS-CoV-2 by activating the Nrf-2 pathway and reinforcing the cellular defences against oxidative stress. Concern has been raised on the use of second-line treatments for MS during COVID-19 pandemic. However, this concern is not always justified. For example, fingolimod, might be highly beneficial during the hyperinflammatory stage of COVID-19 for a number of mechanisms including the reinforcement of the endothelial barrier.

The subjects were divided into groups based on treatments and also on the increased number of small intestinal mucosal breaks. The candidate SNP was selected by an initial analysis of GWAS among the groups in various combinations. After the initial analysis, the gene including the specified SNP was analyzed in detail using GWAS and genotype imputation. RESULTS After analysis, 70 subjects receiving the loxoprofen treatment and 69 subjects receiving celecoxib treatment were determined to be eligible for the analysis. The minimum p value in GWAS was detected in the analysis of 16 cases with an increase of five or more mucosal breaks and 123 controls with zero to four mucosal breaks. In the GWAS, five SNPs in the bactericidal/permeability-increasing fold-containing family B member 4 (BPIFB4) gene showed the lowest p value (p = 2.69  10-7 with an odds ratio of 40.9).

It is urgent to develop a novel 3D cell migration model in vitro to simulate the tumor microenvironment as much as possible and screen out effective anti-migration drugs. Sodium alginate, has a widely used cell encapsulation material, as significant advantages. We have designed a microfluidic device to fabricate a hollow alginate hydrogel microtube model. Based on the difference in liquid flow rate, TSCC cells (Cal27) were able to be evenly distributed in the hollow microtubes, which was confirmed though fluorescence microscope and laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM). Our microfluidic device was cheap, and commercially available and could be assembled in a modular way, which are composed of a coaxial needle, silicone hose, and syringes. It was proved that the cells grow well in artificial microtubes with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins by LSCM and flow cytometry. Periodic motility conferred a different motor state to the cells in the microtubes, more closely resembling the environment in vivo. The quantitative analysis of tumor cell migration could be achieved simply by determining the position of the cell in the microtube cross-section. We verified the anti-migration effects of three NSAIDs drugs (aspirin, indomethacin, and nimesulide) with artificial microtubes, obtaining the same results as conventional migration experiments. The results showed that among the three NSAIDs, nimesulide showed great anti-migration potential against TSCC cells.

However, sensitive and specific detection of ST and SPA in environmental samples has been challenging. In this study, we developed and validated two methods for concentrating and detecting ST/SPA from wastewater: the Moore swab trap method for qualitative results, and ultrafiltration (UF) for sensitive quantitative detection, coupled with qPCR. We then applied these methods for ST and SPA wastewater surveillance in Kolkata, India and Dhaka, Bangladesh, two enteric fever endemic areas. The qPCR assays had a limit of detection of 17 equivalent genome copies (EGC) for ST and 25 EGC for SPA with good reproducibility. In seeded trials, the Moore swab method had a limit of detection of approximately 0.05-0.005 cfu/mL for both ST and SPA. In 53 Moore swab samples collected from three Kolkata pumping stations between September 2019 to March 2020, ST was detected in 69.8% and SPA was detected in 20.8%. Analysis of sewage samples seeded with known amount of ST and SPA and concentrated via the UF method, followed by polyethylene glycol precipitation and qPCR detection demonstrated that UF can effectively recover approximately 8 log10 cfu, 5 log10 cfu, and 3 log10 cfu of seeded ST and SPA in 5 L, 10 L, and 20 L of wastewater.

The rate of in-hospital death was 12.4% without COVID-19 vs 29.8% with COVID-19 (P<0.001). In mixed-effects logistic regression that accounted for patient clustering by hospital, comorbid COVID-19 increased the odds of in-hospital death over four-fold (OR 4.48, 95% CI 3.02 to 6.165). Comorbid COVID-19 was also associated with lower odds of a favorable discharge (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.61). In the sensitivity analysis, comparing AIS patients with COVID-19 who did not undergo EVT (n=2139) to the AIS EVT patients with COVID-19, there was no difference in the rate of in-hospital death (30.6% vs 29.8%, P=0.868), and AIS EVT patients had a higher rate of favorable discharge (32.4% vs 47.1%, P=0.002). CONCLUSION: In AIS patients treated with EVT, comorbid COVID-19 infection was associated with in-hospital death and a lower odds of favorable discharge compared with patients without COVID-19, but not compared with AIS patients with COVID-19 who did not undergo EVT. AIS EVT patients with COVID-19 were younger, more likely to be male, have systemic complications, and almost twice as likely to be black and over three times as likely to be Hispanic.","output":"Endovascular thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke patients with COVID-19: prevalence, demographics, and outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Faced with a global pandemic such as the one triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the medical supply chain has been highly demanded.

Here, for the first time, we report the use of this method with some modifications to generate an ADC from a monoclonal antibody, m860, which we identified from a human na?ve phage display Fab library by panning against the extracellular domain of human HER2. M860 bound to cell surface-associated HER2 with affinity comparable to that of Trastuzumab (Herceptin), but to a different epitope.

It exhibited potent and specific cell-killing activity against HER2 positive cancer cells, including trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells. This unique ADC may have utility as a potential therapeutic for HER2 positive cancers alone or in combination with other drugs.

The long-term consequences of it are not yet clear, as is whether society and life can return to a healthy state. Long-term assessment of their health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is essential. This study aimed to investigate HRQoL and its risk factors in COVID-19 survivors at a follow-up of 6-month. Methods: A multicenter cross-sectional survey was conducted among 192 COVID-19 patients with confirmed age  18 years who were discharged from various hospitals in Wuhan from January to April 2020. The demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory results of the study subjects were obtained from the hospital's medical records. Survivors' HRQoL was assessed using the Short Form 36 (SF-36), cognition was assessed using the ascertain dementia eight-item informant questionnaire (AD8), and survivors' pulmonary function were examined. All participants in this study completed the survey and testing at Hubei Provincial Hospital of Chinese and Western Medicine. SF-36 scores were compared with the Chinese norm, and logistic regression and multivariate analysis were used to investigate the factors affecting HRQoL in COVID-19 survivors. Results: SF-36 showed significant differences in HRQoL between COVID-19 survivors and the general Chinese population ( P< 0.05).Multiple linear regression demonstrated that age was negatively correlated with physical functioning (PF), role-physical limitation (RP) and social functioning (SF) ( P <0.05). Bodily pain (BP), vitality (VT), SF and role-emotional limitation (RE) were negatively correlated with females ( P <0.05). Length from discharge to follow\\\\up was positively correlated with PF and RP ( P <0.05). Abnormal cognitive function was negatively correlated with PF, RP, general health (GH), VT, SF, RE and mental health (MH) ( P <0.05). Abnormal Carbon Monoxide Diffusing Capacity (DLCO%<80%) was significantly negatively correlated with PF and SF ( P <0.05).In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between Coronary heart disease and RP, GH, VT and RE ( P <0.05).Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that age(OR 1.032) and AD8 scores (OR 1.203)were risk factors associated with a low physical component summary (PCS) score. Length from discharge to follow\\\\up (OR 0.971) was the protective factor for PCS score. Abnormal cognitive function (OR 1.543) was a significant determinant associated with a mental component summary (MCS)<50 in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: The HRQoL of COVID-19 survivors remains to be improved at six-month follow-up. Future studies should track HRQoL in older adults, women, patients with abnormal DLCO, and abnormal cognitive function for a long time and provide them with rehabilitation advice and guidance.","output":"Health-related quality of life of COVID-19 survivors at 6 months after hospital discharge: a cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a chronic neurodegenerative disease, Parkinsons disease requires a close cooperation between different specialist disciplines in order to ensure the best possible quality of life for patients.

Second opinions might be particularly useful for people recommended surgery for their back pain as surgery has at best a limited role in the management of back pain. METHODS We conducted a scoping review. Two independent researchers screened PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL and CINAHL from inception to May 6th, 2021. Studies of any design published in any language were eligible provided they described a second opinion intervention for people with spinal pain (low back or neck pain with or without radicular pain) either considering surgery or to whom surgery had been recommended. We assessed the methodological quality with the Downs & Black scale. Outcomes were: i) characteristics of second opinion services for people considering or who have been recommended spinal surgery, ii) agreement between first and second opinions in terms of diagnoses, need for surgery and type of surgery, iii) whether they reduce surgery and improve patient outcomes; and iv) the costs and healthcare use associated with these services. Outcomes were presented descriptively. RESULTS We screened 6341 records, read 27 full-texts, and included 12 studies (all observational; 11 had poor methodological quality; one had fair). Studies described patient, doctor, and insurance-initiated second opinion services. Diagnostic agreement between first and second opinions varied from 53 to 96%. Agreement for need for surgery between first and second opinions ranged from 0 to 83%. Second opinion services may reduce surgery rates in the short-term, but it is unclear whether these reductions are sustained in the long-term or if patients only delay surgery. Second opinion services may reduce costs and healthcare use (e.g. imaging), but might increase others (e.g. injections). CONCLUSIONS Second opinion services typically recommend less surgical treatments compared to first opinions and may reduce surgery rates in the short-term, but it is unclear whether these reductions are sustained in the long-term or if patients only delay surgery. There is a need for high-quality randomised trials to determine the value of second opinion services for reducing spinal surgery.","output":"Second opinions for spinal surgery: a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Calf diarrhea is a major cause of mortality in calves, and results in high treatment costs and economic loss for the dairy and cattle industries. In addition, diarrhea usually occurs around 2 weeks after calf birth. In this study, we determined how compound probiotics influenced the gut microbiota and its effect on diarrhea rates of newborn Holstein calves. The probiotics included compound yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces marxianus) and lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Lactobacillus plantarum). Among them, the LS, L, and S groups are different compound probiotic groups, and the D group is the control group. Our results revealed that although probiotics did not affect the community diversity of gut bacteria in newborn calves, compound probiotics significantly increased the community richness of gut bacteria. Principal coordinates analysis using weighted UniFrac distances showed that the microbial communities of calves fed compound probiotics were relatively closely clustered, but were separate from the communities of calves in the control group. The calves fed compound probiotics also had lower rates of diarrhea. Our findings improve our understanding of the role of probiotics in regulating the gut microbiota of calves, and are of special significance to researchers in the dairy and cattle industries. ABSTRACT: We evaluated the effects of probiotic compounds on the composition of the gut microbiota. Forty newborn calves were random allocated to the lactic acid bacteria + yeast group (LS group), lactic acid bacteria group (L group), yeast group (S group), and control group (D group). Probiotics containing Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Kluyveromyces marxianus were fed to calves in the three treatment groups for 15 days. The feeding process lasted 15 days. Fecal samples were collected from all calves at the end of the trial and analyzed using high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing. Totals of 1,029,260 high-quality reads and 420,010,128 bp of sequences were obtained. Among the four groups, the alpha diversity of gut microbes was significantly higher in newborn cattle in the LS group than in those in the L, S, and D groups. Overall, the dominant phyla were Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, whereas Bifidobacterium was the most abundant phylum in the gut of cattle in the LS group. Newborn calves from the compound probiotic groups had closely clustered gut bacterial communities and had lower rates of diarrhea. Overall, compound probiotics regulated the intestinal microbiota community structure of newborn calves and improved intestinal health. New information relevant to the prevention of diarrhea is provided by our research in newborn calves.","output":"Compound Probiotics Improve the Diarrhea Rate and Intestinal Microbiota of Newborn Calves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The identification and characterization of B-cell epitopes play an important role in vaccine design, immunodiagnostic tests, and antibody production. Therefore, computational tools for reliably predicting linear B-cell epitopes are highly desirable. We evaluated Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers trained utilizing five different kernel methods using fivefold cross-validation on a homology-reduced data set of 701 linear B-cell epitopes, extracted from Bcipep database, and 701 non-epitopes, randomly extracted from SwissProt sequences. Based on the results of our computational experiments, we propose BCPred, a novel method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes using the subsequence kernel. We show that the predictive performance of BCPred (AUC = 0.758) outperforms 11 SVM-based classifiers developed and evaluated in our experiments as well as our implementation of AAP (AUC = 0.7), a recently proposed method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes using amino acid pair antigenicity. Furthermore, we compared BCPred with AAP and ABCPred, a method that uses recurrent neural networks, using two data sets of unique B-cell epitopes that had been previously used to evaluate ABCPred. Analysis of the data sets used and the results of this comparison show that conclusions about the relative performance of different B-cell epitope prediction methods drawn on the basis of experiments using data sets of unique B-cell epitopes are likely to yield overly optimistic estimates of performance of evaluated methods. This argues for the use of carefully homology-reduced data sets in comparing B-cell epitope prediction methods to avoid misleading conclusions about how different methods compare to each other. Our homology-reduced data set and implementations of BCPred as well as the APP method are publicly available through our web-based server, BCPREDS, at: http://ailab.cs.iastate.edu/bcpreds/.","output":"Predicting linear B-cell epitopes using string kernels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While lymphopenia has been a common finding in COVID-19 infection, particularly in severe cases, febrile neutropenia has been very rarely reported in immunocompetent patients with COVID-19.

School closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted childrens access to school meals. Two policy approaches were activated to replace missed meals for children from low-income families. The Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT) program provided the cash value of missed meals directly to families on debit-like cards to use for making food purchases. The grab-and-go meals program offered prepared meals from school kitchens at community distribution points. The effectiveness of these programs at reaching those who needed them and their costs were unknown. ObjectiveTo determine how many eligible children were reached by P-EBT and grab-and-go meals, how many meals or benefits were received, and how much each program cost to implement. DesignCross-sectional study, Spring 2020. SettingNational. ParticipantsAll children <19 years old and children age 6-18 eligible to receive free or reduced price meals (FRPM). Exposure(s)Receipt of P-EBT or grab-and-go school meals. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Percentage of children reached by P-EBT and grab-and-go school meals; average benefit received per recipient; and average cost, including implementation costs and time costs to families, per meal distributed. ResultsGrab-and-go school meals reached about 10.5 million children (17% of all US children), most of whom were FRPM-eligible students. Among FRPM-eligible students only, grab-and-go meals reached 27%, compared to 89% reached by P-EBT. Among those receiving benefits, the average monthly benefit was larger for grab-and-go school meals ($148) relative to P-EBT ($110). P-EBT had lower costs per meal delivered - $6.51 - compared to $8.20 for grab- and-go school meals. P-EBT had lower public sector implementation costs but higher uncompensated time costs to families (e.g., preparation time for meals) compared to grab-and-go school meals. Conclusions and RelevanceBoth programs supported childrens access to food when schools were closed and in complementary ways. P-EBT is an efficient and effective policy option to support food access for eligible children when school is out. KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat were the operating costs, costs and benefits to families, and proportion of eligible children who received benefits of two programs aimed at replacing school meals missed when schools were closed due to COVID-19? FindingsIn this cross sectional analysis, we found that the Pandemic-Electronic Benefit Transfer program, in which state agencies sent debit cards loaded with the cash value of missed school meals directly to families, reached nearly all low income students (89%) and cost relatively little per meal provided. In comparison, grab-and-go school meals, in which school food service departments provided prepared meals for offsite consumption, reached 27% of low income children and was associated with larger per meal costs.

This scaling is described by two parameters, one representing a shift along the time axis and the other is a normalisation factor, providing a reliable definition of the mortality rate for each country in a given period. The number of segments for any country required in our analyses turns out to be surprisingly few with as many as 16 out of 54 countries being described by a single segment and no country requiring more than three segments. Estimates of the shift and mortality for these 54 countries in different periods show large spreads ranging over 0-16 days and 0.45-19.96%, respectively. Shift and mortality are found to be inversely correlated. Analyses of number of tests carried out for detecting COVID-19 and the number of infections detected due to such tests suggest that an effective way to increase the shift, and therefore, decrease mortality, is to increase number of tests per infection detected. This points to the need of a dynamic management of testing that should accelerate with the rise of the pandemic; it also suggests a basis for adjusting variations in the testing patterns in different geographical locations within a given country.","output":"A comparative study of infection and mortality in COVID-19 across countries: A scaling analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The German Prevention Act (Pr?vG) came into force in 2015 As a federal law, it remains vague with regard to municipal structure The municipalities, as those public health units that have direct access to the living environment, play a central role in the implementation of health promotion and prevention The evaluation by the National Prevention Conference in 2019 showed that the involvement of the municipal public health services (?GD) has not yet been sufficiently achieved A major problem is the heterogeneity of ?GD units in Germany's federal structure, about which little information is available Methods In order to fully capture this heterogeneity for the first time, a systematic online screening was carried out For this purpose, the websites of all 358 ?GD units were screened independently of two researchers according to structural conditions Results 70% of all municipal ?GD units are located at district level, 18% at city district level and 12% cumulatively Population varies from 35,000 to about 1 5 million inhabitants The allocation of the ?GD units to youth service planning and social welfare varies in the federal states from 18 7% to 94 4%, within regulatory agency and veterinary office from 27 8% to 79 2% Conclusions The heterogeneity makes the establishment of municipal standards difficult Due to the diverse administrative allocation, different levels of policy-making must be considered on the way to health in all policies The political classification reflects in roughly equal parts an ?GD orientation towards health protection or social determinants of health, as recommended for the Pr?vG A one-sided orientation towards health protection was shown by the temporary suspension of the use of financial resources for prevention in the course of the 2nd pandemic law to combat the COVID-19 pandemic For the announced reform of the German ?GD it is necessary to homogenize essential structural characteristics and to prevent a one-sided orientation Key messages The heterogeneity of municipal health services makes it difficult to implement the German Prevention Act In the course of the upcoming ?GD reform, essential structural characteristics should be homogenized and a one-sided orientation of the municipal ?GD units towards health protection should be avoided","output":"Implementation of the German Prevention Act: Municipal Public Health Units as a Bottleneck?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Governments across Europe are preparing for the emergence from lockdown, in phases, to prevent a resurgence in cases of COVID-19. Along with social distancing (SD) measures, contact tracing comprising find, track, trace and isolate (FTTI) policies are also being implemented. Here, we investigate FTTI policies in terms of their impact on the endemic equilibrium. We used a generative model, the dynamic causal 'Location', 'Infection', 'Symptom' and 'Testing' (LIST) model to identify testing, tracing, and quarantine requirements. We optimised LIST model parameters based on time series of daily reported cases and deaths of COVID-19 in England and based upon reported cases in the nine regions of England and in all 150 upper tier local authorities. Using these optimised parameters, we forecasted infection rates and the impact of FTTI for each area; national, regional, and local. Predicting data from early June 2020, we find that under conditions of medium-term immunity, a '40%' FTTI policy (or greater), could reach a distinct endemic equilibrium that produces a significantly lower death rate and a decrease in ICU occupancy. Considering regions of England in isolation, some regions could substantially reduce death rates with 20% efficacy. We characterise the accompanying endemic equilibria in terms of dynamical stability, observing bifurcation patterns whereby relatively small increases in FTTI efficacy result in stable states with reduced overall morbidity and mortality. These analyses suggest that FTTI will not only save lives, even if only partially effective, and could underwrite the stability of any endemic steady-state we manage to attain.","output":"Using the LIST model to Estimate the Effects of Contact Tracing on COVID-19 Endemic Equilibria in England and its Regions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Adherence to self-care is the goal of nursing care for elderly people with hypertension to give them optimal functional health status. The purpose of this paper is to determine the effectiveness of self-management on adherence to self-care and management of health status elderly people living with hypertension in Pekanbaru City. Design and methods: This study design was quasi-experimental with a pre-post test with a control group. The self-management intervention was provided through four home visits to elderly people living with hypertension with a caregiver. Samples were taken by the consecutive sampling technique, and a total number 134 elderly people were participants. The instruments used were the adherence to self-care questionnaire and the Short Form 12 Health Survey (SF12) for elderly people. RESULTS The results showed that most of the respondents with hypertension were 60-74 years of age (84.3%), were female (67.9%), of Minang ethnicity (48.5%), had completed primary school (44%), were unemployed (81.3) %), had a family history of hypertension (50%), were non-smokers (52.2%), and had never drunk alcohol (95.5%). The effects of self-management were positive on adherence to caring for themselves (p<0.001) and on health status (p<0.001). The most influencing factor on self-care compliance and health status after being controlled by confounding variables was self-management (p<0.001).

A web-based survey of antimicrobial leads gathered data about the use of procalcitonin testing. Responses were received from 148/151 (98%) eligible hospitals. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was widespread introduction and expansion of PCT use in NHS hospitals. The number of hospitals using PCT in emergency/acute admissions rose from 17 (11%) to 74/146 (50.7%) and use in Intensive Care Units (ICU) increased from 70 (47.6%) to 124/147 (84.4%). This increase happened predominantly in March and April 2020, preceding NICE guidance. Approximately half of hospitals used PCT as a single test to guide decisions to discontinue antibiotics and half used repeated measurements. There was marked variation in the thresholds used for empiric antibiotic cessation and guidance about interpretation of values.

However, one criticism is that EHRs increase the providers engagement with the computer and decrease engagement with the patient leading to less patient-centered care. Patient-centered care is personalized care tailored to individual patient needs and preferences. Interventions have been suggested to help manage EHR use during visits while balancing computer interaction and patient-centered care. Methods: Using the Resident-as-Teacher: a layered learning intervention, patient care training, patient-centric EHR use and team development of residents is balanced with creating a shared understanding of these processes. New interns serve as scribes for the senior residents, observing how patient care is conducted while taking notes necessary for charting and billing requirements. The intern and senior resident together navigate the EHR to ensure proper documentation. In addition, attending physicians precept every patient, providing the aspect of layered learning. The roles are then reversed and the senior resident becomes the interns scribe. The intern is able to focus on patient care without any distractions that would have been present if the intern was fully in charge of the visit. The resident addresses any missed items with the intern before conclusion of each office visit. EHR training in this manner resulted in 15% more patient encounters while building rapport between the residents. Our assessment included an examination of patient visit counts and an open-ended survey administered to all interns and residents. Adapting training to telehealth during COVID-19 highlights adaptations to in-person training that could be implemented in the virtual environment while maintaining connection between the preceptor and resident. For example, use of a virtual precepting room, providing the most up to date best practice information and training residents how to provide the best possible care with the limited information received when only seeing the patient virtually. We conducted qualitative interviews with residents approximately one month into the training to assess residents perceptions of its impact and support they received. Results: Analysis of the Resident-as-Teacher suggests that it provided more patient interactions for interns and residents, as well as facilitated rapport building on the team. For adapting training to telehealth, interviews with residents noted a few challenges but support from attendings was appreciated. Conclusions: EHRs have been viewed more as a system required in health care and less of a tool to aid in organization and communication. With appropriate training, EHRs can be an asset to clinical care while working in conjunction with patient-centered care. Providers working together during a resident training period can promote a beneficial learning curve for both patient care and reducing providers amount of work after clinic. ? 2022 by the authors.","output":"Training to improve patient-centered electronic health record (EHR) use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using data from the Drug Shortages Canada website, we ask whether the first months of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic were associated with a significant increase in drug shortages in Canada.

METHODS: A total of 180 patients with DOR diagnosed from December 2013 to December 2014 were equally assigned into progynova and duphaston (E+D) group, Zuogui Pill () group and BYHD group with 60 cases in each by computerized randomization. Patients received E+D, Zuogui Pill or BYHD for 12 months, respectively. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), anti-Mllerian hormone (AMH), antral follicle count (AFC), ovarian volume, endometrial thickness, and the resistance indices (RIs) of ovarian arteries and uterine arteries were observed before and after treatment. RESULTS: Nine women (4 from the E+D group, 3 from the Zuogui Pill group, and 2 from the BYHD group) withdrew from the study. After 6 months, Zuogui Pill and BYHD significantly decreased FSH and LH and increased endometrial thickness and AMH (all P<0.01). BYHD also resulted in E2 elevation (P<0.05), ovary enlargement (P<0.05), AFC increase (P<0.01), and RI of ovarian arteries decrease (P<0.05). After 12 months, further improvements were observed in the Zuogui Pill and BYHD groups (all P<0.01), but BYHD showed better outcomes, with lower FSH, larger ovaries and a thicker endometrium compared with the Zuogui Pill group (all P<0.01). However, E+D only significantly increased endometrial thickness (P<0.01) and no significant improvements were observed in the RI of uterine arteries in the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: BYHD had a favorable therapeutic effect in patients with DOR by rebalancing hormone levels, promoting ovulation, and repairing the thin endometrium.

Even though effective vaccination is a major contributor to slowing down the current pandemic, vaccine hesitancy remains a major challenge. To analyze attitudes toward vaccine hesitancy, a web-based cross-sectional survey was used to understand and describe the influences of attitudes about vaccination against COVID-19 in the German population. A descriptive analysis for the entire dataset was carried out, and multiple proportional odds regression, path model, and structural equation modeling (SEM) were subsequently used to analyze any relationship between latent variables and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. In total, 1092 responses from across Germany were analyzed. SEM modeling revealed that trust in institutions, trust in non-pharmaceutical interventions, and various demographic factors were associated with intent to vaccinate. Descriptive analysis and multiple proportional odds regression confirmed that a history of influenza vaccination and level of satisfaction with democratic institutions were highly predictive (p < 0.05) for COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Additionally, social determinants of health such as gender, age, number of children in the family, and the degree of satisfaction with life were also predictors (p < 0.05) for COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.

Furthermore, LC3 protein is covalently modified during poliovirus infection in a manner indistinguishable from that observed during bona fide autophagy. This covalent modification can also be induced by the expression of viral protein 2BC in isolation. However, differences between poliovirus-induced vesicles and autophagosomes also exist: the viral-induced membranes are smaller, at 200-400 nm in diameter, and can be induced by the combination of two viral proteins, termed 2BC and 3A. Experimental suppression of expression of proteins in the autophagy pathway was found to reduce viral yield, arguing that this pathway facilitates viral infection, rather than clearing it.

Here we show that, to mitigate the risk of future shortages, it is possible to envision recyclable PCR kits, based on a more sustainable use of nucleic acid resources. A PCR kit is mainly composed of primers, nucleotides, and enzymes. In the case of a positive test, the free nucleotides are polymerized onto the primers to form longer DNA strands. Our approach depolymerizes such strands keeping the primers and regenerating the nucleotides, i.e., returning the nucleic acid materials to the original state. The polymerized long DNA strands are hydrolyzed into nucleotides monophosphates that are then phosphorylated in triphosphates using a method that is a development of a recently published one. We used oligonucleotides with 3-terminal phosphorothioate (PS) backbone modification as non-hydrolysable PCR primers, so to undergo the recycling process unchanged.

Hence, the present study is aimed to evaluate the role of inflammatory markers in predicting the outcome of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. Methods: A total of 272 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in the study. Clinical and demographic data were collected. Biochemical, hematological, and inflammatory markers were assessed in all patients. Disease severity and primary outcome as survival and or mortality were recorded. Results:Hematological indices and inflammatory markers were significantly higher among the non-survivors. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) can differentiate non-survivors from survivors with 100% sensitivity and 70.2% specificity, with a cut-off value of 79.6 in the receiver operator curve (ROC). As disease severity was increasing, IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly increased among patients. Survival analysis showed that an elevated level of IL-6 was significantly associated with mortality and Cox regression analysis showed the hazard ratio (HR) of IL-6 was 0.996 (P<0.007). Conclusion:The results of the present study implicate that increased levels of IL-6 and CRP were significantly correlated with severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients.

VVV demonstrated that the cloned virus population was homogeneous (as designed) at position 2934 where the wild-type virus demonstrated two variant populations at a ratio of almost 50:50. A total of 18, 10, 3 and 28, viral genetic variants were detected for AMPV, PEDV, TCoV and IBV respectively. The simplicity of this pipeline makes the study of viral genetic variants more accessible to a wide variety of biologists, which should ultimately increase the rate of understanding of the mechanisms of viral genetic evolution.","output":"Viral variant visualizer (VVV): A novel bioinformatic tool for rapid and simple visualization of viral genetic diversity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A convenient route has been developed for the synthesis of novel 6-amino-2,2-(or 3,3-difluoro)-2-(or 3),6-dideoxy-hexopyranoses.

The aim of this study was to outline the main issues that led tobacco smoking being discussed as a potential risk factor associated with COVID-19. METHODS: articles from MEDLINE and pre-prints published from January to April 2020 were identified. RESULTS: data from China showed that men had more severe outcomes of COVID-19 than women. Since smoking prevalence is very high among Chinese men in comparison to women, it was hypothesized that smoking could be a risk factor for poor prognosis. This was also supported by the higher prevalence of comorbidities, many of which tobacco-related diseases, in patients with severe COVID-19, who were also more likely to have a smoking history. A meta-analysis confirmed these results, reporting an OR=2.25 (95% CI: 1.49-3.39) for developing severe COVID-19 among patients with a smoking history. Some authors, noticing that reported smoking prevalence among hospitalized patients was substantially lower than smoking prevalence in the source populations, speculated a protective role of nicotine. However, it is likely that low prevalence among hospitalized patients are partially due to many smokers misclassified as nonsmokers. Tobacco smoking seems to cause a dose-dependent upregulation of angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2), the virus cellular entry receptor, which could explain the higher risk of severe COVID-19 in smokers. CONCLUSIONS: There is need for further independent studies to clarify the role of smoking on COVID-19 incidence, progression and mortality.

Many mechanisms have been found to be related to this clinical phenomenon. Predicting this event by using hematological biomarkers may provide opportunities for adopting preventive measures against unfavorable neurovascular complications. The aim of this study is to determine the hematological predictors of carotid artery vasospasm during carotid stenting. Material and methods A total of 120 patients who underwent carotid stenting were divided into two groups: those with and without carotid artery vasospasm. Carotid artery vasospasm was angiographically defined as transient or persistent emergent stenosis or irregularity of the vessel wall without evidence of thrombosis during carotid stenting. The hematological parameters were compared between 21 patients who developed carotid artery vasospasm (17.5%) and 99 patients who did not (82.5%). Results The mean age of the patients with carotid artery vasospasm and without carotid artery vasospasm was 66 8 and 70 8 years, respectively. Creatinine levels within 0.5-0.9 (OR = 3.704, 95% CI: 1.245-11.019, p = 0.019), each 1000 unit increase in neutrophil count (OR = 1.567, 95% CI: 1.027-2.392, p = 0.037) and presence of diabetes (OR = 3.081, 95% CI: 1.116-8.505, p = 0.030) were the independent predictors of carotid artery vasospasm in carotid arteries during carotid stenting. Conclusions The prediction of carotid artery vasospasm during carotid stenting should help clinicians adopt preventive measures against the development of neurological sequelae.

Multimorbidity is also becoming more common in this population as more people live longer with breast cancer and experience late effects of cancer treatment. Breast cancer survivors have heightened risk of depression, but to what extent multimorbidity affects the mental health of this population is less clear. This study aims to investigate the association between multimorbidity and depression among women living with and beyond breast cancer in the UK Biobank cohort. METHODS: Data from UK Biobank (recruitment during 2006 to 2010, aged 40C70 years) were used to identify 8438 women with a previous diagnosis of breast cancer via linked cancer registries in England, Scotland and Wales. The lifetime number of chronic conditions was self-reported and multimorbidity defined as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5+. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) was used to define participants that were likely to have depression based on their symptom reporting at baseline. Logistic regression models were used to analyse the associations between multimorbidity and depression, accounting for a number of potential sociodemographic confounding variables (including age, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, education level and marital status) and characteristics related to the cancer (number of years since diagnosis and recurrence/secondary cancer). RESULTS: Multimorbidity was common among breast cancer survivors, with 32.9% of women experiencing one and 30.1% experiencing two or more chronic health conditions. Hypertension (25.8%), painful conditions (18.3%), and asthma (11.6%) were the three most common co-morbid conditions. 5.3% of participants had current depression. A strong, dose-response relationship was found between multimorbidity and the likelihood of depression (OR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.56C2.79 for two conditions and OR = 6.06, 95% CI: 3.63C10.14 for five or more conditions). CONCLUSIONS: Multimorbidity and depression were strongly associated among female UK Biobank participants with a previous breast cancer diagnosis. This association became increasingly pronounced as the number of chronic comorbid conditions increased. As more people survive cancer for longer, increasing recognition and support for multimorbidity and its impact on mental health is needed.

Improper treatment of this waste poses serious risks of disease transmission to waste pickers, waste workers, health workers, patients, and the community in general through exposure to infectious agents. Poor management of the waste emits harmful and deleterious contaminants into society. However, contamination of highly contagious agents such as the COVID-19 virus has created enormous instability in healthcare waste handling and subsequent recycling because of the volume of the waste generated and its contagious nature. Several countries have adopted safety measures to combat this contamination and manage healthcare waste; however, these measures are insufficient and vary depending on the context of the country. In addition, the WHO has set out guidelines for management of healthcare waste. These guidelines are helping to manage the highly contagious healthcare waste resulting from the current pandemic. Proper healthcare waste management may add value by reducing the spread of the COVID-19 virus and increasing the recyclability of materials instead of sending them to landfill. Disinfecting and sorting out healthcare waste facilitates sustainable management and allows their utilization for valuable purposes. This review discusses the different healthcare solid waste management strategies practiced in different countries, the challenges faced during this management, and the possible solutions for overcoming these challenges.

Influenza-like illness (ILI), a disease caused by respiratory pathogens including but not exclusively by influenza virus, is a major health concern in this population. However, there is little information on changes in the nasopharyngeal (NP) microbiota of older adults associated with respiratory infections identified by/ reported as ILI, as well as its dynamics during recovery. Here, we compared the NP microbiota in older adults who presented with ILI (n= 240) to the NP microbiota in older adults not reporting an ILI event (n= 157) during the 2014-2015 influenza season. To investigate the dynamics of the microbiota from the acute phase to the recovery phase of the infection, participants reporting an ILI event were sampled at onset of infection (<72 hours), at 14 days and at 7-9 weeks after infection (recovery sample). Results Cross-sectional analysis of the microbiota at the different time-points showed no differences in alpha diversity between the groups. A small but significant effect of the ILI was observed on the microbiota community and structure when compared to controls and recovery samples. Furthermore, the NP microbiota exhibited inter-individual differences in dynamics from onset of ILI to recovery. Corynebacterium, one of the keystone species in the upper respiratory tract, was negatively associated with ILI and its abundance increased after recovery. Potential pathobionts such as Haemophilus, Porphyromonas and Gemella had higher abundances during acute-ILI. Stability and changes in the NP microbial community showed individual dynamics. Key core genera, Corynebacterium, Moraxella and Dolosigranulum exhibited higher inter-individual variability in acute-ILI, but showed comparable variability to controls after recovery. Participants in the ILI group with higher core microbiota abundances at the acute phase showed higher microbiota stability after recovery. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that acute-ILI is associated with small but significant alterations in the phylogenetic structure of the NP microbiota in older adults. The observed variation in the core microbiota suggests potential imbalances in the ecosystem, which could play a role in the recovery of the NP microbiota after an ILI event.","output":"Associations and recovery dynamics of the nasopharyngeal microbiota during influenza-like illness in the aging population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A significant fraction of the more than 18 million scientific articles currently indexed in the PubMed database are related to immune responses to various agents, including infectious microbes, autoantigens, allergens, transplants, cancer antigens and others. The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) is an online repository that catalogs immune epitope reactivity data derived from articles listed in the National Library of Medicine PubMed database. The IEDB is maintained and continually updated by monitoring PubMed for new, potentially relevant references. METHODOLOGY: Herein we detail the classification of all epitope-specific literature in over 100 different immunological domains representing Infectious Diseases and Microbes, Autoimmunity, Allergy, Transplantation and Cancer. The relative number of references in each category reflects past and present areas of research on immune reactivities. In addition to describing the overall landscape of data distribution, this particular characterization of the epitope reference data also allows for the exploration of possible correlations with global disease morbidity and mortality data. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: While in most cases diseases associated with high morbidity and mortality rates were amongst the most studied, a number of high impact diseases such as dengue, Schistosoma, HSV-2, B. pertussis and Chlamydia trachoma, were found to have very little coverage. The data analyzed in this fashion represents the first estimate of how reported immunological data corresponds to disease-related morbidity and mortality, and confirms significant discrepancies in the overall research foci versus disease burden, thus identifying important gaps to be pursued by future research. These findings may also provide a justification for redirecting a portion of research funds into some of the underfunded, critical disease areas.","output":"Classification of the Universe of Immune Epitope Literature: Representation and Knowledge Gaps"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Racial disparities have been observed in the impacts of COVID-19 in the USA.

In addition, Blacks differed significantly from Whites in their assessment of COVID-19s threat to public health and the economy, the adequacy of government responses to COVID-19, and the appropriateness of behavioral changes to mitigate COVID-19s spread. Although in many cases these views of COVID-19 were also associated with political ideology, this association was significantly stronger for Whites than Blacks.

Accurate prediction of the binding between short peptides and the MHC molecules has long been a principal challenge for immunoinformatics. Recently, the modeling of MHC-peptide binding has come to emphasize quantitative predictions: instead of categorizing peptides as \\"binders\\" or \\"non-binders\\" or as \\"strong binders\\" and \\"weak binders\\", recent methods seek to make predictions about precise binding affinities. RESULTS: We developed a quantitative support vector machine regression (SVR) approach, called SVRMHC, to model peptide-MHC binding affinities. As a non-linear method, SVRMHC was able to generate models that out-performed existing linear models, such as the \\"additive method\\". By adopting a new \\"11-factor encoding\\" scheme, SVRMHC takes into account similarities in the physicochemical properties of the amino acids constituting the input peptides. When applied to MHC-peptide binding data for three mouse class I MHC alleles, the SVRMHC models produced more accurate predictions than those produced previously. Furthermore, comparisons based on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that SVRMHC was able to out-perform several prominent methods in identifying strongly binding peptides. CONCLUSION: As a method with demonstrated performance in the quantitative modeling of MHC-peptide binding and in identifying strong binders, SVRMHC is a promising immunoinformatics tool with not inconsiderable future potential.","output":"Quantitative prediction of mouse class I MHC peptide binding affinity using support vector machine regression (SVR) models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalised Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with diabetes. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted in patients with diabetes admitted with COVID-19 to Mediclinic Parkview Hospital in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) from 30th March to 7th June 2020. They had laboratory and/or radiologically confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), known as COVID-19. Variation in characteristics, length of stay in hospital, diabetes status, comorbidities and outcomes were examined. Results: A total of 103 patients with confirmed COVID-19 presentations had diabetes. During the same timeframe, 410 patients overall were admitted with COVID-19 infection. This gives a total proportion of persons admitted with COVID-19 infection and coexistent diabetes/prediabetes of 25%. 67% (n=69) of the COVID-19 diabetes cohort were male. Patients admitted with COVID-19 and diabetes represented 17 different ethnicities. Of these, 59.2% (n=61) were Asians and 35% (n=36) were from Arab countries. Mean age (SD) was 54 (12.5) years. 85.4% (n=88) were known to have diabetes prior to admission, while 14.6% (n=15) were newly diagnosed with either diabetes or prediabetes during admission. Most patients in the study cohort had type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, with only 3% overall having type 1 diabetes (n=3). 46.9% of patients had evidence of good glycaemic control of their diabetes during the preceding 4-12 weeks prior to admission as defined arbitrarily by admission HbA1c <7.5%. 73.8% (n=76) had other comorbidities including hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, and dyslipidaemia.

The results showed that the overall prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic was 24.94% (95% CI: 21.83C28.05, I(2) = 0.0%, P = 0.804) and 24.83% (95% CI: 21.41C28.25, I(2) = 0.0%, P = 0.897), respectively. CONCLUSION: This umbrella review shows that the prevalence of anxiety and depression is relatively high among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare workers should be provided with resources to minimize this risk.","output":"The prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: An umbrella review of meta-analyses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Airway oscillometry has become the de facto standard for quality assessment of lung physiology in laboratory animals and has demonstrated its usefulness in understanding diseases of small airways. Nowadays, it is seeing extensive use in daily clinical practice and research; however, a question that remains unanswered is how well physiological findings in animals and humans correlate? Methodological and device differences are obvious between animal and human studies. However, all devices deliver an oscillated airflow test signal and output respiratory impedance. In addition, despite analysis differences, there are ways to interpret animal and human oscillometry data to allow suitable comparisons. The potential with oscillometry is its ability to reveal universal features of the respiratory system across species, making translational extrapolation likely to be predictive. This means that oscillometry can thus help determine if an animal model displays the same physiological characteristics as the human disease. Perhaps more importantly, it can also be useful to determine whether an intervention is effective as well as to understand if it affects the desired region of the respiratory system, e.g., the periphery of the lung. Finally, findings in humans can also inform preclinical scientists and give indications as to what type of physiological changes should be observed in animal models to make them relevant as models of human disease. The present article will attempt to demonstrate the potential of oscillometry in respiratory research, an area where the development of novel therapies is plagued with a failure rate higher than in other disease areas.","output":"Oscillometry of the respiratory system: a translational opportunity not to be missed"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the initial pandemic phase, effluents from wastewater treatment facilities were reported mostly free from Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA, and thus conventional wastewater treatments were generally considered effective. However, there is a lack of first-hand data on i) comparative efficacy of various treatment processes for SARS-CoV-2 RNA removal; and ii) temporal variations in the removal efficacy of a given treatment process in the backdrop of active COVID-19 cases. This work provides a comparative account of the removal efficacy of conventional activated sludge (CAS) and root zone treatments (RZT) based on weekly wastewater surveillance data, consisting of forty-four samples, during a two-month period. The average genome concentration was higher in the inlets of CAS-based wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in the Sargasan ward (1.25  10(3) copies/ L), than that of RZT-based WWTP (7.07  10(2) copies/ L) in an academic institution campus of Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India. ORF 1ab and S genes appeared to be more sensitive to treatment i.e., significantly reduced (p < 0.05) than N genes (p > 0.05). CAS treatment exhibited better RNA removal efficacy (p = 0.014) than RZT (p = 0.032). Multivariate analyses suggested that the effective genome concentration should be calculated based on the presence/absence of multiple genes. The present study stresses that treated effluents are not always free from SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and the removal efficacy of a given WWTP is prone to exhibit temporal variability owing to variations in active COVID-19 cases in the vicinity and genetic material accumulation over the time. Disinfection seems less effective than the adsorption and coagulation processes for SARS-CoV-2 removal. Results stress the need for further research on mechanistic insight on SARS-CoV-2 removal through various treatment processes taking solidCliquid partitioning into account.","output":"First comparison of conventional activated sludge versus root-zone treatment for SARS-CoV-2 RNA removal from wastewaters: Statistical and temporal significance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using a recently introduced efficient mass spectrometry-based approach we monitored in molecular detail the IgG1 clonal responses in individual donorsindividual donors IgG1 clonal responses in molecular detail, examining SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein-specific IgG1 repertoires. We monitored the plasma clonal IgG1 profiles of 8 donors (4 male and 4 female) who had recently experienced an infection by either the wild type Wuhan Hu-1 virus or one of 3 VOCs (Alpha, Beta and Gamma). In these donors we charted the full plasma IgG1 repertoires as well as the IgG1 repertoires targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimer as antigen. We observed that shortly after infection in between <0.1% to almost 10% of all IgG1 antibody molecules present in plasma did bind to the spike protein. Each donor displayed a unique plasma IgG1 repertoire, but also each donor displayed a unique and polyclonal antibody response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein variants. Our analyses revealed that certain clones exhibit (alike) binding affinity towards all four tested spike-protein variants, whereas other clones displayed strong unique mutant-specific affinity. We conclude that each infected person generates a unique polyclonal response following infection, whereby some of these clones can bind multiple viral variants, whereas other clones do not display such cross-reactivity. In general, by assessing IgG1 repertoires following infection it becomes possible to identify and select fully matured human plasma antibodies that target specific antigens, and display either high specificity or cross-reactivity versus mutated versions of the antigen, which will aid in selecting antibodies that may be developed into biotherapeutics.","output":"IgG1 responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection are polyclonal and highly personalized, whereby each donor and each clone displays a distinct pattern of cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Use of wastewater-based epidemiology as a tool to record and manage the course of SARS-CoV-2 infections in human populations requires information about the efficiency of methods to concentrate the virus from wastewater.

The patientas clinical presentation, and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction) were recorded. The patients were divided by diagnosis into COVID (COVID-19 infection) or CONTROL (an alternate diagnosis). A retrospective review of consecutive patients over a further 2-week period were used for the purposes of validation. ResultsOverall, 399 patients (53% COVID, 47% CONTROL) were analysed.

Although SRI is a common procedure in eye research laboratories, there is no published guidance on the best practices for determining what constitutes a 'successful' SRI. Optimal injections are required for reproducibility of the procedure and, when carried out suboptimally, can lead to erroneous conclusions. To address this issue, we propose a standardized protocol for SRI with 'procedure success' defined by follow-up examination of the retina and the retinal pigmented epithelium rather than solely via intraoperative endpoints. This protocol takes 7-14 d to complete, depending on the reagent delivered. We have found, by instituting a standardized training program, that trained ophthalmologists achieve reliable proficiency in this technique after ~350 practice injections.

Moreover, we decided to exhibit the possibility of using this substance to treat COVID-19 infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The latest available scientific publications were reviewed until November 14, 2020, from the PubMed platform. RESULTS: Nicotine is a cholinergic agonist and pro-inflammatory cytokines inhibitor. Some authors present that smoking and nicotine reduce the amount of the ACE2 receptors which are used by the novel coronavirus to enter cells, while others claim that ACE2 receptors are upregulated in smokers. Moreover, the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with nAChR is suspected of dysregulation of the nicotinic cholinergic system, which is associated with the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Due to the harmfulness of cigarettes, a high frequency of smokers is suspected among people suffering from COVID-19. However, some studies report that the number of current smokers hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection is lower than expected, considering the prevalence of smoking in individual countries. Nicotine could restore the impaired function of the nicotine cholinergic system and possibly mitigate the cytokine storm. CONCLUSIONS: There is no clear attitude regarding the impact of smoking on the new coronavirus infection now. Researchers do not recommend smoking as a tool to combat the pandemic and show the importance of fighting addiction to reduce the adverse health effects of smoking.

One of the reasons is the possibility of infection of the recipient with SARS-CoV-2. Determining the risk of transmission of COVID 19 with a donor organ is very important for developing a kidney transplantation policy during a pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHOD We present cases of kidney transplantation from COVID 19 positive deceased donor to two dialysis patients in single center. Deceased donor: a 45 years old man with diabetes, who had a major hemorrhagic stroke resulting in brain death. He had normal urine output and serum creatinine level for last 24 hours before kidney harvesting. For a few hours after organ harvesting, the donor was diagnosed COVID 19 (retrospective nasopharyngeal swab rRT-PCR which was confirmed by morphological examination and RNA-PCR of specimens from the trachea and bronchus). Recipient 1: a 49 years old man with polycystic kidney disease had been on hemodialysis for 28 months. He was in urgent list because of problems with vascular access. So non identical ABO (0-donor, B-recipient) kidney transplantation from this deceased donor was done in May 2020. Recipient 2: a 45 years old man with polycystic kidney disease on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). was registered on urgent waiting list because of low transport capacity of peritoneum. Kidney transplantation from the same deceased donor was done at the same time. In both cases we completely abandoned any antilymphocytic agents for induction, despite non ABO identical transplantation in one of the recipients and the delayed graft function. Both patients received only basic immunosuppression, including tacrolimus, methylprednisolone and a mycophenolic acid. RESULTS In first case cold ischemia time was 22 hours. The recipient had delayed graft function with increasing of urine output on day 8 post-transplant. No other deviations from the usual course were seen during hospital stay. The patient was discharge from hospital with serum creatinine level 122 mkmol/L. The cold ischemia time was 21 hours in another patient. Graft function was immediate with a decrease serum creatinine to 92.5 mkmol/L at discharge. Both patients had no febrile and no other symptoms of acute respiratory disease during all hospital stay. No abnormalities on chest X-ray were seen. No serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were detected before and during 6 weeks after surgery. Repeated nasopharyngeal swabs rRT-PCR were negative during all the period. Both recipients were discharged for 5 weeks after surgery to prevent out-of-hospital contamination of COVID 19, which would be difficult to differentiate from transmission infection. After 9 months both patients are doing well with no clinical or laboratory signs of COVID-19. CONCLUSION Today we have no evidence of the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 from a SARS-Cov-2 positive donor to a kidney recipient. We also have no reason to suspect kidney damage by COVID-19 in a deceased donor at normal serum creatinine level. Avoiding the use of anti-lymphocyte drugs for induction of immunosuppression may also reduce the risk of developing COVID19 after transplantation. A careful collection and analysis of such dates is necessary to develop modern practical recommendations for transplant centers.","output":"[Kidney transplantation from Covid-19 positive deceased donor: what are the consequences for recipients?]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with influenza release aerosol particles containing the virus into their environment. However, the importance of airborne transmission in the spread of influenza is unclear, in part because of a lack of information about the infectivity of the airborne virus. The purpose of this study was to determine the amount of viable influenza A virus that was expelled by patients in aerosol particles while coughing. Sixty-four symptomatic adult volunteer outpatients were asked to cough 6 times into a cough aerosol collection system. Seventeen of these participants tested positive for influenza A virus by viral plaque assay (VPA) with confirmation by viral replication assay (VRA). Viable influenza A virus was detected in the cough aerosol particles from 7 of these 17 test subjects (41%). Viable influenza A virus was found in the smallest particle size fraction (0.3 m to 8 m), with a mean of 142 plaque-forming units (SD 215) expelled during the 6 coughs in particles of this size. These results suggest that a significant proportion of patients with influenza A release small airborne particles containing viable virus into the environment. Although the amounts of influenza A detected in cough aerosol particles during our experiments were relatively low, larger quantities could be expelled by influenza patients during a pandemic when illnesses would be more severe.

An increased rate of employment loss and decreased salary, along with poor-management of government response and emergency assistance to the people who are in need have complicated the overall scenario. All of these factors have contributed to the situation of deurbanization. During the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands of low-income people have left this megacity, where they once came to pursue their dreams, and returned to their home villages.

METHODS A retrospective chart analysis of patients who presented to the OED during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted. The proportions of traumatic, non-traumatic-urgent, and non-traumatic-non-urgent presentations in 2020 were compared to those of the same time period in 2019. Duration of chief complains and best-corrected visual acuity were also assessed. RESULTS There were 144 OED visits in 2020 compared to 327 OED visits during the same 3-week-period in 2019. Lower mean age of OED patients was present in 2020. Logarithmic expression (LogMAR) best corrected visual acuity (BVCA) was similar in both years.

Women exposed to VAW were more likely to be without social insurance, injured in the trunk part of their body, and having a life-threatening injury in the pandemic period. In both periods, women were attacked by an intimate partner, dominantly (42.6% and 54.1%, respectively). In addition, among all admissions of adults to the ED, women's percentage decreased while men's admission ratios increased during the pandemic period. Admissions to ED declined 47.7% during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the year before. CONCLUSION Cases of VAW tend to increase during the pandemic, and health care settings should be well-organized to respond to survivors.","output":"Violence Against Women During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Comparative Study from a Turkish Emergency Department."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND One of the most misdiagnosed appendicular pathologies is lymphoid hyperplasia (LH) that can be managed con-servatively when identified early and is self-limiting. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare acute appendicitis (AA) with LH in terms of hematological parameters to determine whether there is a hematological predictor to distinguish the two diseases. METHODS Complete blood cell counts of patients with AA were compared with those having LH. RESULTS One-hundred-ninety-five patients (118 male/77 female) underwent appendectomy. Histopathological examination re-vealed acute AA in 161 patients (82.6%), and negative appendectomy (NA) in 19 patients (9.7%). Of the NA specimens, 16 were LH (8.2%). Thirteen patients (6.7%) had AA with simultaneous LH. White blood cell count (p=0.030, neutrophil (p=0.009), neutrophil per-centage (p=0.009), and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (p=0.007) were significantly higher in AA whereas lymphocyte count (p=0.027), lymphocyte percentage (p=0.006) were significantly higher in LH. Multi logistic regression analysis revealed white blood cell count as the only independent predictor in distinguishing AA from LH with a 69.1% sensitivity, 80.0% specificity, 77.5% positive predictive value, and 72.1% negative predictive value. The cut-off value for white blood cell count was 11.3 Ku/L, and every one unit (1000/mm3) increase in white blood cell count raises the risk of AA by 1.24 times, while values below this value will increase the likelihood of LH. CONCLUSION The most predictive complete blood count parameter in distinguishing LH from AA appears to be as white blood cell count.","output":"The role of hematological parameters in distinguishing acute appendicitis from lymphoid hyperplasia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the molecular mechanism of COVID-19 pathogenesis helps in the rapid therapeutic target identification. Usually, viral protein targets host proteins in an organized fashion. The expression of any viral gene depends mostly on the host translational machinery. Recent studies report the great significance of codon usage biases in establishing host-viral protein-protein interactions (PPI). Exploring the codon usage patterns between a pair of co-evolved host and viral proteins may present novel insight into the host-viral protein interactomes during disease pathogenesis. Leveraging the similarity in codon usage patterns, we propose a computational scheme to recreate the host-viral protein-protein interaction network. We use host proteins from seventeen (17) essential signaling pathways for our current work towards understanding the possible targeting mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We infer both negatively and positively interacting edges in the network. Further, extensive analysis is performed to understand the host PPI network topologically and the attacking behavior of the viral proteins. Our study reveals that viral proteins mostly utilize codons, rare in the targeted host proteins (negatively correlated interaction). Among them, non-structural proteins, NSP3 and structural protein, Spike (S), are the most influential proteins in interacting with multiple host proteins. While ranking the most affected pathways, MAPK pathways observe to be the worst affected during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several proteins participating in multiple pathways are highly central in host PPI and mostly targeted by multiple viral proteins. We observe many potential targets (host proteins) from the affected pathways associated with the various drug molecules, including Arsenic trioxide, Dexamethasone, Hydroxychloroquine, Ritonavir, and Interferon beta, which are either under clinical trial or in use during COVID-19.","output":"A scheme for inferring viral-host associations based on codon usage patterns identifies the most affected signaling pathways during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The innovation of rapid influenza polymerase chain reaction (XT-PCR) has allowed quick, highly sensitive test results.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Internet-based survey covered 353 individuals who had participated in a psychological support project operated by one of the non-governmental organizations in Lublin, Poland, in the 12 months prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. The questionnaire used in the study contained questions to collect sociodemographic data and psychometric scales to measure resource gains and losses (the Conservation of Resources - Evaluation questionnaire), the quality of life (the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF), and strategies of coping with the pandemic situation (a modified Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced questionnaire). RESULTS: A higher global quality of life occurred with higher gains and minor losses, as well as with coping through planning, positive reframing, emotional support seeking, a reduced substance use tendency, low self-blame, avoidance, and disengagement. Moreover, helplessness-based coping strategies were found to mediate both the relationships between resource gains and the quality of life, and between resource losses and the quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Factors that may reduce people's quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic are an increase in losses and limited gains, experienced over the 6 months preceding the pandemic, as well as not using active, meaning-oriented, and support-seeking coping strategies, but using avoidance behaviors instead. Coping strategies specific to people experiencing helplessness are a mediating mechanism between losses and limited gains of resources, and the quality of life.","output":"The quality of life, resources, and coping during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in people seeking psychological counselling before the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 global pandemic has severely impacted Western Europe, resulting in a high caseload and deaths that varied by country in Spring 2020. The varying severity of the pandemic is explained by differences in prevention efforts in the form of public health policy, adherence to those guidelines, as well as socio-cultural, climate, and population characteristics. The second wave of the COVID-19 is currently breaching the borders of Europe. Public health surveillance is necessary to inform policy and guide leaders, however, existing surveillance explains past transmissions obscuring shifts in the pandemic, increases in infection rates, and the persistence in the transmission of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to provide advanced surveillance metrics for COVID-19 transmission that account for shifts in the pandemic, week over week, speed, acceleration, jerk and persistence, to better understand country risk for explosive growth and those who are managing the pandemic successfully. Existing surveillance coupled with our dynamic metrics of transmission will inform health policy to control the COVID-19 pandemic until an effective vaccine is developed and provides novel metrics to measure the transmission of disease. METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 62 days of COVID data from public health registries. We use an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in Europe as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments (GMM) approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: New European cases slightly decreased from 158,741 to 152,064 from the week of 01/04-01/10 (week 1) to the week of 01/11-01/17 (week 2), and cumulative cases only increased from 22,507,271 to 23,890,761 with a weekly increase of 1,383,490 between January 10 to January 17. France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and UK have the largest 7-day moving averages for new infections at 18,269, 20,787, 17,292, 17,442 and 59,809 respectively during the week of 01/4-01/10, but do not necessarily have positive speed, acceleration, jerk and persistance during the same time period. During week two, Jan 11-17, 7-day moving averages increased to 18,318 and 28,829 for France and Spain respectively. The infection rate per 100,000 people during the week of Jan 4-10 was highest in Ireland and the UK at 139.5 and 81.06, respectively. The Czech Republic, Portugal and Lituania have the next highest rates at 78.90, 73.59, and 54.81 all per 100,000 population. The top five countries by infection rate in week two were Portugal at 101.85, Ireland at 59.66, Andorra at 58.24, France at 57.31 and UK at 56.94. From the week of 01/04-1/10 to the week of 01/11-01/17, Europe's speed decreased (37.72 to 33.02 per 100,000), acceleration decreased (0.39 to -0.16 per 100,000), and jerk increased (-1.30 to 1.37 per 100,000). Speed was largest and decreasing in Ireland (132.29 to 72.66), Czech Republic (120.97 to 77.36), and Slovenia (97.54 to 67.64) during both weeks. Acceleration was highest in Portugal and Ireland in the week of 01/04-01/10 at 5.77 and 5.57 in addition to Slovakia at 4.59. CONCLUSIONS: These dynamic data suggest that the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has breached European borders, but that virus transmission is decreasing in some countries. However, the UK, Spain, and Portugal, in particular, are at risk for a rapid expansion in the transmission of COVID-19. An examination of the European region suggests that there was a decrease in caseload of COVID-19 between January 4 and January 17. Unfortunately, the rates of jerk, which were negative for Europe at the beginning of the month, reversed course and became positive, despite descreases in speed and acceleration. Finally, the 7-day persistence rate during the second week was larger than the first week. These measures indicate that the second wave of the pandemic may be subsiding, but some countries remain at risk for new outbreaks and increased transmission in the absence of rapid policy responses.","output":"European SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance: Longitudinal Trend Analyses of Wave Two"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study is an attempt to find a suitable therapy using antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) by identifying peptide-protein interaction of AMPs and nucleocapsid protein of SARS and SARS-CoV- 2.

The aim of our systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate helium-oxygen (heliox) in bronchiolitis. METHODS We screened 463 studies, assessed 22 of them, and included six randomized controlled trials. Primary outcomes were the need for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or intubation, hospitalization duration, and change in the modified Woods Clinical Asthma Scale (M-WCAS). We calculated mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous outcomes, and risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes. RESULTS Six studies (five double- and one single-blinded) with 560 infants were included. Risk of bias was high in one, moderate in four, and low in one. The RR for the need for CPAP (three studies) was 0.87 (CI: 0.56-1.35), and for intubation (four studies) was 1.39 (CI: 0.53-3.63), heliox compared to air-oxygen. The hospital stay (four studies) was 0.25 days longer (CI: -0.22-0.71) in the heliox group. The mean decrease in M-WCAS from the baseline (three studies) was 1.90 points (CI: 1.46-2.34) greater in the heliox group. CONCLUSION We found low-quality evidence that heliox does not reduce the need for CPAP, intubation, or length of hospitalization for bronchiolitis. Based on the M-WCAS scores, heliox seems to relieve respiratory distress symptoms rapidly after its initiation. The included studies had high heterogeneity in their methods and included relatively mild cases of bronchiolitis. A larger RCT with more severe cases of bronchiolitis with enough power to analyze the need for intubation is needed in the future. This article is protected by copyright.

As such, regulatory efforts to improve nursing home care have largely focused on the identification of deficiencies and assignment of sanctions. The current regulatory strategy often places nursing home teams and government agencies at odds, hindering their ability to build a culture of safety in nursing homes that is foundational to health care quality. Imbuing safety culture into nursing homes will require nursing homes and regulatory agencies to acknowledge the high-risk nature of post-acute and long-term care settings, embrace just culture, and engage nursing home staff and stakeholders in actions that are supported by evidence-based best practices. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic prompted some of these actions, leading to changes in nursing survey and certification processes as well as deployment of strike teams to support nursing homes in crisis. These actions, coupled with investments in public health that include funds earmarked for nursing homes, could become the initial phases of an intentional renovation of the existing regulatory oversight from one that is largely punitive to one that is rooted in safety culture and proactively designed to achieve meaningful and sustained improvements in the quality of care and life for nursing home residents.","output":"Integrating Principles of Safety Culture and Just Culture Into Nursing Homes: Lessons From the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obesity, a risk to health, is a global problem in modern society.

However, systematic evaluation of the relationship between gut microbiota, gut metabolite and host metabolite profiles in obese adults is still lacking. In this study, we used comparative metagenomics and metabolomics analysis to determine the gut microbiota and gut-host metabolite profiles in six normal and obese adults of Chinese origin, respectively. Following the functional and pathway analysis, we aimed to understand the possible impact of gut microbiota on the host metabolites via the change in gut metabolites. The result showed that the change in gut microbiota may result in the modulation of gut metabolites contributing to glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle and homolactic fermentation. Furthermore, integrated metabolomic analysis demonstrated a possible positive correlation of dysregulated metabolites in the gut and host, including l-phenylalanine, l-tyrosine, uric acid, kynurenic acid, cholesterol sulfate and glucosamine, which were reported to contribute to metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes.

Methods: We identified prevalent mutations using the spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 deposited in the Nextstrain global database and comparing them to the Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 genomic sequence as a reference. Then we calculated the percentages of mutant genomes from the total regional subsample isolates from December 2019 to the end of January 2021. We developed two separate time series forecasting models for the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant. The computational model used the structure of the S-RBD to examine its interactions with the neutralizing antibody, named CV30 (isolated from a patient), and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2), based on a hybrid algorithm of template-based modeling to predict the affinity of S protein to the neutralizing antibodies and hACE-2 receptor. Results: The proportion of the B.1.1.7 strain in North America is growing fast. From these computations, it seems that the S-RBD and hACE-2 proteins are less favorable for the South African strain (K417N, E484K, and N501Y) as compared to the wild type structure and more favorable for B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants. In the present of crystallized CV30 neutralizing antibodies, docking scores suggest antibodies can be partially neutralize the B.1.1.7 variant, and, less efficiently, the B.1.351 and P.1 variants.

METHODS: RNA extracts of positive samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, alone or in pools of different sizes (2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-sample pools) with negative samples. Transport media of additional 3 positive samples were also tested when mixed with transport media of negative samples in pools of 8.

In the present study, we investigated the role of HDAC6 in the regulation of NO production and nitrative stress in a mouse model of endotoxin-induced septic shock. HDAC6 deficient mice and a specific HDAC6 inhibitor were utilized in our studies. Our data clearly indicate that HDAC6 is an important mediator of NO production in macrophages. HDAC6 mediates NO production through the regulation of iNOS expression in macrophages. HDAC6 up-regulates iNOS expression in macrophages by modulating STAT1 activation and IRF-1 expression. HDAC6 inhibition potently blocked endotoxin-induced STAT1 activation and iNOS expression in macrophages. Furthermore, HDAC6 contributes to excessive NO production and nitrotyrosine level in the blood and promotes iNOS expression in the lung tissues during septic shock. Our data reveal a novel HDAC6/STAT1/iNOS pathway that mediates excessive NO production and nitrative stress in septic shock.","output":"HDAC6 Mediates Macrophage iNOS Expression and Excessive Nitric Oxide Production in the Blood During Endotoxemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent months, Covid\\\\19 has devastated African American communities across the nation, and a Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd.

In particular, this essay examines palliative and end\\\\of\\\\life care for African Americans, highlighting the ways in which American medicine, like American society, has breached trust. In the experience of many African American patients struggling against terminal illness, health care providers have denied them a say in their own medical decision\\\\making. In the midst of the Covid\\\\19 pandemic, African Americans have once again been denied a say with regard to the rationing of scarce medical resources such as ventilators, in that dominant and ostensibly race\\\\neutral algorithms sacrifice black lives.

Genetic variation in a cholesterol transport protein, apolipoprotein E (apoE), is the most common genetic risk factor for sporadic AD. In vitro evidence suggests that apoE links to A production through nanoscale lipid compartments (lipid clusters), but its regulation in vivo is unclear. Here, we use superresolution imaging in the mouse brain to show that apoE utilizes astrocyte-derived cholesterol to specifically traffic neuronal amyloid precursor protein (APP) in and out of lipid clusters, where it interacts with - and -secretases to generate A-peptide. We find that the targeted deletion of astrocyte cholesterol synthesis robustly reduces amyloid and tau burden in a mouse model of AD. Treatment with cholesterol-free apoE or knockdown of cholesterol synthesis in astrocytes decreases cholesterol levels in cultured neurons and causes APP to traffic out of lipid clusters, where it interacts with -secretase and gives rise to soluble APP- (sAPP-), a neuronal protective product of APP. Changes in cellular cholesterol have no effect on -, -, and -secretase trafficking, suggesting that the ratio of A to sAPP- is regulated by the trafficking of the substrate, not the enzymes. We conclude that cholesterol is kept low in neurons, which inhibits A accumulation and enables the astrocyte regulation of A accumulation by cholesterol signaling.","output":"Regulation of beta-amyloid production in neurons by astrocyte-derived cholesterol."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because cases of highly pathogenic influenza are rare, no systematic clinical studies have evaluated different therapeutic approaches.

Studies of highly pathogenic influenza in different animal models, especially nonhuman primates and ferrets, reproduce many of the key observations from clinical cases. Host-response kinetics reveal a delayed but broad activation of genes involved in the innate and acquired immune responses (innate responses produce inflammatory responses), which continue after the virus has been cleared and may contribute importantly to the clinical signs observed. Experimental animal models point to an important role for immune dysregulation in the pathogenesis of highly pathogenic influenza. The use of these models to develop and validate therapeutic approaches is just beginning, but published studies reveal the importance of early treatment with antivirals and show the potential and limitations of approaches aimed at the host response.","output":"Influenza pathogenesis: lessons learned from animal studies with H5N1, H1N1 Spanish, and pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The WHO states that hospital-acquired infections may be transmitted through contaminated hands. Practicing hand hygiene using alcohol-based handrub or soap and water reduces harmful organisms. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) best practice recommends empowering patients with hand hygiene knowledge and engaging their involvement to strengthen hand hygiene practices. AIMS The aim of this project was to improve hand hygiene among surgical inpatients. METHODS This evidence-based quality improvement project was conducted in three phases: the baseline audit, implementing best practice, and the postimplementation audit. Participants were patients hospitalized in three surgical wards of a 1200-bed acute care tertiary hospital. This project utilized the online JBI Practical Application of Clinical Evidence System and The Getting Research into Practice program to identify barriers and strategies. Nurses provided patients with an education pamphlet and regularly reminded them to improve their hand hygiene practices. RESULTS Ninety-four patients were audited between April and June 2018. Patients' hand hygiene practices improved from 19.1% at baseline audit to 61.7% (P < 0.01) at first follow-up audit. Patients' hand hygiene improved from 48.9 to 72.3% (P = 0.03) before meals, and from 92.6 to 98.9% (P = 0.65) after toileting. The proportion of patients who received a hand hygiene information leaflet in an appropriate language increased from 64.9 to 89.4% (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION Patients' involvement in the hand hygiene program has significantly improved their hand hygiene practices.

Approximately 30% of patients postponed regular consultations, and one-quarter of patients who received consultation more than once a month used telephone consultations. Two of 84 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy had reduced their steroid doses. A shortage of ventilator accessories and infection protection equipment occurred following the onset of COVID-19, and this shortage had a serious impact on medical care and infection prevention measures. Reductions in rehabilitation and other services, and avoidance of outings, led to a decrease in exercise and an increase in caregiver burden. Inpatients were restricted from going out and visiting family members. More than 20% of patients reported physical or mental complaints; however, few required treatment.

METHODS: Participants were 122 adolescents (ages 15-17; 61% male; 48% with ADHD). Parents reported on adolescents' sleep duration and difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep (DIMS); adolescents reported on sleep patterns, sleep duration, delayed sleep/wake behaviors, and daytime sleepiness before (September 2019-February 2020) and during (May-June 2020) COVID-19. Adolescents also reported on their health behaviors, COVID-19-related negative affect, and difficulties concentrating due to COVID-19. RESULTS: Parents reported adolescents had more DIMS during COVID-19 than before COVID-19, with clinically-elevated rates increasing from 24% to 36%. Both bedtimes and waketimes shifted later during COVID-19, and adolescents reported more delayed sleep/wake behaviors. Adolescents also reported less daytime sleepiness and longer school night sleep duration during COVID-19. In considering differences between adolescents with and without ADHD, adolescents with ADHD did not experience an increase in school night sleep duration and were less likely to obtain recommended sleep duration during COVID-19. In the full sample, controlling for ADHD status, COVID-19-related sadness/loneliness was associated with increases in DIMS, and spending less time outside and more COVID-19-related worries/fears were associated with increases in delayed sleep/wake behaviors during COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had negative and positive impacts on adolescent sleep. Adolescents with ADHD did not experience the benefit of increased school night sleep duration during COVID-19 like adolescents without ADHD. Negative affect and health behaviors may be useful intervention targets for reducing negative impacts of COVID-19 for adolescent sleep.","output":"Prospective Examination of Adolescent Sleep Patterns and Behaviors Before and During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this report, the antiviral activity of 80R immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), a human monoclonal antibody against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike (S) protein that acts as a viral entry inhibitor in vitro, was investigated in vivo in a mouse model. When 80R IgG1 was given prophylactically to mice at doses therapeutically achievable in humans, viral replication was reduced by more than 4 orders of magnitude to below assay limits. The essential core region of S protein required for 80R binding was identified as a conformationally sensitive fragment (residues 324 to 503) that overlaps the receptor ACE2-binding domain. Amino acids critical for 80R binding were identified. In addition, the effects of various 80R-binding domain amino acid substitutions which occur in SARS-like-CoV from civet cats, and which evolved during the 2002/2003 outbreak and in a 2003/2004 Guangdong index patient, were analyzed. The results demonstrated that the vast majority of SARS-CoVs are sensitive to 80R. We propose that by establishing the susceptibility and resistance profiles of newly emerging SARS-CoVs through early S1 genotyping of the core 180-amino-acid neutralizing epitope of 80R, an effective immunoprophylaxis strategy with 80R should be possible in an outbreak setting. Our study also cautions that for any prophylaxis strategy based on neutralizing antibody responses, whether by passive or active immunization, a genotyping monitor will be necessary for effective use.","output":"Evaluation of human monoclonal antibody 80R for immunoprophylaxis of severe acute respiratory syndrome by an animal study, epitope mapping, and analysis of spike variants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rural, ethnically diverse older adults experience disparities in dementia detection/management.

The COVID-19 pandemic has initiated the requirement for automated speech therapy tools for persons with SSD making speech therapy accessible and affordable. However, there are no guidelines for designing such automated tools and their required degree of automation compared to human experts. In this systematic review, we followed the PRISMA framework to address four research questions: 1) what types of SSD do AI-based automated speech therapy tools address, 2) what is the level of autonomy achieved by such tools, 3) what are the different modes of intervention, and 4) how effective are such tools in comparison with human experts. An extensive search was conducted on digital libraries to find research papers relevant to our study from 2007 to 2022. The results show that AI-based automated speech therapy tools for persons with SSD are increasingly gaining attention among researchers. Articulation disorders were the most frequently addressed SSD based on the reviewed papers. Further, our analysis shows that most researchers proposed fully automated tools without considering the role of other stakeholders.

Our MD simulations consisted of M protein dimers and E protein pentamers in patches of membrane. By examining where these proteins induced membrane curvature in silico, we obtained insights around how the budding process may occur. The M protein dimers acted cooperatively to induce membrane curvature while E protein pentamers kept the membrane planar.

From the analysis, we found that a decentralized approach, prompt decision-making and timely execution, coordination between local health authorities, and public participation in the implementation of strategies could substantially reduce the case fatality rate. Nations with a high percentage of gross domestic product invested in the health sector, as well as more nurses, physicians, hospital beds, intensive care unit beds, and ventilators, better managed the pandemic. Instead, nations that postponed their pandemic response by delaying tracking, tracing, testing, quarantine, and lockdown were badly affected.

The SLE patients were mainly females (86.6%), of median age 36.7 (29.8-49.4) years and disease duration of 6.1 (1.6-11.8) years. Within the DN subset, ABC-like (IgD-CD27-CD11c+CD21-) B cell frequency reduced from baseline median level of 20.4% to 11.3% (p=0.03), at early follow-up. The DN B cells were further subdivided based on CXCR5 expression. Significant shifts were observed at the early follow-up in the DN2 sub-cluster (CD11c+CXCR5-), which reduced significantly (-15.4 percentage points, p=0.02) and in the recently described DN3 (CD11c-CXCR5-) which increased (+13 percentage points, p=0.03). SLE patients treated with RTX are at high risk of developing ADA. In our cohort, the presence of ADA at 6 months was associated with lower frequencies of DN cells and to a more pronounced expansion of plasmablasts at early follow-up. The frequency of follicular helper T cells (T(FH), CD4+PD-1+CXCR5+) and of peripheral helper T cells (T(PH), CD4+PD-1+CXCR5-) did not change after RTX. A sub-cluster of PD-1(high)CD4+ T cells showed a significant decrease at later follow-up compared to early follow-up (p=0.0039). It is well appreciated that RTX transiently influences B cells. Here, we extend these observations to cell phenotypes which are believed to directly contribute to autoimmunity in SLE. We show early transient effects of RTX on ABC-like memory B cells, later effects on PD-1(high) CD4+ cells, and possible implications for RTX immunogenicity. Further insight in such effects and their monitoring may be of clinical relevance.","output":"Rituximab in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Transient Effects on Autoimmunity Associated Lymphocyte Phenotypes and Implications for Immunogenicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Turkey adenovirus 3 (TAdV-3) causes high mortality and significant economic losses to the turkey industry. However, little is known about the molecular determinants required for viral replication and pathogenesis. Moreover, TAdV-3 does not grow well in cell culture, thus detailed structural studies of the infectious particle is particularly challenging. To develop a better understanding of virus-host interactions, we performed a comprehensive proteomic analysis of proteinase K treated purified TAdV-3 virions isolated from spleens of infected turkeys, by utilizing one-dimensional liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Our analysis resulted in the identification of 13 viral proteins associated with TAdV-3 virions including a novel uncharacterized TaV3gp04 protein. Further, we detected 18 host proteins in purified virions, many of which are involved in cell-to cell spread, cytoskeleton dynamics and virus replication. Notably, seven of these host proteins have not yet been reported to be present in any other purified virus. In addition, five of these proteins are known antiviral host restriction factors. The availability of reagents allowed us to identify two cellular proteins (collagen alpha-1 (VI) chain and haemoglobin) in the purified TAdV-3 preparations. These results represent the first comprehensive proteomic profile of TAdV-3 and may provide information for illustrating TAdV-3 replication and pathogenesis.

Weed seed survival after the 7 week burial period varied widely among burial environments (from 8% to 88% when averaged among weed and crop species), whereas growth of the different crop species had negligible impact on seedbank persistence. Among environments, wild oat seed survived the greatest (79%), followed by kochia (20%), and volunteer canola (6%). Weed seed survival was associated with soil physical properties (texture) and seed microsite characteristics (temperature), but not crop species or soil chemical properties.

However, the activity of kaolin + B. bassiana (CG 138) against C. includens was higher than each ingredient alone, indicating an additive action against C. includes larvae. The mortality of A. argillacea and C. includens larvae treated with kaolin + B. bassiana (CG 138) was similar, and the A. argillacea mortality was higher than that of C. includens with kaolin and B. bassiana (GC 138) separated.

Methods: A total of 42 elderly patients with advanced bladder cancer who were admitted to our hospital from January 2019 to January 2020 were included and assigned to the GT group (21 cases) receiving GT chemotherapy and combination group (21 cases) given 3D-CRT combined with GT chemotherapy. The clinical efficacy, immune function, inflammatory factors, tumor markers, urinary angiogenesis molecules before and after treatment, 1-year survival rate, 2-year survival rate, and incidence of adverse reactions of the two groups were compared. SPSS 22.0 statistical software was used for data processing and analysis. Results: The combination group had 5 cases of CR, 12 cases of PR, 3 cases of SD, and 1 case of PD, with an ORR of 80.95% (17/21), which was remarkably higher than the ORR of 57.14% (12/21) in the GT group which had 3 cases of CR, 9 cases of PR, 5 cases of SD, and 4 cases of PD (P < 0.05). The 1-year survival rate of the combination group was 76.19% (16/21), and the 2-year survival rate was 47.62% (10/21), which were higher than the 1-year survival rate of 47.62% (10/21) and 2-year survival rate of 19.05% (4/21) in the GT group (P < 0.05). The two groups presented similar results in terms of adverse reactions rate (P > 0.05). After treatment, the combination group obtained significantly lower levels of urinary bladder cancer antigen (UBC), nuclear matrix protein-22 (NMP-22), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) than the GT group (P < 0.05). The CD3+, CD4+, and CD4+/CD8+ levels of the two groups of patients were lower than those before treatment (P < 0.05), but no statistical difference was observed between the two groups after treatment (P > 0.05). The levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon-?3 (IFN-?3) of the two groups witnessed a decline after treatment, with lower results in the combination group as compared to the control group (P < 0.05).

Surgical excision and wound reconstruction are indicated for severe or refractory disease. This study aims to explore institutional reconstructive outcomes following hidradenitis suppurativa excision and compare these to the nationally recognized Tracking Operations and Outcomes for Plastic Surgeons (TOPS) database to determine best-practice guidelines. METHODS A retrospective chart review of all patients with surgically treated hidradenitis suppurativa from January of 2004 to January of 2016 was performed. Data on patient characteristics, reconstructive methods, and outcomes were collected. Outcomes for each reconstructive method were analyzed and associations between reconstruction and complications were determined. These results were compared to TOPS data. RESULTS A total of 382 operative sites for 101 individual patients were reviewed. Overall complication rates were 80, 68.3, and 59.6 percent for simple, intermediate, and complex closure, respectively; 68.3 percent for adjacent soft-tissue rearrangement; and 100 percent for split-thickness skin grafts and perforator flaps. Statistical significance was identified between superficial wound dehiscence and adjacent tissue rearrangement compared to intermediate and complex closure (p = 0.0132). TOPS data revealed similar wound breakdown rates for primary closure methods but much lower rates with negative-pressure wound therapy, split-thickness skin grafts, and muscle flaps. CONCLUSIONS Primary closure techniques for hidradenitis suppurativa wound reconstruction possess high complication rates, whereas improved outcomes are observed with negative-pressure wound therapy, split-thickness skin grafts, and muscle flaps. The correlation in outcomes between our experience and that reported in the TOPS database provides a level of validation to this national database.","output":"Hidradenitis Suppurativa: A Comparison of Institutional Experience and the Tracking Operations and Outcomes for Plastic Surgeons Registry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: People experiencing homelessness (PEH) may be at risk for COVID19. We synthesised evidence on SARS-Cov-2 infection, transmission, outcomes of disease, effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), and the effectiveness of strategies for infection prevention and control (IPC). METHODS: Systematic review of articles, indexed in electronic databases (EMBASE, WHOCovid19, Web of Science), institutional websites and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health's live map of COVID-19 evidence, and published from December 1st, 2019, to March 3rd, 2021. Empirical papers of any study design addressing Covid-19 and health(-related) outcomes in PEH or shelters staff were included. (PROSPERO-2020-CRD42020187033) FINDINGS: Of 536 publications, 37 studies were included (two modelling, 31 observational, four qualitative studies). Random-effect meta-analysis yields a baseline SARS-Cov-2 prevalence of 2?32% (95% Confidence-Interval, 95%CI=1?30C3?34) in PEH and 1?55% (95%CI=0?79C2?31) in staff.

Main IPC strategies were universal rapid testing, expansion of non-congregate housing, and in-shelter measures (bed spacing, limited staff rotation, reduction in number of residents). INTERPRETATION: 32% of PEH and 15% staff are infected during outbreaks of SARS-Cov-2 in homeless shelters. Most studies were conducted in the USA. No studies were found quantifying health-related outcomes of NPI.

Although inactivated and/or attenuated vaccines have been developed and widely used around the world, there are still concerns with regard to their safety, efficacy, and costs. OBJECTIVE: As demand has grown for a new rabies vaccine, we have developed a new vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSVs) based rabies vaccine that replaces glycoproteins with rabies virus (RABV) glycoprotein (GP), or so-called VSV/RABV-GP. METHODS: VSV/RABV-GP production was measured by sandwich ELISA. The generation of VSV/RABV-GP was evaluated with GP-specific antibodies and reduced transduction with GP-specific neutralizing antibodies. Virus entry was quantified by measuring the luciferase levels at 18-h post-transduction. BALB/c mice (three groups of six mice each) were intraperitoneally immunized with PBS, RABA, or VSV/RABV-GP at 0 and 14 days. At 28 days post-immunization serology was performed. Statistical significance was calculated using the HolmCSidak multiple Students t test. RESULTS: Mice immunized with VSV/RABV-GP produced IgM and IgG antibodies, whereas IgM titers were significantly higher in mice immunized with VSV/RABV-GP compared to inactivated RABV. The secretion profiles of IgG1 and IgG2a production suggested that VSV/RAVB-GP induces the T helper cell type-2 immune bias. In addition, the average (SD; n = 3) serum neutralization titers of the inactivated RABV and VSV/RABV-GP groups were 241  40 and 103  54 IU/mL, respectively CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that VSV/RABV-GP could be a new potential vaccination platform for RABV.","output":"Immunogenicity of replication-deficient vesicular stomatitis virus based rabies vaccine in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Rapid but yet sensitive, specific, and high-throughput detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in clinical samples is key to diagnose infected people and to better control the spread of the virus.

In this paper, we investigate whether presenting the COVID-19 pandemic as a war affects people's reasoning about the pandemic. Data collected suggest that the metaphorical framing effect does not occur by default.

The study aims to assess the oral health status, treatment needs, and association with demographic variables, oral health behaviors, and parents' perception among preschoolers in these Anganwadis. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 1200, 3-5-year-old preschoolers from 48 Anganwadis in Belagavi. They were examined in accordance with the WHO Oral Health Pro forma (2013). A self-administered questionnaire assessed their parents' perception of their oral health. SPSS software (version 20) was used for statistical analysis. Chi-square test computed categorical data. One-Way ANOVA test was used for multiple group comparisons. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The prevalence of dental caries was found to be 76.1% and gingival bleeding was found in 30.4% participants. The most common oral mucosal lesions were ulcers (5.1%) followed by abscess in 4.5% of children. About 67% of the parents perceived their child's oral health as good. A staggering 98.5% of parents had not taken their children to the dentist ever. About 76.8% of the children required prompt treatment. Conclusion Poor oral health status necessitates prompt action with age-specific targeted interventions for the curtailment of the prevalent oral maladies along with preventive strategies for the rejuvenation and resurrection of the plummeted oral health status for restoring the quality of life, coupled with motivation meted out to utilize the abundant dental services available in Belagavi.

This opening up did not happen spontaneously in an institutional vacuum. Instead, the current degree of economic openness and the resulting prosperity are results of a combination of multilateral trade negotiations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and later the World Trade Organization (WTO), underwritten largely by the United States, as well as a variety of regional initiatives.The existing platforms for trade liberalization - WTO, regional trade blocs, and other preferential trade agreements (PTAs) - have their weaknesses. One is that the low-hanging fruit of slashing tariffs and removing quotas has been mostly picked. The remaining trade barriers revolve around politically thorny issues related to technical and regulatory questions, intellectual property, and distorted agricultural markets. In addition, the one-way nature of WTO membership has been subject to abuse by state-capitalist economies, particularly China, which has gained access to Western markets while jealously shielding its incumbent firms from foreign competition.However, giving up on the institutions underpinning the current trade regime would be extremely unwise, particularly at a time of historically unprecedented economic distress accompanying the COVID-19 pandemic. Without the constraints imposed by the WTO and PTAs, nothing would stop politicians from reverting back to trade policies that cater to special interests while distributing the costs over the wider public. As the example of the Great Depression shows, such danger would be imminent in bad economic times when the temptation to impose discriminatory trade barriers would be strong and doing so would amplify the size of adverse economic shocks. A zero- or negative-sum economic environment provides fuel for extremist ideologies, militarism, and war. Avoiding such a scenario is precisely the challenge facing the world today.Polish Abstract: Narastaj?ce tarcia pomi?dzy sfer? polityki i handlu nie powinny przes?ania? nam faktu, ?e powojenna liberalizacja ?wiatowego handlu okaza?a si? ogromnym sukcesem i pozostaje jednym z najwi?kszych, o ile nie najwi?kszym osi?gni?ciem okresu globalizacji.

AIMS: To examine COVID-19-related stress and its immediate psychological impact on healthcare staff. METHOD: All healthcare staff working in the fever clinic, from 20 January 2020 to 26 March 2020, of a tertiary general hospital were enrolled. Stress management procedures were in place to alleviate concerns about the respondents own health and the health of their families, to help them adjust their work and to provide psychological support via a hotline. Qualitative interviews were undertaken and the Sources of Distress and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) were administered. RESULTS: Among the 102 participants (25 males; median age 30 years, interquartile range (IQR) = 27C36), the median IES-R total score was 3 (IQR = 0C8), and 6 participants (6.0%) scored above the cut-off on the IES-R (20). Safety and security were acceptable or better for 92 (90.2%) participants. The top four sources of distress were worry about the health of one's family/others at 0.88 (IQR = 0.25C1.25), worry about the virus spread at 0.50 (IQR = 0.00C1.00), worry about changes in work at 0.50 (IQR = 0.00C1.00) and worry about one's own health at 0.25 (IQR = 0.25C0.75). There was a moderate correlation between the IES-R score and the Sources of Distress score (rho = 0.501, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The stress levels of healthcare staff in the fever clinic during the COVID-19 epidemic were not elevated. Physio-psychosocial interventions, including fulfilment of basic needs, activation of self-efficacy and psychological support, are helpful and worth recommending in fighting COVID-19.","output":"Stress and psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the healthcare staff at the fever clinic of a tertiary general hospital in Beijing: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Bakery is one of the primary sources of income from the entrepreneurs that serves various products and directly sells to the customers.

Urban and rural development interacts through the flows of people, materials, energy, goods, capital, and information. Without building sound urbanCrural linkages, achieving development in one area could compromise it in another area. Achieving sustainable development needs customized policy prioritization and implementation in both urban and rural areas. Much literature exists in the research field of urbanCrural linkages, but little has been done via a comprehensive analysis from an interlinkage perspective in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Sustainable Development Goal 11 on sustainable cities and several targets embedded under other Goals provides a good framework for analyzing the urbanCrural linkages. This paper contributes to this novel research perspective using Ghana as a case. The study applied an integrated approach by combining the results from a solution-scanning exercise with an SDG interlinkage analysis to identify the challenges and priority solutions and assess the synergies and trade-offs of the identified solutions. It extends the conventional solution-scanning approach by further assessing the synergies and trade-offs of the solutions from an SDG interlinkage perspective. It also enables a more practical SDG interlinkage analysis through the contributions from the multi-stakeholder consultations conducted in Ghana. The analyses show that prioritizing gender inclusion (Goal 5) will positively affect many social and well-being outcomes, including poverty elimination (Goal 1), hunger reduction (Goal 2), health improvement (Goal 3) and access to quality education (Goal 4) and basic services, such as water (Goal 6). However, gender inclusion could have potential trade-offs in the agricultural sector (Goal 2) in the case that women who dominate agricultural value chains could move to work in other sectors. Lack of proper infrastructure (Goal 9), such as transport, will hinder wide gender inclusion. An integrated approach that considers both the synergies and trade-offs of relevant solutions is critical for effective policymaking, specifically in developing countries.","output":"UrbanCrural linkages: effective solutions for achieving sustainable development in Ghana from an SDG interlinkage perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted novelties in socio-cultural, political, urban and tourist issues, due to globalization, mass consumption and mobility In this context, the text presents reflections of bibliographic research in the databases with the terms Tourism, COVID-19 and Coronavirus The articles found are of international origin and introduce discussions that include the terms, reallocating them in investigations already under development The papers, when discussing the relationships associated with tourism during and after COVID-19, look for possible answers and gaps Reflections on sustainability, the economy, the prefigurations of tourism and the relationships that are likely to be established in the post-COVID-19 are underway","output":"Mobility of scientific production on tourism and Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is continuing, it may become worse in the coming winter months with a high potential for the emergence and spread of escape variants of SARS-CoV-2.

Methods: Using longitudinal data from the HIVE cohort from 2010-11 through 2017-18, we estimated direct, indirect, and total influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) and the incidence rate ratio of influenza virus infection using adjusted mixed-effect Poisson regression models. Total effectiveness was determined through comparison of vaccinated members of full or partially vaccinated households to unvaccinated individuals in completely unvaccinated households. Results: The pooled, direct VE against any influenza was 30.2% (14.0-43.4). Direct VE was higher for influenza A/H1N1 43.9% (3.9 to 63.5) and B 46.7% (17.2 to 57.5) than A/H3N2 31.7% (10.5 to 47.8); and was higher for young children 42.4% (10.1 to 63.0) than adults 18.6% (-6.3 to 37.7).

Yet the need to continue to train physicians to care for patients and communities is greater than ever. Medical educators are responding by adapting curricula in response to requirements for social distancing, changing availability of clinical learning opportunities, and limitations on testing center availability for examinations. These disruptions require a systems approach to ensure that learners achieve competence in preparation for advancement in training toward unsupervised practice. In this article, the authors assert that medical educators, obligated by current conditions to adapt educational experiences, should seize the opportunity presented by the pandemic to make needed changes in 3 areas aligned with competency-based medical education: focusing on outcomes, broadening the assessment toolbox, and improving the undergraduate medical education (UME)-to-graduate medical education (GME) transition. Defined outcomes, as exemplified by entrustable professional activities, will enable curricular designers to shorten and adapt learning experiences by focusing on students achievement of prespecified learning outcomes. Broadening the assessment toolbox entails capturing more and different assessment information about learners to provide a well-rounded view of their strengths and areas for growth in both traditional and novel settings, such as telehealth. Limitations on available data, such as licensing examination scores and clerkship grades, heighten the urgency to revise the system for the UME-to-GME transition by enhancing the quality and usability of information available to residency program directors. Educators should capitalize on the opportunity presented by altered conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic to make these needed changes to the educational system, to prepare physicians to provide health care and lead the health care system into the future.","output":"The COVID-19 Pandemic as an Imperative to Advance Medical Student Assessment: 3 Areas for Change"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, a timely study on the impacts of and policy response to the pandemic on rural poverty in China is critically important because China has aimed to completely eradicate extreme poverty by the end of 2020 This paper uses data from the latest round of a nationally representative household panel survey to examine the impacts of the pandemic on rural poverty in China Our data show that 11 9% of sample households were ever officially registered as poor households between 2013 and 2019, and this poverty incidence fell to 2 7% by the end of 2019 In the middle February of 2020, 23% of the households who have graduated from poverty since 2013 perceived that they would fall back into poverty due to the COVID-19 Among those never poor households, 7 1% perceived that they would possibly fall into poverty due to the pandemic Results from both descriptive and multivariate analyses consistently show the interruptions that the pandemic caused in off-farm employment is an important channel that led households to perceive of falling back into or falling into poverty We also find households in the bottom four quintiles when ranked in terms of household income per capita are much more likely to perceive themselves of falling back into or falling into poverty during this pandemic than those in the richest quintile Meanwhile, our results show that the education and age of household heads, as well as being from Hubei Province matter in explaining household perception about falling back into or falling into poverty in some cases but not all The paper concludes with a set of policy responses that China has taken to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on poverty alleviation","output":"Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on rural poverty and policy responses in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A pandemic is the worldwide outbreak and spread of a disease.

Mast cells (MCs) are activated by SARS-CoV-2. Although only recently recognized, MC activation syndrome (MCAS), usually due to acquired MC clonality, is a chronic multisystem disorder with inflammatory and allergic themes, and an estimated prevalence of 17%. This paper describes a novel conjecture explaining how MCAS might cause a propensity for severe acute Covid-19 infection and chronic post-Covid-19 illnesses. METHODS: Observations of Covid-19 illness in patients with/without MCAS were compared with extensive clinical experience with MCAS. RESULTS: The prevalence of MCAS is similar to that of severe cases within the Covid-19-infected population. Much of Covid-19's hyperinflammation is concordant with manners of inflammation which MC activation can drive. Drugs with activity against MCs or their mediators have preliminarily been observed to be helpful in Covid-19 patients. None of the authors' treated MCAS patients with Covid-19 suffered severe infection, let alone mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperinflammatory cytokine storms in many severely symptomatic Covid-19 patients may be rooted in an atypical response to SARS-CoV-2 by the dysfunctional MCs of MCAS rather than a normal response by normal MCs.

On-site measurements registered in some test cells (controlled environment with no users influence) were used to calibrate dynamic energy simulation models. The impact of several future periods, climate zones of southern Spain and orientations on thermal comfort was assessed. The results show that climate change triggers a more significant increase in outdoor temperatures in summer than in winter. Should ventilation be kept to minimum and blinds opened during daytime in winter, higher comfort would be achieved, with great differences between orientations and south reporting the best results. The higher the outdoor temperatures due to climate change, the higher the percentage of comfort hours (i.e. 23C68% in the present and 50C75% in 2080).

Using SARS-COV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 lentivirus based pseudoviruses, we show that neutralizing antibody responses were predominantly SARS-CoV-2 specific. These data define patterns of cross-reactive binding and neutralizing serum responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination in rhesus macaques. Our observations have important implications for understanding polyclonal responses to SARS-CoV-2 Spike, which will facilitate future CoV vaccine assessment and development.ImportanceThe rapid development and deployment of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has been unprecedented. In this study, we explore the cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses to other coronaviruses. By analyzing responses from NHPs both before and after immunization with DNA or Ad26 vectored vaccines, we find patterns of cross reactivity that mirror those induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data highlight the similarities between infection and vaccine induced humoral immunity for SARS-CoV-2 and cross-reactivity of these responses to other CoVs.","output":"Coronavirus-Specific Antibody Cross Reactivity in Rhesus Macaques Following SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination and Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has negatively impacted the well-being of many college students, particularly lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ +) students who are already at a disproportionate risk for negative mental health and well-being outcomes. To identify potential risk and protective factors we examined LGBTQ + college students' disclosure of sexual orientation, gender identity, or both (SOGI) to mothers and fathers, living arrangements (whether or not students lived with mothers and fathers), social support from family and friends, and parent-child relationship quality and their association with stress, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and problem drinking during the pandemic. LGBTQ + college students (N = 366; Mage = 20.4) completed an online survey. Students who reported more social support from family and friends and better quality relationships with mothers or fathers had better well-being and were less likely to perceive a substantial decrease in their well-being due to the pandemic. In contrast, SOGI disclosure and whether or not students lived with mothers or fathers were generally unrelated to well-being. Findings suggest that universities should consider offering mental health resources for students living on- and off-campus, and that clinical professionals should consider strategies to help these young adults identify and maintain support systems and highlight the value of positive parent-child relationships.

METHOD A search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Open Grey and Orthopaedic Proceedings. Studies with a level of evidence of I-III on patients ( 18 years) with DIATFs operated on with either EF or ORIF were included. A total of 3814 studies were identified. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomised controlled trials and the ROBINS-I tool for nonrandomised studies were used to assess risk of bias. RESULTS Nine studies with 478 patients, 271 ORIF and 197 EF met the inclusion criteria. The mean follow-up ranged from 12 to 38 months. The meta-analysis showed a higher incidence of superficial wound infections (RR = 2.94, 95% CI 1.62-5.34, p = 0.0004) and malunions (RR = 2.62, 95% CI 1.27-5.43, p = 0.009) in the EF group compared to the ORIF group. Also worse physical function was associated with the EF group. However, the overall evidence was low. CONCLUSION This systematic review is the first to report on physical function following DIATF surgery. In general, decreased physical function was reported. The meta-analysis showed lower incidence of superficial wound infection and malunion rates in the ORIF group. Heterogeneity was low. In conclusion, this review reports lower complication rates following ORIF for DIATF. The overall evidence was limited, and therefore, the authors cannot recommend ORIF to be superior to EF treatment for DIATF. More multi-centre studies with larger sample sizes are needed to assess long-term physical function and complications following DIATF surgery.

Firstly, viruses appear to be polyphyletic in origin, with several sets of viruses arising by different, independent routes at different times. Secondly, subsequent virus adaptation for survival in different host/vector combinations has involved the selective acquisition of additional genes by a process of cassette or modular evolution, with these additional gene modules coming from other viruses or host genetic material. Thus, depending on the gene product used for comparison, different phylogenetic relationships can be deduced. Further virus adaptation can arise by reassortment of segmented genomes, gene duplication, deletions, frameshift mutations, point mutations or de novo development of new gene products from existing, unused reading frames. The solution to the first objection is to place all viruses in a separate kingdom and assign the current viruses to several phyla that reflect these diverse origins. The solution to the second objection is to consider the core module of replication machinery as the major criterion on which to make the initial assignments to classes and orders. For RNA viruses, the major criterion is the sequence identity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Using this criterion, the positive strand RNA viruses can be assigned to five classes that correspond to the recently recognized supergroups of RNA viruses. These five classes contain four, three, three, three and one order(s) respectively. These fourteen orders contain 31 virus families (including 17 families of plant viruses) and 48 genera (including 30 genera of plant viruses). This approach confirms the separation of the alphaviruses and flaviviruses into two families, the Togaviridae and Flaviridae, but suggests that several other current taxonomic assignments, such as the pestiviruses, hepatitis C virus, rubiviruses, hepatitis E virus and arteriviruses, may be wrong. The coronaviruses and toroviruses appear to be distinct families in distinct orders, not distinct genera of the same family as currently classified. In addition, the luteoviruses are split into two families and apple chlorotic leaf spot virus appears not to be a closterovirus but a new genus of the Potexviridae. From an analysis of the polymerase dendrograms of the dsRNA viruses, it appears that they are not closely related to each other, but belong to four additional classes (Partitiviridae, Reoviridae, Birnaviridae and Cystoviridae) and one additional order (Totiviridae) of one of the classes of positive ssRNA viruses in the same subphylum as the positive strand RNA viruses. The negative strand virus polymerase relationships confirm the assignment of the negative strand viruses to two orders in a single class in a separate subphylum of the RNA viruses. This review includes preliminary data suggesting that the DNA viruses can also be assigned to higher taxa on the basis of the sequence identities of their highly conserved DNA polymerases. The suggested use of viral polymerases to establish higher order relationships is similar in principle to the use of highly conserved ribosomal RNA gene sequences in prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxonomy. This review also discusses the assignment of 33 of the 35 groups of plant viruses into genera of 25 families based on the nature of the genome and its arrangement, the level of sequence identity and, to a lesser extent, particle morphology.","output":"Progress towards a higher taxonomy of viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to analyze the suitability of pluripotent stem cells derived from the amnion (hAECs) as a potential cell source for revitalization in vitro. hAECs were isolated from human placentas, and dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) and dentin matrix proteins (eDMPs) were obtained from human teeth.

We developed a triage strategy including noninvasive respiratory support and admission to the intermediate care unit (IMCU). ICU admission was restricted to patients requiring invasive ventilation. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted to the IMCU. METHOD: Retrospective cohort including consecutive patients admitted between March 28 and April 27, 2020. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure avoiding ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included the rate of emergency intubation, 28-day mortality, and predictors of ICU admission. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-seven patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia were admitted to the IMCU. Among the 85 patients admitted for worsening respiratory failure, 52/85 (61%) avoided ICU admission. In multivariate analysis, PaO2/FiO2 (OR 0.98; 95% CI: 0.96-0.99) and BMI (OR 0.88; 95% CI: 0.78-0.98) were significantly associated with ICU admission. No death or emergency intubation occurred in the IMCU. CONCLUSIONS: IMCU admission including standardized triage criteria, self-proning, and noninvasive respiratory support prevents ICU admission for a large proportion of patients with COVID-19 hypoxemic respiratory failure. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, IMCUs may play an important role in preserving ICU capacity by avoiding ICU admission for patients with worsening respiratory failure and allowing early discharge of ICU patients.","output":"Role of Intermediate Care Unit Admission and Noninvasive Respiratory Support during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: During COVID-19, the majority of the globe nations have experienced horrible difficult times during the COVID -19 outbreak Thus, the present study aimed to assess the association between socio-demographical characteristics, comorbidities and anxiety burden during COVID-19 lockdown in Saudi Arabia Methodology: In the present descriptive survey, 422 persons (living in the City of Ha'il, Northern Saudi Arabia) were recruited Both Saudi and non-Saudi persons were included during the COVID-19 lockdown (May 2020) The study was designed to assess the Psychological influence of the COVID-19 outbreak on the community of northern Saudi Arabia Results: Approximately, 84% of the study population was found with some sorts of anxiety About 206/257(80%) of the males have claimed some sorts of the anxiety of whom 118/206(57%) were found with anxiety level &gt;= 5 About 150/165(91%) of the females have claimed some sorts of the anxiety of whom 102/150(68%) were found with anxiety level &gt;= 5 The risk of anxiety associated with female gender and the relative risk (RR) the 95% confidence interval (95% CI);RR (95% CI) = 0 4581(0 2666 to 0 7873), P = 0 0047, z-statistic = 2 826 Higher levels of anxiety (level &gt;= 5) were detected in 178/336(53%) Saudi and 42/86(49%) of the non- Saudi participants The risk of anxiety associated with Saudi participant, RR (95% CI) = 0 8702 (0 5149 to 1 4707), P = 0 6036, z statistic = 0 519 Conclusion: Sociodemographic characteristics (especially, gender, job status, and age) are important factors affecting the community during an epidemic crisis, and should be considered by health policymakers Especial psychologic support is deemed important for patients with chronic comorbidities, particularly hypertensive patients and those with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases","output":"Association between socio-demographical characteristics, comorbidities and anxiety burden during COVID-19 lockdown in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has imposed significant risks to our health and affected our social and economic order, information on COVID-19 becomes readily accessible via various mass media and social media.

Integrating Terror Management Theory (TMT; Becker, 1973; Greenberg et al., 1986) with Generativity Theory (Erikson, 1963, 1982), we proposed and investigated two psychological mechanisms (i.e., death anxiety and generativity-based death reflection) that account for the effects of employees' COVID-19 information exposure on their work withdrawal and helping behaviors toward coworkers.

Methods: Fifty cases using a TM shell and a TC or DM cemented liner with at least 12 months of follow-up were identified. There were 25 TC and 25 DM liners. Clinical, radiographic, and patient-reported outcomes were collected. Reasons for re-revision and failures were analyzed. Results: The average age was 73 years in the TC group and 75 years in the DM group.

More recently, it has become integral to the estimation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness, in particular for more severe disease outcomes. Because the design has many important advantages and is becoming a mainstay for monitoring postlicensure vaccine effectiveness, epidemiologists and biostatisticians may be interested in further understanding the effect measures being estimated in these studies and connections to causal effects. Logistic regression is typically applied to estimate the conditional risk ratio but relies on correct outcome model specification and may be biased in the presence of effect modification by a confounder. We give and justify an inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) estimator for the marginal risk ratio, which is valid under effect modification.

Design: 2 by 3 experimental design. Setting: Online with data collected between 28th April and 1st May 2020. Participants: 1,204 adults registered with a UK research panel. Intervention: Participants were randomised to receive one of six descriptions of an antibody test and results showing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, differing in the terms used to describe the type of test (Immunity vs Antibody) and the test result (Passport vs Certificate vs Test). Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of participants perceiving no risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 given an antibody positive test result. Other outcomes include intended changes to frequency of hand washing and physical distancing. Results: When using the term Immunity (vs Antibody), 19.1% of participants [95% CI: 16.1 to 22.5] (vs 9.8% [95% CI: 7.5 to 12.4]) perceived no risk of catching coronavirus at some point in the future given an antibody-positive test result (AOR: 2.91 [95% CI: 1.52 to 5.55]).

Rapid restoration of TB diagnosis and care services is critical for minimizing the potential effects on TBrelated deaths and bringing TB burden back to control. It is urgent to ramp up case detection including active case finding and to provide an uninterrupted supply of quality-assured treatment and care for TB cases in postCOVID-19 outbreak.","output":"Predicted Impact of the COVID-19 Responses on Deaths of Tuberculosis - China, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors reflect on how the athletic training community was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including on athletic training research Topics include how the readers, editors, authors, and reviewers were affected by the pandemic, and how athletic trainers conduct research, evaluate research, and disseminate research","output":"The Pandemic as an Opportunity to Reflect on Athletic Training Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The increasing number of data supporting use of a personalized approach in cancer treatment, is changing the path of patients management. In the same time, the availability of technologies should allow patients to receive the best test for the specific individual condition. This is theoretically true, when a specific test is designed for the specific disease condition, while it is difficult to implement in the setting of agnostic therapies. Financial sources availability related to the non homogeneous health systems working in the different countries do not allow for an immediate implementation of the technologies and test commercially available. Future perspectives for targeted oncology include tumor-agnostic drugs, which target a given mutation and could be used in treating cancers from multiple organ types. Therefore, the present paper is aimed to both underline a how much important is this new view and also to sensitize the international bodies that supervise health policies at the decision-making level, with the aim of harmonizing cancer treatment pathways in at least all European countries. ABSTRACT: Rapid and continuing advances in biomarker testing are not being matched by uptake in health systems, and this is hampering both patient care and innovation. It also risks costing health systems the opportunity to make their services more efficient and, over time, more economical. The potential that genomics has brought to biomarker testing in diagnosis, prediction and research is being realised, pre-eminently in many cancers, but also in an ever-wider range of conditionsnotably BRCA1/2 testing in ovarian, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers. Nevertheless, the implementation of genetic testing in clinical routine setting is still challenging. Development is impeded by country-related heterogeneity, data deficiencies, and lack of policy alignment on standards, approvaland the role of real-world evidence in the processand reimbursement. The acute nature of the problem is compellingly illustrated by the particular challenges facing the development and use of tumour agnostic therapies, where the gaps in preparedness for taking advantage of this innovative approach to cancer therapy are sharply exposed. Europe should already have in place a guarantee of universal access to a minimum suite of biomarker tests and should be planning for an optimum testing scenario with a wider range of biomarker tests integrated into a more sophisticated health system articulated around personalised medicine. Improving healthcare and winning advantages for Europes industrial competitiveness and innovation require an appropriate policy frameworkstarting with an update to outdated recommendations. We show herein the main issues and proposals that emerged during the previous advisory boards organised by the European Alliance for Personalized Medicine which mainly focus on possible scenarios of harmonisation of both oncogenetic testing and management of cancer patients.","output":"Bringing Onco-Innovation to Europes Healthcare Systems: The Potential of Biomarker Testing, Real World Evidence, Tumour Agnostic Therapies to Empower Personalised Medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is a concern that influenza vaccination may increase the incidence of immune\\\\related adverse events in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the available data on the safety and efficacy of influenza vaccination in cancer patients receiving ICIs. METHODS: Studies reporting safety and efficacy outcomes of influenza vaccination in cancer patients receiving ICIs were included. Only descriptive statistics were conducted to obtain a pooled rate of immune\\\\related adverse events in vaccinated patients. RESULTS: Ten studies assessing the safety and eight assessing the efficacy of influenza vaccination in cancer patients receiving ICIs were identified, for a total of 1124 and 986 vaccinated patients, respectively. Most patients had melanoma or lung cancer and received a single agent anti\\\\PD\\\\1, but also other tumour types and immunotherapy combinations were represented. No severe vaccination\\\\related toxicities were reported. The pooled incidence of any grade immune checkpoint inhibitorCrelated adverse events was 28.9%. In the 6 studies specifying the incidence of grade 3\\\\4 toxicities, the pooled incidence was 7.5%. No grade 5 toxicities were reported. No pooled descriptive analysis was conducted in studies reporting efficacy outcomes due to the heterogeneity of endpoints and data reporting. Nevertheless, among the eight studies included, seven reported positive efficacy outcomes of influenza vaccination. CONCLUSION: The results of this systematic review support the safety and efficacy of influenza vaccination in cancer patients receiving ICIs.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the Saudi public perceptions toward seasonal influenza vaccination and their association with the rate of vaccination. Methods: Individuals aged 15 years and older were surveyed about their knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward the seasonal influenza vaccine using a previously developed and validated 19-item online questionnaire. The impact of the participants perceptions toward the seasonal influenza vaccine on their past influenza vaccination history was assessed using multiple linear regressions. Results: The rate of regular vaccination among the 790 surveyed participants was 12.65%, and those who were aged <24 years had the highest rate (57%). The vast majority of the participants with chronic diseases (>90%) reported irregular vaccination histories against seasonal influenza. Participants who believed that the influenza vaccine is safe ( = 3.27; 95% CI: 2.067 to 5.171; p <0.001), efficacious ( = 2.87; 95% CI: 1.834 to 4.498; p <0.001), should be given during a specific time in the year ( = 1.821; 95% CI: 1.188 to 2.789; p = 0.0059), and were aware of their need to get vaccinated against the seasonal influenza ( = 2.781; 95% CI: 1.254 to 6.188; p = 0.0119) were more likely to have received the vaccine.

Social scientists have rarely studied face mask wearing, leaving little guidance for methods to encourage these behaviours. In the current article, we provide an approach to address this issue by developing the 32-item and 8-dimension Face Mask Perceptions Scale (FMPS). We begin by developing an over-representative item list in a qualitative study, wherein participants' responses are used to develop items to ensure content relevance. This item list is then reduced via exploratory factor analysis in a second study, and the eight dimensions of the scale are supported. We also support the validity of the FMPS, as the scale significantly relates to both face mask wearing and health perceptions. We lastly confirm the factor structure of the FMPS in a third study via confirmatory factor analysis. From these efforts, we identify an avenue that social scientists can aid in preventing coronavirus and illness more broadly - by studying face mask perceptions and behaviours.","output":"Understanding face mask use to prevent coronavirus and other illnesses: Development of a multidimensional face mask perceptions scale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nunes et al ([54]) provide an overview of mathematical models used to analyse epidemics and techniques for conducting studies to obtain parameter estimates for such models They discuss the SEIR model which has been used in much coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) analysis Our discussion presents a modelling framework based in time series analysis developed for the analysis of infectious disease surveillance data, as well as our use of the framework in analysing COVID-19 We believe many of the purposes of modelling infectious disease outlined by Nunes et al ([54]) as well as the benefits of mathematical modelling highlighted can also be found in the statistical modelling techniques we use in our work","output":"Endemic-epidemic Framework Used in Covid-19 Modelling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several outbreaks of pneumococcal pneumonia among shipyard workers have been described. In this study, following a previous report of grouped cases, we aimed to elucidate the features of disease onset. METHODS: We compared the population characteristics of shipyard workers with a confirmed diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia (N = 38) to those of workers without pneumonia (N = 53). We compared nine S. pneumoniae strains isolated from patients with pneumonia by capsular serotyping, multi-locus sequence typing, and whole genome sequencing. RESULTS: Shipyard workers with Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia were more frequently from Italy (P = 0.016), had at least one underlying condition (P = 0.024), lived on-board the ship (P = 0.009). None of these factors was independent by multivariate analysis. While capsular serotyping enabled us to identify four different serotypes: 4 (n = 5), 8 (n = 2), 9 N (n = 1), and 3 (n = 1), by sequence typing, we distinguished five sequence types (STs): ST801 (n = 4), ST205 (n = 2), ST1220 (n = 1), ST1280 (n = 1), and ST66 (n = 1). Whole genome sequencing confirmed the results obtained by MLST. Genomes of isolates of the same sequence type were similar with 80 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that the onset of pneumococcal infection among shipyard workers was attributable to both a person-to-person spread of single strains of S. pneumoniae and a shift of different strains from commensal to pathogen under favourable conditions (professional exposure, viral infections). Control measures should therefore be implemented by taking into account these features.","output":"Pneumococcal pneumonia among shipyard workers: Inside the features of disease onset"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polymerase eta (or Pol  or POLH) is a specialized DNA polymerase that is able to bypass certain blocking lesions, such as those generated by ultraviolet radiation (UVR) or cisplatin, and is deployed to replication foci for translesion synthesis as part of the DNA damage response (DDR). Inherited defects in the gene encoding POLH (a.k.a., XPV) are associated with the rare, sun-sensitive, cancer-prone disorder, xeroderma pigmentosum, owing to the enzymes ability to accurately bypass UVR-induced thymine dimers. In standard-of-care cancer therapies involving platinum-based clinical agents, e.g., cisplatin or oxaliplatin, POLH can bypass platinum-DNA adducts, negating benefits of the treatment and enabling drug resistance. POLH inhibition can sensitize cells to platinum-based chemotherapies, and the polymerase has also been implicated in resistance to nucleoside analogs, such as gemcitabine. POLH overexpression has been linked to the development of chemoresistance in several cancers, including lung, ovarian, and bladder. Co-inhibition of POLH and the ATR serine/threonine kinase, another DDR protein, causes synthetic lethality in a range of cancers, reinforcing that POLH is an emerging target for the development of novel oncology therapeutics. Using a fragment-based drug discovery approach in combination with an optimized crystallization screen, we have solved the first X-ray crystal structures of small novel drug-like compounds, i.e., fragments, bound to POLH, as starting points for the design of POLH inhibitors. The intrinsic molecular resolution afforded by the method can be quickly exploited in fragment growth and elaboration as well as analog scoping and scaffold hopping using medicinal and computational chemistry to advance hits to lead. An initial small round of medicinal chemistry has resulted in inhibitors with a range of functional activity in an in vitro biochemical assay, leading to the rapid identification of an inhibitor to advance to subsequent rounds of chemistry to generate a lead compound. Importantly, our chemical matter is different from the traditional nucleoside analog-based approaches for targeting DNA polymerases.","output":"Early Drug Discovery and Development of Novel Cancer Therapeutics Targeting DNA Polymerase Eta (POLH)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inequalities are prevalent across the spectrum of cancer research and patient care, with destructive repercussions for people and society.

Grief is a natural consequence. Many mental health concerns, which can be identified as grief outcomes (e.g. anxiety and depression) in those who have experienced a bereavement, can be improved through physical activity. The objective of this review was to identify from the existing literature if physical activity can benefit grief outcomes in individuals who have been bereaved. METHODS: A systematic review of nine databases was performed. Included studies (qualitative and quantitative) explored physical activity to help individuals (of any age) who had experienced a human bereavement (excluding national loss). RESULTS: From 1299 studies screened, 25 met the inclusion criteria, detailing eight types of bereavement (parental (n = 5), spousal (n = 6), patient (n = 4), pre-natal (n = 3), later life (n = 1), caregiver (n = 1), multiple (n = 4) and non-defined (n = 1). Activities including yoga, running, walking and martial arts were noted as beneficial. Physical activity allowed a sense of freedom, to express emotions, provided a distraction and an escape from grief, whilst enhancing social support. CONCLUSION: There is some evidence that physical activity may provide benefit for the physical health and psychological wellbeing of those who have been bereaved, including when the loss has happened at a young age. This review is timely, given the wide-scale national loss of life due to COVID-19 and extends knowledge in this area.

However, the shortage of grafts, leads to attempt liver resection (LR) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as a first-line treatment for patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis. METHODS We report results, obtained between 2000 and 2007 from a single center, involving 67 patients (mean age: 57 years) eligible for LT, who were treated with RFA, followed by LT if there was recurrence or liver failure. RESULTS Eighty three tumors were treated (mean size: 299 mm; 16 binodular forms). RFA achieved complete ablation in 96% of nodules. No mortality occurred. During a post-RFA median follow-up of 48 months, 38 patients experienced recurrence, corresponding to a 5-year recurrence rate of 58%. Of these, 14 patients did not receive a transplant because they fell outside the Milan criteria, 21 were transplanted, and 3 were treated by RFA after refusing LT. Binodularity (95% CI HR=2, 1.0-4.0; p=0.049) was the unique risk factor for recurrence. By the study's end-point, 24 patients had undergone LT (21 for HCC recurrence and three for liver failure). No HCC recurrence occurred after LT. Among the 43 non-transplant patients, 12 died due to HCC progression, and 27 were alive without detectable viable tumor. The probability rates for 5-year overall and tumor-free survival were 74% and 69%, respectively.

While the lungs are the primary target for the SARS-CoV-2-mediated pathological consequence, SARS-CoV-2 appear to invade the brain and cause neurological deficits. In the later stage, COVID-19 can progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, neurological deficits and multi-organ dysfunctions leading to death. Though a significant portion of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals has been recovering from pathological symptoms, the impact of the COVID-19 on the structural and functional properties of the lungs, heart, brain and other organs at the post-recovery state remains unknown. Presently, there is an urgent need for a remedial measure to combat this devastating COVID-19. Botulinum toxins (BoNTs) are potent neurotoxins that can induce paralysis of muscle and acute respiratory arrest in human. However, a mild dose of the purified form of BoNT has been known to attenuate chronic cough, dyspnoea, pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, abnormal circulation, cardiac defects and various neurological deficits that have been recognised as the prominent clinical symptoms of COVID-19.

The retinal pigment epithelial (RPE), a unique retinal cell, displays a number of essential functions to support the health of the retina. In this review, we highlight how the RPE cell plays a pivotal role in immune defense. The RPE cell orchestrates both innate and adaptive immunity since it expresses TLRs, complement components, MHC class I and II molecules, and serves as an antigen presenting cell. Moreover, both of these immune responses result in the production of a plethora of cytokines, mainly proinflammatory. In order to counteract these inflammatory factors and silence unwanted immune reactivity, the RPE cell also generates suppressive molecules. Recently, chronic immune reactivity has been implicated in a number of retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Current evidence suggests that the generation of excessive retinal inflammation may be the consequence of a loss of RPE immunosuppressive factors.

The analysis was built on a semi-nonparametric approach. Approximately 19 percent of small-scale producers were able to increase sales during the first wave of the pandemic, although country-level variation was significant. Fruits and vegetables were by far the most popular products. The importance of specific channels varied across countries, but farm gate sales were among the most important marketing channels both before and during the first wave. The importance of channels that were based on digital resources and home delivery increased. Our evidence indicates that diversification was a strategy that paid off, both in terms of marketing channels and different product categories. However, the impact appears to be nonlinear; the initial advantage generated by diversification rapidly tapered off, either temporarily (in the case of products), or permanently (in the case of marketing channels).

RESEARCH DESIGN: Quasi-experimental cross-sectional study. STUDY SAMPLE: Thirty patients were assessed: 16 with normal hearing [NH], and 14 hearing-impaired [HI] with moderate hearing loss. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A speech perception test (TAUV) was administered by an operator trained to speak at 65 dB, without a face mask, with a surgical mask, and with a KN95/FFP2 face mask, in a quiet and in a noisy environment (cocktail party noise, 55 dB). The Hearing Handicap Index for Adults (HHI-A) was administered twice, asking subjects to complete it for the period before and after the pandemic outburst. A 2-way repeated-measure analysis of variance was performed. RESULTS: The NH group showed a significant difference between the no-mask and the KN95/FFP2-mask condition in noise (p = 0.01). The HI group showed significant differences for surgical or KN95/FFP2 mask compared with no-mask, and for KN95/FFP2 compared with surgical mask, in quiet and in noise (p < 0.001).

Understanding the genetic mechanisms of immune response to viral infection provides insight into disease etiology and therapeutic opportunities. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive study including genome-wide and transcriptome-wide association analyses to identify genetic loci associated with immunoglobulin G antibody response to 28 antigens for 16 viruses using serological data from 7924 European ancestry participants in the UK Biobank cohort. RESULTS: Signals in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region dominated the landscape of viral antibody response, with 40 independent loci and 14 independent classical alleles, 7 of which exhibited pleiotropic effects across viral families. We identified specific amino acid (AA) residues that are associated with seroreactivity, the strongest associations presented in a range of AA positions within DR1 at positions 11, 13, 71, and 74 for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Varicella zoster virus (VZV), human herpesvirus 7, (HHV7), and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV). Genome-wide association analyses discovered 7 novel genetic loci outside the HLA associated with viral antibody response (P < 5.0  10(?8)), including FUT2 (19q13.33) for human polyomavirus BK (BKV), STING1 (5q31.2) for MCV, and CXCR5 (11q23.3) and TBKBP1 (17q21.32) for HHV7.

LDT was fairly common, but many of the LDTs were isolated events that did not spread. Two putative LDT events did appear to become nascent foci that affected the epidemic in surrounding townships. In evaluating the role of LDT, we simultaneously revisited the problem of spatial heterogeneity. The spread of raccoon rabies is associated with forest coverrabies moves up to three-times slower through the most heavily forested townships compared with those with less forestation. Forestation also modified the effect of rivers. In the best overall model, rabies did not cross the river separating townships that were heavily forested, and the spread slowed substantially between townships that were lightly forested. Our results suggest that spatial heterogeneity can be used to enhance the effects of rabies control by focusing vaccine bait distribution along rivers in lightly forested areas.

Simultaneously due to diminished economic and human activity, the atmospheric levels of PM2.5, an important airborne pollutant, decreased significantly. COVID-19 has been found adherent to PM2.5. PM2.5 has various components including sodium chloride which determines the amount of PM2.5 salt-derived water content. Atmospheric salt content in part determines the sodium chloride content and the consequential hygroscopicity of PM2.5. COVID-19 possesses a C-terminal protein which is hydrophobic.METHOD: The sodium chloride content of the PM2.5 species was assessed in two groups of cities. Cities were chosen as opposed to countries, because substantial regional differences in infection rates were noted between inland and coastal cities. These cities were differentiated by the rate COVID-19 infection and consequent mortality. Atmospheric salt content was obtained from research that assessed chloride ion wet deposition, a proxy for airborne salinity. The salt content of the relevant PM2.5 species was obtained from publications from the various cities assessed.RESULTS: Cities with high COVID-19 infection rates had PM2.5 species with significantly lower salt content than the cities with low Covid-17 infection. The PM2.5 salt content in the cities with elevated COVID-19 rates was 0.196g/m 3 SD 0.05g/m 3 , while cities with low COVID-19 rates had a PM2.5 salt content of 0.81g/m 3 SD 0.32g/m 3 (p<0.0001).There was a significant correlation between atmospheric salinity and the salt content of PM2.5. PM2.5 salt content correlated with minimum atmospheric salinity (R=0.53, p < 0.01) and maximum atmospheric salinity (R=0.64, p <0.002). There appears to be an inverse relationship between COVID-19 infection and atmospheric salt content levels. Cities that were spared high COVID-19 infection rates, have higher maximum/minimum atmospheric salinity content levels (216-1080 mgCl/m 2 /day) compared to sodium chloride levels noted in cities with high COVID-19 rates of infection (40-125. mgCl/m 2 /day) (p<0.005).CONCLUSION: PM2.5 with low salt content, in the presence of low ambient salinity may be linked to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection in the population.","output":"COVID-19 and PM2.5 Sodium Chloride content"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New SARS-COV-2 vaccine strategies are still urgently needed, especially for emerging virus mutations and variants.

METHODS: We have designed and run agent-based simulations and a multiple wave model to fit the infected population data for many countries. We have also developed a novel Pandemic Response Index to provide a quantitative and objective way of ranking countries according to their COVID-19 response performance. RESULTS: We have analyzed data from 18 countries based on the multiple wave (subepidemics) hypothesis and present the relevant parameters. Multiple waves have been identified and were found to describe the data better. The effectiveness of intervention measures can be inferred by the peak intensities of the waves. Countries imposing fast and stringent interventions exhibit multiple waves with declining peak intensities. This result strongly corroborated with agent-based simulations outcomes.

In order to eliminate infectious diseases, individuals need to consider social welfare beyond mere self-interestregardless of ethnic, religious, or national group borders. It has therefore been proposed that vaccination poses a social contract in which individuals are morally obliged to get vaccinated. However, little is known about whether individuals indeed act upon this social contract. If so, vaccinated individuals should reciprocate by being more generous to a vaccinated other. On the contrary, if the other doesnt vaccinate and violates the social contract, generosity should decline. Three preregistered experiments investigated how a persons own vaccination behavior, others vaccination behavior, and others group membership influenced a persons generosity toward respective others. The experiments consistently showed that especially compliant (i.e., vaccinated) individuals showed less generosity toward nonvaccinated individuals. This effect was independent of the others group membership, suggesting an unconditional moral principle. An internal metaanalysis (n = 1,032) confirmed the overall social contract effect. In a fourth experiment (n = 1,212), this pattern was especially pronounced among vaccinated individuals who perceived vaccination as a moral obligation. It is concluded that vaccination is a social contract in which cooperation is the morally right choice. Individuals act upon the social contract, and more so the stronger they perceive it as a moral obligation. Emphasizing the social contract could be a promising intervention to increase vaccine uptake, prevent free riding, and, eventually, support the elimination of infectious diseases.","output":"Vaccination as a social contract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dense urban areas are especially hardly hit by the Covid-19 crisis due to the limited availability of public transport, one of the most efficient means of mass mobility. In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, public transport operators are experiencing steep declines in demand and fare revenues due to the perceived risk of infection within vehicles and other facilities. The purpose of this paper is to explore the possibilities of implementing social distancing in public transport in line with epidemiological advice. Social distancing requires effective demand management to keep vehicle occupancy rates under a predefined threshold, both spatially and temporally. We review the literature of five demand management methods enabled by new information and ticketing technologies: (i) inflow control with queueing, (ii) time and space dependent pricing, (iii) capacity reservation with advance booking, (iv) slot auctioning, and (v) tradeable travel permit schemes. Thus the paper collects the relevant literature into a single point of reference, and provides interpretation from the viewpoint of practical applicability during and after the pandemic.","output":"Social distancing in public transport: mobilising new technologies for demand management under the Covid-19 crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 has already spread over 200 countries approaching two million of confirmed cases, hundreds of thousand of deaths, and is st","output":"Spatiotemporal Analysis for the Outbreak of COVID-19 in the World"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article provides practitioners perspectives on preservation of the Irish web space by the National Library of Ireland (the NLI).

A protocol for open reduction of DDH has been refined through collaboration between surgical, anaesthetic, and nursing teams to allow same day discharge. The objective of this study was to determine the safety and feasibility of performing open reduction of DDH as a day case. METHODS: A prospectively collected departmental database was visited. All consecutive surgical cases of DDH between June 2015 and March 2020 were collected. Closed reductions, bilateral cases, cases requiring corrective osteotomy, and children with comorbidities were excluded. Data collected included demographics, safety outcome measures (blood loss, complications, readmission, reduction confirmation), and feasibility for discharge according to the Face Legs Activity Cry Consolidability (FLACC) pain scale. A satisfaction questionnaire was filled by the carers. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis. RESULTS: Out of 168 consecutive DDH cases, 16 patients fit the inclusion criteria (age range 10 to 26 months, 13 female). Intraoperative blood loss ranged from \\"minimal\\" to 120 ml, and there were no complications or readmissions. The FLACC score was 0 for all patients. The carers satisfaction questionnaire expressed high satisfaction from the experience with adequate information and support provided. CONCLUSION: Open reduction in DDH, without corrective osteotomy, is safe and feasible to be managed as a day case procedure. It requires a clear treatment pathway, analgesia, sufficient counselling, and communication with carers. It is even more important during the COVID-19 pandemic when reduced length of hospital stay is likely to be safer for both patient and their parents.

Covid-19 viral infection targets the human respiratory system and, at present, no specific treatment has been identified even though certain drugs have been studied and considered apparently effective in viral progression by reducing the complications in the lung epithelium. Researchers and clinicians are still struggling to find a vaccine or a specific innovative therapeutic strategy to counter COVID-19 infection.Here we describe our study indicating that SARS-CoV-2 genome contains motif sequences in the 5UTR leader sequence that can be selectively recognized by specific human non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as micro and long non-coding RNAs (miRNAs and lncRNA). Notably, some of these ncRNAs have been already utilized as oligo-based drugs in pulmonary and virus-associated diseases. We identified three selective motifs at the 5UTR leader sequence of SARS-CoV-2 that allow viral recognition and binding of a specific group of miRNAs, some of them characterized by GU seed alignments. Additionally, one seed motif within miRNAs has been found to be able to bind the 5UTR leader sequence. Among miRNAs having thermodynamically stable binding site against leader sequence and that are able interacted with Spike transcript some are involved in pulmonary arterial hypertension and anti-viral response, i.e. miR-204, miR-3661, and miR-1343. Moreover, several miRNA candidates have been already validated in vivo and specific oligo sequence are indeed available for their inhibition or overexpression.Four lncRNAs (H19, Hotair, Fendrr, and LINC05) directly interact with spike transcript (mRNA) and viral genome.In conclusion, we suggest that specific miRNAs and lncRNAs can be potential candidates to design oligonucleotide-drugs to treat COVID-19 and that our study can provide candidate hypothesis to be eventually tested in further experimental studies.","output":"MicroRNAs and long non-coding RNAs as potential candidates to target specific motifs of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigated human calicivirus (HCV)-associated diarrheain children attending day care centers by using stool specimens collected in 1981C1983.

It leads to repeated cycles of muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration and progressive replacement of fibers by fibrotic and adipose tissue, with consequent muscle weakness and premature death. Fibrosis and, in particular, collagen accumulation are important pathological features of dystrophic muscle. A better understanding of the development of fibrosis is crucial to enable better management of DMD. Three-dimensional (3D) characterization of collagen organization by second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy has already proven a highly informative means of studying the fibrotic network in tissue. RESULTS Here, we combine for the first-time tissue clearing with SHG microscopy to characterize in depth the 3D cardiac fibrosis network from DMDmdx rat model. Heart sections (1-mm-thick) from 1-year-old wild-type (WT) and DMDmdx rats were cleared using the CUBIC protocol. SHG microscopy revealed significantly greater collagen deposition in DMDmdx versus WT sections. Analyses revealed a specific pattern of SHG+ segmented objects in DMDmdx cardiac muscle, characterized by a less elongated shape and increased density. Compared with the observed alignment of SHG+ collagen fibers in WT rats, profound fiber disorganization was observed in DMDmdx rats, in which we observed two distinct SHG+ collagen fiber profiles, which may reflect two distinct stages of the fibrotic process in DMD. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE The current work highlights the interest to combine multiphoton SHG microscopy and tissue clearing for 3D fibrosis network characterization in label free organ. It could be a relevant tool to characterize the fibrotic tissue remodeling in relation to the disease progression and/or to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic strategies in preclinical studies in DMD model or others fibrosis-related cardiomyopathies diseases.

However, the relationship between larger nursing homes and the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been documented. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between county average nursing home bed size and presence of certificate of need (CON) laws, which influence nursing home size, with county-level SARS-CoV-2 prevalence over time. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using county-level data from March 11 through June 12, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: All US counties with at least one nursing home (n = 2,883). MAIN MEASURES: The main explanatory variables were county average nursing home bed size and presence of a CON law. The main outcome was the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 cases on each day of the study period adjusted for county population size and density, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, total nursing home bed supply, other health care supply measures, epidemic stage, and census region. KEY RESULTS: By June 12, a between-county difference in average nursing home size equal to 1 bed was associated with 3.92 additional SARS-COV-2 cases (95% CI = 2.14 to 5.69; P < 0.001), on average, and counties subject to CON laws had 104.53 additional SARS-CoV-2 cases (95% CI = 7.68 to 201.38; P < 0.05), on average. Counties with larger nursing homes also demonstrated higher growth in the frequency of SARS-COV-2 throughout the study period.

The aim of our present study was to perform metataxonomic analyses of gut microbiota dynamics during colonization with an extended-spectrum -lactamase (ESBL)- and carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ECKP) strain in mice; additionally, to ascertain the effects of antibiotic administration (ampicillin, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin) on the establishment and elimination of ECKP intestinal colonization.

Healthcare professionals demonstrated some uncertainty in understanding the systems output. Based on their feedback, we altered the explanation provided in the updated version of our CDSS. C-ALS provides local explanations of its predictions in a post-hoc manner, using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). The CDSS predicts the risk of low QoL in the form of a probability, a bar plot shows the feature importance for the specific prediction, along with some verbal guidelines on how to interpret the results. Additionally, we provide the option of a global explanation of the systems function in the form of a bar plot showing the average importance of each feature.

Cross-country comparable food RB with the minimum cost were previously developed in 26 EU countries. However, sustainability was not considered. The aim of this paper is to present the development of healthy and sustainable food baskets for Spanish adults. This work follows the steps proposed in previous European projects to build RB: (1) revision of guidelines on healthy and sustainable eating and expert consultations, (2) translation into a concrete list of foods, (3) pricing. The results indicate that a sustainable diet can be cheaper than current recommendations when only the dietary content is considered, representing monthly savings of about EUR 7.27. This is mainly explained by the shift towards more plant-based proteins. Adding constraints on origin, packaging and seasonality increases the overall cost of the food basket by EUR 12.22/month compared with current recommendations. The Spanish Sustainable Food Reference Budget illustrates the cost of applying different criteria to improve dietary sustainability in the Spanish context, and can be useful to support the ecological transition, since providing different levels of adherence to a sustainable dietary pattern can ease its access across socioeconomic groups.","output":"Estimating the Cost of the Spanish Sustainable Food Basket through the Reference Budgets Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mesocotyl length (MES) is an important trait that affects the emergence of maize seedlings after deep-seeding and is closely associated with abiotic stress. The elucidation of constitutive-QTLs (cQTLs) and candidate genes for MES and tightly molecular markers are thus of great importance in marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding. Therefore, the objective of this study was to perform detailed genetic analysis of maize MES across 346 F2:3 families, 30/30 extreme bulks of an F2 population, and two parents by conventional QTL analysis, bulked-segregation analysis (BSA), and RNA-sequencing when maize was sown at the depths of 3, 15, and 20 cm, respectively. QTL analysis identified four major QTLs in Bin 1.09, Bin 3.04, Bin 4.06-4.07, and Bin 6.01 under two or more environments, which explained 2.89-13.97% of the phenotypic variance within a single environment. BSA results revealed the presence of seven significantly linked SNP/InDel regions on chromosomes 1 and 4, and six SNP/InDel regions and the major QTL of qMES4-1 overlapped and formed a cQTL, cQMES4, within the 160.98-176.22 Mb region. In total, 18,001 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified across two parents by RNA-sequencing, and 24 of these genes were conserved core DEGs. Finally, we validated 15 candidate genes in cQMES4 to involve in cell wall structure, lignin biosyntheis, phytohormones (auxin, abscisic acid, brassinosteroid) signal transduction, circadian clock, and plant organ formation and development.

DESIGN: Natural experiment using interrupted time series analysis, with results synthesised using meta-analysis. SETTING: 149 countries or regions, with data on daily reported cases of covid-19 from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and data on the physical distancing policies from the Oxford covid-19 Government Response Tracker. PARTICIPANTS: Individual countries or regions that implemented one of the five physical distancing interventions (closures of schools, workplaces, and public transport, restrictions on mass gatherings and public events, and restrictions on movement (lockdowns)) between 1 January and 30 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of covid-19 before and after implementation of physical distancing interventions, estimated using data to 30 May 2020 or 30 days post-intervention, whichever occurred first. IRRs were synthesised across countries using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: On average, implementation of any physical distancing intervention was associated with an overall reduction in covid-19 incidence of 13% (IRR 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 0.89; n=149 countries). Closure of public transport was not associated with any additional reduction in covid-19 incidence when the other four physical distancing interventions were in place (pooled IRR with and without public transport closure was 0.85, 0.82 to 0.88; n=72, and 0.87, 0.84 to 0.91; n=32, respectively). Data from 11 countries also suggested similar overall effectiveness (pooled IRR 0.85, 0.81 to 0.89) when school closures, workplace closures, and restrictions on mass gatherings were in place. In terms of sequence of interventions, earlier implementation of lockdown was associated with a larger reduction in covid-19 incidence (pooled IRR 0.86, 0.84 to 0.89; n=105) compared with a delayed implementation of lockdown after other physical distancing interventions were in place (pooled IRR 0.90, 0.87 to 0.94; n=41). CONCLUSIONS: Physical distancing interventions were associated with reductions in the incidence of covid-19 globally. No evidence was found of an additional effect of public transport closure when the other four physical distancing measures were in place. Earlier implementation of lockdown was associated with a larger reduction in the incidence of covid-19.

This pandemic has been preceded by several other interferences on a smaller scale, setting the scene for crises in perpetuity. With a reactive stance adopted, these crises may result in rapid shifts to curricula, minimizing the opportunity for thorough planning and critical analyses. GUIDANCE FROM THE LITERATURE Recognizing the limited frameworks available to provide structure to such curricular crises responses, we drew on the literature to develop a crisis-curriculum analysis framework. The work of the SPICES model by Harden et al., the four-dimensional framework by Steketee et al., and Deverell's crisis-induced learning, was used to develop the framework. CRISIS-CURRICULUM ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK The framework provides a structured approach to curriculum analysis in the face of disruption. It is designed to meet the needs of the global health professions education community, currently in the midst of a crisis. Accompanied by a step-wise guideline, this framework is suitable for educators requiring a practically-orientated approach to curriculum analysis. CONCLUSION Recognizing that curriculum analysis is but one part of crisis-management, we argue that this crisis-curriculum analysis framework may align well with strengthening institutional readiness as educators seek to refine and entrench curricular practices adopted during COVID-19.","output":"When disruption strikes the curriculum: Towards a crisis-curriculum analysis framework."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Successful navigation of the Covid-19 pandemic is predicated on public cooperation with safety measures and appropriate perception of risk, in which emotion and attention play important roles.

We compare key epidemiological indicators of the progression of the pandemic with indicators of the public perception of the pandemic constructed from approx. 20 million unique Covid-19-related tweets from 12 countries posted between 10th March and 14th June 2020. We find evidence of psychophysical numbing: Twitter users increasingly fixate on mortality, but in a decreasingly emotional and increasingly analytic tone. We find that the national attention on Covid-19 mortality is modelled accurately as a logarithmic or power law function of national daily Covid-19 deaths rates, implying generalisations of the Weber-Fechner and power law models of sensory perception to the collective. Our parameter estimates for these models are consistent with estimates from psychological experiments, and indicate that users in this dataset exhibit differential sensitivity by country to the national Covid-19 death rates.

There is evidence of worldwide distribution of such devices, but some experts have warned of possible negative impacts of their use. The objective of this study was to measure the effect of an aerosol box on intubation performance across a variety of simulated difficult airway scenarios in the emergency department. METHODS: This was a randomized, crossover design study. Participants were randomized to intubate one of five airway scenarios with and without an aerosol box in place, with randomization of intubation sequence. The primary outcome was time to intubation. Secondary outcomes included number of intubation attempts, Cormack-Lehane view, percent of glottic opening, and resident physician perception of intubation difficulty. RESULTS: Forty-eight residents performed 96 intubations. Time to intubation was significantly longer with box use than without (mean 17 seconds [range 6C68 seconds] vs mean 10 seconds [range 5C40 seconds], p <0.001). Participants perceived intubation as being significantly more difficult with the aerosol box. There were no significant differences in the number of attempts or quality of view obtained.

The aberrant activity of PRC2 is closely involved in tumorigenesis and progression, making its inhibition a viable strategy for epigenetic cancer therapy. Although the clinical development of small PRC2 inhibitors has made impressive progress, with one EZH2 inhibitor approved for cancer therapy and several other candidates in clinical trials, current EZH2 inhibitors are limited to treating certain hematological malignancies and have acquired drug resistance. EED is essential for PRC2 stabilization and allosterically stimulating PRC2 activity because it functions as a scaffold protein and an H3K27me3-recognizing protein. Thus, due to its novel mechanism of action, targeting EED provides a promising new strategy for inhibiting PRC2 function and exhibits the potential to overcome the issues encountered by EZH2 inhibitors.

The study's aim was to identify factors predicting mortality among SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with CKD. METHODS: We analyzed 2817 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients enrolled in the Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and identified 426 patients with pre-existing CKD. Group comparisons were performed via Chi-squared test. Using univariate and multivariable logistic regression, predictive factors for mortality were identified. RESULTS: Comparative analyses to patients without CKD revealed a higher mortality (140/426, 32.9% versus 354/2391, 14.8%).

We asked 2694 conservationists working globally how satisfied they were with progress towards goals important to them. We then explored how this satisfaction varied between groups. Finally, we looked at respondents' experiences associated with goal progress satisfaction. Many (94.0%) said \\"making a meaningful contribution to conservation\\" was an important goal for them, with over half being satisfied or very satisfied in this area (52.5%). However, respondents were generally dissatisfied with progress to collective conservation goals, such as stopping species loss, echoing formal assessments. Some groups were more likely to report dissatisfaction than others. For instance, those in conservation for longer tended to be less satisfied with collective goal progress (log-odds -0.21, 95% credibility interval (CI) -0.32 to -0.10), but practitioners reported greater satisfaction (log-odds 0.38, 95% CI 0.15-0.60). Likewise, those who are more optimistic in life (log-odds 0.24, 95% CI 0.17-0.32), male (log-odds 0.25, 95% CI 0.10-0.41), and working in conservation practice (log-odds 0.25, 95% CI 0.08-0.43) reported greater satisfaction with individual goal progress.

Tumor volumes were measured every other day. The PK model of SUL as well as that of DEX with a time-dependent clearance were integrated into the final PK/PD model both using Hills function, where DEX exerted its antitumor efficacy by inhibiting the proliferation of tumor cells, and SUL enhanced DEX responses by decreasing the sensitivity parameter EC(50). The PK/PD model was evaluated and subjected external validation. Finally, simulations were performed to predict the antitumor efficacy of DEX combined with SUL under various dose regimens, where changing dosing frequency of SUL had little effect, while the antitumor efficacy was predicted to be improved when DEX was given more frequently.

The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a perfect example how viral infection could pose a great threat to global public health and economic sectors. Therefore, the first step in combating viral pathogens is to get a timely and accurate diagnosis. Early and accurate detection of the viral presence in patient sample is crucial for appropriate treatment, control, and prevention of epidemics. Here, we summarize some of the molecular and immunological diagnostic approaches available for the detection of viral infections of humans. Molecular diagnostic techniques provide rapid viral detection in patient sample. They are also relatively inexpensive and highly sensitive and specific diagnostic methods. Immunological-based techniques have been extensively utilized for the detection and epidemiological studies of human viral infections. They can detect antiviral antibodies or viral antigens in clinical samples. There are several commercially available molecular and immunological diagnostic kits that facilitate the use of these methods in the majority of clinical laboratories worldwide. In developing countries including Ethiopia where most of viral infections are endemic, exposure to improved or new methods is highly limited as these methods are very costly to use and also require technical skills. Since researchers and clinicians in all corners of the globe are working hard, it is hoped that in the near future, they will develop good quality tests that can be accessible in low-income countries.","output":"Molecular and Immunological Diagnostic Techniques of Medical Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article examines the short\\\\term effects of the COVID\\\\19 lockdown on food security and nutrition in rural Guatemala.

We place special emphasis on changes in agricultural and nonagricultural income sources, including remittances, and changes in dietary diversity, including consumption of animal source foods (ASF) and fruits and vegetables (F&V). We find that COVID\\\\19 affected the incomes, food security, and dietary patterns of households, with a decrease in ASF diversity and an increase in F&V diversity, and an overall net decrease in dietary diversity across all food groups. Dietary diversity among women in reproductive age, however, remained unchanged, and increased among children under 2 years old. Interestingly, households with relatively higher incomes appear to have reduced their dietary diversity to a larger extent than lower income ones, as well as households located in communities with more severe access restrictions. The focus of the study in a region with a high prevalence of poverty and chronic malnutrition provides an important perspective into the consequences of the lockdown in complex rural contexts with vulnerable populations and contributes to inform eventual recovery measures.","output":"Short\\\\term impacts of COVID\\\\19 on food security and nutrition in rural Guatemala: Phone\\\\based farm household survey evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is the disease caused by an infection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, previously known as 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) respiratory disease.

In June 6(th) 2020, over 7 million cases registered in the world, recovered 3.4 million and death over 402.000. AIM: The aim of this study is to retreive published papers about COVID-19 infection deposited in PubMed data base and analyzed current results of investigations regarding morbidity and mortality rates as consequences of COVID-19 infection and opinions of experts about treatment of afected patients with COVID-19 who have Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). METHODS: Its used method of descriptive analysis of the published papers with described studies about Corona virus connected with CVDs. RESULTS: After searching current scientific literature (on PubMed till today is deposited more than 1.000 papers about COVID-19 with consequences in almost every medical disciplines), we have acknowledged that till today not any Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) study in the world. Also, there are no unique proposed ways of treatments and drugs to protect patients, especially people over 65 years old, who are very risk group to be affected with COVID-19, including patients with CVDs. Vaccine against COVID-19 is already produced and being in phases of testing in praxis in treatment of COVID-19 at affected patients, but the opinions of experts and common people whole over the world about vaccination are full of controversis. CONCLUSION: Frequent hand washing, avoiding crowds and contact with sick people, and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces can help prevent coronavirus infections are the main proposal of WHO experts in current Guidelines, artefacts stored on a web site.

It usually is diagnosed by examining pathological photographs of the patient's lungs. There is a lot of detailed and essential information on chest radiographs, but manual processing is not as efficient or accurate. As a result, how efficiently analyzing and processing chest radiography of COVID-19 patients is an important research direction to promote COVID-19 diagnosis. To improve the processing efficiency of COVID-19 chest films, a multilevel thresholding image segmentation (MTIS) method based on an enhanced multiverse optimizer (CCMVO) is proposed. CCMVO is improved from the original Multi-Verse Optimizer by introducing horizontal and vertical search mechanisms. It has a more assertive global search ability and can jump out of the local optimum in optimization. The CCMVO-based MTIS method can obtain higher quality segmentation results than HHO, SCA, and other forms and is less prone to stagnation during the segmentation process. To verify the performance of the proposed CCMVO algorithm, CCMVO is first compared with DE, MVO, and other algorithms by 30 benchmark functions; then, the proposed CCMVO is applied to image segmentation of COVID-19 chest radiography; finally, this paper verifies that the combination of MTIS and CCMVO is very successful with good segmentation results by using the Feature Similarity Index (FSIM), the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), and the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).

Flexible sigmoidoscopies were performed at baseline, days 7, 42 and 98. Ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity (UCEIS) and its sub-scores - vascular pattern, bleeding and ulceration/erosion - were post-hoc calculated. Global endoscopic remission was defined by a UCEIS of 0, and partial endoscopic remission by any UCEIS sub-score of 0. RESULTS Among the 55 patients analyzed (29 infliximab and 26 cyclosporine), 49 (83%) had UCEIS 6 at baseline at baseline. Partial endoscopic remission rates were higher for bleeding than for vascular pattern and for ulcerations/erosions at day 7 (20% vs. 4% and 5% (n=55); p=0.004 and p=0.04), for bleeding and ulceration/erosion than for vascular pattern at day 42 [63% and 65% vs. 33% (n=54); p<0.001 for both] and at day 98 [78% and 92% vs. 56% (n=50); p=0.007 and p<0.001].

(2) Methods: Dental facilities were surveyed nationwide using an online questionnaire. The acquisition of participants took place in cooperation with the German Society for Dentistry, Oral and Maxillofacial Medicine. (3) Results: A total of 1094 private practices participated. Of these, 39.1% treated fewer than 600 patients per quarter and 59.9% treated over 600 patients per quarter. Pre-interventional testing was rarely performed in either small (6.6%) or large practices (6.0%). Large practices had a significantly higher incidence of at least one SARS-CoV-2-positive HCW than small practices (26.2% vs.14.4%, p < 0.01). The main source of infection in small practices was the private environment, and this was even more significant in large practices (81.8% vs. 89.7%, p < 0.01). The procedure count either remained stable (34.0% of small practices vs. 46.2% of large practices) or decreased by up to 50% (52.6% of small practices vs. 44.4% of large practices).

People were required to stay at home and go out only to satisfy basic needs. Several risk models have postulated a link among online searching behavior, affect, anxiety, and complaints by individuals toward government restrictions (GR), which emerged as also related to an increased perception of knowledge toward risk. However, to date, no study has addressed how these key risk-related aspects (i.e., affect, anxiety, perceived knowledge on risk, and risk dimensions) can act jointly to orient online health information-seeking behavior, and peoples complaints toward GR imposed during the lockdown. This study investigated the mechanisms underlying online health information-seeking behavior and peoples complaints toward the governments restrictions during a COVID-19 emergency in the Italian population. Drawing from the health belief model (HBM), which postulates a link between sociodemographic variables, risk, and affect dimensions in emergency, we assumed risk factors as predictors of affect and anxiety, which, in turn, were posited as mediators between risk dimensions, online health information-seeking behavior, and complaints toward GR. Participants (1,031) were involved during the first week of the quarantine (March 11C18) and completed an online survey composed of (i) an adapted version of the Italian Risk Perception Questionnaire; (ii) the Italian Positive (PA) and Negative Affect (NA) Schedule (PANAS-10); (iii) the State Anxiety Scale (STAI-Y1); (iv) ad hoc personal knowledge measure about novel coronavirus; (v) ad hoc item measuring information search behavior regarding the novel coronavirus; (vi) ad hoc measure of the complains regarding GR; and (vii) sociodemographic questions.

Antimicrobial agents including antibiotics have been frequently utilized in the treatment of infections due to their exceptional outcomes. However, their widespread use has resulted in the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites. Furthermore, due to inherent resistance to antimicrobial drugs and the host defence system, the advent of new infectious diseases, chronic infections, and the occurrence of biofilms pose a tougher challenge to the current treatment line. Essential oils (EOs) and their biologically and structurally diverse constituents provide a distinctive, inexhaustible, and novel source of antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and antiparasitic agents.

Nanoparticles composed of biodegradable polymeric and inorganic materials have been studied extensively to overcome these limitations. Nanoparticles are being investigated as nanocarriers for antimicrobial delivery, antimicrobial coatings for food products, implantable devices, and medicinal materials in dressings and packaging materials due to their intrinsic capacity to overcome microbial resistance. Essential oil-loaded nanoparticles may offer the potential benefits of synergism in antimicrobial activity, high loading capacity, increased solubility, decreased volatility, chemical stability, and enhancement of the bioavailability and shelf life of EOs and their constituents.

The spread of pathogens in wildlife is currently highly related to the transmission of pathogens from farmed animals, which has increased with the constant development of farming. Here, we analysed the spatio-temporal variation in the prevalence of Aleutian mink disease virus (AMDV) antibodies in feral American mink (Neovison vison) populations in Poland (1153 individuals from 9 sites) in relation to mink farming intensity. AMDV was detected in feral mink at all study sites and the prevalence ranged from 0.461 in the northern region to 0.826 in the western region. Mink males and adults were infected more often than females and subadults; the infection was also more frequent during the mink breeding season than during non-breeding. The prevalence of AMDV changed nonlinearly in consecutive years and the peak of prevalence was every 3-4 years. The predicted AMDV prevalence was low at sites where the number of farmed mink was also low and increased linearly with the increase in the number of mink kept on farms. The predicted AMDV prevalence at sites with low mink farming intensity strongly varied between years, whereas at sites with high mink farming intensity, the predicted prevalence did not change significantly. AMDV infection affected the mink's body condition and caused an increase in the size of the spleen, liver, and kidneys. This study shows that Aleutian mink disease strongly affects feral mink but the spatio-temporal variation of its prevalence is complex and partly related to the transmission of the virus from farmed mink to feral populations.

METHODS: The COVID-19 Health Information Survey (CoVHIns), using telephonic (n=500) and web-based surveys (n=1001), was conducted among adults in Hong Kong in April 2020. The Chinese eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS; score range 8-40) was used to measure eHealth literacy. COVID-19 preventive behaviors included wearing surgical masks, wearing fabric masks, washing hands, social distancing, and adding water or bleach to the household drainage system. Adjusted beta coefficients and the slope indices of inequality for the eHEALS score by socioeconomic status, adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for seeking of web-based information on COVID-19 by socioeconomic status, and aORs for the high adherence to preventive behaviors by the eHEALS score and seeking of web-based information on COVID-19 were calculated. RESULTS: The mean eHEALS score was 26.10 (SD 7.70). Age was inversely associated with the eHEALS score, but education and personal income were positively associated with the eHEALS score and seeking of web-based information on COVID-19 (for all, P for trend<.05).

Viruses exist in complex microbial environments, and recent studies have revealed both synergistic and antagonistic effects of specific bacterial taxa on viral prevalence and infectivity. We set out to test whether specific bacterial communities predict SARS-CoV-2 occurrence in a hospital setting. METHODS: We collected 972 samples from hospitalized patients with COVID-19, their health care providers, and hospital surfaces before, during, and after admission. We screened for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR, characterized microbial communities using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and used these bacterial profiles to classify SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection with a random forest model. RESULTS: Sixteen percent of surfaces from COVID-19 patient rooms had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA, although infectivity was not assessed. The highest prevalence was in floor samples next to patient beds (39%) and directly outside their rooms (29%). Although bed rail samples more closely resembled the patient microbiome compared to floor samples, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected less often in bed rail samples (11%). SARS-CoV-2 positive samples had higher bacterial phylogenetic diversity in both human and surface samples and higher biomass in floor samples. 16S microbial community profiles enabled high classifier accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 status in not only nares, but also forehead, stool, and floor samples. Across these distinct microbial profiles, a single amplicon sequence variant from the genus Rothia strongly predicted SARS-CoV-2 presence across sample types, with greater prevalence in positive surface and human samples, even when compared to samples from patients in other intensive care units prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: These results contextualize the vast diversity of microbial niches where SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected and identify specific bacterial taxa that associate with the viral RNA prevalence both in the host and hospital environment.

Comparison was made with data from the prewar calendar year. Six months into the war, only 30% of hospitals, 17% of health centres, 11.5% of ambulances and none of the 712 health posts were functional. As of June 2021, the population in need of emergency food assistance in Tigray increased from less than one million to over 5.2 million.

Initially patients appeared to have a respiratory limited disease but there are now increasing reports of multiple organ involvement including renal disease in association with COVID-19. We studied the development and outcomes of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19, in a large multicultural city hospital trust in the UK, to better understand the role renal disease has in the disease process. METHODS: This was a retrospective review using electronic records and laboratory data of adult patients admitted to the four Manchester University Foundation Trust Hospitals between March 10 and April 30 2020 with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Records were reviewed for baseline characteristics, medications, comorbidities, social deprivation index, observations, biochemistry and outcomes including mortality, admission to critical care, mechanical ventilation and the need for renal replacement therapy. RESULTS: There were 1032 patients included in the study of whom 210 (20.3%) had AKI in association with the diagnosis of COVID-19. The overall mortality with AKI was considerably higher at 52.4% compared to 26.3% without AKI (p-value <0.001). More patients with AKI required escalation to critical care (34.8% vs 11.2%, p-value <0.001). Following admission to critical care those with AKI were more likely to die (54.8% vs 25.0%, p-value <0.001) and more likely to require mechanical ventilation (86.3% vs 66.3%, p-value 0.006). DISCUSSION: We have shown that the development of AKI is associated with dramatically worse outcomes for patients, in both mortality and the requirement for critical care. Patients with COVID-19 presenting with, or at risk of AKI should be closely monitored and appropriately managed to prevent any decline in renal function, given the significant risk of deterioration and death.","output":"Characteristics and outcomes of hospitalised patients with acute kidney injury and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pericardial effusion is rare in pediatric patients and is characterized by a variable clinical presentation.

METHODS: The levels of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs were determined by flow cytometry in 27 COVID-19 patients, and their association with clinical characteristics and laboratory data were analyzed. RESULTS: The frequency of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs was elevated in COVID-19 patients, particularly severe patients. A follow-up comparison revealed a decline of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs percentages in most patients 1 day after testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, but the levels of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs were still greater than 50.0% in 3 ICU patients 4-10 days after negative SARS-CoV-2 results.

The space magnetization is justified by the coexistence of up to six disconnected attractors including both chaotic and periodic. The linear augmentation method is successfully applied to control the multistable HNNs into a monostable network. The control of the coexisting four attractors including a pair of chaotic attractors and a pair of periodic attractors is made through three crises that enable the chaotic attractors to be metamorphosed in a monostable periodic attractor. Also, the control of six coexisting attractors (with two pairs of chaotic attractors and a pair of periodic one) is made through five crises enabling all the chaotic attractors to be metamorphosed in a monostable periodic attractor. Note that this controlled HNN is obtained for higher values of the coupling strength. These interesting results are obtained using nonlinear analysis tools such as the phase portraits, bifurcations diagrams, graph of maximum Lyapunov exponent, and basins of attraction. The obtained results have been perfectly supported using the PSPICE simulation environment. Finally, a simple encryption scheme is designed jointly using the sequences of the proposed HNNs and the sequences of real/imaginary values of the Julia fractals set.

Uptake of vaccination is critical for controlling the pandemic. Nevertheless, vaccination hesitancy is considerable, requiring policies to promote uptake. We investigate Dutch citizens preferences for policies that aim to promote vaccination through facilitating choice of vaccination, profiling it as the norm, making vaccination more attractive through rewards, or punishing people who reject vaccination. Methods We conducted a discrete choice experiment in which 747 respondents were asked to choose between policies to promote vaccination uptake and their impacts on the number of deaths, people with permanent health problems, households with income loss, and a tax increase. Results Respondents generally had a negative preference for policies that promote vaccination. They particularly disliked policies that punish those who reject the vaccine and were more favorable toward policies that reward vaccination, such as awarding additional rights to vaccinated individuals through vaccination passports. Respondents who reject vaccination were in general much more negative about the policy options than respondents who consider accepting the vaccine. Nevertheless, vaccination passports are supported by both respondents who accept the vaccine, those who reject vaccination, and those who are unsure about vaccination. Conclusions This study provides concrete directions for governments attempting to increase the vaccination uptake in ways that are supported by the public. Our results could encourage policy makers to focus on policy options that make vaccination easier and reward people who take the vaccine, as especially the implementation of vaccination passports was supported.","output":"Public Preferences for Policies to Promote COVID-19 Vaccination Uptake: A Discrete Choice Experiment in The Netherlands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED Continuous emission of unipolar ions has been shown to improve the performance of respirators and stationary filters challenged with non-biological particles. In this study, we investigated the ion-induced enhancement effect while challenging a low-efficiency heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) filter with viable bacterial cells, bacterial and fungal spores, and viruses. The aerosol concentration was measured in real time. Samples were also collected with a bioaerosol sampler for viable microbial analysis. The removal efficiency of the filter was determined, respectively, with and without an ion emitter. The ionization was found to significantly enhance the filter efficiency in removing viable biological particles from the airflow. For example, when challenged with viable bacteria, the filter efficiency increased as much as four- to fivefold. For viable fungal spores, the ion-induced enhancement improved the efficiency by a factor of approximately 2. When testing with virus-carrying liquid droplets, the original removal efficiency provided by the filter was rather low: 9.09 +/- 4.84%. While the ion emission increased collection about fourfold, the efficiency did not reach 75-100% observed with bacteria and fungi. These findings, together with our previously published results for non-biological particles, demonstrate the feasibility of a new approach for reducing aerosol particles in HVAC systems used for indoor air quality control. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS Recirculated air in HVAC systems used for indoor air quality control in buildings often contains considerable number of viable bioaerosol particles because of limited efficiency of the filters installed in these systems. In the present study, we investigated - using aerosolized bacterial cells, bacterial and fungal spores, and virus-carrying particles - a novel idea of enhancing the performance of a low-efficiency HVAC filter utilizing continuous emission of unipolar ions in the filter vicinity.

Nevertheless, no conclusions have been drawn about which type of indirect laryngoscope is most effective for tracheal intubation. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether the Airtraq? or the GlideScope? is more effective for tracheal intubation. METHODS We extracted studies of adult prospective randomized trials comparing tracheal intubation between the Airtraq and GlideScope. An electronic database was used to extract the studies included in our meta-analysis. We extracted the following data from the identified studies: success rate, glottic visualization, and intubation time. Data from each trial were combined via a random-effects model for calculation of pooled relative risk (RR) or weighted mean difference (WMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We also performed trial sequential analysis. RESULTS We included eight trials comprising 571 patients for review. Compared with the GlideScope, Airtraq did not improve success rate, glottic visualization, or intubation time in tracheal intubation (success rate: RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.05; P = 0.58; I2 = 65%; glottic visualization: RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.29; P = 0.69; I2 = 64%; and intubation time: WMD, 1.4 seconds ; 95% CI, -6.2 to 9.1; P = 0.72; I2 = 96%).

It is not known how such a formation of atelectasis is related to transpulmonary pressure (PL ) during weaning from mechanical ventilation when the spontaneous breathing effort is increased. If the relation between PL and atelectasis were known, monitoring of PL might help to avoid formation of atelectasis and cyclic collapse during weaning. The main purpose of this study was to determine the relation between PL and atelectasis in an experimental model representing weaning from mechanical ventilation. METHODS Dynamic transverse computed tomography scans were acquired in ten anaesthetized, surfactant-depleted pigs with preserved spontaneous breathing, as ventilator support was lowered by sequentially reducing inspiratory pressure and positive end expiratory pressure in steps. The volumes of gas and atelectasis in the lungs were correlated with PL obtained using oesophageal pressure recordings. Work of breathing (WOB) was assessed from Campbell diagrams. RESULTS Gradual decrease in PL in both end-expiration and end-inspiration caused a proportional increase in atelectasis and decrease in the gas content (linear mixed model with an autoregressive correlation matrix; P < 0.001) as the WOB increased. However, cyclic alveolar collapse during tidal ventilation did not increase significantly. CONCLUSION We found a proportional correlation between atelectasis and PL during the 'weaning process' in experimental mild lung injury.

There is an urgent need for new treatment approaches for this difficult cancer. METHODS: We previously established an original cell line, HSC-60, from a scirrhous gastric cancer patient and isolated a peritoneal-metastatic cell line, 60As6, in nude mice following orthotopic inoculations. In the present study, we focused on the expression of long noncoding ribonucleic acid (RNA) (lncRNA) in the cell lines and investigated the mechanism on peritoneal dissemination. RESULTS: We demonstrated that an lncRNA, HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR), is expressed significantly more highly in 60As6 than HSC-60 cells. Then, using both HOTAIR knockdown and overexpression experiments, we showed that high-level expression of HOTAIR promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in 60As6 cells. By luciferase assay, we found that HOTAIR directly targets and binds to miR-217, and that miR-217 directly binds to Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1). The knockdown of HOTAIR in 60As6 cells significantly reduced the invasion activity and peritoneal dissemination - and significantly prolonged the survival - in the orthotopic tumor mouse model.

The evaluation of the Communities in Charge of Alcohol (CICA) programme offers policymakers, Licensing authorities and public health practitioners, evidence regarding a specific volunteer-led, place-based approach, designed to enable community engagement in licensing with the aim of reducing localised alcohol harm. This study explored factors affecting the sustainable involvement of volunteers in alcohol licensing decision-making from six licensing officers' perspectives, through semi-structured interviews. Routinely collected crime, disorder, and hospital admissions data were reviewed for further context as proxy indicators for alcohol-related harm. Licensing officers perceived sustainable engagement to be impacted by: (i) the extent of alignment with statutory requirements and local political support; (ii) the ability of licensing officers to operationalise CICA and support local assets, and; (iii) the opportunity for, and ability of, volunteers to raise licensing issues. The perspectives of licensing officers indicate complexities inherent in seeking to empower residents to engage in licensing decision-making at a community level. These relate to statutory and political factors, funding, social norms regarding engagement in licensing decision-making, and the need for networks between critical actors including responsible authorities and communities. The evidence indicates that after increasing community capacity to influence alcohol availability decision-making at a local level, communities continue to struggle to influence statutory processes to affect alcohol availability where they live and work.

Uncarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) may participate in the regulation of glucose metabolism, thus measurement of ucOC could be useful in evaluating interactions between bone and glucose metabolism. We developed recombinant antibodies and immunoassay to specifically detect ucOC in human blood samples. ucOC-specific recombinant antibodies were selected from an antibody library by phage display. Four candidates were characterized, and one (Fab-AP13) was used to set up an immunoassay with a pre-existing MAb. Plasma ucOC levels were measured in subjects with normal fasting blood glucose (&#8804; 6 mmol/l, N = 46) or with hyperglycemia (&#8805; 7 mmol/l, N = 29). Further, we analyzed ucOC in age- and gender-matched patients with diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D, N = 49). Antibodies recognized ucOC without cross-reaction to carboxylated osteocalcin. Antibodies had unique binding sites at the carboxylation region, with Glu17 included in all epitopes. Immunoassay was set up and characterized. Immunoassay detected ucOC in serum and plasma, with on average 1.6-fold higher levels in plasma. ucOC concentrations were significantly lower in subjects with hyperglycemia (median 0.58 ng/ml, p = 0.008) or with T2D diagnosis (0.68 ng/ml, p = 0.015) than in subjects with normal blood glucose (1.01 ng/ml). ucOC negatively correlated with fasting plasma glucose in subjects without T2D (r = - 0.24, p = 0.035) but not in T2D patients (p = 0.41). Our immunoassay, based on the novel recombinant antibody, allows for specific and sensitive detection of ucOC in human circulation.

We also analyzed the polymorphic interaction between spike protein and human ACE2 (hACE2). Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is probably originated from a recombination event on the spike protein between a bat coronavirus and a pangolin coronavirus that endows it humans infectivity. Compared with other regions in the S gene of SARS-CoV-2, the direct-binding sites of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) is more conserved. We focused on 3,860 amino acid mutations in spike protein RBD (T333-C525) of SARS-CoV-2 and simulated their differential stability and binding affinity to hACE2 (S19-D615).

Objective: To compare seroconversion in children and adults with non-hospitalized (mild) SARS-CoV-2 infection and to understand the factors that influence this. Design: Participants were part of a household cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Weekly nasopharyngeal/throat swabs and blood samples were collected during the acute and convalescent period following PCR diagnosis for analysis. Setting: Participants were recruited at the Royal Childrens Hospital, Melbourne, Australia between May and October 2020. Participants: Those who had a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive nasal/throat swab. Main outcomes and measures: SARS-CoV-2 antibody and cellular responses in children and adults. Seroconversion was defined by seropositivity in all three serological assays. Results: Among 108 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive participants, 57 were children (median age: 4, IQR 2-10) and 51 were adults (median age: 37, IQR 34-45). Using three established serological assays, a lower proportion of children seroconverted compared with adults [20/54 69 (37.0%) vs 32/42 (76.2%); (p<0.001)]. This was not related to viral load, which was similar in children and adults [mean Ct 28.58 (SD: 6.83) vs 24.14 (SD: 8.47)]. Age and sex also did not influence seroconversion or the magnitude of antibody response within children or adults. Notably, in adults (but not children) symptomatic adults had three-fold higher antibody levels than asymptomatic adults (median 227.5 IU/mL, IQR 133.7-521.6 vs median 75.3 IU/mL, IQR 36.9-113.6). Evidence of cellular immunity was observed in adults who seroconverted but not in children who seroconverted. Conclusion and Relevance: In this non-hospitalized cohort with mild COVID-19, children were less likely to seroconvert than adults despite similar viral loads. This has implications for future protection following COVID-19 infection in children and for interpretation of serosurveys that involve children.

However, compliance with exercise recommendations and the effect of exercise volume on symptom recovery require further investigation. PURPOSE To examine (1) if an 8-week aerobic exercise prescription, provided within 2 weeks of concussion, affects symptom severity or exercise volume; (2) whether prescription adherence, rather than randomized group assignment, reflects the actual effect of aerobic exercise in postconcussion recovery; and (3) the optimal volume of exercise associated with symptom resolution after 1 month of study. STUDY DESIGN Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS Individuals randomized to an exercise intervention (n = 17; mean age, 17.2  2.0 years; 41% female; initially tested a mean of 11.3  2.8 days after injury) or standard of care (n = 20; mean age, 16.8  2.2 years; 50% female; initially tested a mean of 10.7  3.2 days after injury) completed an aerobic exercise test within 14 days of injury. They returned for assessments 1 month and 2 months after the initial visit. The aerobic exercise group was instructed to exercise 5 d/wk, 20 min/d (100 min/wk), at a target heart rate based on an exercise test at the initial visit. Participants reported their exercise volume each week over the 8-week study period and reported symptoms at each study visit (initial, 1 month, 2 months). Because of low compliance in both groups, there was no difference in the volume of exercise between the 2 groups. RESULTS There were no significant symptom severity differences between the intervention and standard-of-care groups at the initial (median Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory, 15 [interquartile range = 10, 42] vs 20 [11, 35.5]; P = .26), 1-month (4 [0, 28] vs 5.5 [0.5, 21.5]; P = .96), or 2-month (6.5 [0, 27.5] vs 0 [0, 4]; P = .11) study visits. Exercise volume was similar between groups (median, 115 [54, 225] vs 88 [28, 230] min/wk for exercise intervention vs standard of care; P = .52). Regardless of group, those who exercised <100 min/wk reported significantly higher symptom severity at the 1-month evaluation compared with those who exercised 100 min/wk (median, 1.5 [0, 7.5] vs 12 [4, 28]; P = .03). Exercising 160 min/wk successfully discriminated between those with and those without symptoms 1 month after study commencement (classification accuracy, 81%; sensitivity, 90%; specificity, 78%). CONCLUSION Greater exercise volume was associated with lower symptom burden after 1 month of study, and an exercise volume >160 min/wk in the first month of the study was the threshold associated with symptom resolution after the first month of the study. Because our observation on the association between exercise volume and symptom level is a retrospective and secondary outcome, it is possible that participants who were feeling better were more likely to exercise more, rather than the exercise itself driving the reduction in symptom severity.","output":"Influence of Aerobic Exercise Volume on Postconcussion Symptoms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common type of malignant brain tumor, among which IDH1-wild type GBM has a poor prognosis. Recent studies have shown that ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) are correlated with the development and progression of cancer. In GBM, the role of FRGs associated with IDH1 status as biological indicators and therapeutic targets remains to be clarified. Ten of FRGs (STEAP3, HSPB1, MAP1LC3A, SOCS1, LOX, CAPG, CP, GDF15, CDKN1A, and CD44) associated with IDH1 status in GBM were identified as key genes through screening by survival analysis and Random Forest using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets, and the protein expressions of key genes were verified. Transwell and qPCR results showed that ferroptosis promoted the migration of glioblastoma cells and affected the expression of key genes. Our study established the ferroptosis-related prognostic model for GBM patients based on ten key genes by a different modeling method from previous study, the GSVA algorithm. Further, we took the methods of functional enrichment analysis, clinical characteristics, immune cell infiltration, immunomodulator, ESTIMATE and single nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis to study the molecular mechanisms of prognostic model and key genes. The results showed that ten key genes were strongly associated with immune-related factors and were significantly involved in the p53 signaling pathway, senescence and autophagy in cancer, and in the negative regulation of protein kinase activity. Moreover, potential therapeutic drugs were identified by Virtual Screening and Molecular Docking.

However, dexamethasone has the potential to increase blood glucose levels postoperatively, which is a known risk factor for complications after total joint arthroplasty. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of dexamethasone administration on post-operative blood glucose levels in diabetic patients after primary hip and knee arthroplasty. Methods This study was a retrospective review of 238 diabetic patients who underwent primary hip and knee arthroplasty between May 1, 2014 and September 30, 2016 at a single urban academic medical center. A total of 77 patients (32.4%) received dexamethasone and 161 (67.7%) did not. Oral hyperglycemic agents were held during the inpatient stay and blood glucose was controlled either with sliding scale insulin or home insulin regimens were continued. All analyses were adjusted for age, BMI, gender, type of diabetes, pre-operative diabetic medication, type of surgical procedure, and pre-operative HgbA1c level. The primary outcome was post-operative hyperglycemia within 72 h of surgery defined as any blood glucose level greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL. Results Post-operative hyperglycemia was observed in 17.1 and 20.6% of the measurements during the first 24 and 72 h respectively. After controlling for confounding variables, patients who received dexamethasone had 4.07 (95% CI: 2.46, 6.72) and 3.08 (95% CI: 2.34, 4.04) higher odds of post-operative hyperglycemia in the first 24 and 72 h respectively. Conclusions Dexamethasone administration in diabetic patients undergoing primary arthroplasty increases post-operative hyperglycemia during the first 24 and 72 h. While our data did not investigate causation, dexamethasone use in this patient population should be thoughtfully considered, as post-operative hyperglycemia is a known risk factor for complications.","output":"Dexamethasone and postoperative hyperglycemia in diabetics undergoing elective hip or knee arthroplasty: a case control study in 238 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a human eye disease that affects people who are suffering from diabetes. It causes damage to their eyes, including vision loss. It is treatable; however, it takes a long time to diagnose and may require many eye exams. Early detection of DR may prevent or delay the vision loss. Therefore, a robust, automatic and computer-based diagnosis of DR is essential. Currently, deep neural networks are being utilized in numerous medical areas to diagnose various diseases. Consequently, deep transfer learning is utilized in this article. We employ five convolutional-neural-network-based designs (AlexNet, GoogleNet, Inception V4, Inception ResNet V2 and ResNeXt-50). A collection of DR pictures is created. Subsequently, the created collections are labeled with an appropriate treatment approach. This automates the diagnosis and assists patients through subsequent therapies. Furthermore, in order to identify the severity of DR retina pictures, we use our own dataset to train deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Experimental results reveal that the pre-trained model Se-ResNeXt-50 obtains the best classification accuracy of 97.53% for our dataset out of all pre-trained models.

While identification and containment of new cases remains important, laboratories must now pivot and consider assessment of SARS-CoV-2 immunity in the setting of the recent availability of multiple COVID-19 vaccines. Here we have utilized the latest Abbott Alinity semi-quantitative IgM and quantitative IgG spike protein (SP) serology assays (IgMSP and IgGSP) in combination with Abbott Alinity IgG nucleocapsid (NC) antibody test (IgGNC) to assess antibody responses in a cohort of 1236 unique participants comprised of naive, SARS-CoV-2 infected, and vaccinated (including both naive and recovered) individuals. The IgMSP and IgGSP assays were highly specific (100%) with no cross-reactivity to archived samples recovered prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, including those from individuals with seasonal coronavirus infections. Clinical sensitivity was 96% after 15 days for both IgMSP and IgGSP assays individually. When considered together, the sensitivity was 100%. A combination of NC- and SP-specific serologic assays clearly differentiated naive, SARS-CoV-2-infected, and vaccine-related immune responses. Vaccination resulted in a significant increase in IgGSP and IgMSP titers, with a major rise in IgGSP following the booster (second) dose in the naive group. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals had several fold higher IgGSP responses than naive following the primary dose, with a comparatively dampened response following the booster.

AIMS: To assess the prevalence of APE in patients hospitalized for non-critical COVID-19 who presented clinical deterioration, and to investigate the association of clinical and biochemical variables with a confirmed diagnosis of APE in these subjects. METHODS: All consecutive patients admitted to the internal medicine department of a general hospital with a diagnosis of non-critical COVID-19, who performed a Computer Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) for respiratory deterioration in April 2020, were included in this retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: Study populations: 41 subjects, median(IRQ)age:71.7(63-76)years, CPTA confirmed APE=8(19.51%,CI95%:8.82%-34.87%). Among patients with and without APE, no significant differences were found with regards symptoms, comorbidities, treatment, Wells score and outcomes. The optimal cut-off value of D-dimer for predicting APE was 2454 ng/mL, sensitivity(CI95%):63(24-91), specificity:73(54-87), Positive Predictive Value:36(13-65), Negative Predictive Value: 89(71-98) and AUC:0.62(0.38-0.85). The standard and age-adjusted D-dimer cut-offs, and the Wells score >2 did not associate with confirmed APE, albeit a cut-off value of D-dimer=2454 ng/mL showed an RR:3.21;CI95%:0.92-13.97;p=0.073. Heparin at anticoagulant doses was used in 70.73% of patients before performing CTPA. CONCLUSION: Among patients presenting pulmonary deterioration after hospitalization for non-critical COVID-19, the prevalence of APE is high. Traditional diagnostic tools to identify high APE pre-test probability patients do not seem to be clinically useful. These results support the use of a high index of suspicion for performing CTPA to exclude or confirm APE as the most appropriate diagnostic approach in this clinical setting.

METHODS A retrospective cohort study on laboratory-confirmed, adult influenza patients hospitalized in 2004 and 2005 was conducted. For all influenza cases during that period, immunofluorescence assay on nasopharyngeal aspirate was used for rapid diagnosis, and oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily for 5 days) prescribed if the patient presented within 2 days of symptom onset. Independent factors associated with time to discharge were identified using Cox proportional hazards models. An adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) >1 signifies a higher chance of early discharge. Viral shedding and influenza vaccination history were studied during one 'flu' season. RESULTS A total of 356 patients (influenza A 93.5%) were studied. The majority of patients were old (70.2 +/- 8.4 years), had > or = 1 comorbid illness (69.1%) and developed respiratory or cardiovascular complications (69.4%). Oseltamivir initiated within 2 days of illness was associated with shorter total LOS (Kaplan-Meier estimated median 4 versus 6 days [-33%]; aHR for discharge 1.54, 95% confidence intervals [95% CI] 1.23-1.92, P < 0.0001). Older age (> or = 70 years), comorbidities and complications were associated with prolonged LOS. Prolonged viral RNA detection >day 4 of illness (23 out of 99 consecutive patients) was also independently associated with longer LOS (aHR 0.36 [95% CI 0.19-0.71], P = 0.003), whereas influenza vaccination within 6 months was associated with shorter LOS (aHR 2.14 [95% CI 1.18-3.85], P = 0.012).

Although numerous mHealth interventions are available, very few have been developed following an evidence-based rationale or have been tested for efficacy. This article describes the systematic development of a coach-supported mHealth application to improve healthy lifestyles for the prevention of dementia and cardiovascular disease in the United Kingdom (UK) and China. Methods: Development of the Prevention of Dementia by Mobile Phone applications (PRODEMOS) platform built upon the experiences with the Healthy Aging Through Internet Counseling in the Elderly (HATICE) eHealth platform. In the conceptualization phase, experiences from the HATICE trial and needs and wishes of the PRODEMOS target population were assessed through semi-structured interviews and focus group sessions. Initial technical development of the platform was based on these findings and took place in consecutive sprint sessions. Finally, during the evaluation and adaptation phase, functionality and usability of the platform were evaluated during pilot studies in UK and China. Results: The PRODEMOS mHealth platform facilitates self-management of a healthy lifestyle by goal setting, progress monitoring, and educational materials on healthy lifestyles. Participants receive remote coaching through a chat functionality. Based on lessons learned from the HATICE study and end-users, we made the intervention easy-to-use and included features to personalize the intervention. Following the pilot studies, in which in total 77 people used the mobile application for 6 weeks, the application was made more intuitive, and we improved its functionalities. Conclusion: Early involvement of end-users in the development process and during evaluation phases improved acceptability of the mHealth intervention.

Outcomes after mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for large vessel occlusion in patients with COVID-19 are substantially unknown. Our aim was to study early outcomes after MT in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Multicenter, European, cohort study involving 34 stroke centers in France, Italy, Spain, and Belgium. Data were collected between March 1, 2020 and May 5, 2020. Consecutive laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases with large vessel occlusion, who were treated with MT, were included. Primary investigated outcome: 30-day mortality. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: early neurological improvement (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale improvement &#8805;8 points or 24 hours National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 0-1), successful reperfusion (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction grade &#8805;2b), and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS: We evaluated 93 patients with COVID-19 with large vessel occlusion who underwent MT (median age, 71 years [interquartile range, 59-79]; 63 men [67.7%]). Median pretreatment National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography score were 17 (interquartile range, 11-21) and 8 (interquartile range, 7-9), respectively. Anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke represented 93.5% of cases. The rate modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b to 3 was 79.6% (74 patients [95% CI, 71.3-87.8]). Thirty-day mortality was 29% (27 patients [95% CI, 20-39.4]). Early neurological improvement was 19.5% (17 patients [95% CI, 11.8-29.5]), and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was 5.4% (5 patients [95% CI, 1.7-12.1]). Patients who died at 30 days exhibited significantly lower lymphocyte count, higher levels of aspartate, and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase). After adjustment for age, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography score, and successful reperfusion, these biological markers remained associated with increased odds of 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio of 2.70 [95% CI, 1.21-5.98] per SD-log decrease in lymphocyte count, 2.66 [95% CI, 1.22-5.77] per SD-log increase in aspartate, and 4.30 [95% CI, 1.43-12.91] per SD-log increase in LDH). CONCLUSIONS: The 29% rate of 30-day mortality after MT among patients with COVID-19 is not negligible.

We reviewed the available evidence on the use of ICT-based interventions to address intimate partner violence (IPV), evaluating the effectiveness, acceptability, and suitability of ICT for addressing different aspects of the problem (e.g., awareness, screening, prevention, treatment, mental health). METHODS: We conducted a systematic review, following PRISMA guidelines, using the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Key search terms included women, violence, domestic violence, intimate partner violence, information, communication technology, ICT, technology, email, mobile, phone, digital, ehealth, web, computer, online, and computerized. Only articles written in English were included. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies addressing screening and disclosure, IPV prevention, ICT suitability, support and women's mental health were identified. The evidence reviewed suggests that ICT-based interventions were effective mainly in screening, disclosure, and prevention. However, there is a lack of homogeneity among the studies' outcome measurements and the sample sizes, the control groups used (if any), the type of interventions, and the study recruitment space. Questions addressing safety, equity, and the unintended consequences of the use of ICT in IPV programming are virtually non-existent.

PPP loans were administered by private lenders but federally guaranteed, largely eliminating unobservable credit risk as a factor in explaining differential lending by race. We document that even after controlling for a firms zip code, industry, loan size, PPP approval date, and other characteristics, Black-owned businesses were 12.1 percentage points (70% of the mean) more likely to obtain their PPP loan from a fintech lender than a traditional bank. Among conventional lenders, smaller banks were much less likely to lend to Black-owned firms, while the Top-4 banks exhibited little to no disparity after including controls. We use novel data to show that the disparity is not primarily explained by differences in pre-existing bank or credit relationships, firm financial positions, fintech affinity, or borrower application behavior. In contrast, we document that Black-owned businesses higher rate of borrowing from fintechs compared to smaller banks is particularly large in places with high racial animus, pointing to a potential role for discrimination in explaining some of the racial disparities in small business lending. We find evidence that when small banks automate their lending processes, and thus reduce human involvement in the loan origination process, their rate of PPP lending to Black-owned businesses increases, with larger effects in places with more racial animus.","output":"Racial Disparities in Access to Small Business Credit: Evidence from the Paycheck Protection Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has strained healthcare delivery systems in a number of southern African countries Despite this, it is imperative that malaria control and elimination activities continue, especially to reduce as far as possible the number and rate of hospitalisations caused by malaria The implementation of enhanced malaria control/elimination activities in the context of COVID-19 requires measures to protect healthcare workers and the communities they serve The aim of this review is therefore to present innovative ideas for the timely implementation of malaria control without increasing the risk of COVID-19 to healthcare workers and communities Specific recommendations for parasite and vector surveillance, diagnosis, case management, mosquito vector control and community outreach and sensitisation are given","output":"Implementing malaria control in South Africa, Eswatini and southern Mozambique during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: After the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in Korea, prediction of pneumonia development and progression to respiratory failure was emphasized in control of MERS outbreak. METHODS: MERS-CoV infected patients who were managed in a tertiary care center during the 2015 Korean MERS outbreak were reviewed. To analyze predictive factors for pneumonia development and progression to respiratory failure, we evaluated clinical variables measured within three days from symptom onset. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients were included in the study: 13 patients (28.9%) did not develop pneumonia, 19 developed pneumonia without respiratory failure (42.2%), and 13 progressed to respiratory failures (28.9%). The identified predictive factors for pneumonia development included age 45 years, fever 37.5 C, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, CRP  2 mg/dL, and a threshold cycle value of PCR less than 28.5. For respiratory failure, the indicators included male, hypertension, low albumin concentration, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and CRP  4 mg/dL (all P < 0.05). With  two predictive factors for pneumonia development, 100% of patients developed pneumonia. Patients lacking the predictive factors did not progress to respiratory failure.

METHODS: The study included 133 patients with COVID-19 admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) at an urban academic quaternary-care center between March 10 and April 8, 2020. Patients were categorized based on the presence or absence of DM and early-onset hyperglycemia (EHG), defined as a blood glucose >180 mg/dL during the first 2 days after ICU admission. The primary outcome was 14-day all-cause in-hospital mortality; also examined were 60-day all-cause in-hospital mortality and the levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, procalcitonin, and lactate. RESULTS: Compared to non-DM patients without EHG, non-DM patients with EHG exhibited higher adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality at 14 days (HR 7.51, CI 1.70-33.24) and 60 days (HR 6.97, CI 1.86-26.13). Non-DM patients with EHG also featured higher levels of median C-reactive protein (306.3 mg/L, P = .036), procalcitonin (1.26 ng/mL, P = .028), and lactate (2.2 mmol/L, P = .023). CONCLUSION: Among critically ill COVID-19 patients, those without DM with EHG were at greatest risk of 14-day and 60-day in-hospital mortality. Our study was limited by its retrospective design and relatively small cohort.

Methods We analyzed confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases and their chains of contact using a nation-wide registry from March 28, 2020 to January 13, 2021. To estimate the effect of contact tracing on fatality we adjusted a multilevel negative binomial model using as outcome variable the number of deaths and off-set variable the number of people within a chain of contacts. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using different cut-off values of contacts traced and a logistic model for the effect of contact tracing on death at individual level. Results We analyzed 1,4 million cases, 542 936 chains of contact, and 46 087 deaths. Only 5,8% of total cases and contacts were included in a chain of a case and five or more contacts. We found that tracing of at least five contacts per case reduce fatality by 48% (95% CI: 45-51) and, at the current levels of tracing in Colombia, it prevents 1.8% of deaths. Results obtained from the sensitivity analysis were consistent with the reduction of fatality at individual level and higher protective effect with higher number of contacts traced.

We remedy this shortcoming by training with both synthetic images, along with their associated labels, and unlabeled real images. To this end, we force our network to learn perspective-aware features by training it to recognize upside-down real images from regular ones and incorporate into it the ability to predict its own uncertainty so that it can generate useful pseudo labels for fine-tuning purposes.

These represent prototypical tumor suppressor syndromes where loss of a tumor suppressor gene-protein impairs the cell's ability to regulate cell proliferation. While clinical manifestations vary widely for each of these syndromes, tumors arising in the peripheral nerve sheath are a unifying feature. Clinical clues should prompt the clinician to recognize the underlying genetic syndrome and screen for associated tumors including, among others, plexiform neurofibromas and gliomas in NF1 and vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, and spinal ependymomas in NF2. Improvements in mechanistic understanding of how the genetic mutations that underlie these syndromes contribute to tumor formation have led to new advances in targeted therapies. MEK inhibitors have shown promise for treating progressive plexiform neurofibromas in NF1. Bevacizumab has been shown to improve hearing and treat vestibular schwannomas in NF2. This article reviews the currently available data on management of tumors associated with these three syndromes.","output":"Available Therapies for Patients with Neurofibromatosis-Related Nervous System Tumors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined the efficacy of exercise programs for individuals with intellectual disability (ID) based on experimental designs.

Understanding factors associated with depressive symptoms and anxiety across 12 months of the pandemic can help identify groups at higher risk and psychological processes that can be targeted to mitigate the long-term mental health impact of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine sociodemographic features, COVID-19-specific factors, and general psychological variables associated with depressive symptoms and anxiety over 12 months of the pandemic. METHODS: Nationwide, cross-sectional electronic surveys were implemented in May (n=14,636), July (n=14,936), October (n=14,946), and December (n=15,265) 2020 and March/April 2021 (n=14,557) in the United States. Survey results were weighted to be representative of the US population. The samples were drawn from a market research platform, with a 69% cooperation rate. Surveys assessed depressive symptoms in the past 2 weeks and anxiety in the past week, as well as sociodemographic features; COVID-19 restriction stress, worry, perceived risk, coping strategies, and exposure; intolerance of uncertainty; and loneliness. RESULTS: Across 12 months, an average of 24% of respondents reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms and 32% reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Of the sociodemographic variables, age was most consistently associated with depressive symptoms and anxiety, with younger adults more likely to report higher levels of those outcomes. Intolerance of uncertainty and loneliness were consistently and strongly associated with the outcomes. Of the COVID-19-specific variables, stress from COVID-19 restrictions, worry about COVID-19, coping behaviors, and having COVID-19 were associated with a higher likelihood of depressive symptoms and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms and anxiety were high in younger adults, adults who reported restriction stress or worry about COVID-19 or who had had COVID-19, and those with intolerance of uncertainty and loneliness. Symptom monitoring as well as early and accessible intervention are recommended.","output":"Depressive Symptoms and Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Large, Longitudinal, Cross-sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To support the implementation of nurse-led interventions in long-term dementia care, in-depth knowledge of specific supporting factors and barriers is required. Conditions and structures of caring for people with dementia differ widely, depending on the country and the care context. Our study aimed to describe the experiences and opinions of nursing experts and managers with regard to facilitators and barriers to the implementation of nurse-led interventions in Swiss long-term dementia care. Methods: We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using individual interviews based on qualitative vignettes as a useful stimulus to generate narrations allowing to study peoples perceptions and beliefs. The study took place in nursing homes in the German-speaking part of Switzerland and in the Principality of Liechtenstein using purposive sampling. We intended to conduct the interviews face-to-face in a quiet room according to the participants choice. However, due to the lockdown of nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020, we performed interviews face-to-face and by video. We analysed data thematically following Braun and Clarke to achieve a detailed, nuanced description. To verify our interpretation and to ensure congruence with participants perspectives, we conducted member checks. The Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) served to structure our manuscript. Results: Six dyads of nursing home managers and nursing experts from six nursing homes took part in our study (n=12). Our thematic analysis yielded seven themes reflecting facilitators and barriers to implementing nurse-led interventions in Swiss long-term dementia care: ?A common attitude and cohesion within the organization?, ?Commitment on several levels?, ?A needs-oriented implementation?, ?The effect and the public perception of the intervention?, ?A structured and guided implementation process?, ?Supporting knowledge and competencies?, as well as ?Resources for implementing the intervention?. Conclusions: Successful implementation of nurse-led interventions in dementia care is highly challenging due to the complex nature of interventions. Therefore, it is important to know the facilitators and barriers to optimally design implementation strategies. Our results might support researchers and other key persons involved in implementing nurse-led interventions in Swiss long-term dementia care.","output":"What Facilitates and Hinders the Implementation of Nurse-Led Interventions in Long-Term Dementia Care?

We applied restrictive measures for the access of patients in our department from 15/2/2020 after several cases of unclear fever. Visitors were not allowed to stay in the ward. RESULTS In the first period of lockdown, from March to June 2020, in our Region, biomolecular test was indicated only for symptomatic people. We organized the hospitalization with a sealed compartment system (that we defined \\"boing system\\") in which the patient stationed in an 'isolation room' for at least 48 hours upon the entry.

Using the most recent report from National Records Scotland (NRS) on 29 April 2020, we examined the percentage difference in crude numbers of deaths in 2020 compared to the average for 2015-2019 by week of death within calendar year. To determine if trends were similar, suggesting underreporting/underdiagnosed COVID-19 related deaths, we also looked at the trends in % differences for cardiovascular disease deaths. From the first 17 weeks' of data, we found a peak in excess deaths between weeks 14 of 2020, about four weeks after the first case in Scotland was detected on 1 March 2020-- but by week 17 these excesses had diminished around the time lockdown in the UK began. Similar observations were seen for cardiovascular disease-related deaths. These observations suggest that the short-term increase in excess cancer and cardiovascular deaths might be associated with undetected/unconfirmed deaths related to COVID-19. Both of these conditions make patients more susceptible to infection and lack of widespread access to testing for COVID-19 are likely to have resulted in under-estimation of COVID-19 mortality. These data further suggest that the cumulative toll of COVID-19 on mortality is likely undercounted. More detailed analysis is needed to determine if these excesses were directly or indirectly related to COVID-19. Disease specific mortality will need constant monitoring for the foreseeable future as changes occur in increasing capacity and access to testing, reporting criteria, changes to health services and different measures are implemented to control the spread of the COVID-19.

However, comparatively little is known about how private living situations shaped individuals experiences of this crisis. To investigate this issue, we analyze how experiences and concerns vary across living arrangements along two dimensions that may be associated with social disadvantage: loneliness and care. In doing so, we employ quantitative text analysis on open-ended questions from survey data on a sample of 1,073 individuals living in Germany. We focus our analyses on four different household structures: living alone, shared living without children, living with a partner and children, and single parents. We find that single parents (who are primarily single mothers) are at high risk of experiencing care-related worries, particularly regarding their financial situation, while individuals living alone are most likely to report feelings of loneliness. Those individuals living in shared houses, with or without children, had the lowest risk of experiencing both loneliness and care-related worries. These findings illustrate that the living situation at home substantially impacts how individuals experienced and coped with the pandemic situation during the first wave of the pandemic.","output":"My Home is my Castle?

Design Cohort study using Minimum Data Set and electronic health record data from a large multi-state long-term care provider. Primary outcomes included testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the post-acute SNF stay, and death among those who tested positive. Setting and Participants The sample included all new admissions to the providers 286 SNFs between January 1 and December 31, 2020. Patients known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 at the time of admission were excluded. Methods SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality rates were measured in time intervals by month of admission. A parametric survival model with SNF random effects was used to measure the association of patient demographic factors, clinical characteristics, and month of admission, with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Results The sample included 45,094 post-acute SNF admissions. Overall, 5.7% of patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 100 days of admission, with 1.0% testing positive within 1-14 days, 1.4% within 15-30 days, and 3.4% within 31-100 days. Of all newly admitted patients, 0.8% contracted SARS-CoV-2 and died, while 6.7% died without known infection. Infection rates and subsequent risk of death were highest for patients admitted during the first and third U.S. pandemic waves. Patients with greater cognitive and functional impairment had a 1.45 to 1.92 higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 than patients with less impairment. Conclusions and Implications The absolute risk of SARSCoV-2 infection and death during a post-acute SNF admission was 0.8%. Those who did contract SARS-CoV-2 during their SNF stay had nearly double the rate of death as those who were not infected.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Between October 2015 and November 2019, 99 patients were recruited from 11 UK centres. Ninety-five patients were randomized 1:1 to receive TriV or BiV pacing systems. The primary endpoint was feasibility of TriV pacing. Secondary endpoints assessed symptomatic and remodelling response to CRT. Baseline characteristics were balanced between groups. In the TriV group, 43/46 (93.5%) patients underwent successful implantation vs. 47/49 (95.9%) in the BiV group. Feasibility of maintaining CRT at 6 months was similar in the TriV vs. BiV group (90.0% vs. 97.7%, P = 0.191). All-cause mortality was similar between TriV vs. BiV groups (4.3% vs. 8.2%, P = 0.678). There were no significant differences in echocardiographic LV volumes or clinical composite scores from baseline to 6-month follow-up between groups. CONCLUSION: Implantation of two LV leads to deliver and maintain TriV pacing at 6 months is feasible without significant complications in the majority of patients.

The aim of this research was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical service delivery and well-being of these healthcare professionals in Australia. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of Australian radiographers and radiation therapists was conducted in June-July 2020. The survey collected data on demographic characteristics, and the impact of COVID-19 on professional practice, infection control and workplace-related stress. RESULTS: A total of 218 responses were received. Changes in work hours (P < 0.001) and workload (P = 0.022) were experienced due to COVID-19. Diagnostic radiographers reported increased procedural pressure on mobile radiography, computed tomography and general radiography. For radiation therapists, most pressure included areas of simulation and linear accelerator. PPE was in short supply at the start of the pandemic, and at the time of the study, shortages were identified for all PPE items. There was no difference in PPE supply reported by diagnostic radiographers and radiation therapists except for hand sanitiser (P = 0.003). Respondents experienced increased personal stress (61.4%) and anxiety (58.2%) at work due to COVID-19. In addition, their work caused increased stress to their family, partners or friends (57.4%). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has resulted in changes to clinical working patterns and service delivery. PPE shortages, as well as increased workplace-related stress, were identified.

However, with rising numbers of cases, multiple reports of cardiovascular manifestations have emerged. We present a case of COVID-19 infection complicated by myopericarditis and tamponade requiring drainage. CASE REPORT An 82-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities presented with five days of productive cough, fever with chills, and intermittent diarrhea. She tested positive for COVID-19. Index EKG revealed new diffuse T-wave inversions and a prolonged QT interval (>500 ms). Troponin was mildly elevated without any anginal symptoms. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were not initiated due to concerns about QT prolongation. The echocardiogram revealed preserved left ventricular (LV) function, a small global pericardial effusion, and apical hypokinesis. Serial echocardiograms revealed an enlarging circumferential pericardial effusion with pacemaker wire reported as 'piercing' the right ventricular (RV) apex alongside early diastolic collapse of the right ventricle, suggesting echocardiographic tamponade. Chest CT revealed extension of the RV pacemaker lead into the pericardial fat. Interestingly, on comparison with a previous chest CT from 2019, similar lead positions were confirmed. Pericardiocentesis was performed with removal of 400 cc exudate. CONCLUSIONS Acute myopericarditis and pericardial effusion can occur in COVID-19 infection, even in the absence of severe pulmonary disease. This case highlights the importance of awareness of rare cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 in the form of acute myopericarditis and cardiac tamponade and their early diagnosis and management.","output":"Acute Myopericarditis with Pericardial Effusion and Cardiac Tamponade in a Patient with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The performance of solving a constraint problem can often be improved by converting a subproblem into a single constraint (for example into a regular membership constraint or a table constraint).

Musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions comprise up to 21% of the annual primary care caseload in England. Established techniques for MSK examination, however, rely on face-to-face attendance. Evidence-based guidance for remote MSK assessment is required to ensure the quality of care is maintained with the move from face-to-face to virtual consultations. Method A literature review of published evidence and current guidelines was conducted. The most appropriate remote consultation techniques and MSK examinations were identified and where there was no evidence, modified examination tests were developed from established face-to-face examination techniques. A concise, accessible framework for remote MSK assessment in primary care was then created and tested on a non-medically trained volunteer. Results Over 2232 papers and articles were identified by search headings, reducing to 28 sources that had relevant content. At the time of searching, there was no published evidence relating to MSK remote consultation in a primary care setting. However, evidence was found in the physiotherapy and rehabilitation literature for the efficacy and practicality of MSK teleconsultation. MSK remote examination framework From this literature and with the addition of modified established examinations, an MSK assessment framework was constructed. This framework provides pre-consultation guidance and step-by-step remote examination instructions. Patient and clinician resources (including a patient information leaflet and photographic examples of examinations) were created as supplementary material. Conclusion Due to the frameshift away from face-to-face consultation, primary care clinicians have found themselves lacking an evidence base or practical guidance to support remote MSK assessment. This paper is a systematic literature review of MSK telemedicine from which practical advice and evidence-based MSK tests have been developed. Where there is no evidence, modified traditional tests are suggested to allow a complete framework for remote MSK examination - using a system approach of look, point, move followed by modified special tests, for use in a primary care setting as a ready-to-use practical guide to remote MSK assessment, presented in a downloadable format. What did this add? With 21% of primary care consultations relating to MSK conditions and limited means of performing face-to-face MSK examination due to COVID-19, there needs to be a recognised framework for assessing the MSK system remotely. To the best of our knowledge, this evidence does not exist for primary care remote MSK examination.

METHOD: This cross-sectional, paper-based study was conducted from June to August 2020. A validated questionnaire (Cronbachs alpha = 0.84) was used to interview 1,023 pharmacists in nine provinces of Vietnam. Analysis of covariance was employed to identify factors associated with the knowledge of pharmacists. The best model was chosen by using the Bayesian Model Averaging method in R software version 4.0.4. RESULTS: The mean knowledge score was 12.02  1.64 (range: 6C15), which indicated that 93.4% of pharmacists had good knowledge of COVID-19. There was no difference in the average score between males and females (p > 0.05). The multivariate linear regression model revealed that the knowledge was significantly associated with pharmacists age, education level, and residence (p < 0.001). About attitude and practices, pharmacists daily sought and updated information on the COVID-19 pandemic through mass media and the internet (social network and online newspapers). Nearly 48% of them conceded that they communicated with customers when at least one person did not wear a face mask at the time of the COVID-19 outbreak. At medicine outlets, many measures were applied to protect pharmacists and customers, such as equipping pharmacists with face masks and hand sanitizers (95.0%), using glass shields (83.0%), and maintaining at least one-meter distance between two people (85.2%). CONCLUSION: The pharmacists knowledge of COVID-19 transmission, symptoms, and prevention was good. Many useful measures against the spread of this perilous virus were applied in medicine outlets. However, pharmacists should restrict forgetting to wear face masks in communication with medicine purchasers.

The aims of this study were: (1) to compare the accuracy of P(musc) estimation using the end-inspiration occlusion (P(musc,index)) and the least square fitting (P(musc,lsf)) against the reference method based on P(es); (2) to test the accuracy of P(musc,lsf) and of P(musc,index) to detect overassistance, defined as P(musc)  1 cmH(2)O. We studied 18 patients at three different PSV levels. At each PSV level, P(musc), P(musc,lsf), P(musc,index) were calculated on the same breaths. Differences among P(musc), P(musc,lsf), P(musc,index) were analyzed with linear mixed effects models. Bias and agreement were assessed by BlandCAltman analysis for repeated measures. The ability of P(musc,lsf) and P(musc,index) to detect overassistance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. Positive and negative predictive values were calculated using cutoff values that maximized the sum of sensitivity and specificity. At each PSV level, P(musc,lsf) was not different from P(musc) (p = 0.96), whereas P(musc,index) was significantly lower than P(musc). The bias between P(musc) and P(musc,lsf) was zero, whereas P(musc,index) systematically underestimated P(musc) of 6 cmH(2)O. The limits of agreement between P(musc) and P(musc,lsf) and between P(musc) and P(musc,index) were  12 cmH(2)O across bias. Both P(musc,lsf)  4 cmH(2)O and P(musc,index)  1 cmH(2)O had excellent negative predictive value [0.98 (95% CI 0.94C1) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.91C0.99), respectively)] to identify over-assistance. The inspiratory effort during PSV could not be accurately estimated by the least square fitting or end-inspiratory occlusion method because the limits of agreement were far above the signal size. These non-invasive approaches, however, could be used to screen patients at risk for absent or minimal respiratory muscles activation to prevent the ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction.","output":"Non-invasive assessment of respiratory muscle activity during pressure support ventilation: accuracy of end-inspiration occlusion and least square fitting methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We herein report two cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).

Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a metabolically active fat depot, abundant in proinflammatory cytokines, and has been correlated with the extent and severity of carotid artery disease (CD). The locations most frequently affected by carotid atherosclerosis are the proximal internal carotid artery (ie, the origin) and the common carotid artery bifurcation. Progression of atheromatous plaque at the carotid bifurcation results in luminal narrowing, often accompanied by ulceration. However, there are no systematic analyses or well-conducted meta-analyses to evaluate the relationship between EAT and CD. The aim of this study is to examine this association of EAT with CD in different ages and sex. METHODS This systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted using published studies that will be identified from electronic databases (ie, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Studies that (1) examined the association between EAT and CD, (2) focus on cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies, (3) will conducted among in adults aged 40 to 70 years, (4) provided sufficient data for calculating ORs or relative risk with a 95% CI, (5) will published as original articles written in English or other languages, and (6) have been published until January 2018 will be included.

Participants 31,180 live singleton infants born in Denmark between March 12, and April 14, from 2015 to 2020 Main outcome measures The Main outcome measure was the odds ratio of premature birth, per preterm category, during the lockdown period compared with the calendar match period in the five previous years. Results A total of 31 180 newborns were included in the study period, of these 58 were born extremely premature (gestational age below 28 weeks). The distribution of gestational ages was significantly different (p = 0.004) during the lockdown period compared to the previous five years. The extremely premature birth rate during the lockdown was significantly lower than the corresponding mean rate for the same dates in the previous years (odds ratio 0.09 [95 % CI 0.01 - 0.04], p < 0.001). No significant difference between the lockdown and previous years was found for other gestational age categories. Conclusions The birth rate of extremely premature infants decreased significantly (~90 % reduction) during the Danish nationwide lockdown from a stable rate in the preceding five years. The reasons for this decrease are unclear. Identification of possible causal mechanisms might stimulate changes in clinical practice. Ideally, some cases of extreme prematurity are preventable which may decrease infant morbidity and mortality.","output":"Changes in premature birth rates during the Danish nationwide COVID-19 lockdown: a nationwide register-based prevalence proportion study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Community face masking is possibly of great value in reducing COVID-19 transmission, especially when universally adopted with high compliance. The aim of this study is to investigate the knowledge, common misconceptions, barriers, and the compliance of the community with the use of face masks for the prevention of COVID-19. A validated questionnaire was administered to the participants through a web link by using various social media. The collected data were statistically analyzed for significant differences according to demographic variables. The average knowledge of face masks and their role in preventing COVID-19 transmission was 95.64%, with no differences among most of the demographical factors. Older groups and females demonstrated a better attitude towards wearing face masks than other groups did (p<0.001). Another significant difference in the participants attitude was noticed between the various educational levels, employment, and nationality (p<0.001). Of the total respondents, 88.2% encouraged wearing face masks. Misconceptions about wearing face masks were very low. The frequency of wearing face masks at public places, workplaces, or social gatherings was 87.2%, 80.5%, and 47.5% respectively. There was a significant variation in the compliance with wearing face masks between the various groups based on age, gender, nationality, and employment status (p<0.001).

METHODS: Starting with 1,017,176 tweets by relevant users, we constructed 2 corpuses of multi-tweet conversations. The first was 1,814 conversations that included VSN members directly, whereas the second was 2,283 conversations mentioning vaccines or vaccine denialism. The tweets and user metadata were then analyzed using an adaptation of rhetorical structure theory. RESULTS: In the studied data, VSN members tweeted 12,677 times within conversations, compared to their 37,587 lone tweets. Their conversations were shorter than those in the comparison corpus (P < 0.0001), and they were involved in fewer multilogues (P < 0.0001).

We aim to synthesize the existing literature on the true SARS-CoV-2 excess deaths and infection fatality rates (IFR) in India, through a systematic search followed by viable meta-analysis. We then provide updated epidemiological model-based estimates of the wave 1, wave 2 and combined IFRs using an extension of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model, using data from April 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, the databases PubMed, Embase, Global Index Medicus, as well as BioRxiv, MedRxiv, and SSRN for preprints (accessed through iSearch), were searched on July 3, 2021 (with results verified through August 15, 2021). Altogether using a two-step approach, 4,765 initial citations were screened resulting in 37 citations included in the narrative review and 19 studies with 41 datapoints included in the quantitative synthesis. Using a random effects model with DerSimonian-Laird estimation, we meta-analyze IFR1 which is defined as the ratio of the total number of observed reported deaths divided by the total number of estimated infections and IFR2 (which accounts for death underreporting in the numerator of IFR1). For the latter, we provide lower and upper bounds based on the available range of estimates of death undercounting, often arising from an excess death calculation. The primary focus is to estimate pooled nationwide estimates of IFRs with the secondary goal of estimating pooled regional and state-specific estimates for SARS-CoV-2 related IFRs in India. We also try to stratify our empirical results across the first and the second wave. In tandem, we present updated SEIR model estimates of IFRs for waves 1, 2, and combined across the waves with observed case and death count data from April 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Results For India countrywide, underreporting factors (URF) for cases (sourced from serosurveys) range from 14.3-29.1 in the four nationwide serosurveys; URFs for deaths (sourced from excess deaths reports) range from 4.4-11.9 with cumulative excess deaths ranging from 1.79-4.9 million (as of June 2021). Nationwide pooled IFR1 and IFR2 estimates for India are 0.097% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.067 - 0.140) and 0.365% (95% CI: 0.264 - 0.504) to 0.485% (95% CI: 0.344 - 0.685), respectively, again noting that IFR2 changes as excess deaths estimates vary. Among the included studies in this meta-analysis, the IFR1 generally appear to decrease over time from the earliest study end date to the latest study end date (from 4 June 2020 to 6 July 2021, IFR1 changed from 0.199 to 0.055%), whereas a similar trend is not as readily evident for IFR2 due to the wide variation in excess death estimates (from 4 June 2020 to 6 July 2021, IFR2 ranged from (0.290-1.316) to (0.241-0.651) %). Nationwide SEIR model-based combined estimates for IFR1 and IFR2 are 0.101% (95% CI: 0.097 - 0.116) and 0.367% (95% CI: 0.358 - 0.383), respectively, which largely reconcile with the empirical findings and concur with the lower end of the excess death estimates. An advantage of such epidemiological models is the ability to produce daily estimates with updated data with the disadvantages being that these estimates are subject to numerous assumptions, arduousness of validation and not directly using the available excess death data. Whether one uses empirical data or model-based estimation, it is evident that IFR2 is at least 3.6 times more than IFR1. Conclusion When incorporating case and death underreporting, the meta-analyzed cumulative infection fatality rate in India varies from 0.36%-0.48%, with a case underreporting factor ranging from 25-30 and a death underreporting factor ranging from 4-12. This implies, by June 30, 2021, India may have seen nearly 900 million infections and 1.7-4.9 million deaths when the reported numbers stood at 30.4 million cases and 412 thousand deaths (covid19india.org) with an observed case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.35%. We reiterate the need for timely and disaggregated infection and fatality data to examine the burden of the virus by age and other demographics. Large degrees of nationwide and state-specific death undercounting reinforce the call to improve death reporting within India.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality rates in India: systematic review, meta-analysis and model-based estimation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a novel concept of responding to disease epidemics, Fangcang shelter hospitals were deployed to expand the health systems capacity and provide medical services for non-severe COVID-19 patients during the outbreak in Wuhan. To give insights on patient management within Fangcang hospitals, we conducted a retrospective analysis to: 1) describe the characteristics of the patients admitted to Fangcang hospitals and 2) explore risk factors for longer length of stay (LOS). We enrolled 136 confirmed COVID-19 patients, including asymptomatic patients and those with mild symptoms, who were hospitalized in the Wuti Fangcang Hospital. 58 patients completed the treatment and discharged before 1 March 2020. After describing patients demographic and clinical characteristics, exposure history, treatment received and time course of the disease, we conducted linear regression analysis to identify factors influencing LOS. We found that patients having fever before admission were hospitalized 3.5 days (95%CI 1.39 to 5.63, p = 0.002) longer than those without fever and that patients having bilateral pneumonia were hospitalized 3.4 days (95%CI 0.49 to 6.25, p = 0.023) longer than those with normal CT scan results. We also found weak evidence suggesting that patients with diabetes were hospitalized 3.2 days longer than those without diabetes (95%CI -0.2 to 6.56, p = 0.065). However, we observed no significant differences in LOS between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and between patients who received treatment and those without treatment. Longer duration of hospitalization among non-severe COVID-19 patients is associated with having fever, bilateral pneumonia on CT scan and diabetes. However, being asymptomatic and using supportive medications at the early stage of infection do not have significant influences on LOS. Our study is a single-centered study with relatively small sample size.

We aim to investigate US medical students' perspectives on the potential implications this transition would have on their education and career opportunities. METHODS A cross-sectional study investigating US medical students' perspectives on the implications of transition of the USMLE Step 1 exam to pass/fail. Students were asked their preferences regarding various aspects of the USMLE Step 1 examination, including activities, educational opportunities, expenses regarding preparation for the examination, and future career opportunities. RESULTS 215 medical students responded to the survey, 59.1% were women, 80.9% were allopathic vs. 19.1% osteopathic students. 34.0% preferred the USMLE Step 1 to be graded on a pass/fail score, whereas 53.5% preferred a numeric scale. Osteopathic vs. allopathic students were more likely to report that the pass/fail transition will negatively impact their residency match (aOR = 1.454, 95% CI: 0.515, 4.106) and specialty of choice (aOR = 3.187, 95% CI: 0.980, 10.359). 57.7% of respondents reported that the transition to a pass/fail grading system will change their study habits. CONCLUSIONS The transition of the USMLE Step 1 to a pass/fail system has massive implications on medical students and residency programs alike. Though the majority of medical students did not prefer the USMLE Step 1 to have a pass/fail score, they must adapt their strategies to remain competitive for residency applications. Residency programs should create a composite score based off all aspects of medical students' applications in order to create a holistic and fair evaluation and ranking system.","output":"Implications of the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 Examination Transition to Pass/Fail on Medical Students Education and Future Career Opportunities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 limitation strategies have led to widespread school closures around the world. The present study reports childrens mental health and associated factors during the COVID-19 school closure in France in the spring of 2020. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from the SAPRIS project set up during the COVID-19 pandemic in France. Using multinomial logistic regression models, we estimated associations between childrens mental health, childrens health behaviors, schooling, and sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the childrens families. Results: The sample consisted of 5702 children aged 8 to 9 years, including 50.2% girls. In multivariate logistic regression models, childrens sleeping difficulties were associated with childrens abnormal hyperactivity-inattention (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 2.05;95% Confidence Interval 1.70-2.47) and emotional symptoms (aOR 5.34;95% CI 4.16-6.86). Factors specifically associated with abnormal hyperactivity/inattention were: male sex (aOR 2.29;95% CI 1.90-2.76), access to specialized care prior to the pandemic and its suspension during school closure (aOR 1.51;95% CI 1.21-1.88), abnormal emotional symptoms (aOR 4.06;95% CI 3.11-5.29), being unschooled or schooled with assistance before lockdown (aOR 2.13;95% CI 1.43-3.17), and tutoring with difficulties or absence of a tutor (aOR 3.25;95% CI 2.64-3.99;aOR 2.47;95% CI 1.48-4.11, respectively). Factors associated with childrens emotional symptoms were the following: being born pre-term (aOR 1.34;95% CI 1.03-1.73), COVID-19 cases among household members (aOR 1.72;95% CI 1.08-2.73), abnormal symptoms of hyperactivity/inattention (aOR 4.18;95% CI 3.27-5.34) and modest income (aOR 1.45;95% CI 1.07-1.96;aOR 1.36;95% CI 1.01-1.84). Conclusions: Multiple characteristics were associated with elevated levels of symptoms of hyperactivity-inattention and emotional symptoms in children during the period of school closure due to COVID-19.

Dreams could give us crucial information about people's well-being, so here we have directly investigated the consequences of lockdown on the oneiric activity in a large Italian sample: 5,988 adults completed a web-survey during lockdown. We investigated sociodemographic and COVID-19-related information, sleep quality (by the Medical Outcomes Study-Sleep Scale), mental health (by the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales), dream and nightmare frequency, and related emotional aspects (by the Mannheim Dream Questionnaire). Comparisons between our sample and a population-based sample revealed that Italians are having more frequent nightmares and dreams during the pandemic. A multiple logistic regression model showed the predictors of high dream recall (young age, female gender, not having children, sleep duration) and high nightmare frequency (young age, female gender, modification of napping, sleep duration, intrasleep wakefulness, sleep problem index, anxiety, depression). Moreover, we found higher emotional features of dream activity in workers who have stopped working, in people who have relatives/friends infected by or who have died from COVID-19 and in subjects who have changed their sleep habits. Our findings point to the fact that the predictors of high dream recall and nightmares are consistent with the continuity between sleep mentation and daily experiences. According to the arousal-retrieval model, we found that poor sleep predicts a high nightmare frequency.

METHOD: CT images of 112 symptomatic patients with ALA were analyzed to identify the imaging features distinctive of each morphological type. The following CT findings were investigated: the presence of abscess wall, rim enhancement, edge characteristic, septa, intermediate density zone, and peripheral hypodensity. Abscesses from each type were further evaluated for their clinical presentations, laboratory findings and outcomes. RESULTS: We identified three types of ALAs: type I, II and III. Type I abscesses (66%) were characterized by absent or incomplete walls, ragged edges and peripheral septa; their edges exhibited irregular and interrupted enhancement. Type II (28%) had a complete wall characterized by rim enhancement and peripheral hypodense halo. Type III (6%) demonstrated a wall but without enhancement. Clinically, type I abscesses presented acutely with severe disease. They had significantly deranged laboratory parameters, higher incidence of rupture and higher rate of inpatient or intensive care unit admission. The severity of the disease prompted immediate percutaneous drainage in most type I abscesses (81%). Two of them died from multiple organ failure. The type II or III abscesses, on the other hand, had delayed presentations with mild to moderate disease, with near normal laboratory findings.

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin system, whose expression dominates on lung alveolar epithelial cells, is the human cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We strongly encourage the concept that thorough considerations of receptor-ligand interactions should be kept at the heart of scientific debate on infection. In this idea, the whole renin-angiotensin system has to be evaluated. We hypothesize that factors related to ethnicity, environment, behaviors, associated illness, and medications involving this complex system are probably responsible for situations regarded as anomalous from both an epidemiological and a clinical point of view, but, taken together, such factors may explain most of the aspects of current outbreak. We decided to use the analogy of a play and speculate about the possible impact in this tragedy of 1) air pollution via the interference of nitrogen dioxide on ACE2 expression; 2) the dual role of nicotine; 3) the hypothetical involvement of ACE2 polymorphisms, the relationships of which with ethnic factors and susceptibility to cardiovascular disease seems intriguing; 4) the impact on the severity of infection of hypertension and related medications acting on the renin/angiotensin system, and, finally, 5) the possible helpful role of chloroquine, thanks to its capacity of modifying ACE2 affinity to the viral spike protein by altering glycosylation.

We compared the curative effect between the control group and the treatment group, the mean alcohol consumption, the SF-36 scores before and after treatment, and the scores of Hamilton Depression Scale before and after treatment of 3, 6, and 9 weeks. Results: Based on the cognitive behavior model, the characteristics and psychological mechanism of depression in elderly patients with alcohol dependence under the COVID-19 epidemic situation were summarized. The total effective rate of the control group was 60%, and that of the treatment group was 100% (p < 0.05). The alcohol consumption of the patients in each group decreased significantly after treatment (p < 0.05), and there was no significant difference in alcohol consumption between the treatment group and the control group (p > 0.05). After 12 weeks of treatment, there were significant differences in PF, RF, physical pain, general health status, energy, and mental health between the treatment group and the control group (p < 0.05). Before and after treatment, there were significant differences in PF, RF, physical pain, general health, energy, emotional function, and mental health (p < 0.05) of the treatment group. The PF, energy, and mental health of the control group were significantly different before and after treatment (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the treatment group and the control group in the scores of Hamilton Depression Scale before treatment. There was significant difference between the treatment group and the control group in the scores of Hamilton Depression Scale at 3, 6, and 9 weeks after treatment. Conclusion: Attention, cognition, emotion, behavior, and physical response reinforce each other, creating a vicious cycle that reinforces and sustains the depressive symptoms of elderly alcohol dependence under the COVID-19 epidemic, and acupuncture combined with emotional therapy of Chinese medicine treatment for improving the depressive symptoms of elderly alcohol dependence during the epidemic period of COVID-19 has a brilliant therapeutic effect.","output":"Acupuncture Combined With Emotional Therapy of Chinese Medicine Treatment for Improving Depressive Symptoms in Elderly Patients With Alcohol Dependence During the COVID-19 Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: This study examined the role of family functioning in predicting family adherence to health-protective behaviors (HPBs) aimed at reducing COVID-19 spread. Pre-COVID-19 family functioning, disruptions to family functioning (cohesion, conflict, routines), and family chaos during the COVID-19 pandemic were tested as pathways to HPB adherence. METHOD: We utilized a sample of N = 204 families, comprising parents who had children (MAge = 4.17). Parents (MAge = 27.43) completed one survey prior to COVID-19 onset in the United States, and twice during COVID-19, at a 2-week interval. Structural equation modeling was used to test three potential pathways between prepandemic family-level functioning and HPB adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Findings indicated that families with higher levels of chaos during COVID-19 demonstrated consistently lower HPB adherence across all three models. Additionally, disruptions in family cohesion from pre-COVID was associated with lower levels of parent and child HPB adherence. Family conflict was indirectly associated with HPB adherence via family chaos during COVID-19; whereas family routines were not associated with HPB adherence at all. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that family functioning is a meaningful predictor of HPB adherence. Family-based support may be effective in improving HPB adherence by focusing on promoting cohesion and reducing conflict and chaos for families coping with reduced community support and resources. Strategies for family-based supports are discussed.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, resource allocation became a major problem in globally overwhelmed ICUs. The main goal of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics of the very elderly patients (aged  80 years) with COVID-19 admitted in Romanian ICUs. The study objectives were to evaluate and determine the factors associated with ICU mortality. Methods. We designed a national, multicentric, observational platform with prospective enrolment. This study included patients aged  80 years admitted in Romanian ICUs with SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 2020 to December 2021. Results. We included 1666 patients with a median age of 83 years and 78% ICU mortality. Male sex, dyspnoea, lower Glasgow Coma Scale and lower SpO2 at ICU admission, the need for mechanical ventilation (MV), and corticosteroid use were independently associated with mortality. A total of 886/1666 (53%) elderly patients underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, with a mortality of 97%. The age impact on mortality was confirmed by a 1:1 propensity matching with less elderly ICU patients. Conclusion. In extremely elderly patients with COVID-19 admitted in the ICU, mortality is high, particularly when requiring MV. Therapy should be directed towards the optimization of less invasive ventilatory methods and the use of MV and corticosteroids only in highly selected patients.","output":"Outcomes of COVID-19 Critically Ill Extremely Elderly Patients: Analysis of a Large, National, Observational Cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors hypothesized that the cytokine storm described in COVID-19 patients may lead to consistent cell-based tissue factor (TF)-mediated activation of coagulation, procoagulant microvesicles (MVs) release, and massive platelet activation.

In the short term, disasters are associated with physical trauma, adverse environmental exposures, and unstable housing. In the longer term, disasters may lead to relocation, changes in family functioning, and negative economic effects. These aspects of disaster exposure, in turn, lead to lack of access to health care, increased stress and negative mental health outcomes, and negative behavioral changes, including smoking and substance use, poor nutrition, physical overexertion and limited activity, and reduction in breastfeeding. All of these factors interact with social determinants of health to worsen effects on the most vulnerable women, infants, and communities. Few interventions after disasters have been tested. With the increase in disasters due to climate change and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the models of effects of disasters and their human health consequences need increasing refinement, and, more importantly, should be applied to interventions that improve disaster prevention, mitigation, and response.","output":"Assessing the effects of disasters and their aftermath on pregnancy and infant outcomes: A conceptual model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is rapidly spreading all over the world.

This study explores prime GPCR targets of the two phlorotannins. In silico proteocheminformatics modeling predicted twenty major protein targets and in vitro functional assays showed a good agonist effect at the 2C adrenergic receptor ((2C)AR) and an antagonist effect at the adenosine 2A receptor (A(2A)R), -opioid receptor (-OPR), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), and 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A receptor (5-TH(1A)R) of both phlorotannins. Besides, dieckol showed an antagonist effect at the vasopressin 1A receptor (V(1A)R) and PFF-A showed a promising agonist effect at the cannabinoid 1 receptor and an antagonist effect at V(1A)R. In silico molecular docking simulation enabled us to investigate and identify distinct binding features of these phlorotannins to the target proteins.

In addition, fecal microbial transplant (FMT) is neither FDA-approved or guideline-recommended for patients with pauci-rCDI (first or second recurrences). Therefore, a rigorous RCT of sufficient size was designed to determine the optimal treatment among three antibiotic regimens in current practice for treatment of pauci-rCDI. METHODS VA Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) #596 is a prospective, double-blind, multi-center clinical trial of veteran patients with pauci-rCDI comparing fidaxomicin (FDX) 200 mg twice daily for 10 days and vancomycin (VAN) 125 mg four times daily for 10 days followed by a 3-week vancomycin taper and pulse (VAN-T/P) regimen to a standard course of VAN 125 mg four times daily for 10 days. The primary endpoint is sustained clinical response at day 59, with sustained response measured as a diarrhea composite outcome (D-COM) that includes symptom resolution during treatment (before day 10) without recurrence of diarrhea or other clinically important outcomes through day 59.

Researchers have sought to inform the pandemic response through a diverse set of methodologies, including early efforts modelling anticipated increases in GBV. For example, in April 2020, a highly cited modelling effort by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and partners projected headline global figures of 31 million additional cases of intimate partner violence due to 6 months of lockdown, and an additional 13 million child marriages by 2030. In this paper, we discuss the rationale for using modelling to make projections about GBV, and use the projections released by UNFPA to draw attention to the assumptions and biases underlying model-based projections. We raise five key critiques: (1) reducing complex issues to simplified, linear cause-effect relationships, (2) reliance on a small number of studies to generate global estimates, (3) assuming that the pandemic results in the complete service disruption for existing interventions, (4) lack of clarity in indicators used and sources of estimates, and (5) failure to account for margins of uncertainty. We argue that there is a need to consider the motivations and consequences of using modelling data as a planning tool for complex issues like GBV, and conclude by suggesting key considerations for policymakers and practitioners in using and commissioning such projections.","output":"The pitfalls of modelling the effects of COVID-19 on gender-based violence: lessons learnt and ways forward"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the global public health challenges nowadays. AMR threatens the effective prevention and treatment of an ever-increasing range of infections, being present in healthcare settings but also detected across the whole ecosystem, including wildlife. This work compiles the available information about an important resistance mechanism that gives bacteria the ability to inactivate cephalosporin antibiotics, the cephalosporinases (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC beta-lactamase), in wildlife. Through a rigorous systematic literature review in the Web of Science database, the available publications on this topic in the wildlife sphere were analysed. The emergence and spread of cephalosporinases in wildlife has been reported in 46 countries from all continents (52% in Europe), with descriptions mainly in birds and mammals. The most widely disseminated cephalosporinases in human-related settings (e.g. CTX-M-1, CTX-M-14, CTX-M-15 and CMY-2) are also the most reported in wildlife, suggesting that anthropogenic pressure upon natural environments have a strong impact on antimicrobial resistance spread, including the dissemination of genes encoding these enzymes. Our work highlights the urgence and importance of public and ecosystem health policies, including improved surveillance and control strategies that breakdown AMR transmission chains across wildlife, as part of an integrated strategy of the One Health approach. ABSTRACT: In the last decade, detection of antibiotic resistant bacteria from wildlife has received increasing interest, due to the potential risk posed by those bacteria to wild animals, livestock or humans at the interface with wildlife, and due to the ensuing contamination of the environment. According to World Health Organization, cephalosporins are critically important antibiotics to human health. However, acquired resistance to -lactams is widely distributed and is mainly mediated by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and AmpC beta-lactamases, such as cephalosporinases. This work thus aimed to compile and analyse the information available on the emergence and dissemination of cephalosporinases in wildlife worldwide. Results suggest a serious scenario, with reporting of cephalosporinases in 46 countries from all continents (52% in Europe), across 188 host species, mainly birds and mammals, especially gulls and ungulates. The most widely reported cephalosporinases, CTX-M-1, CTX-M-14, CTX-M-15 and CMY-2, were also the most common in wild animals, in agreement with their ubiquity in human settings, including their association to high-risk clones of Escherichia coli (E. coli), such as the worldwide distributed CTX-M-15/ST131 E. coli. Altogether, our findings show that anthropogenic activities affect the whole ecosystem and that public policies promoting animal and environmental surveillance, as well as mitigation measures to avoid antimicrobial misuse and AMR spread, are urgently needed to be out in practise.","output":"Emergence and Spread of Cephalosporinases in Wildlife: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, a novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 from China has rapidly spread worldwide.

We assessed how UTT was related to markers of disease progression in PLHIV overall and specifically among clients with low CD4 count/high World Health Organization (WHO) stage. METHODS The analysis was conducted using data from a stepped-wedge trial of UTT in 14 government-managed health facilities in Eswatini from 2014 to 2017. Disease progression was defined as CD4 count falling below 200 cells/L or baseline value, > 10% weight loss, body mass index (BMI) dropping below 18.5, incident tuberculosis (TB) or HIV-related death; these outcomes also were assessed individually. We assessed multivariate Cox proportional hazard models overall and specifically among clients with CD4 count < 350 cells/L or WHO stage 3-4 at enrolment. RESULTS Eight hundred and seven of 3176 clients demonstrated at least one marker of disease progression over 2339 person-years of follow-up.

In our undergraduate Sustainability Science courses, students learn and practice key sustainability competencies (Wiek et al. in Sustain Sci 6:203C218, 2011) including systems thinking, strategic thinking, and futures thinking. In response to COVID-19, in the latter half of the Spring 2020 semester, we re-tooled our courses to help our students (1) apply competencies to understand Coupled Human and Natural Systems drivers behind COVID-19 spread as well as individual, societal, and natural responses, and (2) to envision how our future can be deliberately different if people choose to push past previously accepted paradigms as we emerge from the immediate crisis. In this chapter, we first overview how our curriculum lends itself to a deep systems understanding of COVID-19 by providing specific pedagogical examples of how we have utilized this pandemic to explain key sustainability theories, concepts, and competencies. Second, we offer a novel qualitative analysis of future sustainability-focused visions from student assignments from two courses that occurred between March and May 2020.

It has been reported also in patients with COVID-19, Hodgkin disease and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We analyzed the clinical relevance of Low T3 syndrome in COVID-19 patients and, in particular, in those with associated hematological malignancies. METHODS: Sixty-two consecutive patients, hospitalized during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Sant'Andrea University Hospital in Rome, were subdivided in 38 patients (Group A), showing low levels of FT3, and in 24 patients (Group B), with normal FT3 serum values. During the acute phase of the disease, we measured serum, radiologic and clinical disease severity markers and scores, in search of possible correlations with FT3 serum values. In addition, in 6 COVID-19 patients, 4 with Low T3 syndrome, including 2 with a hematological malignancy, and 2 with normal FT3 values, we performed, high-dimensional single-cell analysis by mass cytometry, multiplex cytokine assay and gene expression profiling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). RESULTS: Low FT3 serum values were correlated with increased Absolute Neutrophil Count, NLR and dNLR ratios and with reduced total count of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Low FT3 values correlated also with increased levels of inflammation, tissue damage and coagulation serum markers as well as with SOFA, LIPI and TSS scores. The CyTOF analysis demonstrated reduction of the effector memory and terminal effector subtypes of the CD4+ T lymphocytes. Multiplex cytokine assay indicates that mainly IL-6, IP-10 and MCAF changes are associated with FT3 serum levels, particularly in patients with coexistent hematological malignancies. Gene expression analysis using Nanostring identified four genes differently expressed involved in host immune response, namely CD38, CD79B, IFIT3 and NLRP3. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that low FT3 serum levels are associated with severe COVID-19. Our multi-omics approach suggests that T3 is involved in the immune response in COVID-19 and coexistent hematological malignancy and new possible T3 target genes in these patients have been identified.","output":"Gene signature and immune cell profiling by high-dimensional, single-cell analysis in COVID-19 patients, presenting Low T3 syndrome and coexistent hematological malignancies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surface pre-reacted glass-ionomer (S-PRG) filler is a bioactive functional glass that releases six different ions. Although several dental materials containing S-PRG filler have been developed, few self-care products containing S-PRG filler have been reported. We investigated the inhibitory effects of PRG gel paste containing S-PRG filler on Streptococcus mutans, a major pathogen of dental caries. PRG gel paste inhibited bacterial growth of S. mutans in a concentration-dependent manner, and all S. mutans were killed in the presence of  1% PRG gel paste. Additionally, it was difficult for S. mutans to synthesize insoluble glucan from sucrose in the presence of 0.1% PRG gel paste. A biofilm formation model was prepared in which slices of bovine enamel were infected with S. mutans after treatment with or without PRG gel paste. Biofilm formation was inhibited significantly more on the enamel treated with PRG gel paste than on enamel without PRG gel paste (P < 0.001). The inhibitory effects on bacterial growth and biofilm formation were more prominent with PRG gel paste than with S-PRG-free gel paste, suggesting that PRG gel paste may be effective as a self-care product to prevent dental caries induced by S. mutans.","output":"Inhibitory effect of a gel paste containing surface pre-reacted glass-ionomer (S-PRG) filler on the cariogenicity of Streptococcus mutans."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria are a vital part of global malaria control. Over the past decade, RDT prices have declined, and quality has improved. However, the relationship between price and product quality and their larger implications on the market have yet to be characterized. This analysis used purchase data from the Global Fund together with product quality data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) Malaria RDT Product Testing Programme to understand three unanswered questions: (1) Has the market share by quality of RDTs in the Global Funds procurement orders changed over time? (2) What is the relationship between unit price and RDT quality? (3) Has the market for RDTs financed by the Global Fund become more concentrated over time? METHODS: Data from 10,075 procurement transactions in the Global Funds database, which includes year, product, volume, and price, was merged with product quality data from all eight rounds of the WHO-FIND programme, which evaluated 227 unique RDT products. To describe trends in market share by quality level of RDT, descriptive statistics were used to analyse trends in market share from 2009 to 2018. A generalized linear regression model was then applied to characterize the relationship between price and panel detection score (PDS), adjusting for order volume, year purchased, product type, and manufacturer. Third, a HerfindahlCHirschman Index (HHI) score was calculated to characterize the degree of market concentration. RESULTS: Lower-quality RDTs have lost market share between 2009 and 2018, as have the highest-quality RDTs. No statistically significant relationship between price per test and PDS was found when adjusting for order volume, product type, and year of purchase. The HHI was 3,570, indicating a highly concentrated market. CONCLUSIONS: Advancements in RDT affordability, quality, and access over the past decade risk stagnation if health of the RDT market as a whole is neglected. These results suggest that from 2009 to 2018, this market was highly concentrated and that quality was not a distinguishing feature between RDTs. This information adds to previous reports noting concerns about the long-term sustainability of this market. Further research is needed to understand the causes and implications of these trends.

The Omicron variant houses 32 mutations in S protein alone. The viral infectivity is determined mainly by the ability of spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) to bind to the human Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. In this paper, the interaction of the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 variants with hACE2 was analyzed by using protein-protein docking and compared with the novel Omicron variant. Our findings reveal that the Omicron RBD interacts strongly with hACE2 receptor via unique amino acid residues as compared to the Wuhan and many other variants. However, the interacting residues of RBD are found to be the same in Lamda (C.37) variant. These unique binding of Omicron RBD with hACE2 suggests an increased potential of infectivity and vaccine evasion potential of the new variant. The evolutionary drive of the SARS-CoV-2 may not be exclusively driven by RBD variants but surely provides for the platform for emergence of new variants.","output":"Analyzing the interaction of human ACE2 and RBD of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in perspective of Omicron variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 represents the greatest health challenge of modern years.

The AC depth (ACD) of an eye can be used as a surrogate marker for identification of eyes at risk of developing angle-closure disease. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted at a university teaching hospital in South India. Each eye was photographed with a smartphone using the two perspectives, followed by quantitative measurement of ACD using optical biometry. The percentage of nasal iris illuminated was measured from the image acquired using the flashlight method (anterior perspective), whereas pupil position relative to the cornea was measured from the image acquired using the temporal perpendicular method (temporal perspective). The receiver-operating characteristic curve and area under the curve (AUC) were studied for both perspectives independently for overall predictive accuracy in detection of shallow AC (ACD <2.7 mm, obtained by IOL Master). RESULTS: A total of 275 eyes were examined, of which 77 (28%) had an ACD <2.7 mm. The accuracy of detection of shallow AC was found to be 95.2% for both perspectives when used alone or in combination. AUC of the anterior perspective was 0.99 (95% CI 0.982C0.997). The AUC for the temporal perspective was 0.993 (95% CI 0.988C0.999).

All piglets inoculated by the combined oral  nasal route (16) or into the infraorbital nerve (3) became sick after an incubation period of 5 days. Six of the 7 pigs inoculated into the stomach wall, 6 of the 8 pigs inoculated intramuscularly and 3 of the 5 pigs inoculated intracerebrally became ill after an incubation period of 3C3.5 days. None of the pigs inoculated either intravenously or into the abdominal cavity or into the stomach lumen became sick. All diseased pigs showed the vomiting and wasting syndrome. In oronasally inoculated pigs, killed during the early stages of disease, the virus was reisolated consistently from the tonsils and respiratory tract but irregularly from the pons + medulla and the stomach wall. Pigs inoculated by other routes were positive for virus when sick. All except one of the pigs which remained healthy had seroconverted. The site of virus replication which gives rise to the vomition could not be determined. It was concluded from the present studies that virus spread within the body occurs along nerve pathways.

In each trial, participants ingested 1.2 gmin-1 of glucose (enriched with 13C glucose) and 0.6 gmin-1 of fructose (enriched with 13C fructose) directly before and every 15 min during exercise. Indirect calorimetry and isotope ratio mass spectrometry were used to calculate fat oxidation, total and exogenous carbohydrate oxidation, plasma glucose oxidation, and endogenous glucose oxidation derived from liver and muscle glycogen. Total carbohydrate oxidation during the exercise period was lower at altitude (157.7  56.3 g) than sea level (286.5  56.2 g, P = 0.006, ES = 2.28), whereas fat oxidation was higher at altitude (75.5  26.8 g) than sea level (42.5  21.3 g, P = 0.024, ES = 1.23).

The human -syn protein (140 amino acids) with His-tag (8 amino acids) was expressed and purified to at least 95% purity. Isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis showed that the isoelectric point (pI) of -syn and apoA-I were pI = 4.5 and pI = 6.4, respectively. The lipid-free -syn showed almost no phospholipid-binding ability, while apoA-I showed rapid binding ability with a half-time (T(1/2)) = 8  0.7 min. The -syn and apoA-I could be incorporated into the reconstituted HDL (rHDL, molar ratio 95:5:1:1, palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC):cholesterol:apoA-I:-syn with the production of larger particles (92 ?) than apoA-I-rHDL (86 and 78 ?) and -syn-rHDL (65 ?). An rHDL containing both apoA-I and -syn showed lower -helicity around 45% with a red shift of the Trp wavelength maximum fluorescence (WMF) from 339 nm, while apoA-I-HDL showed 76% -helicity and 337 nm of WMF. The denaturation by urea addition showed that the incorporation of -syn in rHDL caused a larger increase in the WMF than apoA-I-rHDL, suggesting that the destabilization of the secondary structure of apoA-I by the addition of -syn. On the other hand, the addition of -syn induced two-times higher resistance to rHDL glycation at apoA-I:-syn molar ratios of 1:1 and 1:2. Interestingly, low -syn in rHDL concentrations, molar ratio of 1:0.5 (apoA-I:-syn), did not prevent glycation with more multimerization of apoA-I. In the lipid-free and lipid-bound state, -syn showed more potent antioxidant activity than apoA-I against cupric ion-mediated LDL oxidation. On the other hand, microinjection of -syn (final 2 M) resulted in 10% less survival of zebrafish embryos than apoA-I. A subcutaneous injection of -syn (final 34 M) resulted in less tail fin regeneration than apoA-I. Interestingly, incorporation of -syn at a low molar ratio (apoA-I:-syn, 1:0.5) in rHDL resulted destabilization of the secondary structure and impairment of apoA-I functionality via more oxidation and glycation. However, at a higher molar ratio of -syn in rHDL (apoA-I:-syn = 1:1 or 1:2) exhibited potent antioxidant and anti-glycation activity without aggregation. In conclusion, there might be a critical concentration of -syn and apoA-I in HDL-like complex to prevent the aggregation of apoA-I via structural and functional enhancement.","output":"Structural and Functional Changes of Reconstituted High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) by Incorporation of -synuclein: A Potent Antioxidant and Anti-Glycation Activity of -synuclein and apoA-I in HDL at High Molar Ratio of -synuclein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has been a devastating, mass bereavement event characterised by high levels of disruption to end-of-life, grieving and coping processes. Quantitative evidence is emerging on the effects of the pandemic on grief outcomes, but rich qualitative evidence on the lived experiences of people bereaved during these times is lacking. METHODS: We analysed qualitative data from two independent UK-wide online surveys to describe the experiences of 881 people bereaved during the pandemic. We analysed the data in two phases, conducting an inductive thematic analysis and then applying Stroebe and Schuts Dual Process Model (DPM) and concepts of loss-oriented and restoration-oriented coping (1999; 2010) as an analytic lens to further contextualise and interpret the data. RESULTS: We identified six main themes: troubled deaths; mourning, memorialisation and death administration; mass bereavement, the media and the ongoing threat of the pandemic; grieving and coping; work and employment; and support from the health and social care system. Examples of loss-oriented stressors included being unable to visit and say goodbye at the end of life and restricted funeral and memorialisation practices. Associated reactions were feelings of guilt, anger, and problems accepting the death and beginning to grieve. Examples of restoration-oriented stressors and reactions were severely curtailed support-systems and social/recreational activities, which impacted peoples ability to cope. CONCLUSION: Study results demonstrate the exceptionally difficult sets of experiences associated with pandemic bereavement, and the utility of the DPM for conceptualising these additional challenges and their impacts on grieving. Our analysis builds and expands on previous use of the DPM in explicating the impact of the pandemic on bereavement. We make recommendations for statutory, private and third sector organisations for improving the experiences of people bereaved during and following this and future pandemics.","output":"It was brutal.

This model is a reduced-form relationship between the CA balance and a set of CA fundamental and policy drivers, from which a CA norm may be derived and against which the actual CA balance is appraised. After having formally outlined a standard CA model similar to those developed by the main international institutions, the paper raises several concerns in CA modelling, amongst which the measurement and selection of both the dependent and explanatory variables and some technical issues in the estimation procedure. Recent trends affecting the CA balance, such as the expansion of global firms and the rise in corporate saving, as well as the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, are also discussed. The paper does not prescribe fully-fledged solutions to the manifold issues discussed, but rather aims to raise awareness of the latter, as well to provide some hints on how to tackle at least some of these challenges.","output":"Methodological Issues in the Estimation of Current Account Imbalances"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we establish daily confirmed infected cases prediction models for the time series data of America by applying both the long short-term memory (LSTM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithms, and employ four performance parameters as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE to evaluate the effect of model fitting. LSTM is applied to reliably estimate accuracy due to the long-term attribute and diversity of COVID-19 epidemic data. Using XGBoost model, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of predictive model to parameter features. Our results reveal that achieving a reduction in the contact rate between susceptible and infected individuals by isolated the uninfected individuals, can effectively reduce the number of daily confirmed cases. By combining the restrictive social distancing and contact tracing, the elimination of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is possible.

The T1D-predisposing human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecule, DQ8, binds and presents insulin B chain peptides in the thymus producing autoreactive CD4+ T cells. Here, we show that this process is driven by negatively-charged T cell receptor (TCR) complementarity-determining region 3{beta} (CDR3{beta}) sequences interacting with alanine at position 57 of the DQ8 {beta} chain. Since T1D aetiology is linked to gut microbiota dysbiosis, we hypothesized that the commensal proteome contains mimics of the primary insulin B:9-23 epitope that control TCR selection and tolerance. We identified a large set of bacterial proteins with significant similarity to insulin B:9-25, particularly from the transketolase (TKT) superfamily. We isolated a CD4+ TCR with a negatively-charged CDR3{beta} from the pancreas of a DQ8-positive patient that was cross-reactive with one of these TKT peptides and insulin B:9-23. The T1D-protective molecule, DQ6, with the negatively-charged aspartic acid (D) at DQ{beta}57, showed strong TKT mimotope binding, supporting a role for TKT-specific regulatory T cells in resistance to T1D. We propose that in a DQ8+DQ6- child with a proinflammatory dysbiotic gut microbiota, cross-reactive TKT-insulin B chain peptide T effector cells escape from the thymus and initiate T1D. TKT is a strong candidate because it is highly upregulated during weaning, a key period in T1D aetiology, and hence a prominent target for an autoimmune-prone immune system. Inhibiting gut dysbiosis and improving immune tolerance to TKT and other mimotopes, especially before and during weaning, could be a route to primary prevention of T1D and other common diseases.","output":"HLA-DQ?257, anti-insulin T cells and insulin mimicry in autoimmune diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When children are exposed to serious life adversities, Ed Zigler believed that developmental scientists must expediently strive to illuminate the most critical directions for beneficial interventions. In this paper, we present a new study on risk and resilience on adolescents during COVID-19, bookended - in introductory and concluding discussions - by descriptions of programmatic work anchored in lessons learned from Zigler. The new study was conducted during the first two months of the pandemic, using a mixed-methods approach with a sample of over 2,000 students across five high schools. Overall, rates of clinically significant symptoms were generally lower as compared to norms documented in 2019. Multivariate regressions showed that the most robust, unique associations with teens' distress were with feelings of stress around parents and support received from them. Open ended responses to three questions highlighted concerns about schoolwork and college, but equally, emphasized worries about families' well-being, and positive outreach from school adults. The findings have recurred across subsequent school assessments, and strongly resonate with contemporary perspectives on resilience in science and policy. If serious distress is to be averted among youth under high stress, interventions must attend not just to the children's mental health but that of salient caregiving adults at home and school.

Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations are common in patients with COVID-19 due to the high viral load lodged in the small intestine's mucosa. As a result, it causes an increase in the permeability of the intestinal barrier that favours the passage and translocation of bacteria, from the lumen of the intestine, towards the internal environment, with the appearance of sepsis, with evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has been found in faeces. This article highlights epidemiology, clinical symptoms, and mechanisms related to manifestations of disease in the GI tract and its pathogenesis in patients with COVID-19. It highlights bacterial translocation and COVID-19, mechanisms that control bacterial translocation, intestinal infection and feco-oral transmission, defense mechanisms against microbial invasion, role of microbiota/microbiome and implications of their dysbiosis and alterations during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and lastly protective health benefits by improving dietary habits with nutritional foods approaches amid the ongoing pandemic. Increasing evidence indicates that bacterial translocation appears due to the high viral load of COVID-19 in the mucosa of the GI tract, and the intestinal microbiota contributes to the COVID-19 course owing to their bidirectional relationship with the immune system and lungs. Dysbiosis in gut microbiota leads to increased gut permeability thus predisposing to secondary infection and multiple organ dysfunction. Disruption of intestinal barrier integrity due to dysbiosis may cause translocation of SARS-CoV-2 from lungs into the intestinal lumen via the circulatory and lymphatic system, initiating severe clinical presentation of the infection. A thorough understanding of the key role of gut microbiota, gastrointestinal symptoms, and pathology along with immunomodulatory approaches would help in alleviating morbidity and mortality during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. ? 2021, Editorial board of Journal of Experimental Biology and Agricultural Sciences.","output":"Bacterial translocation: Microbiota-intestine-lung axis and pro-inflammatory status in the severity of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE:Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) phenotypes differ by pulmonary epithelial vs. endothelial injury marker predominance. Epithelial vs. endothelial injury patterns in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been directly compared. METHODS:Adult patients presenting to a single ED in Boston from 3/24-4/30/20 were enrolled. Inclusion criteria: clinical concern for COVID-19 ARDS and 1) respirations 22/minute or 2) SpO292% on room air or 3) respiratory support. For this study, we excluded patients without subsequently polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 or without supplemental oxygen or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) at presentation (non-invasive mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 was against hospital policy during enrollment). On Day=0, 3, and 7, patients had dedicated research blood draws and detailed clinical data were recorded. Data included clinical/respiratory status using the World Health Organization (WHO)-scale, and non-pulmonary (renal, cardiovascular, and coagulation) dysfunctions. Clinical status on Day=28 was also recorded. Blood was analyzed using the Olink Proximity Extension Assay, an oligonucleotide-labelled antibody assay that provides high-specificity analysis of plasma proteins, including low abundance proteins. Targets included markers of epithelial injury (n=5), endothelial activation and injury (n=11), and inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, interleukin-8, soluble-Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-1 (sTNF-R1). We used multivariable mixed-effects generalized linear models to determine associations between biomarker and clinical status trajectories. Multivariable proportional-odds models measured associations between biomarker trajectories with 28-day outcome. Models were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, heart, lung, and renal comorbidities, and initial Sequential Organ-Failure Assessment score. RESULTS:Figure-A shows (n=225) patients' clinical status over time. At Day=0, epithelial injury markers were higher in patients requiring IMV vs. supplemental oxygen and decreased over time independent of respiratory status (Figure-B). They did not discriminate renal, cardiovascular, or coagulation dysfunctions. In contrast, endothelial markers were initially lower for IMV than supplemental oxygen patients;they fell over time in lower severity patients but rose sharply in IMV patients (Figure-C). Endothelial markers discriminated patients with non-pulmonary organ dysfunction from those without. More endothelial (8/11, 73%) than epithelial (1/5, 20%) markers were significantly associated with worse 28-day outcome (Figure-E). Change from Day=0 to Day=3 was significantly associated with 28-day WHO-scale for all 11 (100%) endothelial vs. 3/5 (60%) epithelial markers. Endothelial effect-sizes were substantially larger (median odds-ratio:3.60 vs. 1.58). CONCLUSIONS:In COVID-19 patients with respiratory distress, endothelial markers are more strongly associated with clinical progression, non-pulmonary organ dysfunction, and 28-day outcomes than pulmonary epithelial markers.

We aimed to investigate the association between baseline sarcopenia and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: All hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 who had baseline chest computed tomography (CT) scans at a Korean university hospital from February 2020 to May 2020 were included. The main outcome was time from hospital admission to discharge. Death was considered as a competing risk for discharge. Baseline skeletal muscle cross-sectional area at the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra was measured from chest CT scans. The lowest quartile of skeletal muscle index (skeletal muscle cross-sectional area divided by height-squared) was defined as sarcopenia. RESULTS: Of 121 patients (median age, 62 years; 44 men; 29 sarcopenic), 7 patients died and 86 patients were discharged during the 60-day follow-up. Patients with sarcopenia showed a longer time to discharge (median, 55 vs. 28 days; p<0.001) and a higher incidence of death (17.2% vs. 2.2%; p=0.004) than those without sarcopenia. Baseline sarcopenia was an independent predictor of delayed hospital discharge (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.96), but was not independently associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 (aHR, 3.80; 95% CI, 0.48-30.26).

The diagnostic performance of the leucocyte subsets and other parameters were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Further, the correlations between leucocyte subsets and inflammation-related factors associated with clinical outcome were subsequently investigated. Results: Among 95 subjects included, 56 patients were cured, and 39 died.

Several studies have indicated that densely populated urban environments and the heavy dependence on traffic could increase the potential spread of COVID-19. This study investigated the association between changes in traffic volume and the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea. METHODS: This study analyzed the daily national traffic and traffic trend for 3 months from January 1, 2020. Traffic data were measured using 6307 vehicle detection system (VDS). This study analyzed the difference in traffic levels between 2019 and 2020. Non-linear regression was performed to analyze the change in traffic trend in 2020. The relationship between traffic and confirmed COVID-19 cases was analyzed using single linear regression. RESULTS: The mean daily nationwide level of traffic for the first 3 months of 2020 was 143 655 563 vehicles, which was 9.7% lower than the same period in 2019 (159 044 566 vehicles).

In Incheon there was a positive, but insignificant, linear relationship between increasing numbers of newly confirmed cases and increasing traffic (? = 43 146; p = 0.056). CONCLUSIONS: Numbers of newly confirmed COVID-19 patients have been decreasing since March, while the traffic has been increasing.

Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses. Assembly and budding of coronavirus particles occur at the Endoplasmic Reticulum-Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC), with the structural proteins Nucleocapsid, Spike, Membrane and Envelope facilitating budding and release of virions into the secretory pathway lumen. This allows viral release which can occur through delivery of virus particles to deacidified lysosomes and subsequent lysosomal secretion. Coronaviral Envelope proteins are necessary for coronavirus assembly, play important roles in replication and can form oligomeric cation channels. Whilst synthesised in the ER, the mechanism by which Envelope achieves its steady state localisation to the ERGIC remains unclear. Here, we used fluorescent reporters to illuminate the Envelope protein from SARS-CoV-2. We discovered that internal tagging of this protein is necessary to preserve the functionality of a C-terminal ER-export motif and to allow localisation of Envelope to the ERGIC. Using this non-disruptive form of tagging, we used proximity biotinylation to define the vicinal proteome of wild type and ER-restricted versions of Envelope. We show that both Envelope and the presence of its ER-export motif contribute to the packaging of nucleocapsid into virus like particles. Finally, using our labelled versions of Envelope, we discovered that a minor pool of this protein is delivered to lysosomes. We show that lysosomal Envelope is oligomeric and can contribute to pH neutralisation in these organelles.","output":"Exploitation of the Secretory Pathway by SARS-CoV-2 Envelope"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Trastuzumab is a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) inhibitor used to treat HER2+ metastatic gastric cancer (mGC). The present study aims to investigate the relationship between CDH1 mRNA expression and HER2-positivity in mGC using a multiplexed gene expression profile in two series of gastric cancer (GC): Series 1 (n = 38): HER2+ and HER2- mGC; Series 2 (n = 36) HER2- GC with and without metastasis. To confirm the results, the same expression profiles were analyzed in 354 GC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. The difference in gene expression connected HER2 overexpression with canonical wingless-type (Wnt)/?-catenin pathway and immunohistochemical (IHC) expression loss of E-cadherin (E-CAD). CDH1 mRNA expression was simultaneously associated with the rs16260-A variant and an increase in E-CAD expression. Differences in retinoic acid receptor alfa (RARA), RPL19 (coding for the 60S ribosomal L19 protein), catenin delta 1 (CTNND1), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) mRNA levels-all included in the Wnt/?-catenin pathway-were found associated with overall survival (OS). RARA, CTNND1, and EGF resulted in independent OS prognostic factors. EGF was confirmed as an independent factor along with TNM stage in HER2-overpressed mGC from TCGA collection.

Due to the complex nature of mixing in heterogeneous and anisotropic media, the mathematical models related to this phenomenon are not analytically tractable. Numerical simulations often provide a viable route to predict chemical mixing accurately. However, contemporary modeling approaches for mixing cannot utilize available spatial-temporal data to improve the accuracy of the future prediction and can be compute-intensive, especially when the spatial domain is large and for long-term temporal predictions. To address this knowledge gap, we will present in this paper a deep-learning (DL) modeling framework applied to predict the progress of chemical mixing under fast bimolecular reactions. This framework uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) for capturing spatial patterns and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for forecasting temporal variations in mixing. By careful design of the framework -- placement of non-negative constraint on the weights of the CNN and the selection of activation function, the framework ensures non-negativity of the chemical species at all spatial points and for all times. Our DL-based framework is fast, accurate, and requires minimal data for training.","output":"A deep learning modeling framework to capture mixing patterns in reactive-transport systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 has spread from China as a global pandemic, Italy being one of the earliest affected countries. The infection displays a more complicated and often fatal course in adults with a history of kidney disease, while it does not seem to affect children in the same way. Pediatric patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS), with or without chronic immunosuppressive therapy, are at greater risk of infections which may also trigger relapses. OBJECTIVES: We performed a systematic review of the literature to identify all articles on SARS-CoV-2 infections in children with INS in order to describe the severity of all SARS-CoV-2 infections reported in children with INS, to evaluate the risk of new onset and relapses associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to draw recommendations on their management and vaccination. The search was conducted on the following databases: MEDLINE (via Pubmed), Google Scholar, and Web of Science. The search methodology used with the selected free text terms or MesH was (nephrotic syndrome OR idiopathic nephrotic syndrome) and (covid 19 OR \\"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\\" OR \\"2019-nCoV\\" OR \\"SARS-CoV-2\\"). RESULTS: The literature search provided 36 records. After screening for their relevance to the topic, 11 studies were selected. Two additional publications were identified through the reference list of all included articles and 13 articles were included in the review. A total of 43 cases of children with INS and SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported; the course of the disease was mild for most patients with low need of respiratory support and no death in high income countries. In 5 patients, the infection was complicated by relapse, which anyway showed a good response to steroids. Two children had a new onset of INS during a SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Children with INS, with or without immunosuppression, are not at higher risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Relapse is a possible complication, but steroid treatment is safe and effective. After summarizing the evidence, we have suggested recommendations for the management of children with INS during the pandemic and the vaccination campaign.

In times of the corona pandemic surgery and rehabilitation appointments were cancelled or delayed leading to a more difficult access to auditory rehabilitation. Newly implemented hygiene modalities due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have changed medical aftercare and the rehabilitation process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of rehabilitation under corona conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An anonymous survey of adult cochlear implant patients was carried out by a non-standardized questionnaire. Demographics were analyzed and the quality of medical aftercare, speech therapy, technical aftercare, psychological support and the hygiene modalities were compared to previous rehabilitation stays. RESULTS: In total 109 patients completed the questionnaire. The quality of rehabilitation and individual therapy were rated as qualitatively similar or improved. The threat of the pandemic and fear of corona were rated unexpectedly high with 68% and 50%, respectively. The hygiene measures during the rehabilitation stay eased subjective fears at the same time. The majority of patients were annoyed by wearing face masks but visors, protection shields and social distancing were more tolerated. CONCLUSION: The implementation of the new hygiene modalities within the therapeutic rehabilitation setting was well-accepted by patients allowing access to auditory rehabilitation. A successful rehabilitation should ensure a fear-free environment by adhering to the necessary hygiene modalities.","output":"Qualit?t der Cochleaimplantat-Rehabilitation unter COVID-19-Bedingungen./ [Quality of cochlear implant rehabilitation under COVID-19 conditions.

However, whether AMOTL2 participates in asthma pathogenesis has not been fully studied. In the present work, we studied the possible role and mechanism of AMOTL2 in regulating transforming growth factor-?1 (TGF-?1)-induced proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition of airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells. Our results showed marked reductions in the abundance of AMOTL2 in TGF-?1-stimulated ASM cells. Cellular functional investigations confirmed that the up-regulation of AMOTL2 dramatically decreased the proliferation and ECM deposition induced by TGF-?1 in ASM cells. In contrast, the depletion of AMOTL2 exacerbated TGF-?1-induced ASM cell proliferation and ECM deposition. Further research revealed that the overexpression of AMOTL2 restrained the activation of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) in TGF-?1-stimulated ASM cells. Moreover, the reactivation of YAP1 markedly reversed AMOTL2-mediated suppression of TGF-?1-induced ASM cell proliferation and ECM deposition. Together, these findings suggest that AMOTL2 restrains TGF-?1-induced proliferation and ECM deposition of ASM cells by down-regulating YAP1 activation.","output":"AMOTL2 restrains transforming growth factor-?1-induced proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition of airway smooth muscle cells via the down-regulation of YAP1 activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: This paper describes the occupations in the U.S. that involve close contact with others and whether the work is outdoors or indoors (risk factors for COVID-19), including the distribution of Black and Hispanic workers over these occupations. METHODS: U.S. data released from 2014 to 2019 on employment, proximity to others at work, outdoor or indoor work, and Black and Hispanic worker percentages for occupations were used. Occupations were assigned to 6 categories defined as a low, medium, or high physical closeness (proximity) at work and outdoor or indoor work. A total of 3 of the 6 categories represent a higher risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2: medium-proximity indoor, high-proximity outdoor, and high-proximity indoor exposure. RESULTS: A high proportion of U.S. workers may be at higher risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 because their occupations involve either high proximity to others indoors and outdoors (25.2%, 36.5 million workers) or medium-proximity indoors (48%, 69.6 million workers). There is a differential distribution of proximity and outdoor/indoor work by occupation, which disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic workers in some occupations. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of COVID-19 preventive measures in work settings should be based on occupation-specific risk factors, including the extent of proximity to others and whether the work is conducted outdoors or indoors.

There was large variation in how services were affected, depending on local incidence rates, location, and the systems they were working in. There was a lack of data about how services were coping, what types of pressures they were under, and how things are changed over time. We launched a project to collect and report data about the impact of COVID-19 on child health services. The first phase ran from April to July 2020 and the second from December 2020 to February 2021. This project collected data on a weekly basis to track trends and patterns, highlight service pressures, and help identify pinch points. Objectives 1. To capture a picture of how COVID-19 is affecting paediatric services throughout winter. 2. To provide members with information to help with workforce and service planning and recovery. 3. To ensure RCPCH members feel listened to and supported, and provided with a way of alerting us to issues in their service. 4. To make the responsible bodies in each of the UK nations aware of the problems facing paediatric services throughout winter. Methods We asked representatives, such as the paediatric clinical lead, to respond on behalf of their Trust or Health Board on a weekly basis. The first phase covered 12 weeks from April to July 2020 and the second phase covered 14 weeks from December 2020 to February 2021. Respondent were asked to submit data about 'the 7 days up to 08:00 on [date of Friday in the current collection week]'. Questions were answered as compared to 'normal' levels of staffing and capacity i.e., the same week in previous years. Some questions were changed over the data collection period in response to changing priorities. Results Response rate per week varied from 30% to 53%. In the first phase of collection (Spring 2020), up to 10% of all paediatric staff were not available to work (e.g., shielding). Up to 22% of junior paediatric medical staff (on the tier 1 rota) were redeployed to adult services, and up to 46% of community child health trainees and 14% of community career grade staff were also redeployed within paediatrics. In the second phase (Winter 2020-21), 16% of paediatric staff were reported absent due to stress and up to 28% of services reported trainee redeployment to adult services. We also found that paediatric inpatient beds occupied with children admitted due to a mental health issue had doubled from 6% in 2019 to 12% in 2020. Conclusions The paediatric workforce has been working intensely and beyond their usual scope for the past year. Prior to the pandemic, paediatric services and workforce already could not meet the demand for care. Redeployment and staff shortages due to the pandemic have therefore posed further challenges on an already stretched system. Staff and services must be supported to restore and recover.","output":"What impact has COVID-19 had on paediatric workforce and services?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study aimed to investigate the relationship among perceived stress, state-trait anxiety, and sleep quality of graduates to provide a reference for improving their psychological status and attitude adjustment of job-searching during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Results: While cerebral, mesenteric, and renal fractional oxygen extraction (FTOE) measurements decreased significantly (p = .042, p < .001, p < .001, respectively), NIRS measurements (p = .016, p < .001, p < .001, respectively) and mean blood flow velocities (p = .003, p = .011, p = .002, respectively) increased significantly after the treatment. There was a significant correlation between pretreatment cerebral and mesenteric FTOE and resistive index (RI) values (r = 0.45, p = .01, and r = 0.46, p = .01, respectively). However, no correlation was observed between renal FTOE values and renal RI (r = 0.33, p = .06).

We sought to investigate how non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and vaccination affected the course of these outbreaks. METHODS: We used an agent-based model of disease transmission to simulate COVID-19 outbreaks in Nunavut. The model encapsulated demographics and household structure of the population, the effect of NPIs, and daily number of vaccine doses administered. We fitted the model to inferred, back-calculated infections from incidence data reported from October 2020 to June 2021. We then compared the fit of the scenario based on case count data with several counterfactual scenarios without the effect of NPIs, without vaccination, and with a hypothetical accelerated vaccination program whereby 98% of the vaccine supply was administered to eligible individuals. RESULTS: We found that, without a territory-wide lockdown during the first COVID-19 outbreak in November 2020, the peak of infections would have been 4.7 times higher with a total of 5,404 (95% CrI: 5,0155,798) infections before the start of vaccination on January 6, 2021. Without effective NPIs, we estimated a total of 4,290 (95% CrI: 3,8804,708) infections during the second outbreak under the pace of vaccination administered in Nunavut. In a hypothetical accelerated vaccine rollout, the total infections during the second Nunavut outbreak would have been 58% lower, to 1,812 (95% CrI: 1,5932,039) infections. Vaccination was estimated to have the largest impact during the outbreak in April 2021, averting 15,196 (95% CrI: 14,79815,591) infections if the disease had spread through Nunavut communities. Accelerated vaccination would have further reduced the total infections to 243 (95% CrI: 222265) even in the absence of NPIs. CONCLUSIONS: NPIs have been essential in mitigating pandemic outbreaks in this large, geographically distanced and remote territory. While vaccination has the greatest impact to prevent infection and severe outcomes, public health implementation of NPIs play an essential role in the short term before attaining high levels of immunity in the population.

PURPOSE: To develop and validate a radiomics nomogram for predicting the fatal outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present study consisted of a training dataset (n = 66) and a validation dataset (n = 30) with COVID-19 from January 2020 to March 2020. A radiomics signature was generated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model. A radiomics score (Rad-score) was developed from the training cohort. The radiomics model, clinical model, and integrated model were built to assess the association between radiomics signature/clinical characteristics and the mortality of COVID-19 cases. The radiomics signature combined with the Rad-score and the independent clinical factors and radiomics nomogram were constructed. RESULTS: Seven stable radiomics features associated with the mortality of COVID-19 were finally selected. A radiomics nomogram was based on a combined model consisting of the radiomics signature and the clinical risk factors indicating optimal predictive performance for the fatal outcome of patients with COVID-19 with a C-index of 0.912 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.867-0.957) in the training dataset and 0.907 (95% CI 0.849-0.966) in the validation dataset. The calibration curves indicated optimal consistency between the prediction and the observation in both training and validation cohorts. CONCLUSION: The CT-based radiomics nomogram indicated favorable predictive efficacy for the overall survival risk of patients with COVID-19, which could help clinicians intensively follow up high-risk patients and make timely diagnoses.","output":"Radiomics analysis enables fatal outcome prediction for hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Document: When a person believes that he or she has sustained an injury because of someone else's negligent or wrongful conduct, the injured party can potentially file a tort lawsuit seeking money damages from the alleged wrongdoer In recent months, many plaintiffs have filed tort lawsuits alleging that they contracted COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019] or otherwise sustained COVID-19-related injuries because of someone else's unlawful conduct For example, after a Walmart employee contracted COVID-19 and died, his brother filed a lawsuit alleging that Walmart caused the employee's death by negligently failing to provide him with personal protective equipment, enforce social distancing guidelines, and disinfect the store Policymakers and commentators have debated whether Congress should enact legislation reducing defendants' potential exposure to COVID-19-related tort liability Tort liability of corporations;COVID-19 (Disease)","output":"Federal Legislation Shielding Businesses and Individuals from Tort Liability: A Legal and Historical Overview [May 8, 2020]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a serious threat to global health.

Variations of the peripheral lung density and the subpleural alveolar shape and its configuration are typically connected to the presence of ultrasound artifacts and consolidations. COVID-19 pneumonia can give rise to a variety of pathological pulmonary changes ranging from mild diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterized by peripheral bilateral patchy lung involvement. These findings are well described in CT imaging and in anatomopathological cases. Ultrasound artifacts and consolidations are therefore expected signs in COVID-19 pneumonia because edema, DAD, lung hemorrhage, interstitial thickening, hyaline membranes, and infiltrative lung diseases when they arise in a subpleural position, generate ultrasound findings.

Soon after approval, severe allergic reactions to the mRNA-based vaccines that resolved after treatment were reported. Regulatory agencies from the European Union, Unites States and the United Kingdom agree that vaccinations are contraindicated only when there is an allergy to one of the vaccine components or if there was a severe allergic reaction to the first dose. This position paper of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) agrees with these recommendations and clarifies that there is no contraindication to administer these vaccines to allergic patients who do not have a history of an allergic reaction to any of the vaccine components. Importantly, as is the case for any medication, anaphylaxis may occur after vaccination in the absence of a history of allergic disease. Therefore, we provide a simplified algorithm of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of severe allergic reactions and a list of recommended medications and equipment for vaccine centres. We also describe potentially allergenic/immunogenic components of the approved vaccines and propose a workup to identify the responsible allergen. Close collaboration between academia, regulatory agencies and vaccine producers will facilitate approaches for patients at risks, such as incremental dosing of the second injection or desensitisation. Finally, we identify unmet research needs and propose a concerted international roadmap towards precision diagnosis and management to minimise the risk of allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines and to facilitate their broader and safer use.","output":"EAACI statement on the diagnosis, management and prevention of severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ultrastructure of the proximal tubular epithelial cells in chicken kidneys was examined throughout the course of an experimental infection with infectious bronchitis virus.

In the halogenated base pairs (except the Cl-base pair, which has a very non-planar structure with no halogen bonds) and R-I ribbons (except the At trimer), the potential N-Xa?a?a?O interaction is sacrificed to optimise the N-Xa?a?a?N halogen bond. In the At trimer, the astatines originally bonded to N1 in the halogen bond donating guanines have moved to the adjacent O6 atom, enabling O-Ata?a?a?N, N-Ata?a?a?O, and N-Ata?a?a?At halogen bonds. The brominated and chlorinated R-II trimers contain two N-Xa?a?a?N and two N-Xa?a?a?O halogen bonds, whereas in the iodinated and astatinated trimers, one of the N-Xa?a?a?N halogen bonds is lost.

The national ban on hospital visiting rapidly changed the way in which this news would be delivered. In recognition of these new challenges, our team sought to design a teaching course that could be implemented quickly and cost effectively, with the aim of improving clinician's confidence around these difficult skills. Methods: A teaching programme was created using senior geriatric and palliative care clinicians as simulated patients, open to any grade and speciality. Learners were required to break bad news (BBN) without any visual feedback, to simulate skills required when using the telephone. Surveys were collected to determine self -assessed confidence across four domains (Table 1) before, immediately after and 4-20 weeks after the course. Participants were asked to rank their confidence for each skill on a 5 point scale with 1 being very unsure and 5 being very confident. Results: Pre-teaching scores showed an average of 3 (neither confident nor unsure) across all domains. After the course all domains improved, most notably around discussing end of life (EoL) care and discussing information over the phone. Conclusion: This project has highlighted a lack of confidence across all skill levels when it comes to BBN. This confidence is easily improved by a short, cost-effective teaching course.

SYK is also a key modulator of pathways involved in thrombosis formation. Fostamatinib is FDA-approved for chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and has been evaluated in over 4000 patients for treatment of allergic, autoimmune, and neoplastic disorders. Fostamatinib is well tolerated, with a consistent safety profile across a number of diseases. In rheumatoid arthritis patients, fostamatinib reduced the plasma levels of IL-6.1 The active metabolite (R406) was protective in mouse models of LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI)2 and LPS- or antibody-induced acute kidney injury (AKI).3 SYK inhibition decreased the incidence of thrombosis in mouse models of thromboembolism,4 and the incidence of thromboembolic events was decreased in patients treated with fostamatinib compared with other treatments for ITP. These immunomodulatory effects suggest that SYK inhibition represents a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of COVID-19, which led to design of a clinical study of fostamatinib in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients are at risk for a potentially fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cytokine storm, severe systemic capillary leak syndrome, thromboembolic events, and multi-organ dysfunction/failure. SYK is a master regulator of signal transduction pathways implicated in these COVID-19 associated complications, which involves hyperactivation of both innate and acquired immune systems. Targeting SYK could prevent the cytokine storm, downstream activation of endothelial cells and platelets, and influx of neutrophils and monocytes into lungs or kidney leading to ALI and AKI, respectively. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, Phase 3 study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of fostamatinib in adult, hospitalized, high-risk COVID-19 patients. Patients will be treated with fostamatinib 150mg BID for up to 28 days plus standard of care. Improvement in clinical status will be assessed using the 8-point ordinal scale. References 1.

As hand contamination is considered an important and potentially preventable factor for transmission, we have reviewed face touching in the context of a group of disorders known as the Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviours (BFRPs). Spontaneous face-touching is a poorly understood, atavistic, ingrained habit for humans, who engage in this activity approximately 26 times per hour. Nearly half of spontaneous face-touches involve mucous membranes, and one third of those involve the eyes. Historically the majority of research of this curious phenomenon has focused on psychological aspects, despite its pertinence to a range of anterior eye diseases such as keratoconus, trichotillomania and mucus-fishing syndrome. The ocular infectious sequelae through chiral auto-inoculation are well known for diseases including the conjunctivitides, herpetic keratitis, and papillomatosis. Furthermore, touches to the ocular mucous membranes also play an important role in systemic disease through access to the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts via the nasolacrimal duct and nasopharynx, and may be relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Through this access, chiral touches may also play a significant role in building and maintaining the microbiome, which has been increasingly implicated in ocular disease.

Our prospective study was designed to assess the immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in triggering the humoral and the cellular immune response in healthcare workers up to 6 months after two doses vaccination. Methods: This prospective study enrolled 208 healthcare workers from the Liege University Hospital (CHU) of Liege in Belgium. All participants received two doses of BioNTech/Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2). Fifty participants were SARS-CoV-2 experienced (self-reported SARS-CoV-2 infection) and 158 were naive (no reported SARS-CoV-2 infection) before the vaccination. Blood sampling was performed at the day of the first (T0) and second (T1) vaccine doses administration, then at 2 weeks (T2), 4 weeks (T3) and 6 months (T4) after the 1st vaccine dose administration. A total of 1024 blood samples were collected. All samples were tested for the presence of anti-Spike antibodies using DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay. Neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-like variant strain were quantified in all samples using a Vero E6 cell-based neutralization-based assay. Cell-mediated immune response was evaluated at T4 on 80 participants by measuring the secretion of IFN-gamma on peripheral blood lymphocytes using the QuantiFERON Human IFN-gamma SARS-CoV-2, Qiagen. All participants were monitored on weekly-basis for the novo SARS-COV-2 infection for 4 weeks after the 1st vaccine dose administration. We analyzed separately the naive and experienced participants. Findings: We found that anti-spike antibodies and neutralization capacity levels were significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 experienced healthcare workers (HCWs) compared to naive HCWs at all time points analyzed. Cellular immune response was similar in the two groups six months following 2nd dose of the vaccine. Reassuringly, most participants had a detectable cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 six months after vaccination. Besides the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection history on immune response to BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, we observed a significant negative correlation between age and persistence of humoral response. Cellular immune response was, however, not significantly correlated to age, although a trend towards a negative impact of age was observed. Conclusions: Our data strengthen previous findings demonstrating that immunization through vaccination combined with natural infection is better than 2 vaccine doses immunization or natural infection alone. It may have implications for personalizing mRNA vaccination regimens used to prevent severe COVID-19 and reduce the impact of the pandemic on the healthcare system. More specifically, it may help prioritizing vaccination, including for the deployment of booster doses.","output":"Kinetics and persistence of the cellular and humoral immune responses to BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in SARS-CoV-2-naive and -experienced subjects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The state-led investment in digital infrastructure under the ruling partys political agenda of Digital Bangladesh has given rise to scholarly and policy debates, especially around issues of digital surveillance and media censorship.

We also observed that broad-spectrum, pulsed UV light is effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 on N95 respirator material to undetectable levels with a dose of 103 mJ/cm(2). We included UV dosimeter cards that provide a colorimetric readout of UV dose and demonstrated their utility as a means to confirm desired levels of exposure were reached. Together, the results presented here demonstrate that broad-spectrum, pulsed UV light is an effective technology for the in vitro inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 on multiple surfaces.","output":"Pulsed Broad-Spectrum UV Light Effectively Inactivates SARS-CoV-2 on Multiple Surfaces and N95 Material"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over 10 million individuals pass through U.S. detention centers on an annual basis, with nearly two-thirds meeting criteria for drug dependence/abuse.

Here we describe a new program of telemedicine-based clinical provision of new/continuing buprenorphine treatment for individuals detained in a rural jail. Implementation objectives were completed between January and August 2020, and patient encounters were conducted between August 2020 and February 2021. We established (i) telemedicine hardware/software capability; (ii) a screening process; (iii) buprenorphine administration methods; (iv) necessary medical release procedures; (v) telemedicine encounter coordination and medication prescription procedures; and (vi) a research platform. Seven incarcerated patients have been treated, two of whom were referred from community treatment. Patients were mostly male (71%), non-Hispanic White (86%), and averaged 33 years old. All patients tested positive for an opioid upon intake and began/continued buprenorphine treatment in the jail. Average time to first MOUD appointment was 9 days and patients were maintained in treatment an average 21 days. Referrals for continuing community treatment were offered to all patients prior to discharge. We report successful implementation of telemedicine MOUD in a rural detention center, with treatment engagement and initiation occurring prior to the high-risk period of discharge. The fact that this program was launched during the height of the pandemic highlights the flexibility of telemedicine-based buprenorphine treatment.

Therefore, measuring the performance of the construction suppliers has become the primary focus of project-oriented organizations and the core of business decision-making, especially during global megatrends. The question that may arise here is, How can the performance of the construction suppliers be determined under uncertainties considering the post-COVID-19 era? Organizations need eligible suppliers for the rapid recovery of the supply chain and construction sector at this critical stage. Given the importance of the issue, this study aims to propose a novel approach for measuring the performance of construction suppliers using the fuzzy ordinal priority approach (OPA-F). OPA-F is a recent development in multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) that can determine the criteria weights for performance measurement using fuzzy linguistic variables. We do not always have access to a complete data set in real-world situations and business environments. Nevertheless, OPA-F can handle this dilemma, even with incomplete input data. This research intends to consider three main aspects of the construction suppliers, known as (L-A-D) capabilities, including localization, agility, and digitalization. In this regard, we bring up a case study from the construction industry to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework. The findings show that the most critical criterion is digitalization for the case study. This criterion covers supply chain automation and virtualization and dematerialization of services/products. The proposed approach is practical and straightforward, particularly for academicians and decision-makers;it can also incorporate uncertainties.","output":"Performance measurement of construction suppliers under localization, agility, and digitalization criteria: Fuzzy Ordinal Priority Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How to cite this article: Naaz S, Kumar A, Sahay N, Kumar R, Ozair E, Valiaparambath A.

METHODS: Information on 429 patients with confirmed COVID-19, admitted to Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, India between 04 June 2020 to 15 August 2020, was retrospectively collected through electronic records and analysed. RESULTS: 79.25% of the patients included in the study had eosinopenia on admission. The median eosinophil count in COVID-19-positive patients was 0.015  109 /L, and in negative patients, it was 0.249  109 /L. Eighteen per cent of the positive patients presented with 0 eosinophil count. Eosinopenia for early diagnosis of COVID-19 had a sensitivity of 80.68% and specificity of 100% with an accuracy of 85.24. Role of eosinopenia in prognostication of COVID-19 was found to be insignificant. There was no statistically significant difference between the median eosinophil counts in survivors and nonsurvivors. Eosinophil trends during the course of disease were found to be similar between survivors and nonsurvivors.

However, there has been considerable confusion and disagreement regarding the degree to which masks protect the wearer from airborne particles. Objectives To evaluate the fitted filtration efficiency (FFE) of various consumer-grade and improvised face masks, as well as several popular modifications of medical procedure masks that are intended to improve mask fit or comfort. Design, Setting, and Participants For this study conducted in a research laboratory between June and August 2020, 7 consumer-grade masks and 5 medical procedure mask modifications were fitted on an adult male volunteer, and FFE measurements were collected during a series of repeated movements of the torso, head, and facial muscles as outlined by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration Quantitative Fit Testing Protocol. The consumer-grade masks tested included (1) a 2-layer woven nylon mask with ear loops that was tested with an optional aluminum nose bridge and nonwoven filter insert in place, (2) a cotton bandana folded diagonally once (ie, \\"bandit\\" style) or in a (3) multilayer rectangle according to the instructions presented by the US Surgeon General, (4) a single-layer woven polyester/nylon mask with ties, (5) a nonwoven polypropylene mask with fixed ear loops, (6) a single-layer woven polyester gaiter/neck cover balaclava bandana, and (7) a 3-layer woven cotton mask with ear loops. Medical procedure mask modifications included (1) tying the mask's ear loops and tucking in the side pleats, (2) fastening ear loops behind the head with 3-dimensional-printed ear guards, (3) fastening ear loops behind the head with a claw-type hair clip, (4) enhancing the mask/face seal with rubber bands over the mask, and (5) enhancing the mask/face seal with a band of nylon hosiery over the fitted mask. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary study outcome was the measured FFE of common consumer-grade and improvised face masks, as well as several popular modifications of medical procedure masks. Results The mean (SD) FFE of consumer grade masks tested on 1 adult male with no beard ranged from 79.0% (4.3%) to 26.5% (10.5%), with the 2-layer woven nylon mask having the highest FFE. Unmodified medical procedure masks with ear loops had a mean (SD) FFE of 38.5% (11.2%). All modifications evaluated in this study increased procedure mask FFE (range [SD], 60.3% [11.1%] to 80.2% [3.1%]), with a nylon hosiery sleeve placed over the procedure mask producing the greatest improvement. Conclusions and Relevance While modifications to improve medical procedure mask fit can enhance the filtering capability and reduce inhalation of airborne particles, this study demonstrates that the FFEs of consumer-grade masks available to the public are, in many cases, nearly equivalent to or better than their non-N95 respirator medical mask counterparts.","output":"Evaluation of Cloth Masks and Modified Procedure Masks as Personal Protective Equipment for the Public During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: This study reviewed whether the response to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affected the care for hip fracture patients at a major trauma centre in Scotland during the first-wave lock-down period. METHODS: All patients referred to Orthopaedics with a hip fracture in a major trauma centre in Scotland were captured between 14 th March and 28 th May (11 weeks) in 2020 and 2019. Patients were identified using electronic patient records. The primary outcomes are time to theatre, length of admission and 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes are COVID-19 prevalence, duration of surgery, proportion of patients to theatre within 36 hours and COVID-19 positive 30-day mortality from time of surgery. 225 patients were included: 108 from 2019 and 117 from 2020. THE MAIN FINDINGS: 30-day mortality was 3.7% (n=4) in 2019 and 8.5% (n=10) in 2020 (p=0.142). There was no statistical difference with time to theatre (p=0.150) nor duration of theatre (p=0.450).

COVID-19 symptoms vary from a mild cold to more severe illnesses such as SARS, thrombosis, stroke, organ failure, and in some patients even cause mortality. Deciphering the underlying disease mechanisms is pivotal for the identification and development of COVID-19 specific drugs for effective treatment and prevent human-to-human transmission, disease complications, and mortality. Methodology: Here, the Next Generation RNA Sequencing (RNA Seq) data using Illumina Next Seq 500 from SARS CoV-infected A549 cells and mock-treated A549 cells, were obtained from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) (GSE147507) and the Quality Control (QC) were evaluated using the CLC Genomics Workbench 20.0 (Qiagen, USA) before the RNA Seq analysis. The DEGs were imported into BioJupies to analyze to decipher COVID-19 induced biological, molecular, and cellular processes, pathways, and small molecules derived from chemical synthesis or natural sources to mimic or reverse COVID-19-specific gene signatures. Besides, we have used the iPathwayGuide (Advaita Bioinformatics USA) to identify COVID-19 specific pathways, biological, molecular, and cellular processes, and druggable candidates for future therapy. Results: 141 DEGs were identified out of a total of 9665 DEGs obtained from BioJupies analysis of the RNASeq reads of the SARS CoV infected A549 cells and mock-treated A549 cells based on a p-value cut off (0.05) and a fold change cut off 1.5.

The difficulty of this task is exacerbated in low resource settings that may not have access to biotechnology tests. Furthermore, Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major health problem in several low- and middle-income countries and its common symptoms include fever, cough and tiredness, similarly to COVID-19. In order to help in the detection of COVID-19, we propose the extraction of deep features (DF) from chest X-ray images, a technology available in most hospitals, and their subsequent classification using machine learning methods that do not require large computational resources. We compiled a five-class dataset of X-ray chest images including a balanced number of COVID-19, viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, TB, and healthy cases. We compared the performance of pipelines combining 14 individual state-of-the-art pre-trained deep networks for DF extraction with traditional machine learning classifiers. A pipeline consisting of ResNet-50 for DF computation and ensemble of subspace discriminant classifier was the best performer in the classification of the five classes, achieving a detection accuracy of 91.6+ 2.6% (accuracy + 95% Confidence Interval). Furthermore, the same pipeline achieved accuracies of 98.6+1.4% and 99.9+0.5% in simpler three-class and two-class classification problems focused on distinguishing COVID-19, TB and healthy cases;and COVID-19 and healthy images, respectively. The pipeline was computationally efficient requiring just 0.19 second to extract DF per X-ray image and 2 minutes for training a traditional classifier with more than 2000 images on a CPU machine.

In Germany, as in many other regions, current tests for SARS-CoV2 are not conducted on a representative basis and in a longitudinal design. Furthermore, knowledge about the immune status of the population is lacking. Nonetheless, these data are needed to understand the dynamics of the pandemic and hence to appropriately design and evaluate interventions. For this purpose, we recently started a prospective population-based cohort in Munich, Germany, with the aim to develop a better understanding of the state and dynamics of the pandemic. METHODS: In 100 out of 755 randomly selected constituencies, 3000 Munich households are identified via random route and offered enrollment into the study. All household members are asked to complete a baseline questionnaire and subjects 14 years of age are asked to provide a venous blood sample of 3 ml for the determination of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgA status. The residual plasma and the blood pellet are preserved for later genetic and molecular biological investigations. For twelve months, each household member is asked to keep a diary of daily symptoms, whereabouts and contacts via WebApp. If symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 are reported, family members, including children < 14 years, are offered a pharyngeal swab taken at the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, for molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2. In case of severe symptoms, participants will be transferred to a Munich hospital. For one year, the study teams re-visits the households for blood sampling every six weeks.

Here we report the use of reverse complement polymerase chain reaction (RC-PCR), a novel technology for WGS of SARS-CoV-2 enabling library preparation in a single PCR saving time, resources and enables high throughput screening. Additionally, we show SARS-CoV-2 diversity and possible transmission within the Radboud university medical center (Radboudumc) during September 2020 using RC-PCR WGS. MethodsA total of 173 samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March and September 2020 were selected for whole-genome sequencing. Ct values of the samples ranged from 16 to 42. They were collected from 83 healthcare workers and three patients at the Radboudumc, in addition to 64 people living in the area around the hospital and tested by the local health services. For validation purposes, nineteen of the included samples were previously sequenced using Oxford Nanopore Technologies and compared to RC-PCR WGS results. The applicability of RC-PCR WGS in outbreak analysis for public health service and hospitals was tested on six suspected clusters containing samples of healthcare workers and patients with an epidemiological link. FindingsRC-PCR resulted in sequencing data for 146 samples. It showed a genome coverage of up to 98,2% for samples with a maximum Ct value of 32. Comparison to Oxford Nanopore technologies gives a near-perfect agreement on 95% of the samples (18 out of 19). Three out of six clusters with a suspected epidemiological link were fully confirmed, in the others, four healthcare workers were not associated.

Twenty-nine consecutively collected cases were analyzed and compared to 141 nonvaccinated control cases. Autopsies were performed on 16 partially and 13 fully vaccinated individuals. Most patients were elderly and suffered from several relevant comorbidities. Real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) identified a significantly increased rate of generalized viral dissemination within organ systems in vaccinated cases versus nonvaccinated cases (45% vs. 16%, respectively; P = 0.008) mainly with Ct-values of higher than 25 in non-respiratory samples. However, vaccinated cases also showed high viral loads, reaching Ct-values below 10, especially in the upper airways and lungs. This was accompanied by high rates of pulmonal bacterial or mycotic superinfections and the occurrence of immunocompromising factors, such as malignancies, immunosuppressive drug intake, or decreased immunoglobulin levels. All these findings were particularly accentuated in partially vaccinated patients compared to fully vaccinated individuals. The virus dissemination observed in our case study may indicate that patients with an impaired immune system have a decreased ability to eliminate the virus.

RESULTS: The results of meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of depression in active military forces and veterans was 23% (%95 CI: 20C26%) and 20% (%95 CI: 18C22%), respectively. In addition, the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts in the military was 11% (%95 CI: 10C13%) and 11% (%95 CI: 9C13%), respectively. The prevalence of suicide ideation and attempts in drug-using military was 18% (%95 CI: 7C33%) and 30% (%95 CI: 23C36%), respectively. The prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts in military consuming alcohol were 9% (%95 CI: 4C13%) and 8% (%95 CI: 7C10%), respectively. In militaries with AIDS / HIV, the prevalence of suicide attempts was 5% (%95 CI: 4C8%).

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case series with a control group evaluating the effectiveness and safety of CPT in patients with COVID-19 are included for the meta-analyses. Our search retrieved seven studies, including two RCTs and five cohort studies, with a total of 5444 patients. In patients with COVID-19, the use of CPT reduces mortality (odd's ratio [OR] 0.44; 95% CI, 0.25-0.77), increases viral clearance (OR, 11.29; 95% CI, 4.9-25.9) and improves clinically (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 0.8 to 4.9).

Until herd immunity is achieved with vaccines, the only available mechanisms for controlling the pandemic are quarantines, perimeter closures and social distancing with the aim of reducing mobility.

The main criterion for establishing these measures and planning socioeconomic subsidies is the evolution of infections. Early warning systems in all countries monitor the COVID-19 pandemic evolution. However, the collapse of the health system and the unpredictability of human behaviour, among others, make it difficult to predict this evolution in the short to medium term.

RECENT FINDINGS Postoperative delirium affects on average 36.8% of surgical patients, ranging from 9 to 87% depending on age, setting, type of surgery and other risk factors. This number may in fact be an underestimation based on the variation in screening practices. Meta-analyses show that in a mix of medical and surgical patients, a single episode of delirium resulted in a doubling of the odds ratio for death as well as an increase in the risk of admission to an institution and increase in dementia. It is also associated with an increase in length of mechanical ventilation in addition to total length of ICU and hospital length of stay.

The disease duration revealed by different examination methods may differ. OBJECTIVE: To compare the differences in the disease course of patients with COVID-19 by chest computed tomography (CT) and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and explore the factors that affect the course of the illness. METHODS: 106 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were enrolled and divided into two groups (age <60 years and age 360 years). The clinical characteristics of the two groups were analyzed. The intervals from symptoms onset to initial positive time point (ISIP), symptoms onset to initial negative time point (ISIN), and initial positive to initial negative time point (IIPN) indicated by chest CT and RT-PCR assay were analyzed. Multiple regression analysis was performed to assess the correlations between independent factors and the intervals. RESULTS: Chest CT showed an earlier positive time point, a later negative time point, and a longer disease duration than RT-PCR assay (P<.001, respectively). Older patients over 60 years old showed a later negative time point and a longer disease duration by chest CT than younger patients (P<.01 vs. P<.05, respectively). The CT score and clinical grades of older patients were greater than those of younger patients (P<.001, respectively). Age and clinical grades were significantly correlated with the disease course shown by chest CT (P<.05, respectively), and CT score was positively correlated with the illness course shown by chest CT and RT-PCR assay (P<.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: The disease course revealed by chest CT and RT-PCR assay was asynchronous. Chest CT showed a 17-day longer period compared to the RT-PCR assay. Older patients had a longer duration than younger ones. A prolonged course is predicted by increasing age, CT score, and clinical grades.","output":"Comparison of Chest CT and RT-PCR Assay for Indication of Disease Course of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak is increasing around the world in the number of cases, deaths, and affected countries.

Typically, the fastest route to identifying and licensing a safe and effective antiviral drug is to test those already shown safe in early clinical trials for other infections or diseases. Here, we tested in vitro oleandrin, derived from the Nerium oleander plant and shown previously to have inhibitory activity against several viruses. Using Vero cells, we found that prophylactic oleandrin administration at concentrations down to 0.05 g/ml exhibited potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, with an 800-fold reduction in virus production, and a 0.1 g/ml dose resulted in a greater than 3,000-fold reduction in infectious virus production. The EC50 values were 11.98ng/ml when virus output was measured at 24 hours post-infection, and 7.07ng/ml measured at 48 hours post-infection. Therapeutic (post-infection) treatment up to 24 hours after infection of Vero cells also reduced viral titers, with the 0.1 g/ml dose causing greater than 100-fold reductions as measured at 48 hours, and the 0.05 g/ml dose resulting in a 78-fold reduction. The potent prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral activities demonstrated here strongly support the further development of oleandrin to reduce the severity of COVID-19 and potentially also to reduce spread by persons diagnosed early after infection. IMPORTANCE COVID-19, a pandemic disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, has swept around the world to cause millions of infections and hundreds-of-thousands of deaths due to the lack of vaccines and effective therapeutics. We tested oleandrin, derived from the Nerium oleander plant and shown previously to reduce the replication of several viruses, against SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cells. When administered both before and after virus infection, nanogram doses of oleandrin significantly inhibited replication by up to 3,000-fold, indicating the potential to prevent disease and virus spread in persons recently exposed to SARS-CoV-2, as well as to prevent severe disease in persons at high risk. These results indicate that oleandrin should be tested in animal models and in humans exposed to infection to determine its medical usefulness in controlling the pandemic.","output":"Prophylactic and Therapeutic Inhibition of In Vitro SARS-CoV-2 Replication by Oleandrin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the end of December 2019, outbreak of a novel viral disease was reported in Wuhan city of China, which caused by a novel coronavirus and was officially named as COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO) The outbreak of COVID-19 was unique in its rapidity of transmission, which has become a global health emergency within just a few months in all countries worldwide This disease will not only raise public health concerns but also cause several psychological distress, including anxiety, fear, depression, stigmatization, avoidance behaviors, irritability, insomnia, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) In this situation, the maintenance of mental health status of individuals is very important because people in different parts of society may experience additional stressors during the COVID-19 outbreak Individuals in different parts of a society may experience the psychological symptoms to COVID-19 during the rising phase of the outbreak, including patients of COVID-19, quarantine individuals, health care workers and family members of medical staffs, children, university students, pregnant women, and families In this regard, there is the strong evidence that the mental health status of these populations is vulnerable to exhibition of the psychological disorders symptoms ? 2020 Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences All rights reserved","output":"Psychological impacts of Covid-19 outbreak on mental health status of society individuals: A narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak in the United States has disproportionately affected African-Americans, but little is known about the factors that underlie this observation.

METHODS: This single center retrospective observational study included all adult subjects with laboratory confirmed SARS-Cov-2 treated in our ICU between March 15th and May 10th, 2020. RESULTS: 128 critically-ill adult subjects were included in the study (median age 68 Interquartile range(IQR) 61-76), 45% female, and 64% African-American); 124 (97%) required intubation. Eighty (63%) died during their inpatient stay, which did not differ by race/ethnicity. Compared with other racial/ethnic groups, African-Americans had a greater proportion of women (52% vs. 30%, p=0.02), and hypertensives (91% vs. 78%, p=0.035). Asthma (p=0.026) was associated with lower inpatient death, primarily among African-Americans (p=0.02). Among African-Americans, increased age (OR [95% CI]: 1.06[1.05-1.22]per year], positive fluid balance (1.06 [1.01-1.11]per 100 mL), and treatment with Tocilizumab (25.0 [3.5-180]) were independently associated with inpatient death, while higher platelets (0.65 [0.47-0.89]per 50 x 103/ml) and treatment with intermediate dose anticoagulants (0.08 [0.02, 0.43]) were protective. Among other race/ethnic groups, higher total bilirubin (1.75 [0.94, 3.25]per 0.2 mg/dL) and higher maximal lactate (1.43 [0.96, 2.13]per mmol/L) were marginally associated with increased death, while Tocilizumab treatment was marginally protective (0.24 [0.05, 1.25]).

The objective of this work was to study the presence of T. foetus and some associated risk factors in cats from densely housed origins and with a reported history of chronic diarrhea. Animals enrolled in this study were family cats (n=15) acquired from pet shops, shelters or breeding centers and cattery cats belonging to one breeding center (n=28) and two cat shelters (A and B, n=25 each). In the catteries, a follow-up analysis for a period of up to 2 months was also performed to determine the parasite shedding pattern in feces and the incidence of infection. Fecal samples were analyzed using in vitro culture and a PCR technique. T. foetus was detected in a total of 38.7% (36/93) of the cats with chronic diarrhea. Parasite infection was similarly detected in family cats and cattery animals (40% versus 38.4%). In the catteries, the parasite was detected in 50%, 44% and 20% of the animals from the breeding center and shelters A and B, respectively. The follow-up analysis showed that 58.3% of infected cats intermittently shed trophozoites in their feces, with an incidence of 23.1%. Investigation of potential risk factors showed that cats 1 year old were more likely to be infected than older cats (57.1% versus 27.3%; P<0.05).

In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of piperine loaded or not into two nanostructured systems (named NS-A and NS-B) prepared by the nanoprecipitation method. The Ae. aegypti larvae were exposed to different concentrations of piperine loaded or not (2 to 16 ppm) and the mortality was investigated after 24, 48, and 72 hours. The nanostructures prepared were spherical in shape with narrow size distribution and great encapsulation efficiency. The lethal concentration 50 (LC50) for non-loaded piperine were 13.015 ppm (24 hours), 8.098 ppm (48 hours), and 7.248 ppm (72 hours). The LC50 values found for NS-A were 35.378 ppm (24 hours), 12.091 ppm (48 hours), and 8.011 ppm (72 hours), whereas the values found for NS-B were 21.267 ppm (24 hours), 12.091 ppm (48 hours), and 8.011 ppm (72 hours). Collectively, these findings suggested that non-loaded piperine caused higher larval mortality in the first hours of exposure while the nanostructured systems promoted the slow release of piperine and thereby increased the larvicidal activity over time. Therefore, loading piperine into nanostructured systems might be an effective tool to improve the larval control of vector Ae. aegypti.","output":"Polymer-based nanostructures loaded with piperine as a platform to improve the larvicidal activity against Aedes aegypti."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has proven to be a serious challenge for the Spanish healthcare system.

In addition, the model also explores the possibility of establishing a new facility. Hybrid facilities are considered because of their huge cost-cutting potential due to equipment sharing and space sharing. The capacity of hybrid facilities can be expanded to a predefined limit to process returned products without hampering forward logistics operations. However, if a product cannot be repaired at the warehouse, it is transported to the plant for remanufacturing. The model optimizes the overall configuration and operation cost of the production-distribution network. The production-distribution model developed in the paper is a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) that is later transformed to a mixed-integer linear program to reduce the solution time.

Thus, the micromotors with catalysts or magnetic elements in their cavities, as well as with the corresponding structural color coding, could be achieved by using the platinum and ferric oxide dispersed pre-gel to fill and duplicate the stomatocyte colloidal crystal clusters. We have demonstrated that the self-movement of these structural color-barcode micromotors could efficiently accelerate the mixing speed of the detection sample and greatly increase the probe-target interactions towards faster and more sensitive single or multiplex detection, and the magnetism of these barcode micromotors enables the flexible collection of the micromotors, which could facilitate the detection processes. These features make the stomatocyte structural color-barcode micromotors ideal for biomedical applications.","output":"Stomatocyte structural color-barcode micromotors for multiplex assays."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, health workers represented a group particularly vulnerable to work-related stress, but prevention and management of psychiatric symptoms are still under evaluation.

DESIGN: A single-centre retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A level 2 trauma centre in Breda, The Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: All patients with trauma seen at the ED between 11 March and 10 May 2020 (the first Dutch lockdown period) were included in this study. Comparable groups were generated for 2019 and 2018. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were the total number of patients with trauma admitted to the ED and the trauma mechanism. Secondary outcomes were triage categories, time of ED visit, trauma severity (Injury Severity Score (ISS) >12), anatomical region of injury and treatment. RESULTS: A total of 4674 patients were included in this study. During the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a decrease of 32% in traumatic injuries at the ED (n=1182) compared with the previous years 2019 (n=1717) and 2018 (n=1775) (p<0.001). Sports-related injuries decreased most during the lockdown (n=164) compared with 2019 (n=386) and 2018 (n=367) (p<0.001). We observed more frequent injuries due to a fall from standing height (p<0.001) and work-related injuries (p<0.05). The mean age was significantly higher (mean 48 years vs 42 and 43 years). There was no difference in anatomical place of injury or ISS >12. The amount of patients admitted for emergency surgery was significantly higher (14.6% vs 9.4%; 8.6%, p<0.001). Seven patients (0.6%) tested positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Measures taken in the COVID-19 outbreak result in a predictable decrease in the total number of patients with trauma, especially sports-related trauma. Although the trauma burden on the emergency room appears to be lower, more people have been admitted for trauma surgery, possibly due to increased throughput in the operating theatres.","output":"Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic during the first lockdown in the Netherlands on the number of trauma-related admissions, trauma severity and treatment: the results of a retrospective cohort study in a level 2 trauma centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A pandemic brought on by COVID-19 has created a scalable health crisis.

We explored how health crises affect clinical clerkships using the COVID-19 pandemic as an example. METHODS: In a constructivist qualitative study, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders (i.e. medical students and doctors) from two teaching hospitals and 10 different departments. We used thematic analysis to investigate our data and used stakeholder theory as a sensitising concept. RESULTS: We identified three themes: (1) emotional triggers and reactions; (2) negotiation of legitimacy; and (3) building resilience. Our results suggest that the health crisis accentuated already existing problems in clerkships, such as students' feelings of low legitimacy, constant negotiation of roles, inconsistencies navigating rules and regulations and low levels of active participation. Medical students and doctors adapted to the new organisational demands by developing increased resilience. Students responded by reaching out for guidance and acceptance to remain relevant in the clinical clerkships. Doctors developed a behaviour of closing in and focused on managing themselves and their patients. This created tension between these two stakeholder groups. CONCLUSION: A health crisis can critically disrupt the hierarchical structure within the clinical clerkships and exacerbate existing conflicts between stakeholder groups. When medical students are not perceived as legitimate stakeholders in clinical clerkships during a health crisis, their attendance is perceived as unnecessary or even a nuisance.

FDA-approved drugs and compounds in iPPI-DB, which comprise PPI inhibitors and stabilizers, were evaluated using QEPPI.

We evaluated the discriminatory performance of QEPPI and RO4 for datasets of PPI-target compounds and FDA-approved drugs using F-score and other indices. The F-scores of RO4 and QEPPI were 0.451 and 0.501, respectively. QEPPI showed better performance and enabled quantification of drug-likeness for early-stage PPI drug discovery.

Although multiple machine learning models have been proposed to address this issue, based on the need for extensive data pre-processing and feature engineering, these models have not been validated or implemented outside of the original study site. Methods: In this study, we propose CovRNN, recurrent neural network (RNN)-based models to predict COVID-19 patients' outcomes, using their available electronic health record (EHR) data on admission, without the need for specific feature selection or missing data imputation. CovRNN is designed to predict three outcomes: in-hospital mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, and long length of stay (LOS >7 days). Predictions are made for time-to-event risk scores (survival prediction) and all-time risk scores (binary prediction). Our models were trained and validated using heterogeneous and de-identified data of 247,960 COVID-19 patients from 87 healthcare systems, derived from the Cerner(R) Real-World Dataset (CRWD). External validation was performed using three test sets (approximately 53,000 patients). Further, the transferability of CovRNN was validated using 36,140 de-identified patients' data derived from the Optum(R) de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record v.1015 dataset (2007-2020). Findings: CovRNN shows higher performance than do traditional models. It achieved an area under the receiving operating characteristic (AUROC) of 93% for mortality and mechanical ventilation predictions on the CRWD test set (vs. 91.5% and 90% for light gradient boost machine (LGBM) and logistic regression (LR), respectively) and 86.5% for prediction of LOS > 7 days (vs. 81.7% and 80% for LGBM and LR, respectively). For survival prediction, CovRNN achieved a C-index of 86% for mortality and 92.6% for mechanical ventilation. External validation confirmed AUROCs in similar ranges. Interpretation: Trained on a large heterogeneous real-world dataset, our CovRNN model showed high prediction accuracy, good calibration, and transferability through consistently good performance on multiple external datasets. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a COVID-19 predictive model that delivers high accuracy without the need for complex feature engineering.","output":"CovRNN - A recurrent neural network model for predicting outcomes of COVID-19 patients: model development and validation using EHR data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection assays are crucial for gathering seroepidemiological information and monitoring the sustainability of antibody response against the virus.

Detection of IgG antibodies, rather than IgM or total antibodies, against RBD is likely to play a larger role in understanding antibody-mediated protection and vaccine response.

Evidence in jails is especially scarce. Methods: Between July 8, 2020 and April 30, 2021 we performed SARS-CoV-2 serology testing and administered a questionnaire among residents and staff in four Northern California jails. We analyzed seroprevalence in conjunction with demographic factors and survey responses of self-perceived COVID-19 risk, recent illness, COVID-19 test results, and symptom reporting behaviors. We additionally assessed COVID-19 policies in practice and evaluated their impacts on court dates, mental health, and routine health care. We engaged stakeholder representatives, including incarcerated individuals and their advocates, to guide study design, conduct, and interpretation. Findings: We enrolled 788 incarcerated individuals and 380 staff across four county jails. Most seropositive individuals had not previously tested positive for COVID-19, despite many suspecting prior infection. Among incarcerated participants, we identified deficient access to face masks and prevalent symptom underreporting associated with fears of isolation and perceptions of medical neglect in jail. Incarcerated participants also reported substantial hindrances to court cases and reductions in routine health care due to COVID-19. Incarcerated individuals and staff both cited worsened mental health due to COVID-19, which for incarcerated individuals was largely attributable to further isolation from loved ones and other pandemic restrictions on recreation and programming. Conclusions: Perceptions of inadequate protection from COVID-19 were pervasive among incarcerated individuals. Simultaneously, restrictive measures compounded poor mental health and fostered fears of isolation that undermined effective infection control. Custody officials should work to systematically improve provision of masks, understand and mitigate fears and mistrust, and take proactive steps to minimize the detrimental impacts of restrictive policies on residents' mental health and well-being.","output":"COVID-19 policies in practice and their direct and indirect impacts in Northern California jails"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the rate of asymptomatic recurrence of stage 1 endometrioid endometrial cancer and assess the role of routine hospital follow-up after treatment. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case-note review study of women who were diagnosed with stage 1 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma at Queens Hospital, Romford, between January 2008 and December 2016. RESULTS: We included 299 patients with a median follow-up period of 44.4 months. All the patients underwent total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Adjuvant radiotherapy was offered to the patients subsequent to discussions in the multidisciplinary team meeting in accordance with the risk stratification criteria. There was no significant correlation between the risk factors and disease recurrence. In total, 11 patients presented with recurrent disease with original staging: 1a, n=6/199; and 1b, n=5/100. Four patients presented with vaginal bleeding due to vault recurrence and one patient with abdominal pain due to pelvic mass. Locoregional recurrence was an incidental finding in two other patients. Four patients presented with symptomatic distant metastases to the lung (n=2), liver (n=1), and bone (n=1). No asymptomatic recurrences were identified on routine follow-ups, despite several hospital appointments and clinical examinations. The recurrence rate for patients with stage 1a and 1b, grade 1, and grade 2 disease was 3.53%, and that for patients with stage 1a, grade 1, and grade 2 disease was 2.7%. CONCLUSION: Routine clinical examinations have a low yield in finding recurrence in asymptomatic women and should be questioned for their value, considering the limited resources of the National Health Service (NHS).

Several observational studies reported the rate of venous and arterial thrombotic events in patients infected with COVID-19, with conflicting results . The aim of this multicentre study was to estimate the rate of thrombotic and bleeding events in hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. Method: multicenter study of 636 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. ?Result: Twelve patients were diagnosed with VTE 1.89% (95% CI, 1.18C3). The rate in the non-ICU group was 0.19% (95% CI, 0.04C0.84) compared to 10.38% (95% CI, 6.45C16.27) in the ICU group. Fourteen patients were diagnosed with an arterial event with an overall rate of 2.20% (95% CI, 1.43C3.38). The rate in the non-ICU group was 0.94% (95% CI, 0.46C0.1.93) and 8.49% (95% CI, 5.01C14.04) in the ICU group. The overall composite events rate was 2.99% (95% CI, 2.06C4.31). The composite events rate in the non-ICU group was 0.94% (95% CI, 0.46C0.1.93) and 13.21% (95% CI, 8.7C19.54) in the ICU group. Eleven patients developed bleeding with an overall rate of 1.73% (95% CI, 1.06C2.81). The bleeding rate in the non-ICU group was 0.19% (95% CI, 0.04C0.84), and 9.43% (95% CI, 5.72C15.16) in the ICU group. Of the selected risk factors, the only risk factor that predicted VTE and the composite outcome, was the baseline D-dimer. (OR 1.31, 95% CI, 1.084-1.573, p=0.005) and composite events (OR 1.32, 95% CI, 1.126-1.555, p=0.0007). Conclusion: Of 636 adults with COVID-19, the rate of VTE was similar to the rate of hospitalized patients with a similar degree of critical illness. In contrast to the risk of VTE, we found a high rate of arterial and bleeding complications in patients admitted to ICU. An elevated D-dimer at baseline could predict a thrombotic complication in the COVID-19 patients, which may assist in the identification of these patients. Given the high rate of bleeding, the current study suggests that the intensification of anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients beyond the standard of care, should be pursued with caution and is best evaluated in a randomised controlled study.","output":"High Rate of Bleeding and Arterial Thrombosis in COVID-19: Saudi Multicenter Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The COVID pandemic has greatly impacted cancer care, with survivorship care being accorded low priority. We aimed to assess the impact of the COVID pandemic on survivorship services at our centre, as well as on survivors of childhood cancer (CCS). METHODS: We analyzed the trends in survivorship care at our centre from March 2020 to June 2021 compared to previous years. We also conducted an online survey of adolescent and young adult (AYA-CCS) following up at the After Completion of Treatment Clinic, Mumbai, to assess the impact of the COVID pandemic and ensuing restrictions on our cohort of survivors. Sibling responses were used as comparator (CTRI/2020/11/029029). RESULTS: There was a decrease in in-person follow-ups and increase in remote follow-ups over the first few months of the pandemic. While in-person visits steadily increased after October 2020 and reached pre-pandemic numbers, distant follow-ups continue to be higher than pre-pandemic. Evaluable responses from the survey of 88 AYA-CCS and 25 siblings revealed new-onset health concerns in 29.5% of AYA-CCS, missed follow-up visit in 52% and varying degrees of mental health issues in 12.5%. While most survivors were able to cope with the stresses of the pandemic, 20% of siblings reported being unable to cope. CONCLUSIONS: Survivorship services continue to be affected well into the pandemic, with increased use of distant follow-ups. While AYA-CCS experienced significant physical, mental health issues and psychosocial concerns as a result of the COVID pandemic, they coped better than siblings during this stressful time, possibly due to multiple, holistic support systems including family, peer support groups and healthcare team.

The subacute phase of LBP presents an opportune time to prevent chronicity and lessen recurrence. The goal of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to determine the relative effectiveness of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) training and a progressive exercise program (PEP) on improving physical performance, pain, and torso strength in U.S. service members with subacute LBP, compared to standard primary care management (PCM) alone. METHODS: This is an Institutional Review BoardCapproved protocol for an RCT conducted with active duty military personnel (n = 128) at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, between April 2018 and March 2020. Participants were randomized to receive NMES (n = 43), PEP (n = 42), or PCM (n = 43) for 9 weeks. Outcome measures of physical performance (sit-ups, push-ups, walking, and torso endurance), torso muscle strength (flexion and extension), and pain were assessed at baseline and after 3, 6, and 9 weeks. Analysis was intent-to-treat using linear mixed effects models. A sensitivity analysis was performed to address the protocol deviations that occurred in response to coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, which required rescheduling 17 in-person study visits to home assessments at 9-week testing. RESULTS: Evidence was found for group differences in physical performance for sit-ups and push-ups, with NMES showing greater improvement than PCM. The two groups showed similar improvements in torso muscle strength, although the NMES groups may show better improvement during early treatment. No group differences in pain levels were observed during the intervention, and all groups improved during the course of the study period. The amount of NMES muscle stimulation was directly related to the level of improvement, which was not the case for the hours reported for PEP exercise. CONCLUSION: In an active duty population with subacute LBP, integrating NMES strength training into the rehabilitation therapy may offer a modest benefit for increasing sit-ups and push-ups and improving torso strength.","output":"Non-pharmacological Home Therapies for Subacute Low Back Pain in Active Duty Military Personnel: A Randomized Controlled Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: TDR, The Special Programme for Research and Training hosted at the World Health Organization, has long supported Low- and Middle-Income Countries in strengthening research capacity through three training programmes: the Postgraduate Training Scheme (PGTS), the Clinical Research and Development Fellowship (CRDF), and the Structured Operational Research Training InitiaTive (SORT IT). In the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed whether those trained through these programmes were involved in the COVID-19 response and if so, in which area(s) of the emergency response they were applying their skills. Methods: From the records for each training programme, we identified the individuals who had completed training during the relevant timespan of each programme: 1999-2018 for the CRDF scheme, 2015-2020 for PGTS, and 2009-2019 for SORT-IT. Between March and April 2020, we sent trainees an online questionnaire by e-mail. Results: Out of 1254 trained, 1143 could be contacted and 699 responded to the survey. Of the latter, 411 were involved with the COVID-19 response, of whom 315 (77%) were applying their acquired skills in 85 countries. With some overlap between programmes, 84% of those trained through CRDF were applying their skills in 27 countries, 91% of those trained through PGTS were applying their skills in 19 countries, and through SORT IT, this was 73% in 62 countries.

Measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic had and continue to have a particularly strong impact on non-formal and informal learning, which are important features of out-of-class on-line STEM workshops combining science, technology, engineering and mathematics. We developed and carried out online STEM workshops for approximately 250 students during times of isolation in the spring and summer of 2020. To identify potential success factors and stumbling blocks for designing and implementing online STEM workshops, we conducted a qualitative interview-based study with a selection of eight experts in the summer and autumn 2020, i.e. after the STEM workshops. The experts were Austrian and German teachers who planned and implemented STEM workshops for students age 10 to 18. Our collected data was examined using techniques of grounded theory approaches. Using techniques of qualitative interview studies and grounded theory approaches, we found that removing learning barriers and creating new types of learning spaces, online socio-constructivist learning, and teachers' TPACK for STEM Workshops are important factors when considering and designing STEM workshops for online learning environments. These same factors will also be central when planning and implementing online STEM workshops in post-COVID-19 times. To facilitate student participation and to increase social interaction are critical elements for practitioners working on online STEM workshopsboth during and after COVID-19.

During the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, an increased avoidance of the emergency departments for non-COVID-19 illnesses has been reported in the medical literature. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic caused increased number of orchiectomies in pediatric patients presenting with acute testicular torsion compared to pre-COVID-19 period. STUDY DESIGN: A total number of 119 pediatric patients who underwent surgery for acute testicular torsion from January 2019 to December 2020 were enrolled in retrospective multi-center study from six institutions in Croatia. The patients were divided in two groups. The first group (pre-COVID-19) consisted of the patients who underwent surgery before COVID-19 pandemic (n=68), while the second group (COVID-19) consisted of the patients who underwent surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic (n=51). Main outcomes of the study were orchiectomy rates and time from onset of the symptoms to emergency department presentation. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic period 43.1% (22/51) of the patients underwent orchiectomy while orchiectomy was performed in 16.2% (11/68) of the patients from the pre-COVID group (p=0.001). Median time from onset of the symptoms to emergency department presentation during COVID-19 pandemic and pre-COVID-19 periods was 14h (IQR 5, 48) and 6h (IQR 3, 22) (p=0.007), respectively. A higher proportion of patients waited over 24 h to present to emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-COVID-19 period (47% vs 8.8%, p=0.007). CONCLUSION: During COVID-19 pandemic a significantly higher rates of orchiectomies and increase in delayed presentations for testicular torsion was found.

In order to identify novel pro-viral host cell factors, we screened a haploid insertion-mutagenized mouse embryonic cell library for clones that rendered them resistant to the zoonotic Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV; family Phleboviridae, order Bunyavirales). This screen returned the Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related protein 1 (LRP1, or CD91) as top hit, a 600 kDa plasma membrane protein known to be involved in a wide variety of cell activities. Inactivation of LRP1 expression in human cells reduced RVFV infection at the early stages of infection, including the particle attachment to the cell. In the highly LRP1-positive human HuH-7 cell line, LRP1 was required for the early infection stages also of Sandfly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV; family Phleboviridae, order Bunyavirales), vesicular stomatitis (VSV; family Rhabdoviridae, order Mononegavirales), Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV, family Picornaviridae), and the coronaviruses MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2. While for RVFV, EMCV, and MERS-CoV the replication cycle could eventually catch up, LRP1 requirement for the late infection stage in HuH-7 cells was observed for SFSV, La Crosse virus (LACV; family Peribunyaviridae, order Bunyavirales), VSV, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2. For SARS-CoV-2, the absence of LRP1 stably reduced viral RNA levels in human lung Calu-3 cells, and both RNA levels and particle production in the hepatic HuH-7 cells.

Original models estimated as many as 1,157,000 additional child and 56,700 maternal deaths globally due to health service interruptions. To reduce potential impacts to populations related to RMNCH service delivery, national governments in Kenya, Mozambique, Uganda, and Zimbabwe swiftly issued policy guidelines related to essential RMNCH services during COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued recommendations to guide countries in preserving essential health services by June of 2020. METHODS: We reviewed and extracted content related to family planning (FP), antenatal care (ANC), intrapartum and postpartum care and immunization in national policies from Kenya, Uganda, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe from March 2020 to February 2021, related to continuation of essential RMNCH services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a standardized tool, two to three analysts independently extracted content, and in-country experts reviewed outputs to verify observations. Findings were entered into NVivo software and categorized using pre-defined themes and codes. The content of each national policy guideline was compared to WHO guidance related to RMNCH essential services during COVID-19. RESULTS: All four country policy guidelines considered ANC, intrapartum care, FP, and immunization to be essential services and issued policy guidance for continuation of these services. Guidelines were issued in April 2020 by Mozambique, Kenya, and Uganda, and in June 2020 by Zimbabwe. Many elements of WHOs 2020 recommendations were included in country policies, with some notable exceptions. Each policy guideline was more detailed in some aspects than others  for example, Kenyas guidelines were particularly detailed regarding FP service provision, while Ugandas guidelines were explicit about immediate breastfeeding. All policy guidance documents contained a balance of measures to preserve essential RMNCH services while reducing COVID-19 transmission risk within these services. CONCLUSIONS: The national policy guidelines to preserve essential RMNCH services in these four countries reflected WHO recommendations, with some notable exceptions for ANC and birth companionship. Ongoing revision of country policy guidelines to adapt to changing pandemic conditions is recommended, as is further analysis of subnational-level policies.","output":"Keeping essential reproductive, maternal and child health services available during COVID-19 in Kenya, Mozambique, Uganda and Zimbabwe: analysis of early-pandemic policy guidelines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, interest has increased in regenerative practices as a strategy for transforming food systems and solving major environmental problems such as biodiversity loss and climate change.

The paper begins with a brief review of debates over sustainable food systems and the varying ways that regenerative food systems have been defined and theorized. Then, it provides the theoretical backing of the frameworkthe conservation of change principlewhich is an interpretation of the laws of thermodynamics and theories of adaptive change as relevant to the regenerative capacity of living systems. Next, the paper introduces the framework itself, which comprises two independent but intersecting dimensions of food systems organization: resource diversity and livelihood flexibility. These two dimensions result in four archetypical regimes for food systems: degenerative, regenerative, impoverished, and coerced. The paper defines each and offers real-world examples.

In recent times AUC has found broad application in the biopharmaceutical industry as a first-principle means for quantitatively characterizing biopharmaceuticals. Boundary sedimentation velocity AUC (SV-AUC) analysis is widely used to assess protein aggregation, fragmentation and conformational variants in the same solvents used during drug development and production. SV-AUC is especially useful for the analysis of drug substance, drug product and dosing solution, where other techniques may exhibit solvent matrix issues or concentration limitations. Recently, the only manufacturer of the analytical ultracentrifuge, released its newest (third generation) analytical ultracentrifuge, the Optima, in early 2017 to replace its aging 2nd generation XL series ultracentrifuges. However, SV-AUC data from four Optima units used in conducting characterization work on adeno-associated virus (AAV) has shown evidence of sample convection. Further investigation reveals that this problem arises from the temperature control system design, which is prone to producing destabilizing temperature induced density gradients that can lead to density inversions. The observed convection impacts both the qualitative and quantitative data generated by the Optima. The problem is intermittent and variable in severity within a given Optima unit and between Optima units. This convection appears to be mainly associated with low rotor speeds and dilute samples in dilute solvents, such as AAV samples in formulation buffers containing relatively low concentrations of salts, sugars, etc. Under these conditions it is found that a sufficiently robust stabilizing density gradient is not always present during sedimentation, making the sample susceptible to convection by localized density inversions. Because SV-AUC is used as an analytical tool in making critical decisions in the development and quality control of biotherapeutics, it is imperative to alert users about this potential problem. In general special attention to data quality needs to be made by those researchers working with very large biopharmaceutical particles (e.g. gene therapy products that involve viral vectors or nanoparticles), where the conditions leading to convection are most likely to occur. It is important to note that the XL series analytical ultracentrifuges do not suffer from this problem, indicating that this problem is unique to the Optima. Attributes that reveal the presence of this problem and strategies for its elimination or minimization are provided.","output":"Boundary convection during velocity sedimentation in the Optima analytical ultracentrifuge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes an outbreak of COVID-19 disease in humans with the aid of spike protein. It consists of a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that recognizes and binds to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The aim of this study was to examine the mutational effect of spike protein on the sequence through an interaction study of the mutant spike protein and the human ACE2 protein at the structural level. A total of 17,227 spike proteins from Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania, South America, and North America were compared to the Wuhan spike protein reference sequence (Wuhan-Hu-1). The structural and stability implications of D614G, N501Y, and S477N mutations were evaluated. The binding affinity between mutated RBD and human ACE2 protein was also studied. The D614G mutation may have originated in Germany, Europe based on the date of the first sample collection report. It is now widely circulated all over the world with most occurrences in North America. The mutations N501Y and S477N may have originated from Oceania based on the date of the first sample collection report and also have the highest occurrences in Oceania. Based on the computational analysis of mutational effects, the D614G, N501Y, and S477N mutations decreased stability and were tolerated. For disease propensity prediction, N501Y was more prone to disease compared to D614G, while S477N was not prone to disease. The mutation of D to G at position 614 and S to N at position 477 for secondary structure prediction shows no changes in secondary structure while remaining in the coil region, whereas the mutation of N to Y at position 501 changes from coil structure to extended strand.

In this study, we have selected 40 antiviral phytochemicals to find out the best candidates which can act as potent inhibitors against the main protease. Molecular docking is performed using AutoDock Vina and GOLD suite to determine the binding affinities and interactions between the phytochemicals and the main protease. The selected candidates strongly interact with the key Cys145 and His41 residues. To validate the docking interactions, 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the five top-ranked inhibitors including hypericin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, baicalin, glabridin, and -ketoamide-11r are performed. Principal component analysis (PCA) on the MD simulation discloses that baicalin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, and -ketoamide-11r have structural similarity with the apo-form of the main protease. These findings are also strongly supported by root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), and solvent accessible surface area (SASA) investigations. PCA is also used to find out the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) for pattern recognition of the best ligands. Multiple linear regression (MLR) of QSAR reveals the R(2) value of 0.842 for the training set and 0.753 for the test set. Our proposed MLR model can predict the favorable binding energy compared with the binding energy detected from molecular docking.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of rs12252 C polymorphism, BMI, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia with mild flu in an Iranian population. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study, including 79 mild flu and 125 flu-negative individuals attending primary care centers of three provinces of Iran (i.e, Markazi, Semnan, and Zanjan). Pharyngeal swab specimens were collected from all participants, and were subjected to RNA and DNA extractions for Real-time PCR and PCR tests. All PCR products were then sequenced to find T/C polymorphisms in the rs12252 region. Data on demographic, anthropometric, and clinical variables were collected from participants medical records available in the primary care centers. The data was analyzed using DNASIS (v. 2.5) and Stata (v.11) software. RESULTS: All participants were of Fars ethnic background. The allele frequency for rs12252-C was found to be 9.49% among cases and 2.40% among controls. Carriers of the rs12252 C allele (CT + CC genotypes) showed 5.92 folds increase in the risk of mild flu comparing to the T allele homozygotes (P value: 0.007). We also found a significant positive association between rs12252 C allele heterozygote and mild flu (OR: 7.62, P value: 0.008), but not in C allele homozygote group (OR: 2.71, P value: 0.406). Similarly, we did not find a significant association between mild flu and BMI (OR: 1.06, P value: 0.087), diabetes (OR: 0.61, P value: 0.392), and hypercholesterolemia (OR: 0.50, P value: 0.393) in multivariable logistic regression. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study evaluating the association between rs12252 polymorphisms, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and BMI and susceptibility to mild flu in an Iranian population. Our results suggest a significant positive association between mild flu and rs12252 C allele heterozygous and carriage. Future replication of the strong association observed here between rs12252 C allele carriage and mild flu might candidate this polymorphism as a genetic marker for early screening of susceptibility to mild flu. Lack of significant association between C allele homozygous and mild flu, observed in this study, might be the result of small sample size in this group. TRIAL REGISTRATION: IR.PII.REC.1395.3.

Along with small size vanadium complexes a vanadium-containing derivative of the peptide-like inhibitor N3 (N-[(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)carbonyl]alanyl-l-valyl-N1-((1R,2Z)-4-(benzyloxy)-4-oxo-1-{[(3R)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl] methyl }but-2-enyl)-l-leucinamide) was designed from the crystal structure with PDB entry code 6LU7. On theoretical grounds our consensus docking studies evaluated the binding affinities at the hitherto known binding site of Mpro for binding vanadium complexes. The site is an evolutionarily fold unit which is structurally conserved among proteins belonging to the same enzyme class (EC 3). The highly conserved sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 protease Mpro has a Cys-His dyad at the catalytic site that are characteristic of metal-dependent or metal-inhibited hydrolases. Therefore, Mpro was superimposed to the human protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (hPTP1B) which is a key regulator at an early stage in the signalling cascade of the insulin hormone for glucose uptake into cells. Comparatively, the vanadium-ligand binding site of hPTP1B is located in a larger groove on the surface of Mpro. Vanadium constitutes a well-known phosphate analogue. Hence, its study offers possibilities to design promising vanadium-containing binders to SARS-CoV-2. Given the favourable physicochemical properties of vanadium nuclei, such organic vanadium complexes could become drugs not only for pharmacotherapy but also diagnostic tools for early infection detection in patients. This work presents the in silico design of a potential lead vanadium compound.

Robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention (R-PCI) can be advantageous during a pandemic to facilitate procedural distancing for cath lab personnel and to decrease the cumulative amount of PPE employed. METHODS All patients who underwent R-PCI during the early phase of the pandemic were evaluated at a single institution. Procedural characteristics, complexity of disease, and use of adjunctive imaging or physiology were queried. Mean R-PCI time, procedure and fluoroscopy times, radiation dose, and contrast volume were collected. Cost of PPE incurred with R-PCI was evaluated in comparison with traditional cases. Furthermore, procedural distancing from patients for operators was objectively quantified to compare with traditional cath lab cases. RESULTS Thirteen patients were treated using R-PCI. Radial access site was utilized in 54% and the left circumflex artery was treated most frequently (in 50% of cases). The complexity of cases performed was illustrated by revascularization of chronic total occlusions in 2 patients (14%) as well as adjunctive intravascular ultrasound or instantaneous wave-free ratio in 4 patients (29%). Mean R-PCI time was 45.38 minutes, manual time was 25.66 minutes, and total procedure time was 71.08 minutes. Average fluoroscopy time was 18.27 minutes, contrast volume was 143.85 mL, and radiation dose was 747.15 mGy. R-PCI was more cost effective, with total average PPE cost of $330.71 in comparison with $496.08 for traditional PCI (absolute difference, $165.36). Furthermore, R-PCI demonstrated substantial procedural distancing of operators from patients (8.14 feet for R-PCI vs 2.75 feet for traditional PCI; absolute difference, 5.39 feet). CONCLUSION R-PCI could be a promising strategy during a pandemic by facilitating procedural distancing, minimizing staffing exposure risk, and decreasing PPE cost.","output":"Robotic Percutaneous Coronary Intervention During COVID-19 Pandemic: Outcomes and Cost Effectiveness With Procedural Distancing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Following the failure of antibody therapies in treating COVID-19 hospitalized patients we investigated the impact of viral replication on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of a hyperimmune SARS-CoV-2 Immune Globulin (CoVIG) product in treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection using the adult Syrian hamster model. METHODS: The CoVIG was manufactured from plasma donors who had recovered from COVID-19. The dose used (400 mg/kg) was based on the dose given in clinical trials to hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Hamsters were given a single dose of CoVIG two days after challenge with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (isolate NY/PV08410/2020), followed by sampling of blood, nasal, tracheal and lung tissues at different time points. The blood samples were assayed for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike binding and used to calculate PK parameters. Nasal washes, trachea, and lung samples were assayed for viral replication by PCR (sgRNA). RESULTS: CoVIG-treated hamsters showed a reduction in viral replication in the lower respiratory tract, but minimally in the upper respiratory tract, following challenge with SARS-CoV-2. Challenge with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in altered PK parameters proportionate to viral replication, resulting in decreased area under the curve (AUC), accelerated clearance and shorter half-life of CoVIG. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that in the presence of actively replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus, PK parameters are altered and should trigger an adjustment in dosing of CoVIG.","output":"Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of Human Hyperimmune Intravenous Immunoglobulin Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Adult Syrian Hamsters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of the Coronavirus SARS-2 is a major challenge that led almost all governments worldwide to take drastic measures to respond to the tragedy. Chief among those measures is the massive lockdown of entire countries and cities, which beyond its global economic impact has created some deep social and psychological tensions within populations. While the adopted mitigation measures (including the lockdown) have generally proven useful, policymakers are now facing a critical question: how and when to lift the mitigation measures? A carefully-planned exit strategy is indeed necessary to recover from the pandemic without risking a new outbreak. Classically, exit strategies rely on mathematical modeling to predict the effect of public health interventions. Such models are unfortunately known to be sensitive to some key parameters, which are usually set based on rules-of-thumb.In this paper, we propose to augment epidemiological forecasting with actual data-driven models that will learn to fine-tune predictions for different contexts (e.g., per country). We have therefore built a pandemic simulation and forecasting toolkit that combines a deep learning estimation of the epidemiological parameters of the disease in order to predict the cases and deaths, and a genetic algorithm component searching for optimal trade-offs/policies between constraints and objectives set by decision-makers. Replaying pandemic evolution in various countries, we experimentally show that our approach yields predictions with much lower error rates than pure epidemiological models in 75% of the cases and achieves a 95% R2 score when the learning is transferred and tested on unseen countries. When used for forecasting, this approach provides actionable insights into the impact of individual measures and strategies.","output":"Data-driven Simulation and Optimization for Covid-19 Exit Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic.

An important clinical question is whether laboratory hematologic parameters may act as a surrogate for imaging findings in pediatric COVID-19 pneumonia, in order to reduce exposure to ionizing radiation. The aim is to investigate the relationship between radiographic findings and hematological laboratory parameters in pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection by directly comparing the findings from both studies. Methods: : This was an institutional review board-approved retrospective study of 187 consecutive pediatric patients with microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and available initial chest radiographs at the time of diagnosis, obtained between March 2020 and December 2020. Two groups of patients were created: 1) 1st group (without radiographic evidence of COVID-19 pneumonia) and 2) second group (with radiographic evidence of COVID-19 pneumonia). Two experienced radiologists independently reviewed the initial chest radiographs for abnormalities. Patients medical records were reviewed for clinical presentation, hematological laboratory parameters, and patient outcomes. The relationship between initial chest radiographic findings and hematological laboratory parameters was evaluated between the two groups. Interobserver agreement was estimated with the Cohen k coefficient. Results: : The study population consisted of 187 chest radiographs from 187 individual pediatric patients (95 males and 92 females;mean age  SD, 10.1  6.0 years;range, 9 months C 18 years). Group 1 consisted of 103 chest radiographs (55.0%) from 103 individual pediatric patients (54 males and 49 females;mean age  SD, 12.5  5.2 years;range, 9 months C 18 years). Group 2 consisted of 84 chest radiographs (45.0%) from 84 individual pediatric patients (41 males and 43 females;mean age  SD, 7.0  5.6 years;range, 11 months C 18 years). In group 2, observed chest radiographic abnormalities included ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 75 patients (89.2%), GGO and consolidation in 6 (7.2%), peribronchial thickening in 1 patient (1.1%), consolidation in 1 patient (1.1%), and peribronchial thickening, GGO and consolidation in one patient (1.1%). In addition, group 2 patients (with radiographic abnormalities of COVID-19 pneumonia) had significantly elevated LDH ( p = 0.001) compared to group 1 patients (without radiographic findings of COVID-19 pneumonia). All pediatric patients in both groups completely recovered from COVID-19 infection. Interobserver agreement for chest radiographic findings was nearly perfect between the two reviewers in both groups (k = 0.96, p = 0.001). Conclusion: The presence of radiographic abnormalities on initial chest radiographs correlates well with hematologic laboratory abnormalities, specifically elevated LDH, in pediatric patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that hematologic laboratory parameters may act as a surrogate for chest radiography in pediatric COVID-19 pneumonia and that chest radiography may not be clinically indicated in pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection with normal LDH level, resulting in decreased exposure to ionizing radiation in this vulnerable population.","output":"Hematological laboratory parameters: may act as a surrogate of chest radiographs in Pediatric COVID-19 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 152 million individuals globally.

Dexamethasone was reported as a promising treatment option, leading to a reduction of mortality rates in severe COVID-19 disease. However, the effect of dexamethasone treatment on cardiac injury and pulmonary embolism remains largely elusive. METHODS: In total 178 critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care treatment and mechanical ventilation were recruited in three European medical centres and included in the present retrospective study. One hundred thirteen patients (63.5%) were treated with dexamethasone for a median duration of 10 days (IQR 9C10). Sixty five patients (36.5%) constituted the non-dexamethasone control group. RESULTS: While peak inflammatory markers were reduced by dexamethasone treatment, the therapy also led to a significant reduction in peak troponin levels (231 vs. 700% indicated as relative to cut off value, p = 0.001). Similar, dexamethasone resulted in significantly decreased peak D-Dimer levels (2.16 mg/l vs. 6.14 mg/l, p = 0.002) reflected by a significant reduction in pulmonary embolism rate (4.4 vs. 20.0%, p = 0.001). The antithrombotic effect of dexamethasone treatment was also evident in the presence of therapeutic anticoagulation (pulmonary embolism rate: 6 vs. 34.4%, p < 0.001). Of note, no significant changes in baseline characteristics were observed between the dexamethasone and non-dexamethasone group. CONCLUSION: In severe COVID-19, anti-inflammatory effects of dexamethasone treatment seem to be associated with a significant reduction in myocardial injury.

This mimicry may pose a challenge, as the management of both diseases is quite different. Furthermore, the temporal association of initiating treatment affects prognosis. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mainly infects the pulmonary system. However, in a patient with concomitant pulmonary tuberculosis, it can be a diagnostic challenge. CASE REPORT: A 28-year-old man of Indian origin presented with headache and vomiting. He had a brain mass on imaging suggestive of a glioma. He also had lung infiltrates and was diagnosed with a co-infection by SARS-CoV-2, by a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the GeneXpert system. The mass was excised and was found to be a tuberculoma, diagnosed by Xpert MTB. He received first-line anti-TB and treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia based on local guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: This report highlights that COVID-19 can co-exist with other infectious diseases, such as TB. A high degree of clinical suspicion is required to detect TB with atypical presentation. A co-infection of pulmonary and CNS TB with COVID-19 can present a diagnostic challenge, and appropriate patient management relies on an accurate and rapid diagnosis.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated how the IPV experienced by women in Cameroon affects their stress levels and those of their children. METHOD: We recruited 50 motherCchild dyads exposed to IPV and a control group of 25 motherCchild dyads. All mothers completed questionnaires, including the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale to assess IPV, the Sense of Coherence Scale, and the Self-Esteem Scale, to assess their psychological resources. Mothers were asked to collect 3 saliva samples from themselves and 3 from their children on a single weekday: immediately after waking up, 30 minutes after waking up, and 45 minutes after waking up. The total cortisol secretion over the first hour after awakening was determined by calculating the area under the curve with respect to the ground (AUCg). RESULTS: Mothers exposed to IPV exhibited higher total post-awakening cortisol concentrations compared with those in the control group. However, no significant difference was found between exposed and non-exposed children. In addition, higher IPV, specifically injuries, was significantly and positively associated with greater AUCg among mothers exhibiting lower self-esteem. When self-esteem was high, however, no significant effect of IPV on AUCg was observed.

Results All patients had confirmed COVID-19 infection. Non-contrast CT chest was performed for all cases;in addition, the correlation between each CT finding and disease severity or the short-term prognosis was reported. The mean age was higher for patients with unfavorable prognosis (P < 0.01). The patchy pattern was the most common, found in 532/910 patients (58.4%), the nodular pattern was the least common 123/910 (13.5%). The diffuse pattern was reported in 124 (13.6%). The ground glass density was the most common reported density in the study 512/910 (56.2%). The crazy pavement sign was reported more frequently in patients required hospitalization or ICU and was reported in 53 (56.9%) of patients required hospitalization and in 29 (40.2%) patients needed ICU, and it was reported in 11 (39.2%) deceased patients. Air bronchogram was reported more frequently in patients with poor prognosis than patients with good prognosis (16/100;26% Vs 12/220;5.4%).

Conclusion Our results confirm the important role of the initial CT findings in the prediction of clinical outcome and short-term prognosis. Some signs like subpleural lines, halo sign, reversed halo sign and nodular shape of the lesions predict mild disease and favorable prognosis. The crazy paving sign, dense vessel sign, consolidation, diffuse shape and high severity score predict more severe disease and probably warrant early hospitalization. The high severity score is most important in prediction of unfavorable prognosis.

The purpose of this study is to report the incidence of abnormal cardiovascular findings in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I student-athletes with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN This is a case series of student-athletes with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their subsequent cardiac work-up, including troponin level, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram. Additional testing was ordered as clinically indicated. SETTING This study was conducted at a single NCAA Division I institution. PARTICIPANTS Student-athletes were included if they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR or antibody testing [immunoglobulin G (IgG)] from April 15, 2020 to October 31, 2020. INTERVENTION Cardiac testing was conducted as part of postinfection screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES This study was designed to quantify abnormal cardiovascular screening results and cardiac diagnoses after SARS-CoV-2 infection in Division I collegiate athletes. RESULTS Fifty-five student-athletes tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 14 (26%) had a positive IgG and 41 (74%) had a positive PCR test. Eight abnormal cardiovascular screening evaluations necessitated further testing including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI). Two athletes received new cardiac diagnoses, one probable early cardiomyopathy and one pericarditis, whereas the remaining 6 had normal cMRIs. CONCLUSIONS These data support recent publications which recommend the de-escalation of cardiovascular testing such as cardiac MRI or echocardiogram for athletes who have recovered from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.

As a result, there is a change in the sixth amino acid from glutamic acid to valine. The affected red blood cell is then prone to polymerization and sickling crisis under conditions of low oxygen tension. One of the major causes of mortality in SCD is acute chest syndrome (ACS). On the other hand, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease that carries significant mortality and morbidity worldwide with unknown outcomes in the affected SCD population. This study was created for that reason. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report a case series of ten SCD patients who were affected by COVID-19 and required admission between May 1, 2020, and October 30, 2020, at a tertiary care hospital in Dhahran, eastern region of Saudi Arabia. Historical data were obtained retrospectively from electronic records. MS Excel was used for data entry, and SPSS version 23 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients involved in the study was 32 years, and the mean duration of symptoms was 5.7 days. None required critical care admission, and there was no mortality. All patients were discharged from hospital in good condition with no requirement of home oxygen. CONCLUSION: Although we expected a fatal outcome of SCD patients affected by COVID-19 infection, our limited case series showed favorable disease behavior and outcome, with a suspicion of underlying unclear protective mechanism from serious complications. However, further studies are required to better understand COVID-19 behavior in SCD patients.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in special groups: A single-center experience in sickle cell disease patients in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"5G is a paradigm shift for data transfer and wireless communication technology where 5G involves massive bandwidths based on high carrier frequencies Unlike 4G, 5G is highly integrative to produce a seamless user experience and universal high-rate coverage The key role of 5G is increasing data capacity, improving data rate transfer, providing better service quality, and decreasing latency Recently, COVID-19 is declared as an international epidemic More than 4 5 million confirmed cases and +308,000 death cases have been recorded around more than 209 countries on 16th May 2020 There are several insane theories about 5G technology and human health Therefore, people are burning valuable 5G infrastructure down out of fear for their health People think that 5G towers are weakening the immune system and causing the global COVID-19 pandemic This chapter reviews the data transmission revolution from 1G to 5G technology and discusses the impact of 5G technology on human health, pandemic, and business perspectives ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"The truth about 5G and COVID-19: basics, analysis, and opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study aims to help quality professionals in following a precise framework that maintains a companys performance during health pandemics. In many companies, all quality methods seem to produce performance improvement at different levels, but lean management and kaizen were superior in preparing manufacturing companies to have high readiness levels when faced with a health pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: Which quality method can help businesses in performing well during a health pandemic? In order to answer this question and be able to provide specific recommendations toward performing well in all future health pandemics, 500 manufacturing companies were selected and surveyed. The selected companies are known to use at least one quality method such as lean management, ISO 9001, European foundation for quality management (EFQM) and Six Sigma. Findings: EFQM comes second, then Six Sigma and ISO 9001. Lean creates a healthy workplace and enhances worker's health and well-being. This research helps quality professionals in following a precise framework that maintains performance during health pandemics. Whether the company uses lean or other quality methods, the framework helps in achieving pandemic readiness status. The framework is implemented in a company that does not currently use lean. Implementation resulted in significant improvement in pandemic preparedness, corporate performance and employee well-being. Originality/value: After the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, all companies should start thinking of creating a workplace that functions well during pandemics. To do that, companies should start including sanitation and health pandemic preparedness as part of their performance measurements. Using lean management and kaizen helps organizations to create a healthy workplace;clean and equipped with smaller number of workers.

Healthcare for the elderly is becoming increasingly important as the population ages and grows. The health of an Elderly patient needs frequent examination because the health deteriorates with an increasing age profile. IoT is utilized everywhere in the health industry to identify and communicate with the patients by the professional. A cyber-physical system (CPS) is used to combine physical processes with communication and computation. CPS and IoT are both wirelessly connected via information and communication technologies. The novelty of the research lies in the Honey Badger (HB) algorithm optimized Least-squares Support-Vector Machine (LS-SVM) architecture proposed in this paper for monitoring multi parameters to categorize and determine the abnormal patient details present in the dataset. Since the performance of the LS-SVM is highly dependent on the width coefficient and regularization factor, the HB algorithm is employed in this study to optimize both parameters. The HB algorithm is capable of solving the medical problem that has a complex search space and it also improves the convergence performance of the LS-SVM classifier by achieving a tradeoff between the exploration and exploitation phases. The HB optimized LS-SVM classifier predicts the patients with deteriorating health conditions and evaluates the accuracy of the results obtained. In the end, the statistical data is provided to the caretaker via a smartphone application as a monthly statistical report. The proposed model offers a Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.9478, 0.9587, and 0.9617 respectively which is relatively higher than the conventional techniques such as Decision tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

In this study, we tested the prophylactic effect of a new generation of probiotic like Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) on acute radiation-induced colonic lesions. Experiments were carried out in a preclinical model of pelvic radiation disease. Rats were locally irradiated at 29 Gray in the colon resulting in colonic epithelial barrier rupture. Three days before the irradiation and up to 3 d after the irradiation, the F. prausnitzii A2-165 strain was administered daily (intragastrically) to test its putative protective effects. Results showed that prophylactic F. prausnitzii treatment limits radiation-induced para-cellular hyperpermeability, as well as the infiltration of neutrophils (MPO+ cells) in the colonic mucosa. Moreover, F. prausnitzii treatment reduced the severity of the morphological change of crypts, but also preserved the pool of Sox-9+ stem/progenitor cells, the proliferating epithelial PCNA+ crypt cells and the Dclk1+/IL-25+ differentiated epithelial tuft cells. The benefit of F. prausnitzii was associated with increased production of IL-18 by colonic crypt epithelial cells. Thus, F. prausnitzii treatment protected the epithelial colonic barrier from colorectal irradiation.

Sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins in tissues and cells of COVID-19 patients will support investigations of the biologic behavior and tissue and cell tropism of this virus. We identified commercially available affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies raised against nucleocapsid and spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 that provide sensitive and specific detection of the virus by immunohistochemistry in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Two immunohistochemistry protocols are presented that are mutually validated by the matched detection patterns of the two distinct viral antigens in virus-infected cells within autopsy lung tissue of COVID-19 deceased patients. Levels of nucleocapsid protein in the lungs of COVID-19 decedents, as measured by quantitative histo-cytometry of immunohistochemistry images, showed an excellent logClinear relationship with levels of viral nucleocapsid RNA levels, as measured by qRT-PCR. Importantly, since the nucleocapsid protein sequence is conserved across all known viral strains, the nucleocapsid immunohistochemistry protocol is expected to recognize all common variants of SARS-CoV-2. Negative controls include autopsy lung tissues from patients who died from non-COVID-19 respiratory disease and control rabbit immunoglobulin. Sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human tissues will provide insights into viral tissue and cell distribution and load in patients with active infection, as well as provide insight into the clearance rate of virus in later COVID-19 disease stages.

Although antibiotics are still effective in treating a considerable range of infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria, the alarming increase of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) induced by excessive use of antibiotics has raised global concerns. Therefore, alternative strategies must be developed to prevent and treat bacterial infections and prevent the advent of a postantibiotic era. Vaccines, one of the greatest achievements in the history of medical science, hold extraordinary potential to prevent bacterial infections and thereby reduce the need for antibiotics. Novel bacterial vaccines are urgently needed, however, and outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), naturally produced by Gram-negative bacteria, represent a promising and versatile tool that can be employed as adjuvants, antigens, and delivery platforms in the development of vaccines against Gram-negative bacteria. Here, we provide an overview of the many roles OMVs can play in vaccine development and the mechanisms behind these applications. Methods to improve OMV yields and a comparison of different strategies for OMV isolation aiming at cost-effective production of OMV-based vaccines are also reviewed.","output":"Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles as a Versatile Tool in Vaccine Research and the Fight against Antimicrobial Resistance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Treating chronic macular edema (CME) post endophthalmitis is a challenge. Use of steroids may reactivate the infection and repeated intravitreal therapy with anti-vascular growth factor inhibitors (Anti-VEGF) puts the patient again at the risk of exacerbation of inflammation or endophthalmitis. We describe a case of CME post traumatic endophthalmitis successfully treated with topical interferon therapy. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 34-year-old Asian Indian lady with a history of cat bite to her right eye and treated elsewhere as traumatic endophthalmitis with recurrent macular edema, presented to us 1 year after the injury. She had received anti-VEGF injection for same. Her medical history was non-contributory except for close contact with her cat. Therapeutic trials with oral doxycycline followed by oral albendazole with steroids, as well as repeated anti-VEGF therapy failed to prevent recurrence of CME. Patient's steroid responsiveness and reluctance for injections, made us to opt for a novel topical Interferon therapy. Macular edema resolved in 2 months. Interruption of interferon therapy due to COVID-lock down resulted in recurrence of the CME, which again responded well to interferon monotherapy. CONCLUSION: Topical interferon may have a role in the treatment of inflammatory macular edema and can serve as a, safer, economical and non-invasive treatment option compared to intravitreal steroids and anti-VEGFs.","output":"Topical interferon in recurrent inflammatory macular edema following a cat bite"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract We examine how firms adjust CEO risk-taking incentives in response to risk environments associated with their corporate social responsibility (CSR) standing.

The study of the antibodies' level to SARS-CoV-2 can be used as a confirmation test in the diagnosis of a disease, but it becomes of paramount importance in assessing population immunity resulting from a disease or vaccination, as well as in selection of convalescent plasma donors. The kits developed in our country and abroad for detecting antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus differ both in the methods of testing and in the used coronavirus antigens to which the antibodies are directed. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of five kits for the detection of IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, based on different diagnostic methods. Serum samples from 137 COVID-19 convalescents and 166 donors of blood and its components were examined. The control group consisted of 50 blood sera collected at the beginning of 2019 and 19 sera collected in 2018 (before the advent of the SARS-CoV-2 virus) and stored at -70 C. Testing was carried out in analytical systems: rapid test COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test (Colloidal Gold) (China), on an automatic immunochemical analyzer Abbott Architect? i2000 and kit SARS-CoV-2-IgG (Abbot, Chicago, IL USA), by the chemiluminescence method using an automatic analyzer of the CL series and kits of the Mindray company (China) SARS-CoV-2 IgM and SARS-CoV-2 IgG and by the enzyme immunoassay method on the kits of the companies Diagnostic Systems Ltd (Russia, Nizhny Novgorod) DS-IFA-ANTI-SARS-CoV-2-G, Xema Ltd (Federal State Budgetary Institution National Medical Research Center of Hematology of the Ministry of Health of Russia) SARS-CoV-2-IgG-IFA and Vector-Best CJSC (Russia, Novosibirsk) SARS-COV-2-IgM-IFA-BEST and SARS-COV-2-IgG-IFABEST. When comparing the results of testing 137 plasma samples on the Vector-Best and Mindray kits for IgG antibodies, 127 samples were positive, 7 samples were negative on both kits, the discrepancy was 2.2%. In the study of IgM antibodies, 32.1% were positive, and 52.6% were negative in both kits. The discrepancy rate was 15.3%. Out of 166 samples, 1 serum (0.6%) was negative in 5 kits. On the Mindray kit, IgG antibodies to the antigens of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were detected in 165 samples (99.4%), on Vector-Best - in 164 sera (98.8%), on Diagnostic systems - in 151 (90.96%), on Xema - in 154 (92.8%), and on Abbott - in 155 samples (93.4%). At the same time, 135 (81.33%) samples were positive in all kits, while 30 samples had discordant results (18.07%), and in 9 sera, specific IgG was not detected in 2 or more kits. ROC analysis revealed a high diagnostic value of all tested kits (AUC from 0.908 to 0.998), which indicates a high quality of the separation model of positive and negative samples (p < 0.001). With the cut-off set by the manufacturers, the sensitivity and specificity ranged from 82.8% and 93.3% for the Diagnostic Systems kit to 99.4% and 95.8% for the Vector-Best kit.

Traditional methods and datasets for sentiment analysis are, however, not suitable for the domain of political text as they do not consider the direction of sentiments expressed between entities. In this paper, we propose a novel NLP task of identifying directed sentiment relationship between political entities from a given news document, which we call directed sentiment extraction. From a million-scale news corpus, we construct a dataset of news sentences where sentiment relations of political entities are manually annotated. We present a simple but effective approach for utilizing a pretrained transformer, which infers the target class by predicting multiple question-answering tasks and combining the outcomes. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed method for social science research questions by analyzing positive and negative opinions between political entities in two major events: 2016 U.S. presidential election and COVID-19. The newly proposed problem, data, and method will facilitate future studies on interdisciplinary NLP methods and applications.","output":"Who Blames or Endorses Whom?

Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 has accumulated around two mutations per genome each month. The first relevant event in this context was the occurrence of the mutant D614G in the Spike gene. Moreover, several variants have emerged, including the well-characterized 20I/501Y.V1, 20H/501Y.V2, and 20J/501Y.V3 strains, in addition to those that have been detected within clusters, such as 19B/501Y or 20C/655Y in France. Mutants have also emerged in animals, including a variant transmitted to humans, namely, the Mink variant detected in Denmark. The emergence of these variants has affected the transmissibility of the virus (for example, 20I/501Y.V1, which was up to 82% more transmissible than other preexisting variants), its severity, and its ability to escape natural, adaptive, vaccine, and therapeutic immunity. In this respect, we review the literature on variants that have currently emerged, and their effect on vaccines and therapies, and, in particular, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).

At the same time, Iran is under the United States political and economic sanctions that compromised Iran's health system. Although medicines and basic medical equipment exempted from the economic sanctions, direct and indirect effects of sanctions have restricted Iran's banking system, and consequently has led to a wide range of limitation on trade, manufacturing sector, insurance and ventures. All these circumstances have meant that Iran is restricted to provide the essential basic medical equipment for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of the COVID-19. Although sanctions are not the sole reason for this high rate of mortality and morbidity in a short time period, the chronic and long-term effects of sanctions may be more tangible than their acute impact. In conclusion, providing health services is one of the major problems of Iran's health system during this pandemic that potentially influence on morbidity and mortality of the COVID-19.

The COVID-19 refers to the disease while the SARS-CoV-2 refers to the virus and is characterized by a rapid contagious capacity able to spread worldwide in a very short time. The rise in the number of infected patients and deaths is of great concern especially because symptoms are vague and similar to other forms of flu infection and corona syndrome infections characterized by fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea. According to the latest guidelines published by the World Health Organization (WHO), the diagnosis of COVID-19 must be confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or gene sequencing of specimen obtained from throat, sputum and blood samples. However, the limitations due to logistics, as well as low sensitivity and specificity diagnostic tools currently available have been reported as the main cause of high incidence of either false-negative or positive results. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The purpose of the present translational research protocol is to discuss and present the original findings from our research team on new diagnostic technique to detect four Coronaviridae family members (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, HCoV and MERS-CoV), highlighting the methodology, the procedure and the possible advantages. Moreover, the authors review the current epidemiology, precautions and safety measures for health personnel to manage patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Implementation of an effective and rapid plan of diagnosing, screening and checking is a key factor to reduce and prevent further transmission. This procedure based on rRT-PCR could be of great help to decisively validate the results obtained from more conventional diagnostic procedures such as chest computed tomography (CT) imaging and chest ultrasound.

We sought to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-nCoV with other species of Orthocoronavirinae. Methods: A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the genome sequences. A cluster tree was developed from the profiles retrieved from the presence and absence of homologs of ten 2019-nCoV proteins. The combined data were used to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-nCoV to other species of Orthocoronavirinae. Results: Our analysis reliably suggests that 2019-nCoV is most closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 and belongs to subgenus Sarbecovirus of Betacoronavirus, together with SARS coronavirus and Bat-SARS-like coronavirus. The phylogenetic profiling cluster of homolog proteins of one annotated 2019-nCoV protein against other genome sequences revealed two clades of ten 2019-nCoV proteins. Clade 1 consisted of a group of conserved proteins in Orthocoronavirinae comprising Orf1ab polyprotein, Nucleocapsid protein, Spike glycoprotein, and Membrane protein. Clade 2 comprised six proteins exclusive to Sarbecovirus and Hibecovirus.

METHODS Safety was assessed during titration versus maintenance using integrated data from two 12-week placebo-controlled studies (ARM-TD and AIM-TD) and the open-label extension study. Rates were compared for overall and serious adverse events (AEs), AEs leading to discontinuation, treatment-related AEs, common AEs (4%), and specific AEs (parkinsonism, suicidal ideation, akathisia, restlessness). RESULTS In titration versus maintenance, AE rates with placebo (n=130) were: overall, 43.1% vs 25.4%; serious, 4.6% vs 2.3%; leading to discontinuation, 3.1% vs 0; treatment-related, 26.9% vs 10.0%. For placebo, common AEs during titration were somnolence, headache, nausea, fatigue, and dry mouth; none occurred during maintenance. In titration versus maintenance, AE rates in fixed-dose deutetrabenazine 12-36 mg (n=216) were: overall, 33.3-38.9% vs 22.2-29.2%; serious, 2.8-6.9% vs 0-1.4%; leading to discontinuation, 2.8-5.6% vs 0; treatment-related, 8.3-16.7% vs 8.3-13.9%. For fixed-dose deutetrabenazine, common AEs during titration were headache, diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, depression, hypertension, and dry mouth; headache was the only common AE during maintenance.

This study aimed to investigate whether there was any correlation between changing racial preferences fueled by Trump's racist rhetoric and the health-seeking behaviors of Black patients. Through this, we explored if the number of Black patients that reported not having a primary care physician has changed, and how online search history trends researching Black physicians have also changed. Methods: This study utilized datasets from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and Google Trends.

Ursonic acid (UNA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid extracted from certain medicinal herbs such as Ziziphus jujuba. Since the pharmacological effects and associated mechanisms of UNA are not well-known, in this work, we attempt to introduce the therapeutic potential of UNA with a comparison to ursolic acid (ULA), a well-known secondary metabolite, for beneficial effects. UNA has a keto group at the C-3 position, which may provide a critical difference for the varied biological activities between UNA and ULA. Several studies previously showed that UNA exerts pharmaceutical effects similar to, or stronger than, ULA, with UNA significantly decreasing the survival and proliferation of various types of cancer cells. UNA has potential to exert inhibitory effects in parasitic protozoa that cause several tropical diseases. UNA also exerts other potential effects, including antihyperglycemic, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antioxidant activities. Of note, a recent study highlighted the suppressive potential of UNA against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Molecular modifications of UNA may enhance bioavailability, which is crucial for in vivo and clinical studies. In conclusion, UNA has promising potential to be developed in anticancer and antiprotozoan pharmaceuticals.

The characteristic symptom is severe, long-lasting paroxysmal coughing. Especially in newborns and infants, pertussis symptoms, such as leukocytosis, can become life-threatening. Despite an available vaccination, increasing case numbers have been reported worldwide, including Western countries such as Germany and the USA. Antibiotic treatment is available and important to prevent further transmission. However, antibiotics only reduce symptoms if administered in early stages, which rarely occurs due to a late diagnosis. Thus, no causative treatments against symptoms of whooping cough are currently available. The AB-type protein toxin PT is a main virulence factor and consists of a binding subunit that facilitates transport of an enzyme subunit into the cytosol of target cells. There, the enzyme subunit ADP-ribosylates inhibitory -subunits of G-protein coupled receptors resulting in disturbed cAMP signaling. As an important virulence factor associated with severe symptoms, such as leukocytosis, and poor outcomes, PT represents an attractive drug target to develop novel therapeutic strategies. In this review, chaperone inhibitors, human peptides, small molecule inhibitors, and humanized antibodies are discussed as novel strategies to inhibit PT.","output":"Novel Strategies to Inhibit Pertussis Toxin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Radiological examinations have played a crucial role in the identification and management of COVID-19 patients Therefore, knowledge and awareness of infection control among healthcare workers in radiology departments are important to prevent disease transmission This study aimed to assess the knowledge and practice of infection control for COVID-19 among healthcare workers in radiology departments in Saudi Arabia A cross-sectional, online questionnaire was administered among healthcare workers in radiology departments in Saudi Arabia in May 2020 The questionnaire consisted of demographic characteristics, profession, knowledge of infection control for COVID-19, and good practice of infection control measures for COVID-19 in radiology departments A descriptive statistical analysis and chi-square test were performed using SPSS software A total of 234 (91%) of healthcare workers replied that they have good knowledge about the precautions needed during the examination of positive COVID-19 cases in radiology departments, and 216 (84%) replied that they knew the necessary precautions when using portable X-ray machine Moreover, 191 (&gt;74%) of those surveyed agreed that wearing personal protective equipment and following the CDC sequence There was significant association between profession and good clinical practices in radiology departments regarding COVID-19 Such knowledge could limit the spread of COVID-19 among the healthcare workers in radiology departments","output":"Knowledge of COVID-19 infection control among healthcare workers in radiology departments in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obesity is a chronic disease that leads to an increased risk of mortality and morbidity, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may create a new health challenge.

Additionally, previous research suggests that people are more likely to violate rules for the benefits of close relations, rather than for their own self-interests.

Although pulmonary health has been the primary focus of studies during the early days of COVID-19, development of a comprehensive understanding of this emergent disease requires knowledge of all possible disease manifestations in affected patients. This PRISMA-compliant review focuses on cutaneous manifestations reported in COVID-19 patients. APPROACH Literature review was conducted using the PubMed database to examine various cutaneous manifestations related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Published articles (n=56) related to search criteria from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to June 30, 2020 were included. The primary literature articles included in this paper were mainly from France, Spain, Italy, and the UK. RESULTS Unique to many other symptoms of COVID-19, its cutaneous manifestations have been found in people of all age groups including children. The cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 are varied and include maculopapular, chilblain-like, urticarial, vesicular, livedoid, and petechial lesions. In addition, rashes are common in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a new and serious health condition that shares symptoms with Kawasaki disease and is likely related to COVID-19. In addition, personal protective equipment (PPE)-related skin wounds are of serious concern since broken cutaneous barriers can create an opening for potential COVID-19 infections. Innovation and Conclusion: As this virus continues to spread silently, mainly through asymptomatic carriers, an accurate and rapid identification of these cutaneous manifestations may be vital to early diagnosis and lead to possible better prognosis in COVID-19 patients. This systematic review and photo atlas provide a detailed analysis of the skin pathologies related to COVID-19.

As we can see in [1] a generalized logistic equation captures both the peaks of the total infected and the deaths. In this article our goal is to study the missing peak, i.e. the currently infected one (or total currently positive). After the April 7 the large increase in the number of swabs meant that the logistical behavior of the infected curve no longer worked. So we decided to generalize the model, introducing new parameters. Moreover, we adopt a similar approach used in [1] (for the estimation of deaths) in order to evaluate the recoveries. In this way, introducing a simple conservation law, we define a model with 4 populations: total infected, currently positives, recoveries and deaths. Therefore, we propose an alternative method to a classical SIRD model for the evaluation of the Sars-Cov-2 epidemic. However, the method is general and thus applicable to other diseases. Finally we study the behavior of the ratio infected over swabs for Italy, Germany and USA, and we show as studying this parameter we recover the generalized Logistic model used in [1] for these three countries.

They are becoming more widely used than the classical virological assays in the majority of clinical virology laboratories, and now represent a new method for the diagnosis of human viral infections. Recently, new techniques based on multiplex RT-PCR amplification followed by microarray analysis have been developed and evaluated. On the basis of amplification of viral genome-specific fragments by multiplex RT-PCR and their subsequent detection via hybridization with microorganism-specific binding probes on solid surfaces, they allow simultaneous detection and identification of multiple viruses in a single clinical sample. The management of viral central nervous system and respiratory tract infections currently represents the two main applications of the microarrays in routine virological practice. Microarrays have shown reliable results in comparison with those of referenced (RT)-PCR assays, and appear to be of major interest for the detection of a broad range of respiratory and neurotropic viruses, assessment of the pathogenicity of newly discovered or neglected viruses, and identification of multiple viral infections in clinical samples. Despite several limitations observed during the different studies performed, this new technology might improve the clinical management of patients by enlarging the range of the viruses detected, in particular in cases of severe infections leading to patient hospitalization in the intensive-care unit.

This study aims to know the percentage of patients admitted for COVID-19 who required artificial nutrition (AN), their clinical characteristics, as well as the prevalence of DRM and the risk of sarcopenia at hospital discharge and after 6 months. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, prospective study, with successive inclusion of adult patients admitted for COVID-19 in whom institutional nutritional support (NS) care protocol was applied. Those who received AN underwent a nutritional screening by Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire (SNAQ) and an assessment by Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) at hospital discharge, as well as a screening for sarcopenia (SARC-F test) and SNAQ re-test 15 days and 6 months after by a phone call. Symptoms related to food intake, anthropometric and analytical data were also collected. RESULTS: We evaluated 936 patients with a mean age of 63.7  15.3 years; predominantly male (59.7%), overweight 41%, obesity 40.4%; hypertension 52.9%; diabetes mellitus 26.6% and cancer 10.4%. The stay hospital length was 17.3  13.8 days and 13.6% patients died during hospitalization. The modality of nutritional support was: 86.1% dietary adaptation + oral nutritional supplements (ONS); 12.4% enteral nutrition (EN) by nasogastric (NG) tube; 0.9% parenteral nutrition (PN) and 0.6% EN plus PN. Focusing on patients who received AN, follow-up post discharge was possible in 62 out of 87 who survived. Of these, at the time of hospital discharge, 96.7% presented nutritional risk by SNAQ and 100% malnutrition by SGA (20% B; 80% C). During admission, 82.3% presented intense anorexia and the mean weight loss was 10.9  6 Kg (p < 0.001). Fifteen days after being discharged, 12.9% still had anorexia, while hyperphagia appeared in 85.5% of the patients and risk of sarcopenia by SARC-F was present in 87.1% of them. Six months after discharge, 6.8% still had anorexia and 3.4% hyperphagia, with a global weight gain of 4.03  6.2 Kg (p=<0.0001). Risk of malnutrition was present in only 1.7% of the patients, although risk of sarcopenia persisted in 49.2%. CONCLUSION: All patients admitted by COVID-19 for whom EN or PN were indicated following an institutional protocol still presented malnutrition at hospital discharge, and almost all showed risk of sarcopenia, that persisted in almost half of them at 6 months. These findings suggest that nutritional and functional problems persist in these patients after discharge, indicating that they require prolonged nutritional support and monitoring.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on nutritional status during the first wave of the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The largest coalition of national organizations working together to advocate for federal public policy on behalf of children and adults with disabilities is asking the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to prevent discriminatory rationing of coronavirus treatment.","output":"CCD urges government support to treat disability population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, understanding the global impact of non-pharmacological interventions (NPI) is important for formulating effective intervention strategies, particularly as many countries prepare for future waves We used a machine learning approach to distill latent topics related to NPI from large-scale international news media We hypothesize that these topics are informative about the timing and nature of implemented NPI, dependent on the source of the information (e g , local news versus official government announcements) and the target countries Given a set of latent topics associated with NPI (e g , self-quarantine, social distancing, online education, etc), we assume that countries and media sources have different prior distributions over these topics, which are sampled to generate the news articles To model the source-specific topic priors, we developed a semi-supervised, multi-source, dynamic, embedded topic model Our model is able to simultaneously infer latent topics and learn a linear classifier to predict NPI labels using the topic mixtures as input for each news article To learn these models, we developed an efficient end-To-end amortized variational inference algorithm We applied our models to news data collected and labelled by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) Through comprehensive experiments, we observed superior topic quality and intervention prediction accuracy, compared to the baseline embedded topic models, which ignore information on media source and intervention labels The inferred latent topics reveal distinct policies and media framing in different countries and media sources, and also characterize reaction to COVID-19 and NPI in a semantically meaningful manner Our PyTorch code is available on Github (htps://github com/li-lab-mcgill/covid19_media) ? 2020 Owner/Author","output":"Global Surveillance of COVID-19 by mining news media using a multi-source dynamic embedded topic model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The initial management of urethral trauma remains disputed, and there are several suitable techniques, including delayed repair and suprapubic urinary diversion as well as primary endoscopic or open alignments. The treatment choice used depends on the ruptures location and length as well as the accompanying trauma. CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old male patient was referred to the department of emergency, with the chief complaint of inability to void experienced 1 day before being admitted, after falling from a height of approximately three meters. There was a laceration to the perineum 3 cm long to the rectum, with no active bleeding. After the incident, the patient could not void, but the lower abdomen was not painful. Upon retrograde urethrography examination, contrast extravasation of the bulbous urethra was seen through the anorectal laceration. Immediate debridement and repair for the anorectal wound, then primary anastomosis for the bulbous urethra, was performed. DISCUSSION: The likelihood of an injury to the anterior urethra increases with certain clinical features, including blood in the urethral meatus, palpable bladder distention, and a butterfly appearance on the perineum. Immediate exploration and reconstruction of the urethra is recommended in urethral traumas associated with penile fractures and non-life-threatening penetrating injuries. Furthermore, small lacerations are repaired primarily, while total ruptures are treated with anastomosis. CONCLUSION: Proper identification and management of urethral rupture determines the outcome.

Study Design: We conducted a retrospective chart review on patients that received bamlanivimab in ED between November 17th, 2020 and January 15th, 2021, identified by medication usage report. Methods: We collected the following data: demographics, co-morbidities, eligibility criteria, infusion related adverse events, return visits to ED or hospitalization due to COVID-19 related complications. Results: 130 patients received bamlanivimab infusion. The population consists of 68.4%  65 years of age, 60.8% white, and an average body mass index (BMI) of 29.8 kg/m2 Almost all patients had 1 or more high risk co-morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, asthma, and malignancy.

Among 17,200 observed persons, 85.5% wore masks, with 89.7% of those persons wearing the mask correctly (overall correct mask use: 76.7%). Among persons observed indoors, 91.7% wore masks correctly. The proportion correctly wearing masks indoors varied by mask type, from 96.8% for N95-type masks and 92.2% for cloth masks to 78.9% for bandanas, scarves, and similar face coverings. Observed indoor mask use was high at these six universities with mask mandates.

Laypeoples causal attributions and expectations regarding the trajectory of mental illness have important implications for societal stigma and therapeutic orientations. Two online experimental studies investigated whether reading about fictional cases of mental illness that were explicitly situated during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with reading about the same cases without any pandemic-related contextualisation, affected attributions and expectations about Generalised Anxiety Disorder (Study 1) and Major Depressive Disorder (Study 2). Study 1 (n = 137) results showed that highlighting the onset of anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic weakened attributions to biological causes and reduced the anticipated duration of symptoms. However, Study 2 (n = 129) revealed no effects of COVID-19 contextualisation on beliefs about the cause or course of depression. The research provides preliminary evidence that the increased incidence of mental illness during the pandemic may reshape public beliefs about certain mental illnesses.

MSCs provide support for hematopoietic stem cells and have an ability to differentiate into multiple cell lines. Moreover, they have proangiogenic, protective and immunomodulatory properties. MSCs have the capacity to modulate both innate and adaptive immune responses, which accompany many diseases, by inhibiting pro-inflammatory reactions and stimulating anti-inflammatory activity. Recent findings revealed that the positive effect of MSCs is at least partly associated with the production of extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are small membrane structures, containing proteins, lipids and nuclei acids, which take part in intra-cellular communication. Many studies indicate that EVs contain protective and pro-regenerative properties and can modulate an immune response that is activated in various diseases such as CNS diseases, myocardial infarction, liver injury, lung diseases, ulcerative colitis or kidney injury. Thus, EVs have similar functions as their cells of origin and since they do not carry the risk of cell transplantation, such as tumor formation or small vessel blockage, they can be considered a potential therapeutic tool for cell-free therapy.","output":"Immunomodulatory and Regenerative Effects of Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Extracellular Vesicles: Therapeutic Outlook for Inflammatory and Degenerative Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Adherence to prescribed medical interventions can predict the efficacy of the treatment. In physical health clinics, not adhering to prescribed therapy can take the form of not attending a scheduled clinic visit (no-show appointment) or prematurely terminating treatment against the advice of the provider (self-discharge). A variety of interventions, including mobile phone apps, have been introduced for patients to increase their adherence to attending scheduled clinic visits. Limited research has examined the impact of a mobile phone app among patients attending chiropractic and rehabilitation clinic visits. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare adherence to prescribed physical health treatment among patients attending a chiropractic and rehabilitation clinic who did and did not choose to adopt a phone-based app to complement their treatment. METHODS: The medical records of new patients who presented for care during 2019 and 2020 at 5 community-based chiropractic and rehabilitation clinics were reviewed for the number of kept and no-show appointments and to determine whether the patient was provider-discharged or self-discharged. During this 24-month study, 36.28% (1497/4126) of patients seen in the targeted clinics had downloaded the Kanvas app on their mobile phone, whereas the remaining patients chose not to download the app (usual care group). The gamification component of the Kanvas app provided the patient with a point every time they attended their visits, which could be redeemed as an incentive. RESULTS: During both 2019 and 2020, the Kanvas app group was provider-discharged at a greater rate than the usual care group. The Kanvas app group kept a similar number of appointments compared with the usual care group in 2019 but kept significantly more appointments than the usual care group in 2020. During 2019, both groups exhibited a similar number of no-show appointments; however, in 2020, the Kanvas app group demonstrated more no-show appointments than the usual care group. When collapsed across years and self-discharged, the Kanvas app group had a greater number of kept appointments compared with the usual care group. When provider-discharged, both groups exhibited a similar number of kept appointments. The Kanvas app group and the usual care group were similar in the number of no-show appointments when provider-discharged, and when self-discharged, the Kanvas app group had more no-show appointments compared with the usual care group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who did or did not have access to the Kanvas app and were provider-discharged exhibited a similar number of kept appointments and no-show appointments.

However, many students lack the skills necessary to conduct research themselves. We describe a preclinical elective course designed to equip students with these skills through workshops, mentorship, and research experience. METHODS: Through an application process, we selected first-year medical (M1) students who expressed interest in conducting basic, translational, or clinical research. Throughout the yearlong curriculum, students attended a series of 10 1-hour workshops to learn the skills necessary to engage in research. Additionally, each student was paired with a peer mentor. As their final project, students completed a specific aims page based on their projected research study. RESULTS: Over the course of 3 years, 96% of students secured a research position for the summer following M1, and 36% secured positions at external institutions with nationally competitive funding, compared to 10% of their peers who did not participate in the elective. Of students, 80% indicated that this elective helped them find and secure these research positions, and 75% of students reported that they learned valuable skills not taught in their medical curriculum.

In detention facilities, timely and accurate diagnosis is essential for allowing case isolation and contact tracing to avoid the spread of the infection. Until recently, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) was the recommended method to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (ag-RDT) have emerged as point-of-care testing techniques. Objectives Here, we evaluate the use of ag-RDT for screening of individuals newly admitted to San Vittore prison (SV), a pre-trial prison, in Milan (Lombardy region, Italy), during the second SARS-CoV2 epidemic peak. Methods During the period 1 October-31 December 2020, ag-RDT and rt-PCR were performed individuals newly admitted to SV. Results Among 504 detained individuals tested, 21 (4,2%) resulted positive to rt-PCR. Of these, 10 had tested negative with ag-RDT and 11 had concordant results. Rt-PCR cycle threshold (CT) values were above 35 for the individuals with ag-RDT negative test, therefore the cases missed by the ag-RDT are unlikely to transmit disease. For all the individuals with ag-RDT positive results, CT values were below or equal to 27. In our study population, ag-RDT sensitivity was 52.4% (29.8%-74.3%), positive predictive value (PPV) was 100% and negative predictive value was 98.0% (96.8%-98.7%). Discussion Our study showed that ag-RDT is a promising and useful component of serial testing strategies in prison settings to perform SARS-CoV2 screening at admission based to its high PPV, ease of use, lower costs and resource needs.","output":"Antigenic rapid test for SARS-CoV2 screening of individuals newly admitted to detention facilities: sensibility in an asymptomatic cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aftermath of a trauma may be commonly associated with negative outcomes;however, these experiences can also lead to positive personal changes, including posttraumatic growth (PTG). Little research has explored PTG in relation to chronic or vicarious trauma, nor with regard to the social context. The current study investigated the role of perceived social support in moderating psychological distress and PTG during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional data were collected online using CloudResearch from 296 adults residing in the United States of America during August 2020. A strong positive relationship was found between impact of trauma and PTG (r = .54;p &lt; .001). Moderated multiple regression indicated psychological distress, perceived social support, age, gender, ethnicity, and education accounted for 39% of the variance in PTG;however, a significant positive relationship was only found between social support and PTG. The interaction between social support and psychological distress was significant (p = .021), with slope indicating the relationship between distress and PTG is strengthened with increasing social support. Contrary to expectations, this study found a significant relationship existed between PTG and perceived support from friends (beta = .23;p = .001) and family (beta = .14, p = .044), but not significant others. Age also predicted PTG, suggesting younger people may experience higher growth, and significant mean differences were found between Caucasian and African American participants who reported higher levels of PTG.

Very recently, the problem has been addressed with a crowdsourcing-based approach to scale up labeling efforts: to assess the truthfulness of a statement, instead of relying on a few experts, a crowd of (non-expert) judges is exploited. We follow the same approach to study whether crowdsourcing is an effective and reliable method to assess statements truthfulness during a pandemic.

It is mainly performed in high-income countries but its implementation in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is increasing. However, no aggregate data exist regarding the outcomes of this procedure in resource-limited settings. We retrospectively reviewed all cases of laparoscopy recorded from January 2007 to March 2017 at the Department of Surgery of Beira to assess the related outcomes. Moreover, we performed a systematic review of the laparoscopic practices and outcomes in low-income countries. Data from the Department of Surgery of Beira identified 363 laparoscopic procedures, mainly relating to gynecological diseases, cholelithiasis, and appendicectomy with only a 1.6% complication rate (6 cases) and a 1.9% conversion rate (7 cases) to open surgery. The systematic review showed a pooled risk of overall complications significantly lower in laparoscopic vs. open appendicectomy (OR = 0.43; 95% CI 0.19-0.97; I2 = 85.7%) and a significantly lower risk of infection (OR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.43-0.65; I2 = 0.00%). The pooled SMD in operation duration in laparoscopic vs. open appendectomy was 0.58 (95% CI -0.00; 1.15; I2 = 96.52), while the pooled SMD in hospitalization days was -1.35 (95% CI -1.87; -0.82; I2 = 96.41).

This randomized trial aimed to compare 3 popular methods of minimizing or reducing LLF in laparoscopic surgery by heating the lens using warm saline, applying anti-fog solution to the lens, and rubbing the lens with chlorhexidine solution. METHODS Ninety-six participants underwent randomization to be allocated in control (n = 24), warm saline (n = 24), anti-fog solution (n = 24), and chlorhexidine groups (n = 24). The primary outcome measure was the severity of LLF during the first 3 min after laparoscope insertion into the abdominal cavity. The severity of LLF was rated on a 10-point visual clarity scale ranging from 0 (clearest) to 10 (foggiest). The secondary outcome measures were (1) the severity of LLF during the remaining operative time other than the first 3 min, (2) the number of lens cleansings, and (3) the total time required to clean the lens. RESULTS Lens fogging during the first 3 min and remaining operative time other than the first 3 min was significantly decreased in the warm saline group compared to that in the other 3 groups (all, P < 0.001). In post hoc analysis, the anti-fog solution group was significantly foggier than the warm saline group, but clearer than the chlorhexidine and control groups. The number of lens cleansings and total time required to clean the lens were significantly lower in the warm saline and anti-fog solution groups than in the chlorhexidine and control groups (all, P < 0.05).

All patients were treated with arbidol (100mg each time, three times a day for 14 days) and moxifloxacin (0.4g each time, once a day for 7-14 days). Other data was also collected including demographic data, symptoms, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes. Results In basic characteristics, compared with the ordinary patients, the severe patients were older (median age was 63.0 years V.S 57.0 years, p=0.03), had higher proportion of hypertension (30% V.S 9%, p=0.03), higher possibility of getting fatigue and/or myalgia (26% V.S 6%, p=0.03), and had more obvious dyspnea symptom (26% V.S 3%, p=0.006). In regarding to laboratory results, we found the severe patients have higher white blood cell counts (p=0.003), neutrophil counts (p=0.007), higher levels of D-dimer (p<0.001), ALT (p<0.001) and AST (p=0.013) than the ordinary patients. After treatment of arbidol and moxifloxacin for one week, the rates of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid turning negative were 69.2% in the severe group and 77.8% in the ordinary group. A peculiar phenomenon was that IL-6 stands out among the cytokines in both groups, and higher in severe group than the ordinary one (p=0.011).

Multivariable linear regression was used to assess the association between RAR and age, sex, and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Eight thousand two hundred participants (mean [SE] age, 49.1 [0.5] years) were included, of whom 52.2% were women and 67.3% Whites. Women had higher RAR amplitude and mesor, and also more robust (pseudo-F statistic), more stable (higher IS) and less fragmented (lower IV) RAR (all P trend < 0.001) than men. Compared with younger adults (20-39 years), older adults (&#8805; 60 years) exhibited reduced RAR amplitude and mesor, but more stable and less fragmented RAR, and also reached their peak activity earlier (advanced acrophase) (all P trend < 0.001). Relative to other racial/ethnic groups, Hispanics had the highest amplitude and mesor level, and most stable (highest IS) and least fragmented (lowest IV) RAR pattern (P trend < 0.001). Conversely, non-Hispanic blacks had the lowest peak activity level (lowest amplitude) and least stable (lowest IS) RAR pattern (all P trend < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In the general adult population, RAR patterns vary significantly according to sex, age and race/ethnicity. These results may reflect demographic-dependent differences in intrinsic circadian rhythms and may have important implications for understanding racial, ethnic, sex and other disparities in morbidity and mortality risk.","output":"Demographic characteristics associated with circadian rest-activity rhythm patterns: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incidence of disordered eating among athlete populations is considerably higher than in the general population. Less well understood is the body image-related emotional processes that might lead to disordered eating attitudes and behaviours, specifically among aesthetic athletic girls. Thus, the aim of the present study was to explore the role that body image-related cognitive fusion plays in disordered eating, and the mediating role of body image-related perfectionist self-presentation on this relationship, in aesthetic athletic girls. This study comprised 142 young female athletes from aesthetic sports, who completed self-report measures. A path analysis was conducted to explore the proposed theoretical model, while controlling for age and zBMI. The path model revealed an excellent fit and explained 71% of the severity of disordered eating. Results showed that body image-related cognitive fusion influences disordered eating behaviours, through the mechanism of body image-related perfectionist self-presentation, even when controlling for age and zBMI. Findings suggested that, in aesthetic athletic girls, the entanglement in body image-related thoughts may be associated with the need to present a perfect body image to others, which may lead to disordered eating attitudes and behaviours, adopted as a means to control weight and body shape. The present study highlights the relevance of body image-related processes in disordered eating and suggests the importance of educational programmes that target the development of more adaptive emotion regulation strategies concerning body image in athletes, particularly from aesthetic sports.","output":"A comprehensive model of disordered eating among aesthetic athletic girls: Exploring the role of body image-related cognitive fusion and perfectionistic self- presentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Penggunaan gadget yang berlebihan pada anak harus dihindari agar perkembangan mereka tidak terganggu.

To date, there are no effective treatments for progressive deficits or disease-modifying therapy for those patients. We report encouraging results for spastic paraparesis after spinal cord stimulation. METHODS: A 51-year-old woman suffering from progressive weakness and spasticity in lower limbs related to hereditary spastic paraplegia type 4 underwent spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and experienced also significant improvement in motor function. Maximum ballistic voluntary isometric contraction test, continuous passive motion test and gait analysis using a motion-capture system were performed in ON and OFF SCS conditions. Neurophysiologic assessment consisted of obtaining motor evoked potentials in both conditions. RESULTS: Presurgical Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale (SPRS) score was 26. One month after effective SCS was initiated, SPRS went down to 15. At 12 months follow up, she experienced substantial improvement in motor function and in gait performance, with SPRS scores 23 (OFF) and down to 20 (ON). There was an increased isometric muscle strength (knee extension, OFF: 41 N m; ON: 71 N m), lower knee extension and flexion torque values in continuous passive motion test (decrease in spastic tone) and improvement in gait (for example, step length increase).

UK has the advantage that it is specifically activated on IF; however, it binds IF weakly. Previously, we established a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that recognizes a pit structure formed only in IF. Here, we developed a new mAb against the pit, 1101, that does not affect coagulation or fibrinolysis, and prepared a fusion protein of UK with humanized 1101 Fab to transport UK selectively to IF. In IF-containing lesions, UK is cleaved by plasmin at two sites, Lys158/Ile159 and Lys135/Lys136. Cleavage of the former leads to activation of UK; however, because activated UK is linked by S-S bonds before and after cleavage, it is not released from the fusion. Cleavage at the latter site causes UK to leave the fusion protein; hence, we mutated Lys135/Lys136 to Gly135/Gly136 to prevent release of UK. This engineered UK-antibody fusion, AMU1114, significantly decreased the reduction of plasma plasminogen levels in vivo relative to UK. In a photochemically induced mouse model of thrombus, the vascular patency rate was 0% (0/10) in the control, 50% (5/10) in the tPA treatment group, and 90% (9/10) in the AMU1114 treatment group.

Moreover, negative emotions were related to the general well-being through psychological flexibility in that higher depression, anxiety, and stress were associated with lower psychological flexibility, which decreased general well-being. Finally, negative emotions were shown to be beneficial, having an adaptive effect that allows individuals to maintain their ability to cope with the situation, reach goals, and fulfill daily duties and responsibilities despite critical, stressful situation (like the COVID-19 pandemic) that limit their psychological flexibility.

In recent years, the world has experienced a rapid growth in the cloud computing service sector thanks to its benefits to business organizations and economic development. Therefore, the performance efficiency of this sector has been concerned as one of the keys in todays economic environment. This study aimed to assess the performance efficiency of cloud computing service providers in the United States of America, one of the biggest global markets in terms of cloud computing, by applying the data envelopment analysis models. The efficiency of cloud computing providers was evaluated based on the assumption of the non-cooperative game among cloud computing providers in which providers selfishly choose the best strategy to maximize their payoff with three stages. In the first stage, the performance of these providers over the past period was measured by a super slack-based measure. In the second stage, the performance in the future period was predicted by the new data envelopment analysis model: the pastCpresentCfuture model based on resampling. In the last stage, the efficiency improvement was investigated by adopting the Malmquist productivity index. The findings of this study indicated that the percentage of inefficient providers would increase from 10% in the period from 2017 to 2020 to 20% for 2021 and 2024.

The B3LYP hybrid method and 6-31G (d,p) basis set were utilized to determine the optimized structures of the host and guest molecules and their complexes. The negative adsorption energy (?E) and adsorption enthalpy (?H) calculated for the complexes formed between calix[4]arene compounds and favipiravir drug molecule mentioned that adsorption of favipiravir molecule was an exothermic process on calix[4]arene structures. On the other hand, among the calixarene derivatives in the study, Gibbs free energy change (?G) value for the adsorption was only negative on calix[4]arene4 molecule. The infrared spectroscopy (IR) calculations were performed by examining the C=O, OCH and NH(2) vibrational frequencies to see the adsorption behavior in the favipiravir-calix[4]arene complex. After adsorption of the favipiravir molecule, HOMOCLUMO gap values decreased significantly for the structures and therefore electrical conductivity increased proportionally. In addition, sensor response factors, Fermi energy levels and workfunction changes of calix[4]arene derivatives were calculated and examined. Charge transfer between the four calix[4]arene compounds and the favipiravir molecule has occurred after adsorption. This attributes that calix[4]arene derivatives can be used as a well-suited favipiravir sensor (electronic and workfunction) and adsorbent at room temperature.

Colloidal growth techniques, such as antisolvent precipitation, form dispersions with properties that match bulk layered R-P phases, but controlling the composition of these particles remains challenging. Here, we explore the microstructure of particles of R-P phases of methylammonium lead iodide prepared by antisolvent precipitation from ternary mixtures of alkylammonium cations, where one cation can form perovskite phases (CH3NH3+) and the other two promote layered structures as spacers (e.g., C4H9NH3+ and C12H25NH3+). We determine that alkylammonium spacers pack with constant methylene density in the R-P interlayer and exclude interlayer solvent in dispersed colloids, regardless of length or branching. Using this result, we illustrate how the competition between cations that act as spacers between layers, or as grain-terminating ligands, determines the colloidal microstructure of layered R-P crystallites in solution. Optical measurements reveal that quantum well dimensions can be tuned by engineering the ternary cation composition. Transmission synchrotron wide-angle X-ray scattering and small-angle neutron scattering reveal changes in the structure of colloids in solvent and after deposition into thin films. In particular, we find that spacers can alloy between R-P layers if they share common steric arrangements, but tend to segregate into polydisperse R-P phases if they do not mix.

Seropositivities for H bilis and H hepaticus were defined as positivity for &#8805; 2 antigens. NAFLD was estimated using the Fatty Liver Index and the Hepatic Steatosis Index. Other conditions examined were obesity, central obesity, hypercholesterolemia, low HDL, diabetes and metabolic syndrome (MetSyn). Prevalence odds ratios (POR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. RESULTS: No overall associations between H pylori, H hepaticus, or H bilis and NAFLD or related metabolic conditions were found. Seropositivity for H pylori antigens CagA and VacA and H hepaticus antigen HH0713 was each significantly associated with NAFLD, however. In addition, associations were observed between the H pylori antigens HyuA, HP1564, and UreA and specified metabolic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: While no overall associations between H pylori or Helicobacter species with NAFLD or related conditions were observed, some selected Helicobacter spp. antigens were associated with NAFLD. Further research is warranted to examine whether H. species are associated with any metabolic condition.","output":"Associations between Helicobacter pylori with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and other metabolic conditions in Guatemala"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early classification of time series has been extensively studied for minimizing class prediction delay in time-sensitive applications such as healthcare and finance. A primary task of an early classification approach is to classify an incomplete time series as soon as possible with some desired level of accuracy. Recent years have witnessed several approaches for early classification of time series. As most of the approaches have solved the early classification problem with different aspects, it becomes very important to make a thorough review of the existing solutions to know the current status of the area. These solutions have demonstrated reasonable performance in a wide range of applications including human activity recognition, gene expression based health diagnostic, industrial monitoring, and so on. In this paper, we present a systematic review of current literature on early classification approaches for both univariate and multivariate time series. We divide various existing approaches into four exclusive categories based on their proposed solution strategies. The four categories include prefix based, shapelet based, model based, and miscellaneous approaches. The authors also discuss the applications of early classification in many areas including industrial monitoring, intelligent transportation, and medical. Finally, we provide a quick summary of the current literature with future research directions.","output":"Approaches and Applications of Early Classification of Time Series: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Often promoted as a way to address increasing demands, improve patient accessibility, and improve overall efficiency, electronic consultations are becoming increasingly common in primary care, particularly in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, despite their increasing use, a theoretically informed understanding of the factors that support and inhibit their effective implementation is severely limited. OBJECTIVE: With this scoping review, we sought to identify the factors that support and inhibit the implementation of electronic consultations in primary care. METHODS: In total, 5 electronic databases (PubMed, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO) were systematically searched for studies published in 2009-2019 that explored the impact and/or implementation of electronic consultations in primary care. Database searches were supplemented by reference list and grey literature searches. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis and synthesized using Normalization Process Theory (NPT). RESULTS: In total, 227 articles were initially identified and 13 were included in this review. The main factors found to hinder implementation included awareness and expectations; low levels of engagement; perceived suitability for all patient groups, conditions, and demographics; cost; and other contextual factors. Reports of information technology reliability and clinical workload duplication (as opposed to reduction) also appeared detrimental. Conversely, the development of protocols and guidance; patient and staff education; strategic marketing; and patient and public involvement were all identified as beneficial in facilitating electronic consultation implementation. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the need for proactive engagement with patients and staff to facilitate understanding and awareness, process optimization, and delivery of coherent training and education that maximizes impact and success. Although the necessity to use online methods during the COVID-19 pandemic may have accelerated awareness, concerns over workload duplication and inequality of access may remain. Future research should explore health inequalities in electronic consultations and their economic impacts from multiple perspectives (eg, patient, professional, and commissioner) to determine their potential value. Further work to identify the role of meaningful patient involvement in digital innovation, implementation, and evaluation is also required following the rapid digitization of health and social care.","output":"Barriers and Enablers in Implementing Electronic Consultations in Primary Care: Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThis paper aims to explore factors influencing university students intent to take formal lectures completely through e-learning with cloud meetings.Design/methodology/approachThis study has surveyed Chinese students who have experienced e-learning with cloud meetings as well as traditional massive open online courses (MOOC) without live dialogues.

Several trials are underway to evaluate the potential protective role of BCG vaccination in COVID-19. However, the lack of clarity on the use of appropriate controls concerning the measures of trained immunity or the heterologous cell-mediated immunity conferred by BCG vaccination has been a cause of concern leading to more confusion as exemplified by a recently concluded trial in Israel that failed to find any protective correlation with regard to BCG vaccination.

Unlike any other disease in history, COVID-19 has generated an unprecedented volume of data, well documented, continuously updated, and broadly available to the general public. Yet, the precise role of mathematical modeling in providing quantitative insight into the COVID-19 pandemic remains a topic of ongoing debate.

We illustrate how data-driven modeling can integrate classical epidemiology modeling and machine learning to infer critical disease parameters-in real time-from reported case data to make informed predictions and guide political decision making. We critically discuss questions that these models can and cannot answer and showcase controversial decisions around the early outbreak dynamics, outbreak control, and exit strategies.

This is because of high cross-border mobility (India and Myanmar) of people and increased injection drug abusers amongst youth in the cities and rural areas, HIV can present in many ways, from asymptomatic to advanced disease, including various atypical (generalized itching) and advanced (loss of vision) manifestations. A high degree of suspicion is required to diagnose HIV in a country like Bangladesh. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are essential to have a better outcome. METHODS: Here, we report two thought-provoking cases where patients were suffering from generalized itchy lesions (pruritic papular eruption) throughout the body for a long time and gradual loss of vision in another case. RESULTS: Due to lack of suspicion, initially, HIV screening was not done. Both patients visited several health centres, but no diagnosis was made. Moreover, COVID-19 pandemic worsens the situation. Finally, they were diagnosed with HIV; unfortunately, one of them lost her vision due to CMV retinitis and another patient died of other complications.

In response, supportive services in a central London hospital mobilised mental health support specifically for HCWs. AIMS: This rapid evaluation assessed HCW psychological welfare during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and their use of supportive services made available. METHODS: During the acute phase of COVID-19 (April to May 2020) all staff working for the hospital were invited to complete an online survey assessing well-being (self-rated health, moral distress exposure, symptoms of burnout and psychological distress) and use of available supportive services (awareness of, use and perceived helpfulness). Associations among personal characteristics and psychological well-being were explored using correlations and linear regression. RESULTS: A total of 1127 staff participated in the rapid evaluation. On average, psychological distress was high (mean (SD): 22 (7.57)) regardless of role, with 84% of this sample scoring above the general population mean (14.5). Nearly half of the sample reported feeling emotionally drained and a profile emerged displaying higher levels of psychological distress and burnout in those who were younger and exposed to morally distressing situations, with this group also exhibiting greater support service use. Greater levels of burnout were associated with increased psychological distress when controlling for personal factors. During this acute phase of the pandemic, majority of staff used at least one service and rated it as helpful. CONCLUSION: HCWs experienced high levels of psychological distress requiring continued support as the COVID-19 pandemic evolved. Although HCWs were aware of supportive services, uptake varied.

There have been limited reports of co-infections accompanying SARS-CoV-2 infections, albeit lacking India specific study. The present study has made an effort toward elucidating the prevalence, diversity and characterization of co-infecting respiratory pathogens in the nasopharyngeal tract of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Two complementary metagenomics based sequencing approaches, Respiratory Virus Oligo Panel (RVOP) and Holo-seq, were utilized for unbiased detection of co-infecting viruses and bacteria. The limited SARS-CoV-2 clade diversity along with differential clinical phenotype seems to be partially explained by the observed spectrum of co-infections. We found a total of 43 bacteria and 29 viruses amongst the patients, with 18 viruses commonly captured by both the approaches. In addition to SARS-CoV-2, Human Mastadenovirus, known to cause respiratory distress, was present in a majority of the samples. We also found significant differences of bacterial reads based on clinical phenotype. Of all the bacterial species identified, ~60% have been known to be involved in respiratory distress. Among the co-pathogens present in our sample cohort, anaerobic bacteria accounted for a preponderance of bacterial diversity with possible role in respiratory distress. Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus and Halomonas sp. are anaerobes found abundantly across the samples.

The model simulates three interrelated stochastic processes: epidemic spreading, availability of respiratory ventilators and changes in death statistics. We consider local and non-local modes of disease transmission. The first simulates transmission through social contacts in the vicinity of the place of residence while the second through social contacts in public places: schools, hospitals, airports, etc., where many people meet, who live in remote geographic locations. Epidemic spreading is modelled as a discrete-time stochastic process on random geometric networks. We use the MonteCCarlo method in the simulations. The following assumptions are made. The basic reproduction number is [Formula: see text] and the infectious period lasts approximately ten days. Infections lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome in about one percent of cases, which are likely to lead to respiratory default and death, unless the patient receives an appropriate medical treatment. The healthcare system capacity is simulated by the availability of respiratory ventilators or intensive care beds. Some parameters of the model, like mortality rates or the number of respiratory ventilators per [Formula: see text] inhabitants, are chosen to simulate the real values for the USA and Poland. In the simulations we compare do-nothing strategy with mitigation strategies based on social distancing and reducing social mixing. We study epidemics in the pre-vacine era, where immunity is obtained only by infection. The model applies only to epidemics for which reinfections are rare and can be neglected. The results of the simulations show that strategies that slow the development of an epidemic too much in the early stages do not significantly reduce the overall number of deaths in the long term, but increase the duration of the epidemic.

Starting with the establishment of a sectoral dialogue partnership in 1989, Korea has developed a comprehensive partnership with ASEAN over the years. The ASEAN-KOREA FTA was completed in 2009 and the elevation of bilateral relations to a strategic partnership in 2010 served as a momentum to strengthen our economic and security partnership. By sharing cultural proximity rooted in Asian values, ASEAN and Korea have also enjoyed robust socio-cultural exchanges. Meanwhile, regarding to India and Korea relations, both countries established a long-term cooperative partnership for peace and prosperity in October 2004 as a channel to enhance mutual interests between the two countries. Korea has further deepened its relations with India by concluding the CEPA in 2009 and upgrading its relations into a special strategic partnership in 2015. The New Southern Policy (hereinafter NSP), announced in November 2017 in Indonesia, has further deepened Koreas strategic partnership with ASEAN and India under the vision of achieving a People-centered Community of Peace and Prosperity. ASEAN-Korea relations were developed to a level of Koreas diplomatic ties with the United States, China, Japan, and Russia. The India-Korea Summit of 2018 adopted the Shared Vision for People, Prosperity, Peace, and the Future to strengthen mid-to-long term bilateral relations. President Moon Jae-in visited all ASEAN member states and had two summit meetings with India. Moreover, the Korean government hosted the ASEAN-ROK Commemorative Summit, launching the first Mekong-ROK Summit in 2019. The NSP pursues the three pillars of People, Peace, and Prosperity as a common foundation to realize its vision. People aims to make safer, better lives and greater interaction in the NSP region, that is, ASEAN member states and India. Peace seeks a community where all are free from fear or threat. The goal of Prosperity aims to create mutually beneficial and future-oriented economic cooperation. The number of visitors, trade volume, and investment between Korea and the NSP region has unprecedently increased with the help of NSP partners policies. The NSP has since evolved into the NSP Plus amid the Covid-19 pandemic and the US-China rivalry. Korea and NSP partners together have to overcome the global health crisis and reconstruct global value chains to ensure the safety of the people and free trade in the region. To achieve these goals, the Korean government presented an upgraded version of the NSP in November 2020, reflecting changes in the current environment for cooperation. The NSP Plus promotes seven Initiatives as follows: 1) comprehensive healthcare cooperation, 2) sharing Koreas education model for human resource development, 3) promotion of mutual cultural exchanges, 4) formation of mutually beneficial and sustainable trade and investment, 5) support for rural villages and urban infrastructure development, 6) cooperation in future industries for common prosperity, and 7) cooperation for safe and peaceful communities. In this context, this publication aims at examining the progress of the NSP Plus and discussing a way forward for sustainable cooperation between Korea and NSP partners. It comprises four sections and eighteen chapters. Section 1 provides overviews of the NSP Plus from the perspectives of Korea, ASEAN, and India to evaluate the NSP in a more comprehensive manner. Sections 2 and 3 deal with a sectoral analysis of the NSP Plus including trade, investment, infrastructure, human resource development, and security in the divisions of ASEAN and India. Section 4 summarizes the progress of NSP Plus in the region, suggesting prospects and future tasks to further expand cooperative relations between Korea and NSP partners.

However, the full data set often contains thousands of sequences, because many of those unique sequences have multiple identical copies.

Through simulations, we explore how large data sets with duplicate sequences affect the speed and accuracy of phylogenetic and phylodynamic analysis within BEAST 2. We show that using unique sequences only leads to biases, and using a random subset of sequences yields imprecise parameter estimates. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce PIQMEE, a BEAST 2 add-on that produces reliable parameter estimates from full data sets with increased computational efficiency as compared with the currently available methods within BEAST 2. The principle behind PIQMEE is to resolve the tree structure of the unique sequences only, while simultaneously estimating the branching times of the duplicate sequences. Distinguishing between unique and duplicate sequences allows our method to perform well even for very large data sets. Although the classic method converges poorly for data sets of 6,000 sequences when allowed to run for 7 days, our method converges in slightly more than 1 day. In fact, PIQMEE can handle data sets of around 21,000 sequences with 20 unique sequences in 14 days.

This outbreak was classified as SARS-CoV2 and is the cause of the COVID-19 disease. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declares it a Pandemic and today it is considered the greatest challenge in global health that humanity has faced since World War II and it is estimated that between 40 and 60% of the population worldwide will catch the virus. This has caused enormous challenges in countries around the world in social, economic, environmental and obviously health issues. These challenges are mainly due to the effects of the established quarantines in almost all capitals and major cities around the world, from Asia, Europe to America. However, these lockdown which began worldwide from January 23, have had a significant impact on the environment and on the air quality of cities as recently reported by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and ESA (European Space Agency), with reductions according to them of up to 30% in some of the epicenters such as the case of Wuhan. Knowing that air pollution causes approximately 29% of lung cancer deaths, 43% of COPD deaths, and 25% of ischemic heart disease deaths, it is important to know the effects of quarantines in cities regarding air quality to take measures that favor populations and urban ecosystems when the emergency ends.

The current study assessed the impact of diagnosis threat (i.e., information regarding the long-term neurological impact of COVID-19) and suggestibility on endorsed symptoms of both recovered patients and healthy controls. Method: Recovered patients (na?=a?90) and healthy controls (na?=a?210) described their cognitive functioning after being randomly assigned to: (a) Experimental group: These participants read an article that explored long-term neurological symptoms among COVID-19 survivors. (b) Control group: These participants read an article providing general information regarding the disease. Results: Recovered patients, but not healthy controls, endorsed more symptoms in the experimental condition compared to the control condition. Moreover, suggestibility was correlated with endorsement of symptoms. Conclusions: Post COVID-19 neurological symptoms may, at least partially, be affected by non-neurological factors such as diagnosis threat. Information regarding long-term effects of COVID-19 may skew reported symptoms with highly suggestible individuals particularly susceptible to these effects.

Lower muscle radiodensity was associated with worse clinical outcomes (including shock) and higher in-hospital mortality. Prompt detection of sarcopenia in older adults with CAP is important. The measurement of muscle mass often involves specialized and expensive techniques. A relatively simple and inexpensive method such as the sarcopenia index (SI) to measure muscle mass would be helpful. Therefore, we performed a retrospective cohort study to assess the association between SI and septic shock risk and mortality in older patients with CAP. STUDY DESIGN: In this retrospective cohort study, information on hospitalized CAP patients, including general information and septic shock, were obtained from the medical record database of the Southwest Medical University Zigong Affiliated Hospital, China. Data on patient survival and mortality (all-cause) were acquired from government authorities and telephonic follow-up. Serum creatinine (Cr) and cystatin-C (CysC) levels on admission were included in the database. The SI was determined as the serum Cr/CysC ratio  100 and the participants were assigned to low and high SI groups. The association between SI and septic shock was evaluated by logistic regression, and that between SI and mortality by Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: In total, 769 older adults ( 60 years) with CAP were included, of which 480(62.4%) were male and 289(37.6%)were female. We found that the total prevalence of septic shock in older adults with CAP was 16.0%. In the female group, septic shock was more prevalent in the low SI group than in the high SI group (low SI vs. high SI, 22.22% vs. 11.52%, p = 0.024). Following adjustment for confounders, there was a significant association between high SI and a lower risk of septic shock in female patients (OR = 0.38, 95%CI: 0.16C0.94; p < 0.05). The total death toll of older adults with CAP was 332(43.2%). Irrespective of sex, there was a higher risk of mortality in the low SI group (total group: low SI vs. high SI, 63.02% vs. 36.57%, p < 0.001; male group: low SI vs. high SI, 63.03% vs. 39.34%, p < 0.001; female group: low SI vs. high SI, 73.61% vs. 28.57%, p < 0.001) and, after adjustment for confounding factors and irrespective of sex, high SI was a protective factor for mortality in older adults with CAP (total group: HR = 0.64, 95%CI: 0.48C0.84; p < 0.05; male: HR = 0.69, 95%CI: 0.49C0.97; p < 0.05; female: HR = 0.39, 95%CI: 0.24C0.62; p < 0.05).

Uneven distribution of cluster heads (CHs) across the network, repeatedly choosing the same IoT nodes as CHs and identifying cluster heads in the communication range of other CHs are the major problems leading to higher energy consumption in IoT networks. In this paper, using fuzzy logic, bio-inspired chicken swarm optimization (CSO) and a genetic algorithm, an optimal cluster formation is presented as a Hybrid Intelligent Optimization Algorithm (HIOA) to minimize overall energy consumption in an IoT network. In HIOA, the key idea for formation of IoT nodes as clusters depends on finding chromosomes having a minimum value fitness function with relevant network parameters. The fitness function includes minimization of inter- and intra-cluster distance to reduce the interface and minimum energy consumption over communication per round. The hierarchical order classification of CSO utilizes the crossover and mutation operation of the genetic approach to increase the population diversity that ultimately solves the uneven distribution of CHs and turnout to be balanced network load. The proposed HIOA algorithm is simulated over MATLAB2019A and its performance over CSO parameters is analyzed, and it is found that the best fitness value of the proposed algorithm HIOA is obtained though setting up the parameters [Formula: see text] , number of rooster [Formula: see text] , number of hens [Formula: see text] and swarm updating frequency [Formula: see text].

METHODS For this international, multicenter, cross-sectional study, we recruited gynecological cancer survivors 1-5 years after completion of treatment. Information on follow-up visits, use of healthcare resources, self-management (measured by the Health Education Impact Questionnaire), clinical characteristics, and demographics were obtained by validated questionnaires. Participants were categorized as adherent if they attended the number of follow-up visits recommended by national guidelines, non-adherent if they had fewer visits than recommended, or over-users if they had more visits than recommended. RESULTS Of 4455 invited survivors, 2428 (55%) returned the questionnaires, and 911 survivors were included in the analyses. Survivors with high self-management most frequently adhered to recommended follow-up. Non-adherent survivors showed lower self-management in the health-directed activity domain (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.32) than adherent survivors. No other associations between self-management and follow-up adherence were revealed. Non-adherent survivors tended to have endometrial cancer, surgical treatment only, be older, and be Danish residents. Over-users reported more follow-up visits and also used additional healthcare services more frequently than adherent survivors. CONCLUSION Low self-management appears to reduce the likelihood of adherence to national guidelines for gynecological cancer follow-up. Focusing on patient education for survivors at risk of low self-management to ensure adherence to recommended follow-up may improve personalization of follow-up.","output":"Self-management and adherence to recommended follow-up after gynaecological cancer: results from the international InCHARGE study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a 68-year-old male patient with persistent and complicated SARS-CoV-2 infection who was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Here, fires are widely used in agriculture and other traditional activities with the potential to become larger-scale, unmanageable wildfires and contribute to the degradation of both ecosystems and human livelihoods. In this study, we assess the temporal and spatial pattern of MODIS and VIIRS Active Fire Data (AFD) and their relationships to 9 environmental conditions and human activities across the three zones of the Huascaran Biosphere Reserve (HBR), Ancash, Peru between 2001 and 2020. Results Xeric climatic conditions seem to drive the temporal AFD pattern across and within years in the HBR. Across years, an oscillating increment of active fire alerts was evident, with years 2016 and especially 2020 displaying the highest AFD records of the two decades. Both correspond to years with the lowest mean annual precipitation. Seasonally, AFD also peaked at the end of the dry season (August and September), but AFD continue until late November of 2016 and 2020. The amount of people on the other hand, measured in terms of population and number of rural villages, is the main driver of where AFA occur, increasing along the limits of the Huascaran National Park (HNP) and the Buffer Zone (BZ) and in weakly controlled areas within the park. Conclusions We conclude that a combination of both, xeric conditions, and human pressures, seems to interact and produce high numbers of AFD along key Andean ecosystems like Puna grasslands and shrublands that are not ecologically adapted to this type of pressures. Land transformation and a limited capacity of control over key areas within the HNP seem to play an important role in where and when wildfires occur. Finally, although 2020 was an arid year, the covid-19 pandemic would have exacerbated the number of AFDs that occurred in the area, demonstrating that the effects of the pandemic go beyond health problems.","output":"Two decades of active fire data in Huascaran Biosphere Reserve (Peru): patterns and future challenges to prevent wildfires"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The latest diffusion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has involved the whole world population.

METHODS Systematic review and semi-quantitative analysis. Eleven electronic databases were searched to identify all relevant randomized and non-randomized controlled trials. Studies had to report overall PA as the main outcome to be eligible for inclusion in the review. The main outcomes of the studies is a quantified measure of overall PA. Additionally, all studies had to report sex/gender disaggregated overall PA at baseline and/or follow up and/or explain how they dealt with sex/gender during outcome analysis (i.e., sex/gender adjusted analyses) and/or report that there were no differences in the outcome when looking at sex/gender. PRISMA guidelines were followed. Two authors independently screened studies for eligibility and assessed the risk of bias. Semi-quantitative analyses were conducted to evaluate intervention effects, taking into account the extent to which studies have considered sex/gender aspects. To evaluate sex/gender considerations in primary studies, a newly developed sex/gender checklist was used. The study was registered previously (registration number CRD42018109528). RESULTS In total, 97 articles reporting 94 unique studies with 164 outcomes for overall PA were included in the present review. Average sample size was 829 participants, ranging from five to 9839. Participants' ages ranged from three to 19 years. Our review shows that overall 35% of PA outcomes had significant effects in increasing overall PA of children and adolescents. Not including single sex/gender studies, 105 out of 120 PA outcomes resulted in same intervention effects for boys and girls. The interventions reported to have similar effects on PA outcomes for boys and girls showed higher quality of reporting sex/gender aspects of measurement instruments, participant flow and intervention content and materials than PA outcomes with effects only in boys or only in girls. Overall, consideration of sex/gender aspects in intervention studies is low.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) are essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 to the host cells. Both ACE-2 and NRP-1 receptors and TMPRSS2 have been identified in the oral cavity. However, there is limited knowledge about the impact of periapical lesions and their metabolites on the expression of these critical genes. This study aims to measure the impact of periapical lesions and their unique fatty acids (FAs) metabolites on the expression of the aforementioned genes, in addition to interleukin 6 (IL-6) gene and hence SARS-CoV-2 infection loads can be estimated. METHODS: Gene expression of ACE-2, NRP-1, TMPRSS2, and IL-6 was performed in periapical lesions in comparison to healthy oral cavity. Since FAs are important immunomodulators required for the lipid synthesis essential for receptors synthesis and viral replication, comparative FAs profiling was determined in oral lesions and healthy pulp tissues using gas chromatographyCmass spectrometry (GCCMS). The effect of major identified and unique FAs was tested on mammalian cells known to express ACE-2, NRP-1, and TMPRSS2 genes. RESULTS: Gene expression analysis indicated that ACE-2, NRP-1, and TMPRSS2 were significantly upregulated in healthy clinical samples compared to oral lesions, while the reverse was true with IL-6 gene expression. Saturated and monounsaturated FAs were the major identified shared and unique FAs, respectively. Major shared FAs included palmitic, stearic and myristic acids with the highest percentage in the healthy oral cavity, while unique FAs included 17-octadecynoic acid in periapical abscess, petroselinic acid and l-lactic acid in periapical granuloma, and 1-nonadecene in the radicular cyst. Computational prediction showed that the binding affinity of identified FAs to ACE-2, TMPRSS2 and S protein were insignificant. Further, FA-treated mammalian cells showed significant overexpression of ACE-2, NRP-1 and TMPRSS2 genes except with l-lactic acid and oleic acid caused downregulation of NRP-1 gene, while 17-octadecynoic acid caused insignificant effect. CONCLUSION: Collectively, a healthy oral cavity is more susceptible to viral infection when compared to that complicated with periapical lesions. FAs play important role in viral infection and their balance can affect the viral loads. Shifting the balance towards higher levels of palmitic, stearic and 1-nonadecene caused significant upregulation of the aforementioned genes and hence higher viral loads. On the other hand, there is a reverse correlation between inflammation and expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors. Therefore, a mouth preparation that can reduce the levels of palmitic, stearic and 1-nonadecene, while maintaining an immunomodulatory effect can be employed as a future protection strategy against viral infection.","output":"Estimating the viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in the oral cavity when complicated with periapical lesions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The emergence of 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A (pH1N1) has provided a unique challenge to influenza control in healthcare settings. We provide an overview of the early lessons from the 2009 pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS The modes of influenza transmission and their contributions to the development of infections remain unclear. Recent studies in the guinea pig model have demonstrated airborne transmission, but data from human studies and outbreaks are inconclusive. Data on physical interventions to prevent transmission support the use of hand hygiene, gowns, gloves, face shields and respiratory protection. The effectiveness of surgical masks compared to N95 respirators has been investigated, and there is evidence from one trial that surgical masks are noninferior to N95 respirators in preventing infection. Experiences with mandatory vaccination suggest that this is a highly successful approach to increase healthcare personnel vaccination rates. Lessons from pH1N1 have multiple implications for future pandemic preparedness planning. SUMMARY Further research is needed on appropriate respiratory protection for influenza. Mandatory vaccination programs should be considered in all healthcare settings. Pandemic preparedness plans should be revised, focusing on flexibility, communication, stockpiling of essential supplies, and staffing support for infection control.","output":"Control of influenza in healthcare settings: early lessons from the 2009 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Airborne ultrafine particle (UFP) exposure is a great concern as they have been correlated to increased cardiovascular mortality, neurodegenerative diseases and morbidity in occupational and environmental settings. The ultrafine components of diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) represent about 25% of the emission mass; these particles have a great surface area and consequently high capacity to adsorb toxic molecules, then transported throughout the body. Previous in-vivo studies indicated that DEP exposure increases pro- and antioxidant protein levels and activates inflammatory response both in respiratory and cardiovascular systems. In cells, DEPs can cause additional reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which attacks surrounding molecules, such as lipids. The cell membrane provides lipid mediators (LMs) that modulate cell-cell communication, inflammation, and resolution processes, suggesting the importance of understanding lipid modifications induced by DEPs. In this study, with a lipidomic approach, we evaluated in the mouse lung and cortex how DEP acute and subacute treatments impact polyunsaturated fatty acid-derived LMs. To analyze the data, we designed an ad hoc bioinformatic pipeline to evaluate the functional enrichment of lipid sets belonging to the specific biological processes (Lipid Set Enrichment Analysis-LSEA).

More than 100 different viruses are associated with these mammals, particularly Rhabdoviridae (Lyssavirus like rabies virus), Paramyxoviridae (like Nipah and Hendra viruses), Filoviridae (Ebola and Marburg viruses) and Coronaviridae (viruses causing SARS and MERS). These infections are usually asymptomatic in bats but the mechanism of this tolerance is not yet understood. For those viruses, bats are efficient reservoirs and disseminators.

Despite being comprised primarily of only four cognate nucleobases, nucleic acids can adopt complex three-dimensional structures, and RNA in particular, can catalyze biochemical reactions to regulate a wide variety of biological processes. Such chemical versatility is due in part to the phenomenon of nucleobase tautomerism, whereby the bases can adopt multiple, yet distinct isomeric forms, known as tautomers. For nucleobases, tautomers refer to structural isomers that differ from one another by the position of protons. By altering the position of protons on nucleobases, many of which play critical roles for hydrogen bonding and base pairing interactions, tautomerism has profound effects on the biochemical processes involving nucleic acids. For example, the transient formation of minor tautomers during replication could generate spontaneous mutations. These mutations could arise from the stabilization of mismatches, in the active site of polymerases, in conformations involving minor tautomers that are indistinguishable from canonical base pairs. In this review, we discuss the evidence for tautomerism in DNA, and its consequences to the fidelity of DNA replication. Also reviewed are RNA systems, such as the riboswitches and self-cleaving ribozymes, in which tautomerism plays a functional role in ligand recognition and catalysis, respectively. We also discuss tautomeric nucleoside analogs that are efficacious as antiviral drug candidates such as molnupiravir for coronaviruses and KP1212 for HIV. The antiviral efficacy of these analogs is due, in part, to their ability to exist in multiple tautomeric forms and induce mutations in the replicating viral genomes. From a technical standpoint, minor tautomers of nucleobases are challenging to identify directly because they are rare and interconvert on a fast, millisecond to nanosecond, time scale. Nevertheless, many approaches including biochemical, structural, computational and spectroscopic methods have been developed to study tautomeric dynamics in RNA and DNA systems, and in antiviral nucleoside analogs. An overview of these methods and their applications is included here.","output":"Structural Insights Into Tautomeric Dynamics in Nucleic Acids and in Antiviral Nucleoside Analogs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 exhibit low expression of interferon-stimulated genes, contributing to a limited antiviral response. Uncovering the underlying mechanism of innate immune suppression and rescuing the innate antiviral response remain urgent issues in the current pandemic. Here we identified that the dimerization domain of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (SARS2-NP) is required for SARS2-NP to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation with RNA, which inhibits Lys63-linked poly-ubiquitination and aggregation of MAVS and thereby suppresses the innate antiviral immune response. Mice infected with an RNA virus carrying SARS2-NP exhibited reduced innate immunity, an increased viral load and high morbidity. Notably, we identified SARS2-NP acetylation at Lys375 by host acetyltransferase and reported frequently occurring acetylation-mimicking mutations of Lys375, all of which impaired SARS2-NP liquid-liquid phase separation with RNA. Importantly, a peptide targeting the dimerization domain was screened out to disrupt the SARS2-NP liquid-liquid phase separation and demonstrated to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and rescue innate antiviral immunity both in vitro and in vivo.","output":"Targeting liquid-liquid phase separation of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein promotes innate antiviral immunity by elevating MAVS activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stay at home order during the COVID-19 helps flatten the curve but ironically, instigate mental health problems among the people who have Substance Use Disorders.

OBJECTIVES The aim of this review was to examine the effects of radiotherapy on neovascular AMD. SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group trials register) on The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2004, MEDLINE (1966 to May 2004), EMBASE (1980 to June 2004) and LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database) (May 2004). We also wrote to investigators of trials included in the review to ask if they were aware of any other studies. SELECTION CRITERIA We included all randomised controlled trials in which radiotherapy was compared to another treatment, sham treatment, low dosage irradiation or no treatment in people with subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation secondary to AMD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two reviewers independently extracted the data. Relative risks were combined using a random effects model. The percentage of the variability in effect estimates that was due to heterogeneity, rather than sampling error, was estimated using I2. MAIN RESULTS Eleven trials randomising a total of 1078 people were included in this review. All trials used a similar method of delivering the radiotherapy treatment (external beam). Dosage ranged from 7.5 to 24 Gy. Most trials found effects (not always significant) that favoured treatment. However, there was considerable inconsistency in the results between trials (I2 > 50%). As only 11 trials were included in the review and only some of these trials provided data for each outcome our ability to determine the causes of the heterogeneity between trials was limited. Subgroup analyses did not reveal any statistically significant interactions although with small numbers of trials in each subgroup (range two to four) this was not surprising. There was some indication that trials with no sham irradiation reported a greater effect of treatment as did trials with a greater percentage of participants with classic choroidal neovascularisation. REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS This review currently does not provide evidence that external beam radiotherapy is an effective treatment for neovascular AMD. If further trials are to be considered to evaluate radiotherapy in AMD then adequate masking of the control group must be considered. Given the recent evidence that most lesions are amenable to treatment with photodynamic therapy if identified at a small lesion size, trials evaluating radiotherapy against photodynamic therapy are warranted.","output":"Radiotherapy for neovascular age-related macular degeneration."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) poses a high risk for developing late-onset, non-obese type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The exact mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unknown, although the contribution of the central nervous system is recognized. The main hypothalamic nuclei involved in the homeostatic regulation express nesfatin-1, an anorexigenic neuropeptide and identified regulator of blood glucose level. Using intrauterine protein restricted rat model (PR) of IUGR, we investigated, whether IUGR alters the function of nesfatin-1. We show that PR rats develop fat preference and impaired glucose homeostasis by adulthood, while the body composition and caloric intake of normal nourished (NN) and PR rats are similar. Plasma nesfatin-1 levels are unaffected by IUGR in both neonates and adults, but pro-nesfatin-1 mRNA expression is upregulated in the hypothalamus of adult PR animals. We find that centrally injected nesfatin-1 inhibits the fasting induced neuronal activation in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus in adult NN rats. This effect of nesfatin-1 is not seen in PR rats. The anorexigenic effect of centrally injected nesfatin-1 is also reduced in adult PR rats. Moreover, chronic central nesfatin-1 administration improves the glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in NN rats but not in PR animals. Birth dating of nesfatin-1 cells by bromodeoxyuridine (BrDU) reveals that formation of nesfatin-1 cells in the hypothalamus of PR rats is disturbed. Our results suggest that adult PR rats acquire hypothalamic nesfatin-1-resistance, probably due to the altered development of the hypothalamic nesfatin-1 cells. Hypothalamic nesfatin-1-resistance, in turn, may contribute to the development of non-obese type T2DM.","output":"Hypothalamic Nesfatin-1 Resistance May Underlie the Development of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Maternally Undernourished Non-obese Rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: The aim of the present paper was to provide an up\\\\to\\\\date view on epidemiology and risk factors of heart failure (HF) development after myocardial infarction.

The primary objectives of this study are to determine whether passive and active work breaks lead to less discomfort than no work breaks and whether active work breaks lead to less discomfort than passive work breaks. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A controlled, randomised cross-over trial will be performed in the laboratory, of which its protocol is described here according to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2013 Statement. Recruitment of 21 laparoscopic surgeons started in April 2019 and the study is ongoing.

In this cross-sectional survey, trainees consisted of medical residents and medical and nursing students undergoing their clinical clerkship. An anonymous questionnaire was distributed following pilot testing. In total, 410 trainees participated (response rate: 90.1%), of whom 194 (47.3%) were residents, 154 (37.6%) medical and 62 (15.1%) nursing students.

Only 22/410 (5.4%) of HCPs opposed to mandatory occupational vaccination. The primary reasons for a negative attitude were the belief that personal rights outweigh public benefit (10/22, 45.5%) and the fear of side effects (9/22, 40.9%).

Samples showing a low FVII, FX, PC, and PS were categorized as a vitamin K deficiency pattern. Samples showing a low FV, low or normal fibrinogen, and high FVIII were categorized as a liver disease pattern. Samples showing an anti-Xa >0.01 IU/ml were assayed for anti-Xa DOACs. Samples which could not be categorized were grouped as equivocal. RESULTS A total of 48 samples were obtained over a 6-month period. Nineteen showed a Vitamin K deficiency pattern, 17 a liver disease pattern, 7 showed an anti-Xa DOAC and 5 were equivocal. High FVIII and D-dimers and reduced levels of the anticoagulant proteins were present in the majority of the samples.

We selected these sites as part of a multi-level intervention aimed at introducing more traditional AN subsistence foods, increasing fruit and vegetable intake, and decreasing SSB consumption among young children enrolled in Head Start (preschool) programmes (Clinicaltrials.gov #NCT03601299). Storekeepers in these communities agreed that seasonality and flight schedules were primary factors determining commercial foods' availability. Several storekeepers noted that federal food assistance programmes that specify which food items may be purchased with funds received from the programme and community policies that set limits on less healthy items promote customer purchases of healthier products. The fact that storekeepers are comfortable enforcing government assistance programme guidelines, company policies, and tribal resolutions suggests an important role storekeepers play in improving nutritional intake in their communities.","output":"Storekeeper perspectives on improving dietary intake in 12 rural remote western Alaska communities: the \\"Got Neqpiaq?\\" project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 may present or eventually develop central nervous system and ophthalmic signs and symptoms. Varying reports have emerged regarding isolation of viral RNA from these tissue sites, as well as largely autopsy-based histopathologic descriptions of the brain and the eye in patients with CoVID-19. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A primary literature search was performed in literature databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library. Keywords were used alone and in combination including the following: SARS CoV-2, CoVID-19, eye, brain, central nervous system, histopathology, autopsy, ocular pathology, aqueous, tears, vitreous, neuropathology, encephalitis. RESULTS: The reported ophthalmic pathologic and neuropathologic findings in patients with SARS-CoV-2 are varied and inconclusive regarding the role of direct viral infection versus secondary pathology. The authors own experience with autopsy neuropathology in CoVID-19 patients is also described. There is a particular paucity of data regarding the histopathology of the eye. However, it is likely that the ocular surface is a potential site for inoculation and the tears a source of spread of viral particles.

EDs are often poorly equipped to address the multi-dimensional nature of patient need and the complex circumstances surrounding repeated presentation. Employing a model of intensive short-term community-based case management, the Checkpoint program sought to improve care coordination for this patient group, thereby reducing their reliance on ED. METHOD: This study employed a single group interrupted time series design, evaluating patient engagement with the program and year-on-year individual differences in the number of ED visits pre and post enrolment. Associated savings were also estimated. RESULTS: Prior to intervention, there were two dominant modes in the ED presentation trends of patients. One group had a steady pattern with 7 presentations in each of the last four years. The other group had an increasing trend in presentations, peaking in the 12 months immediately preceding enrolment. Following the intervention, both groups demonstrated two consecutive year-on-year reductions. By the second year, and from an overall peak of 22.5 presentations per patient per annum, there was a 53% reduction in presentations. This yielded approximate savings of $7100 per patient. DISCUSSION: Efforts to improve care coordination, when combined with proactive case management in the community, can impact positively on ED re-presentation rates, provided they are concerted, sufficiently intensive and embed the principles of integration. CONCLUSION: The Checkpoint program demonstrated sufficient promise to warrant further exploration of its sustainability. However, health services have yet to determine the ideal organisational structures and funding arrangements to support such initiatives.","output":"The Checkpoint Program: Collaborative Care to Reduce the Reliance of Frequent Presenters on ED"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Phylogenetic analysis is used to analyze the evolution of species according to the characteristics of biological sequences. The analytical results are generally represented by phylogenetic trees. NJ (neighbor joining) is a frequently used algorithm for constructing phylogenetic trees because of its few assumptions, fast operation, and high accuracy, and is based on the distance between taxa. It is known that NJ usually constructs different phylogenetic trees for the same dataset with differences in input order, which are known as tied trees. This article proposes an improved method of NJ, called ENJ (extended neighbor joining). The ENJ can join several (currently limited to three) nodes with the same minimum distance into a new node, rather than joining two nodes in one iteration, so it can construct triple phylogenetic trees. We have inferred the formulas for updating the distance values and calculating the branch lengths for the ENJ algorithm. We have tested the ENJ with simulated and real data. The experimental results show that, compared with other methods, the trees constructed by the ENJ have greater similarity to the initial trees, and the ENJ is much faster than the NJ algorithm. Moreover, we have constructed a phylogenetic tree for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and related coronaviruses by ENJ, which shows that COVID-19 and SARS-CoV are closer than other coronaviruses. Because it differs from the existing phylogenetic trees for those coronaviruses, we constructed a phylogenetic network for them. The network shows those species have had a reticulate evolution.","output":"ENJ algorithm can construct triple phylogenetic trees"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To explore the association of obesity with the progression and outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) at the acute period and 5\\\\month follow\\\\up from the perspectives of computed tomography (CT) imaging with artificial intelligence (AI)\\\\based quantitative evaluation, which may help to predict the risk of obese COVID\\\\19 patients progressing to severe and critical disease.

Restaurants are frequent settings for foodborne illness transmission. Public health surveillance - the continual, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of reports of health data to prevent and control illness - is a prerequisite for an effective food control system. While restaurant inspection data are routinely collected, these data are not regularly aggregated like traditional surveillance data. However, there is evidence that these data are a valuable tool for understanding foodborne illness outbreaks and threats to food safety. This article discusses the challenges and opportunities for incorporating routine restaurant inspection data as a surveillance tool for monitoring and improving foodborne illness prevention activities. The three main challenges are: 1) lack of a national framework; 2) lack of data standards and interoperability; and 3) limited access to restaurant inspection data. Tapping into the power of public health informatics represents an opportunity to address these challenges. Advancing the food safety system by improving restaurant inspection information systems and making restaurant inspection data available to support decision-making represents an opportunity to practice smarter food safety.","output":"A Public Health Informatics Solution to Improving Food Safety in Restaurants: Putting the Missing Piece in the Puzzle."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is an ongoing threat of epidemic or pandemic diseases that could be caused by influenza, Ebola or other emerging viruses.

This mixed-methods process evaluation was conducted to investigate the implementation of this program across sites, identify factors associated with the implementation, and collect evidence to optimize the intervention design for future scale-up. Methods: Mixed methods were used sequentially to collect data regarding five process evaluation dimensions: fidelity, dose delivered, dose received, reach, and context. Quantitative data were collected during the intervention process. Participation rate of intervention activities was calculated and compared across cities. The quantitative data was used for the selection of representative intervention participants for the qualitative interviews. Qualitative data were collected in face-to-face semi-structured interviews with purposively selected students (n = 33), adult family members (n = 33), teachers (n = 9), heads of schools (n = 9), key informants from local health, and education departments (n = 8). Thematic analysis technique was applied to analyze the interview transcripts using NVivo. The qualitative data were triangulated with the quantitative data during the interpretation phase. Results: The total number of families recruited for the intervention was 1,124. The overall retention rate of the AppSalt program was 97%.

Here we show that viral detection takes one second per specimen. After scent-interrogating 9,200 samples, our six dogs achieved independently and as a group very high sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, accuracy, and likelihood ratio, with very narrow confidence intervals.

We demonstrated that RRV exits from the ER through a carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone-sensitive vesicular transport. RRV staining was never found within the Golgi apparatus or lysosomes, suggesting that the RRV intracellular pathway does not involve these organelles. This finding was confirmed by treatment with monensin or NH4Cl, which do not affect release of RRV. Electron microscopic analysis revealed RRV containing small smooth vesicles in the apical area and free virions outside the cell in the brush border, consistent with a vesicular vectorial transport of virus.

However, by contrast to the results with the spleen, the guanoxabenz competition curves for the spinal cord and cerebral cortex were monophasic and resolved only into one site fits, the K (d) of guanoxabenz being about 4000 nmol/l for both tissues. Drug K (d) (S)for kidney (2A)-adrenoceptors were also determined using [(3)H]-RX821002. For nearly all drugs tested, the K (d) (S)were highly correlated with those found for the (2A)-adrenoceptors in the other rat tissues. However, for guanoxabenz, the data indicated that it competed with [(3)H]-RX821002 at a single (2A)-adrenoceptor site with a K (d) of 39 nmol/1. When the rat (2A)-adrenoceptor gene RG20 was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells and its ligand binding properties probed using [(3)H]-RX821002, the drug K (d) (S)obtained were also highly correlated with those found for the (2A)-adrenoceptors in the spleen, cerebral cortex, spinal cord and kidney of the rat. For the RG20 encoded receptor, the guanoxabenz competition curves were steep and monophasic and modelled best into one site fits, with the Kd of guanoxabenz being 5200 nmol/1. It is suggested that guanoxabenz can differentiate between two forms of (2A)-adrenoceptors in the rat: (2A1) and (2A2). The (2A1)-form is present in the spleen and kidney where it shows a high apparent affinity for guanoxabenz. The (2A2)-form shows a low apparent affinity for guanoxabenz and is present in the spleen, cerebal cortex and spinal cord. The (2A2)-form of the rat (2)-adrenoceptor appears to be encoded by the RG20 gene. The (2A), and (2A2)-adrenoceptor forms do not represent high and low affinity receptor forms for agonists because assays included EDTA, Gpp(NH)p and Na(+), which eliminated the high affinity receptors for agonists.","output":"Evidence for the existence of two forms of (2A)-adrenoceptors in the rat"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At present the spread of Covid-19 (Coronavirus disease) has become a major threat to human health.

It causes serious patient dissatisfaction and leads to higher hospital costs. For years, each clinic has made efforts to reduce this complication. Here, we aimed to summarize our techniques to prevent dehiscence. MATERIAL This retrospective study included two groups operated via median sternotomy from March 2009 to May 2019. The first group included 1,105 consecutive patients who only received sternum wire for sternum closure from March 2009 to October 2013. The second group included 1,559 consecutive patients operated from January 2014 to May 2019; preventive closure techniques were performed for predefined high-risk patients in this group. These closure techniques included polyglyconate (Maxon) or simple longitudinal reinforced sutures, sternal cable or sternoband, sternal plate, and Robiscek technique. RESULTS All patients in Group 1, and 63.8% (995/1559) patients in Group 2 received sternal wire only (P < .001). In Group 2, we applied preventive closure techniques to 564 (36.2%) patients. There was no sternal dehiscence in Group 2, whereas 29 (2.6%) patients postoperatively suffered sternal dehiscence in Group 1; this was statistically significant (P = .001, OR:85.5, 95%CI:5.22-1400.4). The overall incidence of mediastinitis was 0.94%. The incidence significantly was lower in Group 2 (P = .004, OR:3.6, 95%CI:1.52-8.82). Sternum-related mortality in Group 2 also was lower (0.54% versus 0.06%, P = .048, OR:8.5, 95% CI: 1.02-70.75). CONCLUSION Sternal dehiscence can be avoided by careful perioperative risk assessment and enhanced closure techniques.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the exposure, impact and experience of the pandemic on families of pediatric solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients compared to families of healthy children and adolescents. METHODS: We recruited 96 families, 48 with a pediatric SOT recipient and 48 healthy controls, matched by child age and gender. A primary caregiver from each family responded to an online sociodemographic questionnaire and the COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Survey (CEFIS), which explores the exposure, impact and experience of the pandemic and lockdown on families. RESULTS: Exposure to the pandemic was greater in families of healthy children and adolescents. The impact was mostly negative in both groups: caregivers reported increased anxiety (76%) and mood disturbances (71.9%) and hindered quality of sleep (64.6%) and health habits (58.3%). On the positive side, family relationships improved. Qualitatively, the SOT group positively perceived isolation and established hygienic measures as protective and destigmatizing, although they reported fear of virus transmission to their child. CONCLUSIONS: The psychological impact of the pandemic has been similar in both groups, although families of transplant recipients have protected themselves more, probably because they are used to prevention measures and they see contagion as a graver risk. Additionally, SOT recipients families presented some idiosyncratic elements, especially a decrease in their perception of stigma associated with the medical condition.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Families of Pediatric Solid Organ Transplant Recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced schools to make a shift in learning mode, from face to face become online remote learning This is also faced and done by chemistry teachers The study was conducted to investigate the response of chemistry teachers to online learning in the COVID-19 pandemic A purposive survey method was used in this study by giving online questionnaires through Google form containing 10 open questions about chemistry learning and practicum conducted by the chemistry teachers in the COVID-19 pandemic The data were collected for a week at the beginning of June 2020 A total of 55 chemistry teachers from West Java participated as respondents The result found that chemistry teachers had tried to utilize various technology platforms in conducting learning Moreover, most of them faced difficulty to arrange the lab-work activities and did nothing Some teachers try to find lab-work multimedia instead of real activities However, the multimedia commonly did not make students pertain the processes skills Since the pandemic could not be predicted when it will finish, this is a kind of challenges and opportunities to think about implementing online chemistry learning from now and then","output":"Chemistry teacher responses to learning in the COVID-19 outbreak: Challenges and opportunities to create innovative lab-work activities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reports a scoping review designed to synthesize current literature that used simulation as an investigative methodology (simulation-based research; SBR) in researching practice competencies in clinical social work.

Because of its high transmissibility, COVID-19 has already caused extensive morbidity and mortality in many countries throughout the world. An accurate estimation of the basic reproduction number (R(0)) of COVID-19 would be beneficial for prevention programs. In light of discrepancies in original research on this issue, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled R(0) for COVID-19 in the current outbreak. METHODS: International databases (including Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, and Scopus) were searched to identify studies conducted regarding the R(0) of COVID-19. Articles were searched using the following keywords: COVID-19 and basic reproduction number or R(0). The heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the I(2) index, the Cochran Q test, and T(2). A random-effects model was used to estimate R(0) in this study. RESULTS: The mean reported R(0) in the identified articles was 3.381.40, with a range of 1.90 to 6.49. According to the results of the random-effects model, the pooled R(0) for COVID-19 was estimated as 3.32 (95% confidence interval, 2.81 to 3.82).

Poor-quality oocytes, along with lower cleavage and implantation rates, reduce fertilization. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine crucial molecular mechanisms behind PCOS pathogenesis and repurpose new drug candidates interacting with them. To predict a more in-depth insight, we applied a novel bioinformatics approach to analyze interactions between the drug-related and PCOS proteins in PCOS patients. METHODS: The newest proteomics data was retrieved from 16 proteomics datasets and was used to construct the PCOS PPI network using Cytoscape. The topological network analysis determined hubs and bottlenecks. The MCODE Plugin was used to identify highly connected regions, and the associations between PCOS clusters and drug-related proteins were evaluated using the Chi-squared/Fisher's exact test. The crucial PPI hub-bottlenecks and the shared molecules (between the PCOS clusters and drug-related proteins) were then investigated for their drug-protein interactions with previously US FDA-approved drugs to predict new drug candidates. RESULTS: The PI3K/AKT pathway was significantly related to one PCOS subnetwork and most drugs (metformin, letrozole, pioglitazone, and spironolactone); moreover, VEGF, EGF, TGFB1, AGT, AMBP, and RBP4 were identified as the shared proteins between the PCOS subnetwork and the drugs. The shared top biochemical pathways between another PCOS subnetwork and rosiglitazone included metabolic pathways, carbon metabolism, and citrate cycle, while the shared proteins included HSPB1, HSPD1, ACO2, TALDO1, VDAC1, and MDH2. We proposed some new candidate medicines for further PCOS treatment investigations, such as copper and zinc compounds, reteplase, alteplase, gliclazide, Etc. CONCLUSION: Some of the crucial molecules suggested by our model have already been experimentally reported as critical molecules in PCOS pathogenesis. Moreover, some repurposed medications have already shown beneficial effects on infertility treatment.

This study presents novel findings on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on smoking behaviour in older adults. METHODS: Panel data were obtained from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (N= 60160, 12% smokers, 55% women, 62% married, mean age = 67 years, 23% employed). Fixed effect regression models were used to estimate the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic affected smoking behaviour. A separate model was estimated for men, women, employed, and retired. RESULTS: The findings suggest a significant and positive effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on smoking behaviour (= 0.024; p<0.001). The estimated effects were stronger for men and for the sample of individuals reporting being employed. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, I provide robust evidence of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on smoking behaviour using the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. This large and representative dataset is uniquely suited for the analysis. I find evidence that the proportion of smokers has increased significantly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. IMPLICATIONS: In the UK, the proportion of smokers increased significantly as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest that smoking behaviour may have been used as a mechanism to cope with depression, stress, and anxiety due to the COVID-19 outbreak. To the extent to which smoking behaviour has been used as a coping mechanism to deal with job-related issues, targeted policy action to provide financial stability to those in worse economic situations may be have beneficial effects on smoking behaviour.","output":"The Consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Smoking Behaviour: Evidence from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Skin temperature represents human body temperature Measurement of body temperature aims to detect body organs changes activity, including fighting bacteria or viruses in the human body Measurement of non-contact/long-distance body temperature is an important requirement during the Covid-19 pandemic Based on this background, the development of long body temperature remote based on an Infrared Array SensorGrid-EYE sensor was conducted through microcontroller control Variable of experiments to measure body temperature were distances and the inclined angle of the skin surface The method of designing skin temperature monitoring glasses begins with three main stages process The first process of understanding and analyzing the characteristics of solar cells, the process of measuring the energy of these solar cells The second process involves designing and manufacturing electronic systems The third process is by conducting an experimental experiment on temperature detector glasses The components of this temperature detector system generally consist of infrared-based temperature sensors, signal conditioning circuits, microcontrollers, and were equipped with software that makes easy controlling The results of the experiment showed the accurate measurement with a maximum distance up to 4 meters could monitor the skin temperature of human body with percentage error 0,18% More than distance 4 meters, the ability of sensors was not accurately to monitor skin temperature of human body","output":"Skin temperature monitoring with an instrument infrared sensors measuring based on direction and distance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 spreads across the globe, crowdsourced digital technology harbours the potential to improve surveillance and epidemic control, primarily through increased information coverage, higher information speed, fast case tracking and improved proximity tracing.

Methods: Patients with intracranial lymphoma or high-grade glioma and healthy controls were included in this study (training cohort (n = 10) and validation cohort: intracranial lymphoma (n = 10), high-grade glioma (n = 32), and healthy controls (n = 20)). After RNA was extracted from serum exosomes, the high-throughput sequencing was used to determine the expression profiles of serum exosomal miRNAs and screen the differentially expressed miRNAs. RT-qPCR was used to verify the expressions of the selected miRNAs. The differences of miRNA expressions between groups were assessed by the Kruskal-Wallis test. The diagnostic value was analyzed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: High-throughput sequencing demonstrated that 170 miRNAs, including 109 upregulated ones and 61 downregulated ones, were differentially expressed in serum exosomes between the patients with intracranial lymphoma and high-grade glioma. Compared with the healthy controls, the number of differential serum exosomal miRNAs in the high-grade glioma group and intracranial lymphoma group was 130 and 173, respectively. RT-qPCR proved that both miR-766-5p and miR-376b-5p were significantly downregulated in high-grade glioma and intracranial lymphoma patients compared with the healthy controls (all p < 0.001), and the expression of serum exosomal miR-766-5p in the intracranial lymphoma group was lower compared with the high-grade glioma group (p < 0.05). The areas under ROC curve (AUCs) of serum exosomal miR-766-5p and miR-376b-5p for the diagnosis of glioma were 0.8883 (p < 0.001) and 0.7688 (p = 0.001), respectively, and they were 0.9271 (p < 0.001) and 0.8542 (p < 0.001), respectively, for the diagnosis of intracranial lymphoma.

The sensitivity of the MIP electrodes to VCM in whole blood and buffered saline, but the background current in blood was higher than that in saline. This high background current was also seen in the deproteinized plasma. Thus, the current is probably originated from the oxidation of low molecular weight reducing agents in the blood.

However, the NGAL measurement timepoints vary from immediately after ROSC to several days later. The primary objective of this study was to determine an association between AKI and NGAL, both immediately (ROSC-NGAL) and 3 h after ROSC (3 h-NGAL), in OHCA patients with TTM. The secondary objective was to ascertain the association between NGAL levels in the early post-ROSC phase and the neurologic outcomes at discharge. METHODS This prospective observational study was conducted between January 2016 and December 2018 and enrolled adult OHCA patients (18 years) with TTM after ROSC. The serum NGAL level was measured both immediately and 3 h after ROSC. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the associations between AKI, poor neurologic outcome, and NGAL. RESULTS Among 861 OHCA patients, 89 patients were enrolled. AKI occurred in 48 (55.1%) patients. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, 3 h-NGAL was significantly associated with AKI (odds ratio [OR] 1.022; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.009-1.035; p = 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 3 h-NGAL for AKI was 0.910 (95% CI 0.830-0.960), and a cut-off value of 178 ng/mL was identified. Both ROSC-NGAL and 3 h-NGAL were not significantly associated with poor neurologic outcome on multivariate logistic regression analysis (ROSC-NGAL; OR 1.017; 95% CI 0.998-1.036; p = 0.084, 3 h-NGAL; OR 0.997; 95% CI 0.992-1.001; p = 0.113). CONCLUSIONS The serum NGAL concentration measured 3 h after ROSC is an excellent early predictive marker for AKI in OHCA patients treated with TTM.

Centered on a quantitative approach, the research is based on the application of a questionnaire to a sample of 741 Portuguese consumers, between November 2020 and February 2021, a period during which the most severe measures of social isolation were imposed by the Portuguese government, since the beginning of the pandemic. Moreover, the questionnaire was applied to consumers over 18 years old. According to this population, and considering a 95% confidence level and a margin of error of 4%, the sample has a minimum of 601 responses. Being so, the results of this research are representative for the Portuguese food consumers. The theoretical model was estimated using Partial Least Squares (PLS) in the Smart PLS 3.0 software. The obtained results allowed us to conclude that the Portuguese perception of their weight did not change in the pandemic, despite showing that in general, the pandemic had a negative impact on their physical condition. On the other hand, the results show that the Portuguese associate the practice of physical exercise with physical well-being. Respondents also confirm a positive relationship between positive eating behaviors (such as consumption of fruits and vegetables, low saturated foods and rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and water consumption) and the perception of physical health in general. On the contrary, respondents perception of the choice of negative eating behaviors (measured by the consumption of products with a high content of salt and sugar, snacks, and processed frozen and pre-cooked foods) have a negative impact on the assessment of physical health, in the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, it was concluded that the Portuguese consider that an eventual increase in weight does not necessarily correspond to a perception of worse physical health;the practice of physical exercise and good eating habits corresponds to a perception of better physical health;the adoption of bad eating habits corresponds to the perception of bad physical health.","output":"Physical Health of Food Consumers during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Presence of recanalisation will favour for better physiological recovery after medical management of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) along with lesser chances of post thrombotic syndrome. Rate of recanalisation is varied and can range from 43-57% and the factors that affect recanalisation are still a dilemma. Objective To know the factors for recanalisation following Deep Vein Thrombosis. Method This is a single institution based retrospective-prospective analytical study encompassing all ultrasonologically diagnosed cases of Deep Vein Thrombosis in adults from January 2015 to November 2017. All the cases were admitted with oral warfarin bridged by Heparin/ Enoxaparin and were discharged once International Normalization Ratio was in therapeutic range. The patients were followed up for three months with minimal of three outpatient followup. Best finding in the doppler ultrasonography (done by Acuson P500, Seimens) in relation to recanalisation was taken for the study. Result There were 67 cases of Deep Vein Thrombosis. Of these cases male to female ratio was 0.91. The mean age was 48.07. Most common extent was up to common femoral vein (47.8%) followed by upto popliteal vein (40.3%). Remaining 11.9% had extension upto iliac veins. There was no recanalisation in 2 cases (3%). Partial recanalisation was seen in 23 cases (34.3%) while complete recanalisation was seen in 42 cases (62.7%). Recanalisation is more in DVT involving popliteal vein while it decreases as the extension goes up. In contrast to 79.4% complete recanalisation in popliteal vein, that in common femoral vein is 62.5% while in iliac vein is only 37.5%. Mean age in no recanalisation group is much younger than partial or complete recanalisation groups. Conclusion Recanalisation following Deep Vein Thrombosis distal to popliteal vein is more than that in proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis. The information on recanalization can be considered to use to decide upon the duration of medical management of Deep Vein Thrombosis.","output":"Factors Affecting Recanalisation after Optimal Management of Deep Vein Thrombosis; A single institution based study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although several clinical manifestations of persistent long coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been documented, their effects on the cardiovascular and autonomic nervous system over the long term remain unclear. Thus, we examined the presence of alterations in cardiac autonomic functioning in individuals with long-term manifestations. The study was conducted from October 2020 to May 2021, and an autonomic assessment was performed to collect heart rate data for the heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. The study participants were divided into the long COVID clinical group, the intragroup, which included patients who were hospitalized, and those who were not hospitalized and were symptomatic for different periods (3, >3, 6, and >6 months), with and without dyspnoea. The control group, the intergroup, comprised of COVID-free individuals. Our results demonstrated that the long COVID clinical group showed reduced HRV compared with the COVID-19-uninfected control group. Patients aged 23C59 years developed COVID symptoms within 30 days after infection, whose diagnosis was confirmed by serologic or reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (swab) tests, were included in the study. A total of 155 patients with long COVID [95 women (61.29%), mean age 43.88  10.88 years and 60 men (38.71%), mean age 43.93  10.11 years] and 94 controls [61 women (64.89%), mean age 40.83  6.31 and 33 men (35.11%), mean age 40.69  6.35 years] were included. The intragroup and intergroup comparisons revealed a reduction in global HRV, increased sympathetic modulation influence, and a decrease in parasympathetic modulation in long COVID. The intragroup showed normal sympathovagal balance, while the intergroup showed reduced sympathovagal balance. Our findings indicate that long COVID leads to sympathetic excitation influence and parasympathetic reduction. The excitation can increase the heart rate and blood pressure and predispose to cardiovascular complications. Short-term HRV analysis showed good reproducibility to verify the cardiac autonomic involvement.","output":"Reduction of Cardiac Autonomic Modulation and Increased Sympathetic Activity by Heart Rate Variability in Patients With Long COVID"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION/HYPOTHESIS: Recent studies have shown that healthcare workers directly engaged with COVID-19 patients and those with pre-existing psychological problems were at increased risk of anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms. It is not known whether these symptoms are anticipatory or reactive. This study examines the influence that the perception of the course in time of the pandemic (early, middle, late) has on ICU professionals' mental health. We hypothesize that those workers who perceive that they were at the beginning of the pandemic would have higher anticipatory anxiety, but those who perceived they were toward the end would have higher reactive depression and somatization symptoms. METHODS: On April 7, 2020, an email survey was sent to the members of SCCM with a reminder email one week later to those who hadn't yet responded. Collected information included demographic data, perception of caseload and point in the time course of the pandemic, and responses to psychological instruments assessing depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and symptom somatization (PHQ-15). RESULTS: ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc analysis of the 939 responses showed no significant difference between respondent's perception of their stage in the time course of the pandemic (early, middle, toward the end) and levels of depression (PHQ-9) or anxiety (GAD-7);however, those who believed they were near the end of the pandemic had significantly fewer somatic symptoms (PHQ-15) than those who believed they were early or mid (p< 0.05). DISCUSSION: Perception of stage in the time course of the pandemic did not influence the presence of depression or anxiety but did lead to improved somatization symptoms for those who felt they were at the end of the pandemic. These results suggest that reactive depression and anxiety abate more slowly than somatic symptoms during a pandemic. Psychological interventions for the ICU professional should start in the earliest stages of a pandemic and persist throughout the course.","output":"Effect of perception of stage in time course of the pandemic on the emotional health of ICU workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic posed a great deal of challenge to the higher education community, the curricula for online instruction had to be developed in a very short time period Adaptations for Organic Chemistry I and II with Laboratory courses have been made for the online transition in response to the pandemic, and the insights gained through individual and collaborative efforts are presented by Georgia Gwinnett College (GGC) Organic Chemistry faculty Herein, course specific information with a distinction between lecture and lab and the analysis of student assessment and withdrawal provide insights into the virtual instruction The initiative of instructors played a crucial role during the transition and for maintaining student engagement, and the insights will add valuable resources for further virtual or hybrid instruction","output":"Insights and Initiatives While Teaching Organic Chemistry I and II with Laboratory Courses in the Time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Housing is a key social determinant of health with implications for both physical and mental health. The measurement of healthy housing and studies characterizing the same in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are uncommon. This study described a methodological approach employed in the assessment and characterization of healthy housing in SSA using the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data for 15 countries and explored healthy housing determinants using a multiple survey-weighted logistic regression analysis. For all countries, we demonstrated that the healthy housing index developed using factor analysis reasonably satisfies both reliability and validity tests and can therefore be used to describe the distribution of healthy housing across different groups and in understanding the linkage with individual health outcomes. We infer from the results that unhealthy housing remains quite high in most SSA countries. Having a male head of the household was associated with decreased odds of healthy housing in Burkina Faso (OR = 0.80, CI = 0.68C0.95), Cameroon (OR = 0.65, CI = 0.57, 0.76), Malawi (OR = 0.70, CI = 0.64C0.78), and Senegal (OR = 0.62, CI = 0.51C0.74). Further, increasing household size was associated with reducing odds of healthy housing in Kenya (OR = 0.53, CI = 0.44C0.65), Namibia (OR = 0.34, CI = 0.24C0.48), Nigeria (OR = 0.57, CI = 0.46C0.71), and Uganda (OR = 0.79, CI = 0.67C0.94). Across all countries, household wealth was a strong determinant of healthy housing, with middle and rich households having higher odds of residing in healthy homes compared to poor households. Odds ratios ranged from 3.63 (CI = 2.96C4.44) for households in the middle wealth group in the DRC to 2812.2 (CI = 1634.8C4837.7) in Namibias wealthiest households. For other factors, the analysis also showed variation across countries. Our findings provide timely insights for the implementation of housing policies across SSA countries, drawing attention to aspects of housing that would promote occupant health and wellbeing. Beyond the contribution to the measurement of healthy housing in SSA, our paper highlights key policy and program issues that need further interrogation in the search for pathways to addressing the healthy housing deficit across most SSA countries.

When infected, children generally remain asymptomatic or develop mild disease. A small number of pediatric cases required admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), respiratory support with a mechanical ventilation and additional life-saving interventions. Even if rarely, death can occur. Aim of this manuscript is to highlight the risk factors associated with severe outcome among pediatric patients with COVID-19. MAIN FINDINGS: Early identification of SARS-CoV-2-infected children at risk of developing severe COVID-19 is vital for service planning, as severely affected pediatric patients require high-quality care and should be followed only where an adequately structured PICU is available. However, early identification of children who must be carefully monitored for substantial risk of severe COVID-19 remains difficult. An underlying comorbidity and heart involvement are frequently observed in severe paediatric cases. Reduced left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction < 60%; diastolic dysfunction; and arrhythmias, including ST segment changes, QTc prolongation, and premature atrial or ventricular beat, are the earliest manifestations of heart involvement. Inclusion of heart enzyme serum levels and evaluation of ventricular function among predictive markers could lead to a more effective evaluation of children at risk with proper selection of those to admit to the PICU and with more adequate treatment in case of more severe clinical manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: To appropriately manage severe pediatric COVID-19 cases, greater attention should be paid to risk factors in children and adolescents, especially to cardiovascular alterations (e.g., heart enzyme serum levels and evaluation of ventricular function). Further studies are needed and the development of a validated score based on all the most common presumed markers of disease severity seems essential.","output":"What are the risk factors for admission to the pediatric intensive unit among pediatric patients with COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has precipitated a global health crisis of unprecedented proportions. Due to its severe impact, multiple COVID-19 vaccines are being developed, approved, and manufactured rapidly. However, some serious adverse events (AEs) were reported after the application of them, significantly increasing concerns about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines and doubts about the necessity of vaccination. Particularly, previous vaccination campaigns have shown us that partial vaccination can induce neurologic AEs. Herein, we discussed in depth the involvement of the nervous system during SARS-CoV-2 infection or after vaccination. On the one hand, COVID-19 could pose an enormous threat to human neurological health through direct infection and indirect neurotoxicity effects. On the other hand, our review indicated that only a few serious neurological AEs following vaccination occurred and among which headache was the most common. Moreover, some neurological AEs do not seem to be related to vaccination. Of course, the causal relationships between several vaccines and AEs are considered plausible and, it is not doubtful that these AEs should be taken seriously by clinicians in assessing the potential risks and benefits of vaccinations in special populations. Nevertheless, in the case of the rapid spread of COVID-19, the potential side effects of vaccination on nervous system should be compared with adverse COVID-19 outcomes rather than being considered alone.

METHODS An in vitro screen of the Chemtura library identified several compounds with activity against Tacaribe virus (TCRV), a clade B arenavirus closely related to JUNV. Of these compounds, D746, a phenolic dibenzylsulfide, was further pursued for additional in vitro studies and evaluated in the AG129 mouse TCRV infection model. RESULTS D746 was found to act during an early to intermediate stage of the TCRV replication cycle and M range activity was confirmed by virus yield reduction assays with both TCRV and JUNV. Although intraperitoneal twice daily treatment regimens were found to be highly effective when started 2 h prior to TCRV challenge in AG129 mice, post-exposure treatment initiated 3 days after infection was not efficacious.

Our model calculates the number of the different types of RPDs that should be stockpiled and the consequent cost of purchase and storage, prorating this cost over the shelf life of the inventory. Compared with disposable N95 or powered air-purifying respirators, we show that stockpiling reusable elastomeric half-face respirators is the least costly approach.

The ability to rapidly recover whole genome sequences and analyze the spread and evolution of pathogens using genetic information and pathogen collection dates has lead to interest in real-time tracking of infectious transmission and outbreaks. However, the level of temporal resolution afforded by these analyses may conflict with definitions of what constitutes protected health information (PHI) and privacy requirements for de-identification for publication and public sharing of research data and metadata. In the United States, dates and locations associated with patient care that provide greater resolution than year or the first three digits of the zip code are generally considered patient identifiers. Admission and discharge dates are specifically named as identifiers in Department of Health and Human Services guidance. To understand the degree to which one can impute admission dates from specimen collection dates, we examined sample collection dates and patient admission dates associated with more than 270,000 unique microbiological results from the University of Washington Laboratory Medicine Department between 2010 and 2017. Across all positive microbiological tests, the sample collection date exactly matched the patient admission date in 68.8% of tests. Collection dates and admission dates were identical from emergency department and outpatient testing 86.7% and 96.5% of the time, respectively, with >99% of tests collected within 1 day from the patient admission date. Samples from female patients were significantly more likely to be collected closer to admission date that those from male patients. We show that PHI-associated dates such as admission date can confidently be imputed from deposited collection date. We suggest that publicly depositing microbiological collection dates at greater resolution than the year may not meet routine Safe Harbor-based requirements for patient de-identification.

The model is described by a mixed system of ordinary and partial differential equations which is constituted by the within-host virus infectious fast time ordinary system and the between-host disease transmission slow time age-structured system. The isolated fast system has been investigated in previous literatures, and the main results are introduced. For the isolated slow system, the basic reproduction number R(b0), the positivity and ultimate boundedness of solutions are obtained, the existence of equilibria, the local stability of equilibria, and the global stability of disease-free equilibrium are established. We see that when R(b0)  1 the system only has the disease-free equilibrium which is globally asymptotically stable, and when R(b0) > 1 the system has a unique endemic equilibrium which is local asymptotically stable. With regard to the coupled slow system, the basic reproduction number R(b), the positivity and boundedness of solutions and the existence of equilibria are firstly obtained. Particularly, the coupled slow system can exist two positive equilibria when R(b) < 1 and a unique endemic equilibrium when R(b) > 1. When R(b) < 1 the disease-free equilibrium is local asymptotically stable, and when R(b) > 1 and an additional condition is satisfied the unique endemic equilibrium is local asymptotically stable. When there exist two positive equilibria, under an additional condition the local asymptotic stability of a positive equilibrium and the instability of other positive equilibrium also are established. The numerical examples show that the additional condition may be removed. The research shows that the coupled slow age-structured system has more complex dynamical behavior than the corresponding isolated slow system.","output":"An age-structured model for coupling within-host and between-host dynamics in environmentally-driven infectious diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapidly spread coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has limited people's outdoor activities and hence caused substantial reductions in anthropogenic emissions around the world. However, the air quality in some megacities has not been improved as expected due to the complex responses of aerosol chemistry to the changes in precursors and meteorology. Here we demonstrate the responses of primary and secondary aerosol species to the changes in anthropogenic emissions during the COVID-19 outbreak in Beijing, China along with the Chinese New Year (CNY) holiday effects on air pollution by using six-year aerosol particle composition measurements. Our results showed large reductions in primary aerosol species associated with traffic, cooking and coal combustion emissions by 30-50% on average during the CNY, while the decreases in secondary aerosol species were much small (5-12%). These results point towards a future challenge in mitigating secondary air pollution because the reduced gaseous precursors may not suppress secondary aerosol formation efficiently under stagnant meteorological conditions. By analyzing the long-term measurements from 2012 to 2020, we found considerable increases in the ratios of nitrate to sulfate, secondary to primary OA, and sulfur and nitrogen oxidation capacity despite the overall decreasing trends in mass concentrations of most aerosol species, suggesting that the decreases in anthropogenic emissions have facilitated secondary formation processes during the last decade. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms driving the chemical responses of secondary aerosol to the changes in anthropogenic emissions under complex meteorological environment is essential for future mitigation of air pollution in China.","output":"A chemical cocktail during the COVID-19 outbreak in Beijing, China: Insights from six-year aerosol particle composition measurements during the Chinese New Year holiday"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Canine coronavirus (CCoV) is responsible for mild or moderate enteritis in puppies.

A 2-year investment period is needed for replacement female heifers to grow before entering the milking herd. The management of replacements over this 2-year period can vary greatly among operations, making it difficult to compare producers cost to benchmark. The objective of this project was to develop a model to calculate the cost of rearing a replacement heifer from birth to weaning under different housing, milk source, allotments, and labor and health management decisions to be used as a dairy farm decision support tool. We calculated the cost for management options with general cost values. We found that the average feed cost represented 46% of the total cost while labor, and fixed and variable costs represented 33%, 9%, and 12%, respectively. The total cost increased as milk allotment increased, but cost per Kg of gain decreased. The ranges in total cost within each management scenario often exceed the difference in cost from one scenario to the next. In conclusion, variable costs have the potential to vary among operations, playing a major role in the total cost of rearing replacements from birth to weaning. ABSTRACT: Dairy calves are raised in various housing and feeding environments on dairy farms around North America. The objective of this study was to develop a simulation model to calculate the cost of raising replacement dairy heifers using different inputs that reflect different management decisions and evaluate their influence on the total cost. In this simulation, 84 calves were modeled between 0C2 months of age to reflect a 1000 heifer herd. The decisions associated with housing, liquid diet source and allowance, labor utilization, and health were calculated. Costs and biological responses were reflective of published surveys, literature, and market conditions. A 10,000-iteration economic simulation was used for each management scenario using @Risk and PrecisionTree add-ons (Palisade Corporation, Ithaca, NY, USA) to account for variation in pre-weaning mortality rate, weaning age, and disease prevalence. As milk allotment increased, total feed cost increased. Feeding calves a higher allowance of milk resulted in a lower cost per kg of gain. Average feed cost percentage of the total cost was 46% (min, max: 33%, 59%) while labor, and fixed and variable cost represented 33% (20%, 45%), 9% (2%, 12%), and 12% (10%, 14%), respectively. Total pre-weaning costs ranged from $258.56 to $582.98 per calf across all management scenarios and milk allotments.","output":"An Economic Analysis of the Costs Associated with Pre-Weaning Management Strategies for Dairy Heifers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To identify strategies used by registered nurses and non\\\\registered nursing care staff in overcoming barriers when providing fundamental nursing care for non\\\\invasively ventilated inpatients with COVID\\\\19.

METHODS: In August 2020, we asked UK\\\\based nursing staff to describe any strategies they employed to overcome barriers to delivering care in 15 fundamental nursing care categories when providing care to non\\\\invasively ventilated patients with COVID\\\\19. We analysed data using Framework Analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1062 nurses consented to participate in our survey. We derived four themes. 1) Communication behaviours included adapting verbal and non\\\\verbal communication with patients, using information technology to enable patients significant others to communicate with staff and patients, and establishing clear information\\\\sharing methods with other staff. 2) Organizing care required clustering interventions, carefully managing supplies, encouraging patient self\\\\care and using runners and interdisciplinary input. 3) Addressing patients well\\\\being and values required spending time with patients, acting in loco familiae, providing access to psychological and spiritual support, obtaining information about patients wishes early on and providing privacy and comforting/meaningful items. 4) Management and leadership behaviours included training, timely provision of pandemic information, psychological support, team huddles and facilitating regular breaks. CONCLUSIONS: Our respondents identified multiple strategies in four main areas of clinical practice. Management and leadership are crucial to both fundamental care delivery and the well\\\\being of nurses during pandemics. Grouping strategies into these areas of action may assist nurses and leaders to prepare for pandemic nursing.

Nevertheless, the disease course and predictors of mortality in critically ill patients are poorly understood. Methods: Following the critical developments in ICUs in regions experiencing early inception of the pandemic, the European-based, international RIsk Stratification in COVID-19 patients in the Intensive Care Unit (RISC-19-ICU) registry was created to provide near real-time assessment of patients developing critical illness due to COVID-19. Findings: As of April 22, 2020, 639 critically ill patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the RISC-19-ICU registry. Of these, 398 had deceased or been discharged from the ICU. ICU-mortality was 24%, median length of stay 12 (IQR, 5-21) days. ARDS was diagnosed in 74%, with a minimum P/F-ratio of 110 (IQR, 80-148). Prone positioning, ECCO2R, or ECMO were applied in 57%. Off-label therapies were prescribed in 265 (67%) patients, and 89% of all bloodstream infections were observed in this subgroup (n = 66; RR=32, 95% CI [17-60]). While PCT and IL-6 levels remained similar in ICU survivors and non-survivors throughout the ICU stay (p = 035, 034), CRP, creatinine, troponin, d-dimer, lactate, neutrophil count, P/F-ratio diverged within the first seven days (p<001). On a multivariable Cox proportional-hazard regression model at admission, creatinine, d-dimer, lactate, potassium, P/F-ratio, alveolar-arterial gradient, and ischemic heart disease were independently associated with ICU-mortality. Interpretation: The European RISC-19-ICU cohort demonstrates a moderate mortality of 24% in critically ill patients with COVID-19.

Beyond the immediate delay a backlog for future patients is expected. Such delays can lead to disease progression. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop guidance on criteria for prioritization for surgery and reconfiguring management pathways for non-metastatic stage of prostate cancer who opt for surgical treatment. A second aim was to identify the infection prevention and control (IPC) measures to achieve low likelihood of COVID-19 hazard if radical prostatectomy was to be carried out during the outbreak and whilst the disease is endemic. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: An accelerated consensus process and systematic review. We conducted a systematic review of the evidence on COVID-19 and reviewed international guidance on prostate cancer. These were presented to an international prostate cancer expert panel (n=34) through an online meeting. The consensus process underwent three rounds of survey in total. Additions to the second- and third-round surveys were formulated based on the answers and comments from the previous rounds. OUTCOME MEASURES: Consensus opinion was defined as &#8805;80% agreement, which were used to reconfigure the prostate cancer pathways. RESULTS: Evidence on the delayed management of patients with prostate cancer is scarce. There was 100% agreement that prostate cancer pathways should be reconfigured and develop measures to prevent nosocomial COVID-19 for patients treated surgically. Consensus was reached on prioritization criteria of patients for surgery and management pathways for those who have delayed treatment. IPC measures to achieve a low likelihood of nosocomial COVID-19 were coined as \\"COVID-19 cold sites\\". CONCLUSION: Re-configuring management pathways for prostate cancer patients is recommended if significant delay (>3-6 months) in surgical management is unavoidable. The mapped pathways provide guidance for such patients. The IPC processes proposed provide a framework for providing radical prostatectomy within an environment with low COVID-19 risk during the outbreak or when the disease remains endemic. The broader concepts could be adapted to other indications beyond prostate cancer surgery.","output":"Management of patients who opt for radical prostatectomy during the COVID-19 pandemic: An International Accelerated Consensus Statement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We consider latent Gaussian fields for modelling spatial dependence in the context of both spatial point patterns and areal data, providing two different applications.

Here, we aimed to estimate the basic reproduction number (0) of COVID-19 in Iran. Methods: To estimate 0 in Iran and Tehran, the capital, we used 3 different methods: exponential growth rate, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian time-dependent. Daily number of confirmed cases and serial intervals with a mean of 4.27 days and a standard deviation of 3.44 days with gamma distribution were used. Sensitivity analysis was performed to show the importance of generation time in estimating 0. Results: The epidemic was in its exponential growth 11 days after the beginning of the epidemic (Feb 19, 2020) with doubling time of 1.74 (CI: 1.58-1.93) days in Iran and 1.83 (CI: 1.39-2.71) in Tehran. Nationwide, the value of 0 from February 19 to 29 using exponential growth method, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian time-dependent methods was 4.70 (95% CI: 4.23-5.23), 3.90 (95% CI: 3.47- 4.36), and 3.23 (95% CI: 2.94-3.51), respectively.

In this session, MIT AgeLab researchers will present findings from a mixed methods study with the MIT AgeLab 85+ Lifestyle Leaders, a panel study of octogenarians and nonagenarians that began in September 2015. In March 2020, AgeLab researchers began conducting a series of telephone interviews (n=15) with Lifestyle Leaders and collected quantitative data via an online survey (n=25). Together, the interviews and survey inquired about Lifestyle Leaders attitudes and behaviors related to COVID-19, as well as their uses of technology throughout the crisis. Findings suggest that fears about the impacts of coronavirus transcended multiple domains of the Lifestyle Leaders lives, including their physical, socioemotional, and financial wellbeing. Lifestyle Leaders were asked about functional and emotional repercussions of social distancing and other precautions they had taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and to protect themselves from contracting the virus. Special attention was paid to differences in lived experiences of the COVID-19 crisis among Lifestyle Leaders who were living independently versus those who were living in assisted living or continuing care retirement communities.

Besides, hygiene related factors such as the public health measures by the government and possible personal awareness in the community can also affect the spread of infectious respiratory diseases. However, there is no quantitative support for this conclusion, because of lack of quality data. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (or SARS) outbreak in 2003 triggered strict public health measures and personal awareness in the prevention of infectious respiratory diseases, providing us an opportunity to quantify the impact of hygiene related factors in the spread of the disease. In this paper, we model the number of the respiratory illnesses by a semiparametric model which models the environmental and weather impacts using a multiple index model and the impact of other public health measures and possible personal awareness using a growth curve with jump. Using data from Hong Kong, we found that public health measures contributed to about 39% of reduction in the number of respiratory illnesses during the SARS period. However, the impact of hygienically related factors eventually fades as time passes. The results provide indirect quantitative support to the usefulness of governmental campaigns to arouse the awareness of the public in staying away from transmission of respiratory diseases during the full outbreak of the disease. The results also show the fast fading of alertness of Hong Kong people towards the epidemic. Furthermore, our model also offers a way to model the impacts of environmental factors on respiratory diseases, when the data contains the effect of human intervention, by introducing the change point and growth curve to remove such an effect.","output":"Modeling respiratory illnesses with change point: A lesson from the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among the various host cellular processes that are hijacked by flaviviruses, few mechanisms have been described with regard to viral egress. Here we investigate how flaviviruses exploit Src family kinases (SFKs) for exit from infected cells. We identify Lyn as a critical component for secretion of Dengue and Zika infectious particles and their corresponding virus like particles (VLPs). Pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion of the SFKs, Lyn in particular, block virus secretion. Lyn(?/?) cells are impaired in virus release and are rescued when reconstituted with wild-type Lyn, but not a kinase- or palmitoylation-deficient Lyn mutant. We establish that virus particles are secreted in two distinct populations C one as free virions and the other enclosed within membranes. Lyn is critical for the latter, which consists of proteolytically processed, infectious virus progenies within autophagosome-derived vesicles. This process depends on Ulk1, Rab GTPases and SNARE complexes implicated in secretory but not degradative autophagy and occur with significantly faster kinetics than the conventional secretory pathway. Our study reveals a previously undiscovered Lyn-dependent exit route of flaviviruses in LC3+ secretory organelles that enables them to evade circulating antibodies and might affect tissue tropism.","output":"Lyn kinase regulates egress of flaviviruses in autophagosome-derived organelles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, frequent interregional contacts and the high rate of infection spread have catalyzed the formation of an epidemic network. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify influential nodes and highlight the hidden structural properties of the COVID-19 epidemic network, which we believe is central to prevention and control of the epidemic. METHODS: We first constructed a network of the COVID-19 epidemic among 31 provinces in mainland China; after some basic characteristics were revealed by the degree distribution, the k-core decomposition method was employed to provide static and dynamic evidence to determine the influential nodes and hierarchical structure. We then exhibited the influence power of the above nodes and the evolution of this power. RESULTS: Only a small fraction of the provinces studied showed relatively strong outward or inward epidemic transmission effects. The three provinces of Hubei, Beijing, and Guangzhou showed the highest out-degrees, and the three highest in-degrees were observed for the provinces of Beijing, Henan, and Liaoning. In terms of the hierarchical structure of the COVID-19 epidemic network over the whole period, more than half of the 31 provinces were located in the innermost core. Considering the correlation of the characteristics and coreness of each province, we identified some significant negative and positive factors. Specific to the dynamic transmission process of the COVID-19 epidemic, three provinces of Anhui, Beijing, and Guangdong always showed the highest coreness from the third to the sixth week; meanwhile, Hubei Province maintained the highest coreness until the fifth week and then suddenly dropped to the lowest in the sixth week. We also found that the out-strengths of the innermost nodes were greater than their in-strengths before January 27, 2020, at which point a reversal occurred.

Objectives: We aimed to determine the prevalence of early bacterial identification in intubated patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia, as compared with influenza pneumonia, and to characterize its microbiology and impact on outcomes. Methods: A multicenter retrospective European cohort was performed in 36 ICUs. All adult patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation >48 hours were eligible if they had SARS-CoV-2 or influenza pneumonia at ICU admission. Bacterial identification was defined by a positive bacterial culture within 48 hours after intubation in endotracheal aspirates, BAL, blood cultures, or a positive pneumococcal or legionella urinary antigen test. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 1,050 patients were included (568 in SARS-CoV-2 and 482 in influenza groups). The prevalence of bacterial identification was significantly lower in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared with patients with influenza pneumonia (9.7 vs. 33.6%; unadjusted odds ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15C0.30; adjusted odds ratio, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.16C0.33; P < 0.0001). Gram-positive cocci were responsible for 58% and 72% of coinfection in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza pneumonia, respectively.

We measured hs-cTnT in all patients to assess myocardial injury and correlations with patients age, symptoms and disease course. Results The data showed that, among the 543 patients studied, 257 patients (47.3%) had hs-cTnT values higher than the upper reference limit (URL) of 14 ng/L. Patients with high hs-cTnT had more frequently fever (p <0.01) and respiratory symptoms (p <0.01), compared to the group with hs-cTnT values below URL. The results showed also that patients with hs-cTnT above URL had a higher frequency of previous cardiovascular disease (p <0.01) as well as of hypertension (p<0.01).

These disruptions are often associated with aggravated symptom burden and diminished health-related quality of life that in turn may compromise treatment adherence and, thus, effectiveness. In addition, disrupted sleep has been linked to carcinogenic processes, which ultimately could result in worse prognostic outcomes. Aims Our aim was to systematically review and conduct a meta-analysis of studies examining the associations between sleep and sleep-wake activity and prognostic outcomes in cancer patients undergoing oncological treatment. Methods A comprehensive systematic search of English language papers was undertaken in June 2020 using PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and CINAHL. Two reviewers independently screened 4,879 abstracts. A total of 26 papers were included in the narrative review. Thirteen papers reporting hazard ratios reflecting associations between a dichotomized predictor variable (sleep) and prognostic outcomes were subjected to meta-analysis. Results Nineteen of the 26 eligible studies on a total of 7,092 cancer patients reported associations between poorer sleep and poorer response to treatment, shorter time to progression, and/or reduced overall survival, but were highly heterogeneous with respect to the sleep and outcome parameters investigated. Meta-analysis revealed statistically significant associations between poor self-reported sleep and reduced overall survival (HR = 1.33 [95% CI 1.09-1.62], k = 11), and shorter time to progression (HR = 1.40 [95% CI 1.23-1.59], k = 3) and between poor objectively assessed sleep and reduced overall survival (HR = 1.74 [95% CI 1.05-2.88], k = 4).

As an alternative to the susceptible-infected-resistant (SIR)-based models, this study proposes a hybrid machine learning approach to predict the COVID-19 and we exemplify its potential using data from Hungary. The hybrid machine learning methods of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multi-layered perceptron-imperialist competitive algorithm (MLP-ICA) are used to predict time series of infected individuals and mortality rate. The models predict that by late May, the outbreak and the total morality will drop substantially. The validation is performed for nine days with promising results, which confirms the model accuracy. It is expected that the model maintains its accuracy as long as no significant interruption occurs. Based on the results reported here, and due to the complex nature of the COVID-19 outbreak and variation in its behavior from nation-to-nation, this study suggests machine learning as an effective tool to model the outbreak.

METHOD The study comprised 3 phases: 1) review of the MEDLINE database since 1958 (first reported experience with telemedicine); 2) Google Forms survey sent to all members of the Spanish Society of Neurology's Headache Study Group (GECSEN); and 3) online consensus of GECSEN experts to issue recommendations for the implementation of telemedicine in Spain. RESULTS COVID-19 has increased waiting times for face-to-face consultations, increasing the use of all telemedicine modalities: landline telephone (from 75% before April 2020 to 97% after), mobile telephone (from 9% to 27%), e-mail (from 30% to 36%), and video consultation (from 3% to 21%). Neurologists are aware of the need to expand the availability of video consultations, which are clearly growing, and other e-health and m-health tools. CONCLUSIONS The GECSEN recommends and encourages all neurologists who assist patients with headaches to implement telemedicine resources, with the optimal objective of offering video consultation to patients under 60-65 years of age and telephone calls to older patients, although each case must be considered on an individual basis.

Most patients with stable headache and/or neuralgia are eligible for telemedicine follow-up, after a first consultation that must always be held in person.","output":"Telemedicine in the management of patients with headache: current situation and recommendations of the Spanish Society of Neurology's Headache Study Group."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this observational study, 13 patients with severe COVID-19 and 10 healthy controls were enrolled.

AMEN (Avondale Moms Empowered to Nurse) launched a Peer-to-Peer support group to increase breastfeeding initiation and duration in an under-resourced African American urban community with low breastfeeding rates. Materials and Methods: A Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR)-guided project was developed in partnership with a neighborhood church. Using modified Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) peer counseling materials, Avondale neighborhood breastfeeding moms were trained and designated Breastfeeding Champions. Community organizations and partnering agencies helped recruit local mothers. Support groups included childcare, transportation, refreshments, and incentives, plus stipends for Champions. A mixed-methods approach captured participation, feeding intention and practices, and program evaluation using electronic data capture. After adding another neighborhood with low breastfeeding rates, AMEN was modified to \\"All Moms Empowered to Nurse.\\" Additional Champion moms were trained as Reaching Our Sisters Everywhere (ROSE) Community Transformers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the group has met weekly by virtual platform. Results: Since May 2017, 67 AMEN support meetings have included 158 participants, with average attendance of 10 (range 5-19) per meeting. In addition to 8 Champions, 110 moms have attended, including 24% expecting mothers. Additional attendees include 13 family support persons, 23 guest speakers, and 12 from community outreach programs. Qualitative feedback from participants has been uniformly positive. Breastfeeding initiation rates have increased 12% in the initial neighborhood. Conclusions: Harnessing strength within the local community, Champion Breastfeeding Moms have successfully launched AMEN breastfeeding support groups in under-resourced African American urban neighborhoods, helping more mothers reach their breastfeeding goals.","output":"African American Breastfeeding Peer Support: All Moms Empowered to Nurse."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long-term care facilities (LTCF) and their vulnerable residents are particularly affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

We report here that the bacterial sRNA SsrA plays an essential role in the light-organ symbiosis between Vibrio fischeri and the squid Euprymna scolopes. The symbionts load SsrA into outer membrane vesicles, which are transported specifically into the epithelial cells surrounding the symbiont population in the light organ. Although an SsrA-deletion mutant (&#916;ssrA) colonized the host to a normal level after 24 h, it produced only 2/10 the luminescence per bacterium, and its persistence began to decline by 48 h. The host's response to colonization by the &#916;ssrA strain was also abnormal: the epithelial cells underwent premature swelling, and host robustness was reduced. Most notably, when colonized by the &#916;ssrA strain, the light organ differentially up-regulated 10 genes, including several encoding heightened immune-function or antimicrobial activities. This study reveals the potential for a bacterial symbiont's sRNAs not only to control its own activities but also to trigger critical responses promoting homeostasis in its host.

We model the global pattern of reported COVID-19 cases during the primary response period, with the aim of learning from the past to prepare for the future. METHODS: Using Bayesian methods, we analyse the response to the COVID-19 outbreak for 158 countries for the period 22 January to 9 June 2020. This encompasses the period in which many countries imposed a variety of response measures and initial relaxation strategies. Instead of modelling specific intervention types and timings for each country explicitly, we adopt a stochastic epidemiological model including a feedback mechanism on virus transmission to capture complex nonlinear dynamics arising from continuous changes in community behaviour in response to rising case numbers. We analyse the overall effect of interventions and community responses across diverse regions. This approach mitigates explicit consideration of issues such as period of infectivity and public adherence to government restrictions. RESULTS: Countries with the largest cumulative case tallies are characterised by a delayed response, whereas countries that avoid substantial community transmission during the period of study responded quickly. Countries that recovered rapidly also have a higher case identification rate and small numbers of undocumented community transmission at the early stages of the outbreak. We also demonstrate that uncertainty in numbers of undocumented infections dramatically impacts the risk of multiple waves. Our approach is also effective at pre-empting potential flare-ups. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the utility of modelling to interpret community behaviour in the early epidemic stages. Two lessons learnt that are important for the future are: i) countries that imposed strict containment measures early in the epidemic fared better with respect to numbers of reported cases; and ii) broader testing is required early in the epidemic to understand the magnitude of undocumented infections and recover rapidly. We conclude that clear patterns of containment are essential prior to relaxation of restrictions and show that modelling can provide insights to this end.","output":"Hindsight is 2020 vision: a characterisation of the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Asymptomatic individuals with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been identified via nucleic acid testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); however, the epidemiologic characteristics and viral shedding pattern of asymptomatic patients remain largely unknown.

Information about the impact of infection on glomerular disease patients in particular has been lacking. Understanding the virus's effect in glomerular disease is constantly changing. This review article summarizes the data published thus far on COVID-19 and its manifestations in pre-existing and de novo glomerular disease. SUMMARY: While patients with glomerular disease may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 due to their immunosuppressed status, some data suggest that a low amount of immunosuppression may be helpful in mitigating the systemic inflammatory response which is associated with high mortality rates in COVID-19. There have been a few case reports on COVID-19 causing glomerular disease relapse in patients. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for kidney injury, proteinuria, and hematuria in the setting of COVID-19. More commonly, these are caused by direct tubular injury due to hemodynamic instability and hypoxic injury. However, the cytokine storm induced by COVID-19 may trigger common post-viral glomerular disease such as IgA nephropathy, anti-GBM, and ANCA vasculitis that have also been described in COVID-19 patients. Collapsing glomerulopathy, a hallmark of HIV-associated nephropathy, is being reported SARS-CoV-2 cases, particularly in patients with high-risk APOL1 alleles. Direct viral invasion of glomerular structures is hypothesized to cause a podocytopathy due to virus's affinity to ACE2, but evidence for this remains under study. KEY MESSAGES: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 may cause glomerular disease in certain patients. The mechanism of de novo glomerular disease in the setting of COVID-19 is under study. The management of patients with existing glomerular disease poses unique challenges, especially with regard to immunosuppression management.

Recently, inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) has been identified as an essential assembly cofactor that efficiently produces both immature virions in vivo and immature virus-like particles in vitro. To date, however, several distinct mechanistic roles for IP6 have been proposed on the basis of independent functional, structural, and kinetic studies. In this work, we investigate the molecular influence of IP6 on the structural outcomes and dynamics of CA/SP1 assembly using coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy calculations. Here, we derive a bottom-up, low-resolution, and implicit-solvent CG model of CA/SP1 and IP6, and simulate their assembly under conditions that emulate both in vitro and in vivo systems. Our analysis identifies IP6 as an assembly accelerant that promotes curvature generation and fissure-like defects throughout the lattice. Our findings suggest that IP6 induces kinetically-trapped immature morphologies, which may be physiologically important for later stages of viral morphogenesis and potentially useful for virus-like particle technologies.","output":"Inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) accelerates immature HIV-1 Gag protein assembly towards kinetically-trapped morphologies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: Studies have suggested mental health improvements following the use of the psychotropic plant concoction ayahuasca in non-clinical and clinical samples. OBJECTIVES: The present observational study assessed depressive symptomatology in 20 clinically depressed patients (symptom score > 13 on the Becks Depression Inventory) before attendance of an ayahuasca ceremony and 1 month and 1 year after. Secondary measures included ratings of altered states of consciousness and ego dissolution during the ayahuasca ceremony as well as global measures of mindfulness, satisfaction with life, depression, anxiety, and stress. RESULTS: Twenty participants completed baseline and 1-day follow-up, 19 completed measures at 1-month follow-up, and 17 completed measures at 1-year follow-up. BDI scores reduced from baseline (M = 22.7) to all post-ceremony measures (Ms 11.45, 12.89, and 8.88, for 1-day, 1-month, and 1-year follow-up, respectively). After 1 day, 12/20 participants were in remission (BDI < 13). Remission rates after 1 month and 1 year were 13/19 and 12/17, respectively. Three participants remained mildly depressed (BDI 14C19) at the 1-month and 1-year follow-up. Two participants did not respond and remained at a moderate/severe level of depression at 1-year follow-up. Reductions on the secondary mental health measures and increases in mindfulness and satisfaction with life were found up to 1 year post-ceremony. Improvements in clinical depression and mental health correlated with levels of experienced ego dissolution and oceanic boundlessness during the ceremony up to 1 month after the ceremony. Engagement in additional mental health treatments or use of another psychedelic during study participation may have contributed to improved mental health ratings at 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSION: Ayahuasca produces long-term mental health improvements in clinically depressed patients, which highlights its therapeutic potential.

The integration of care between care homes and health care services is vital to meet increasing care needs and maintain quality of life. However, care home access to high-quality health care is inequitable. eHealth can facilitate this by supporting remote specialist input on care processes, such as clinical assessment and decision-making, and streamlining care on site. How to best implement eHealth in the care home setting is unclear. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to identify the key factors that influence the implementation of eHealth for people living with dementia in long-term care. METHODS: A systematic search of Embase, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and CINAHL was conducted to identify studies published between 2000 and 2020. Studies were eligible if they focused on eHealth interventions to improve treatment and care assessment or decision-making for residents with dementia in care homes. Data were thematically analyzed and deductively mapped onto the 6 constructs of the adapted Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). The results are presented as a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: A total of 29 studies were included, focusing on a variety of eHealth interventions, including remote video consultations and clinical decision support tools. Key factors that influenced eHealth implementation were identified across all 6 constructs of the CFIR. Most concerned the inner setting construct on requirements for implementation in the care home, such as providing a conducive learning climate, engaged leadership, and sufficient training and resources. A total of 4 novel subconstructs were identified to inform the implementation requirements to meet resident needs and engage end users. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing eHealth in care homes for people with dementia is multifactorial and complex, involving interaction between residents, staff, and organizations. It requires an emphasis on the needs of residents and the engagement of end users in the implementation process. A novel conceptual model of the key factors was developed and translated into 18 practical recommendations on the implementation of eHealth in long-term care to guide implementers or innovators in care homes. Successful implementation of eHealth is required to maximize uptake and drive improvements in integrated health and social care.","output":"Implementation of eHealth to Support Assessment and Decision-making for Residents With Dementia in Long-term Care: Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the potential association of obesity and other chronic diseases with severe outcomes, such as intensive care unit (ICU) admission and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This study analyzed a retrospective cohort of 103 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Demographic data, past medical history, and hospital course were collected and analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was implemented to examine associations. RESULTS: From February 17 to April 5, 103 consecutive patients were hospitalized with COVID-19. Among them, 44 patients (42.7%) were admitted to the ICU, and 29 (65.9%) required IMV. The prevalence of obesity was 47.5% (49 of 103). In a multivariate analysis, severe obesity (BMI &#8805; 35 kg/m2 ) was associated with ICU admission (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.39, 95% CI: 1.13-25.64). Moreover, patients who required IMV were more likely to have had heart disease (aOR: 3.41, 95% CI: 1.05-11.06), obesity (BMI = 30-34.9 kg/m2 ; aOR: 6.85, 95% CI: 1.05-44.82), or severe obesity (BMI &#8805; 35 kg/m2 ; aOR: 9.99, 95% CI: 1.39-71.69). CONCLUSIONS: In our analysis, severe obesity (BMI &#8805; 35 kg/m2 ) was associated with ICU admission, whereas history of heart disease and obesity (BMI &#8805; 30 kg/m2 ) were independently associated with the use of IMV.

All articles retrieved had the title and the abstract read, when the papers reporting the latest evidence on each subject were identified and downloaded for complete reading. DATA SYNTHESIS: In the era of largely implemented bacterial conjugate vaccines and widespread use of amplification nucleic acid techniques, respiratory viruses have been identified as the most frequent causative agents of community-acquired pneumonia in patients under 5 years. Hypoxemia (oxygen saturation 96%) and increased work of breathing are signs most associated with community-acquired pneumonia. Wheezing detected on physical examination independently predicts viral infection and the negative predictive value (95% confidence interval) of normal chest X-ray and serum procalcitonin <0.25 ng/dL was 92% (77C98%) and 93% (90C99%), respectively. Inability to drink/feed, vomiting everything, convulsions, lower chest indrawing, central cyanosis, lethargy, nasal flaring, grunting, head nodding, and oxygen saturation <90% are predictors of death and can be used as indicators for hospitalization.

An up-to-date nationwide estimation of COPD prevalence in China is needed. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of individuals from mainland China aged 40 years or older. The primary outcome was COPD, defined according to the 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) lung function criteria. FINDINGS: Between Dec 29, 2014, and Dec 31, 2015, 66 752 adults were recruited to the study population. The estimated standardised prevalence of COPD was 136% (95% CI 120C152). The prevalence of COPD differed significantly between men and women (190%, 95% CI 169C212 vs 81%, 68C93; p<00001), mainly because of a significant difference in smoking status between men and women (current smokers 582% vs 40%). The prevalence of COPD differed by geographic region, with the highest prevalence in southwest China (202%, 95% CI 147C258) and the lowest in central China (102%, 82C122). Among adults with COPD, 564% (95% CI 537C592) had mild disease (GOLD stage I), 363% (343C383) had moderate disease (GOLD stage II), 65% (55C74) had severe disease (GOLD stage III), and 09% (06C11) had very severe disease (GOLD stage IV). INTERPRETATION: In a large, nationally representative sample of adults aged 40 years or older, the estimated overall prevalence of COPD in China in 2014C15 was 136%, indicating that this disease has become a major public-health problem.

The unavailability of specific therapeutic drugs and vaccines urgently demands sincere efforts for drug discovery against COVID-19. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a critical drug target as it plays an essential role in virus replication. Therefore for the identification of potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, we applied a structure-based virtual screening approach followed by molecular dynamics (MD) study. A library of 686 phytochemicals was subjected to virtual screening which resulted in 28 phytochemicals based on binding energy. These phytochemicals were further subjected to drug-likeness and toxicity analysis, which resulted in seven drug-like hits. Out of seven, five phytochemicals viz., Mpro-Dehydrtectol (-10.3 kcal/mol), Epsilon-viniferin (-8.6 kcal/mol), Peimisine (-8.6 kcal/mol), Gmelanone (-8.4 kcal/mol), and Isocolumbin (-8.4 kcal/mol) were non-toxic. Consequently, these phytochemicals are subjected to MD, post MD analysis, and MM/PBSA calculations. The results of 100 ns MD simulation, RMSF, SASA, Rg, and MM/PBSA show that Epsilon-viniferin (-29.240 kJ/mol), Mpro-Peimisine (-43.031 kJ/mol) and Gmelanone (-13.093 kJ/mol) form a stable complex with Mpro and could be used as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

Additionally, there is increased risk due to reduced humoral immune response, induced by therapeutic B cell depletion. This study sought to quantify humoral response after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with IRD treated with RTX. It also sought to elucidate the influence of timeframe between the last RTX dose and the first vaccination or the status of B cell depletion on antibody titre. METHODS: In this case-control study patients with IRDs previously treated with RTX were examined for humoral immune response after completing the first series of vaccinations with approved vaccines (BNT162b2 (Biontech/Pfizer), RNA-1273 (Moderna), (AstraZeneca/Oxford), Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson). Antibody levels were quantified using the Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac ELISA [EI-S1-IgG-quant]. Blood samples were taken just before the next infusion with RTX after the vaccination. The interval between the last RTX infusion and the first vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and other possible influencing factors on the antibody levels were evaluated. RESULTS: 102 patients were included. 65 (64%) showed a negative antibody level (<24IE/ml) after the vaccination. The comparative univariate analysis of the antibody levels achieved a significant result (p= 0.0008) for the time between last RTX infusion and first vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. No CD19+ peripheral B-cells could be measured in 73 of the patients (72%). CONCLUSION: The study confirms the negative impact of RTX on antibody level after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. A clear relationship exists between antibody titre and interval of the last infusion to the first vaccination, number of peripheral B-cells and immunoglobulin quantity. These parameters help improve synchronization of vaccination and RTX therapy regimen.","output":"Humoral immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases under treatment with Rituximab: a case-control study (COVID-19VacRTX)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid emergence of the novel coronavirus [SARS-CoV2] and the coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] has caused significant global morbidity and mortality.

Rheumatology OBJECTIVE: Unusual clinical course BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has recently been described in children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This report describes 2 children with MIS-C who were initially diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome but who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, supporting the diagnosis of MIS-C. CASE REPORTS: Case 1. A 7-year-old boy with fever, cough, and dyspnea was treated with oxygen, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion, and methylprednisolone and showed a worsening of clinical conditions, persistent fever, hypotension, and hematological parameters compatible with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Three intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day) were followed by a progressive resolution. Case 2. A 14-year-old girl with syncope, fever, diarrhea, oliguria, and increased creatinine levels required fluid infusion and correction of electrolyte imbalance. The increase of creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobin, troponin, and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) was associated with grade I atrioventricular block and pericardial effusion. The patient showed myositis and severe muscular weakness, with hematological parameters compatible with MIS-C. She started IVIG and 3 intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone. However, bradycardia, tachypnea, severe hypotension, loss of consciousness, oliguria, bilateral ground-glass pneumonia, bilateral pleural, and peritoneal effusion, in the absence of thromboembolism, required treatment with furosemide, albumin, and enoxaparin, and was followed by a prompt resolution. CONCLUSIONS: These 2 pediatric cases highlight the importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing in all patients with acute symptoms and signs of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. As new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge, cases of MIS-C can become more prevalent, and pediatricians should be aware of diagnostic and management guidelines.","output":"A 7-Year-Old Boy and a 14-Year-Old Girl Initially Diagnosed with Toxic Shock Syndrome and Tested Positive for SARS-CoV-2 Infection, Supporting a Diagnosis of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a new and ongoing infectious disease affecting healthcare systems worldwide.

Protecting the blood supply from emerging infectious threats remains a serious concern in the transfusion medicine community. Transfusion services can employ indirect measures such as surveillance, hemovigilance, and donor questioning (defense), protein-, or nucleic acid based direct testing (detection), or pathogen inactivation of blood products (destruction) as strategies to mitigate the risk of transmission-transmitted infection. In the North American context, emerging threats currently include dengue, chikungunya, and hepatitis E viruses, and Babesia protozoan parasites. The 2003 SARS and 2014 Ebola outbreaks illustrate the potential of epidemics unlikely to be transmitted by blood transfusion but disruptive to blood systems. Donor-free blood products such as ex vivo generated red blood cells offer a theoretical way to avoid transmission-transmitted infection risk, although biological, engineering, and manufacturing challenges must be overcome before this approach becomes practical. Similarly, next generation sequencing of all nucleic acid in a blood sample is currently possible but impractical for generalized screening. Pathogen inactivation systems are in use in different jurisdictions around the world, and are starting to gain regulatory approval in North America. Cost concerns make it likely that pathogen inactivation will be contemplated by blood operators through the lens of health economics and risk-based decision making, rather than in zero-risk paradigms previously embraced for transfusable products.

Diagnosis of RVA infection was based on fecal immune-chromatographic rapid test and further evaluated for their hemagglutination (HA) activity. RVA isolation was carried out on MA104 cells after inoculates were treated with different concentrations of trypsin TPCK. All RVA isolates were confirmed by LSI VetMAX? Triplex Ruminant Rotavirus & Coronavirus Real-Time PCR kit. G and P typing were determined by direct sequencing of the VP4 and VP7 amplicons. RESULTS: RVA isolation was achieved for nine clinical samples following one or two passages (60 %) and was properly depended on HA activity and trypsin treatment of inoculates. The first sign of CPE detected consisted of increased cell granularity, obscure cell boundaries, cell rounding, and eventual degeneration and detachment of cells. At lower TPCK concentration (3C10 g/inoculum), no changes at the cellular level were observed, while cells activated with 25C30 g of trypsin/inoculums, they degenerated and trypsin cytotoxicity was enhanced. Appreciable changes in cells morphology were detected with optimal trypsin concentration of 15C20 g trypsin/inoculums. Data from qRT-PCR confirmed that unsuccessful cultivations have No-Ct, and all nine isolates have Ct values ranged between 12.17 and 24.69. Analysis sequencing revealed that field isolates were of G6 P[5] serotype and isolates from the dairy NCD samples were of G10 P[14] serotype. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study in Morocco which reports the circulation of G10P[14] in NCD on dairy farms and G6P[5] in the field. Our study constitutes a crucial and a necessary step allowing preventive and veterinary medicine to support RVA disease controls in the country.","output":"Isolation and identification of group A rotaviruses among neonatal diarrheic calves, Morocco"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Economic fallouts from COVID-19 have been unprecedented across all industries, with a handful of exceptions. The present study attempts to capture the impact of dividend distribution tax elimination, introduced through the Indian Finance Act 2020, on corporate dividend behavior in India. It explores the determinants of dividend payouts, changing payout decisions, dividend behavior of regular payers, and the prevalence of factors associated with changing payouts. Out of the top 1000 firms, based on their market capitalization at the Bombay Stock Exchange, 509 non-financial firms pursuing consistent dividend payments from 2015 to 2019 are analyzed. The study also examines the dividend behavior of regular payers exhibiting a stable or step-up payout from 2015 to 2019. COVIDs impact on the firms financial performance and sentiments seems to dominate, suppressing investors expectations of enhanced payouts associated with dividend distribution tax advantages, with considerable reductions in payouts and omissions shown by regular and irregular payers in 2020 and 2021 vis--vis the preceding years. The findings signify that the dividend payouts of sample firms are positively associated with the firms size, MBV ratio, and past dividends, and negatively allied with free cash flows and the EBITDA margin. Regular payers are observed to be more sensitive to past dividends. The study lends credence to the conservatism and prevalence of signaling and catering theories in the dividend behavior of Indian corporate firms.","output":"Impact of Elimination of Dividend Distribution Tax on Indian Corporate Firms amid COVID Disruptions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world has recently undergone the most ambitious mitigation effort in a century, consisting of wide-spread quarantines aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19. The use of influential epidemiological models of COVID-19 helped to encourage decision makers to take drastic non-pharmaceutical interventions. Yet, inherent in these models are often assumptions that the active interventions are static, e.g., that social distancing is enforced until infections are minimized, which can lead to inaccurate predictions that are ever evolving as new data is assimilated. We present a methodology to dynamically guide the active intervention by shifting the focus from viewing epidemiological models as systems that evolve in autonomous fashion to control systems with an \\"input\\" that can be varied in time in order to change the evolution of the system. We show that a safety-critical control approach to COVID-19 mitigation gives active intervention policies that formally guarantee the safe evolution of compartmental epidemiological models. This perspective is applied to current US data on cases while taking into account reduction of mobility, and we find that it accurately describes the current trends when time delays associated with incubation and testing are incorporated. Optimal active intervention policies are synthesized to determine future mitigations necessary to bound infections, hospitalizations, and death, both at national and state levels. We therefore provide means in which to model and modulate active interventions with a view toward the phased reopenings that are currently beginning across the US and the world in a decentralized fashion. This framework can be converted into public policies, accounting for the fractured landscape of COVID-19 mitigation in a safety-critical fashion.","output":"Safety-Critical Control of Active Interventions for COVID-19 Mitigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundAnticipating an initial shortage of vaccines for COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the United States developed priority vaccine allocations for specific demographic groups in the population. This study evaluates the performance of the CDC vaccine allocation strategy with respect to multiple potentially competing vaccination goals (minimizing mortality, cases, infections, and years of life lost (YLL)), under the same framework as the CDC allocation: four priority vaccination groups and population demographics stratified by age, comorbidities, occupation and living condition (congested or non-congested). MethodsWe developed a compartmental disease model that incorporates key elements of the current pandemic including age-varying susceptibility to infection, age-varying clinical fraction, an active case-count dependent social distancing level, and time-varying infectivity (accounting for the emergence of more infectious virus strains). Under this model, the CDC allocation strategy is compared to all other possibly optimal allocations that stagger vaccine roll-out in up to four phases (17.5 million strategies). ResultsThe CDC allocation strategy performed well in all vaccination goals but never optimally. Under the developed model, the CDC allocation deviated from the optimal allocations by small amounts, with 0.19% more deaths, 4.0% more cases, 4.07% more infections, and 0.97% higher YLL, than the respective optimal strategies. The CDC decision to not prioritize the vaccination of individuals under the age of 16 was optimal, as was the prioritization of health-care workers and other essential workers over non-essential workers. Finally, a higher prioritization of individuals with comorbidities in all age groups improved outcomes compared to the CDC allocation. InterpretationThe developed approach can be used to inform the design of future vaccine allocation strategies in the United States, or adapted for use by other countries seeking to optimize the effectiveness of their vaccine allocation strategies. FundingThe authors received no funding for this work. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) prioritized population groups for vaccination based on available scientific evidence, the feasibility of different implementation strategies, and ethical considerations. We searched PubMed using the query \\"(((COVID) AND (vaccin*)) AND (model)) AND ((priorit*) OR alloc*)\\" up to June 15, 2021, with no date or language restrictions. The search identified 190 articles, of which 15 used predictive models to evaluate the efficacy of vaccine allocation strategies in achieving vaccination campaign goals such as reducing mortality or incidence. All studies compared only a small number of specific, expertise-based allocations. Most studies stratified the population by age, while some considered additional characteristics such as occupation or comorbidity status, but none took into account all characteristics included in the CDC vaccine prioritizations. Added value of this studyWe developed a compartmental disease model that takes into account several important components of the COVID-19 pandemic, and stratifies the U.S. population by all characteristics included in the CDC vaccine prioritization recommendations. In a novel global optimization approach, we compared the CDC recommendations to all potentially optimal strategies (17.5 million strategies) that also stagger the vaccine roll-out in four phases. The CDC allocation strategy performed well in all considered outcome measures, but never optimally; a higher prioritization of individuals with comorbidities in all age groups improved outcomes. The CDC decision to initially not vaccinate children, as well as the prioritization of health-care workers and other essential workers over non-essential workers proved optimal under all outcome measures. Implications of all the available evidenceOur study identifies and compares the optimal vaccine allocation strategies for several competing vaccination goals.

The importance of the hospital environment has recently been revalued in infection prevention and control. Though the literature is evolving rapidly, many institutions still do not consider healthcare environmental hygiene (HEH) very important for patient safety. The evidence for interventions in the healthcare environment on patient colonization and HAI with multidrug-resistant microorganisms (MDROs) or other epidemiologically relevant pathogens was reviewed. METHODS: We performed a systematic review according to the PRISMA guidelines using the PubMed and Web of Science databases. All original studies were eligible if published before December 31, 2019, and if the effect of an HEH intervention on HAI or patient colonization was measured. Studies were not eligible if they were conducted in vitro, did not include patient colonization or HAI as an outcome, were bundled with hand hygiene interventions, included a complete structural rebuild of the healthcare facility or were implemented during an outbreak. The primary outcome was the comparison of the intervention on patient colonization or HAI compared to baseline or control. Interventions were categorized by mechanical, chemical, human factors, or bundles. Study quality was assessed using a specifically-designed tool that considered study design, sample size, control, confounders, and issues with reporting. The effect of HEH interventions on environmental bioburden was studied as a secondary outcome. FINDINGS: After deduplication, 952 records were scrutinized, of which 44 were included for full text assessment. A total of 26 articles were included in the review and analyzed. Most studies demonstrated a reduction of patient colonization or HAI, and all that analyzed bioburden demonstrated a reduction following the HEH intervention. Studies tested mechanical interventions (n = 8), chemical interventions (n = 7), human factors interventions (n = 3), and bundled interventions (n = 8). The majority of studies (21/26, 81%) analyzed either S. aureus, C. difficile, and/or vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Most studies (23/26, 88%) reported a decrease of MDRO-colonization or HAI for at least one of the tested organisms, while 58% reported a significant decrease of MDRO-colonization or HAI for all tested microorganisms. Forty-two percent were of good quality according to the scoring system. The majority (21/26, 81%) of study interventions were recommended for application by the authors. Studies were often not powered adequately to measure statistically significant reductions. INTERPRETATION: Improving HEH helps keep patients safe. Most studies demonstrated that interventions in the hospital environment were related with lower HAI and/or patient colonization. Most of the studies were not of high quality; additional adequately-powered, high-quality studies are needed.

Reported cognitive assessment is often limited to orientation alone. Further assessment may seem an inappropriate burden in acute COVID-19 cases characterized by fatigue and confusion as well as examiner safety. OBJECTIVE: Objective: To assess cognition in COVID-19 cases as comprehensively as possible in a brief format, all while observing safety; and to establish clear-face value of its external validity. METHODS: Method: We adapted a brief cognitive assessment, previously applied to liver transplant candidates and medical/surgical inpatients, for remote use in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 treatment. Collecting quality assurance data from telephone-administered assessments, this report presents a series of six COVID-19 case vignettes to illustrate the 5-Minute Assessment use in diagnosis and treatment of brain effects. Primary medical teams referred the cases for neuropsychiatric consultation. RESULTS: Results: Varying over four decades in age, none were able to engage meaningfully with their surroundings on admission. On follow-up exam 6 to 10 days later, four of the six had recovered Working Memory, and only one had recovered calculation ability. Two were capable of complex Judgment responses while none of the cases completed frontal executive function testing in the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions: Cognitive assessment in COVID-19 cases, using this remote examination, reveals patterns of cognitive recovery that vary among cases and are far more complex than loss of orientation. In this series, testing specific temporal, parietal, and three frontal lobe functions suggests that calculation ability, judgment, and especially frontal executive functions, may characterize COVID-19 brain effects. Used widely, and serially, this exam method can potentially inform our understanding of COVID-19 brain effects with healing from the virus.

Our research group evaluated a novel three-week therapist-guided internet-delivered intervention based on prolonged exposure (Condensed Internet-Delivered Prolonged Exposure; CIPE) in a pilot trial. The results indicated that the intervention was feasible, acceptable and reduced symptoms of post-traumatic stress at post-intervention compared to a waiting-list condition. Exposure to traumatic memories can be emotionally demanding and there is a need for detailed investigation of participants experiences in receiving this type of intervention remotely. Objective: Investigate participants experiences of receiving CIPE early after trauma. Method: In this study, qualitative thematic analysis was used and semi-structured interviews with 11 participants six months after intervention completion were conducted. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Results: One overarching theme labelled as demanding and effective was identified. Participants expressed that treatment effects could only be achieved by putting in a lot of effort and by being emotionally close to the trauma memory during exposure exercises. Participants reported CIPE to be a highly credible- and educative intervention that motivated them to fully engage in exposure exercises. The most distressing parts of the intervention was perceived as tolerable and important to do to heal psychologically after trauma. For many participants, the possibility to engage in the intervention whenever and where it suited them was helpful, although some participants described it as challenging to find a balance between their own responsibility and when to expect therapist support. The internet-based format was perceived as a safe forum for self-disclosure that helped some participants overcome avoidance due to shame during imaginal exposure. Conclusion: CIPE was considered demanding, yet effective by the interviewed participants.

Methods Data were downloaded from Seoul Data Open Plaza, and changes in the number of passengers on the Seoul Metropolitan Subway network between January 1, 2020, and March 31, 2020, were used to assess the extent to which people in Seoul practiced social distancing. Five events regarding COVID-19 that received wide public attention between January and March 2020 were identified and the changes in the number of passengers before and after each event were analyzed. Also, similar analyses were performed for 16 stations that were specific in either the age or purpose of the visit of the passengers. Results Compared to the third week of January 2020 (January 13-19), the mean daily number of passengers in all stations decreased by 2,984,857.4 or 40.6% by the first week of March (March 2-8). The percentage decrease in individual stations between this period was not significantly different between young and old stations (46.3% vs. 49.2%; p = 0.551) but was significantly smaller in work stations than in leisure stations (36.2% vs. 51.6%; p = 0.021). Of the five events, the first reported death due to COVID-19 in South Korea and the identification of a mass infection cluster in Daegu on February 20 were accompanied by the greatest decrease of the mean daily number of passengers (1,352,153.3 or 20.8%), while the first mass infection in Seoul on March 10 and the announcement of aggressive social distancing campaign on March 22 were accompanied by an increase in the number of passengers. Conclusions The number of subway passengers in Seoul decreased markedly during late February but slowly increased afterward, suggesting decreasing levels of risk perception and adherence to social distancing.

In low- and middle-income countries like Nepal, where medical education faces a range of challenges-such as lack of infrastructure, well-trained educators, and advanced technologies-the abrupt changes in methodologies without adequate preparation are more challenging than in higher income countries. In this article, the authors discuss the COVID-19-related changes and challenges in Nepal that may have a drastic impact on the career progression of current medical students. Outside the major cities, Nepal lacks dependable internet services to support medical education, which frequently requires access to and transmission of large files and audiovisual material. Thus, students who are poor, physically disadvantaged, and who do not have a home situation conducive to online study may be affected disproportionately. Further, the majority of teachers and students do not have sufficient logistical experience and knowledge to conduct or participate in online classes. Moreover, students and teachers are unsatisfied with the digital methodologies, which will ultimately hamper the quality of education. Students' clinical skills development, research activities, and live and intimate interactions with other individuals are being affected. Even though Nepal's medical education system is struggling to adapt to the transformation of teaching methodologies in the wake of the pandemic, it is important not to postpone the education of current medical students and future physicians during this crisis. Looking ahead, medical schools in Nepal should ensure that mechanisms are proactively put into place to embrace new educational opportunities and technologies to guarantee a regular supply of high-quality physicians capable of both responding effectively to any future pandemic and satisfying the nation's future health care needs.","output":"Medical Education in Nepal: Impact and Challenges of the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The immense patient number caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic brings the urge for more knowledge about its immunological features, including the profile of basic immune parameters.

The study included 39 Icelandic horses aged 2C25 years, of varying training levels. The horses were exposed to three tasks: (a) a choice test (n = 37), (b) a visible displacement task (n = 35), and (c) an invisible displacement task (n = 31). 27 horses in the choice test, and 8 horses in the visible displacement task, performed significantly better than expected by chance, while none did so in the invisible displacement task. This was also reflected in their group performance, where horses performed above chance level in the choice task and the visible displacement task only. In the invisible displacement task, the group performed significantly worse than expected by chance indicating that horses persistently chose the side where they had last seen the target. None of the individual characteristics included in the study had an effect on performance. Unsuccessful horses had higher heart rate levels, and expressed more behavior indicative of frustration, likely because of their inability to solve the task.

The quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted to detect SARS-CoV-2. Ocular and systemic signs and symptoms were recorded from their medical history. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 56  13 years. The average disease time from initiation of symptoms was 3.27 days, range: 1C7 days. Forty-one patients (95.3%) had fever at the time of sampling. Only one patient had conjunctivitis. Thirty (69.8%) nasopharyngeal and three (7%) tear samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The result of tear sample was positive in the patient with conjunctivitis. All patients with positive tear RT-PCR results had positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR results. CONCLUSIONS: Ocular manifestation was rare in this series of severe COVID-19 patients, however, 7% of the patients had viral RNA in their conjunctival secretions.

Rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial to prevent the further spread of the disease and reduce its mortality. Chest Computed tomography (CT) is an effective tool for the early diagnosis of lung diseases including pneumonia. However, detecting COVID-19 from CT is demanding and prone to human errors as some early-stage patients may have negative findings on images. Recently, many deep learning methods have achieved impressive performance in this regard. Despite their effectiveness, most of these methods underestimate the rich spatial information preserved in the 3D structure or suffer from the propagation of errors. To address this problem, we propose a Dual-Attention Residual Network (DARNet) to automatically identify COVID-19 from other common pneumonia (CP) and healthy people using 3D chest CT images. Specifically, we design a dual-attention module consisting of channel-wise attention and depth-wise attention mechanisms. The former is utilized to enhance channel independence, while the latter is developed to recalibrate the depth-level features. Then, we integrate them in a unified manner to extract and refine the features at different levels to further improve the diagnostic performance. We evaluate DARNet on a large public CT dataset and obtain superior performance. Besides, the ablation study and visualization analysis prove the effectiveness and interpretability of the proposed method.","output":"DARNet: Dual-Attention Residual Network for Automatic Diagnosis of COVID-19 via CT Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The use of nonpharmaceutical interventions can prevent viral spread in COVID-19 pandemic and PPE forms a crucial part of this strategy. However, there are discrepancies in existing guidelines and a lack of consensus among ophthalmic communities. This review aims to identify general consensus and provides recommendation of PPE for most common ophthalmological scenarios. With a global shortage of PPE, extended use and reuse strategies are also discussed. RECENT FINDINGS In this review, guidelines and resources were selected, based on a three-tier process. The first-tier resources were from international infection control organizations. The second-tier resources were from ophthalmological professional associations and colleges. The third-tier resources involved a PubMed search using the keywords 'COVID-19; coronavirus; personal protective equipment' performed on 1 May 2020. Non-English guidelines and literatures were excluded. SUMMARY On the basis of our methodology, we included a total of 30 documents, including 5 resources from tier 1, 14 resources from tier 2 and 15 from tier 3. Different levels of protection are necessary. Whenever performing an aerosol generating procedure, maximum protection should be ensured, this includes FFP3 respirator, fluid resistant gown, goggles or face-shield and disposable gloves. Similar protection should be used for handling COVID-19-positive/suspected case but the use of FFP2 respirator is acceptable. During routine outpatient clinic in cases of negative triage, it is recommended to use ASTM III surgical mask, plastic apron, disposable gloves and eye protection with goggles or face-shield. Lastly, patients should be encouraged to wear surgical masks whenever possible.","output":"The use of personal protective equipment in clinical ophthalmology during corona virus disease-2019: a review of international guidelines and literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Self-care strategies for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) include practices, tools, and strategies for people to manage their health. Access to SRH services has increased in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) in the past decade. The objective of this manuscript is to provide a preliminary assessment of self-care SRH interventions focusing on access, knowledge, perceived challenges, and recommendations for the future. We aim to contribute to the evidence base on knowledge and uptake of self-care SRH strategies in the EMR. METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional Global Values and Preferences Survey (GVPS) to inform WHO guideline development on self-care interventions for SRH. Recruitment was web-based and included hosting the survey on the WHO Department of Reproductive Health and Research website, and sharing the survey link to diverse SRH websites. Analyses included the subsample of respondents living in EMR countries. We first conducted descriptive statistics of sociodemographic and self-care intervention responses. We then conducted bivariate analyses to examine statistically significant differences in knowledge for each intervention between EMR and non-EMR regions. We extracted open-text responses and applied thematic analysis techniques. RESULTS: There were 53 respondents from the EMR spanning 14 countries, including16 health care providers (HCP) and 37 laypersons. Qualitative responses (n = 16) suggest that (a) perceived benefits of self-care SRH strategies include enhanced SRH access, knowledge, and improved SRH outcomes; (b) perceived concerns include misuse and safety; (c) linkage to care following self-care SRH interventions can consider mobile phone apps, hotlines, health care liaisons, and community outreach; (d) HCP want additional training on strengthening therapeutic alliances with patients and practical information on interventions; and (e) future research can focus on reproductive health, condom use, service barriers, and implementation. EMR respondents reported lower knowledge levels than non-EMR respondents on the following strategies: diaphragm/cervical cap, contraceptive patch, web-based SRH information, post-exposure prophylaxis, re-exposure prophylaxis, and HIV treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of self-care SRH strategies varies by intervention type in the EMR. Future research with larger and more representative samples can inform regional self-care SRH implementation. Knowledge dissemination, stigma reduction, accessibility, and training of health care professionals are key domains for advancing access to self-care SRH strategies in the EMR.","output":"Sexual and reproductive health self-care interventions in the Eastern Mediterranean Region: findings from a cross-sectional values and preferences survey to inform WHO normative guidance on self-care interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current methods of mechanical ventilation and pulmonary drug delivery do not account for the heterogeneity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or its dependence on gravity. The severe lung disease caused by SARS-CoV-2-2019 is one of the many causes of ARDS. SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 2.7 million deaths world-wide and has challenged all therapeutic options for mechanical ventilation. Thus, new therapies are necessary to prevent deaths and long-term complications of severe lung diseases and prolonged mechanical ventilation. We have developed a novel device that allows selective lobe ventilation, selective lobe recruitment and provides a new platform for pulmonary drug delivery. A major advantage of separating lobes that are mechanically heterogeneous is to allow customization of ventilator parameters to match the needs of segments with similar compliance, for better overall ventilation perfusion relationship (V/Q) and prevention of ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) of more compliant lobes. This device accounts for lung heterogeneity and is a potential new therapy for acute lung injury by allowing selective lobe mechanical ventilation using two novel modes of mechanical ventilation (differential positive end-expiratory pressure and asynchronous ventilation) and two new modalities of alveolar recruitment (selective lobe recruitment and continuous positive airway pressure of lower lobes with continuous ventilation of upper lobes). We report initial experience with this novel device which includes a brief overview of device development, the initial in vitro, ex-vivo and in-vivo testing, layout future research, potential benefits, new therapies, and expected challenges prior to uniform implementation in clinical practice.","output":"Selective Lobe Ventilation and a Novel Platform for Pulmonary Drug Delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had infected more than 80000 Chinese sin","output":"Epidemical and Clinical Characteristics of 165 Patients Infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Fujian Province, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Voluntary contributions by citizen scientists can gather large datasets covering wide geographical areas, and are increasingly utilized by researchers for multiple applications, including arthropod vector surveillance.

The aim of this study was to explore the availability of observations of important vector taxa on the iNaturalist platform and examine the utility of these data to complement existing vector surveillance activities. Of ten vector taxa investigated, records were most numerous for mosquitoes (Culicidae; 23,018 records, 222 species) and ticks (Ixodida; 16,214 records, 87 species), with most data from 2019-2020. Case studies were performed to assess whether images associated with records were of sufficient quality to identify species and compare iNaturalist observations of vector species to the known situation at the state, national and regional level based on existing published data. Firstly, tick data collected at the national (United Kingdom) or state (Minnesota, USA) level were sufficient to determine seasonal occurrence and distribution patterns of important tick species, and were able to corroborate and complement known trends in tick distribution. Importantly, tick species with expanding distributions (Haemaphysalis punctata in the UK, and Amblyomma americanum in Minnesota) were also detected. Secondly, using iNaturalist data to monitor expanding tick species in Europe (Hyalomma spp.) and the USA (Haemaphysalis longicornis), and invasive Aedes mosquitoes in Europe, showed potential for tracking these species within their known range as well as identifying possible areas of expansion.

The present study demonstrated for the first time that a virus belonging to the Arteriviridae family activates NF-B in MARC-145 cells and alveolar macrophages. In porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)-infected cells, NF-B activation was characterized by translocation of NF-B from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, increased DNA binding activity, and NF-B-regulated gene expression. NF-B activation was increased as PRRSV infection progressed and in a viral dose-dependent manner. UV-inactivation of PRRSV significantly reduced the level of NF-B activation. Degradation of IB protein was detected late in PRRSV infection, and overexpression of the dominant negative form of IB (IBDN) significantly suppressed NF-B activation induced by PRRSV. However, IBDN did not affect viral replication and viral cytopathic effect. PRRSV infection induced oxidative stress in cells by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), and antioxidants inhibited NF-B DNA binding activity in PRRSV-infected cells, suggesting ROS as a mechanism by which NF-B was activated by PRRSV infection. Moreover, NF-B-dependent expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 was observed in PRRSV-infected cells, an observation which implies that NF-B activation is a biologically significant aspect of PRRSV pathogenesis.

Covid-19 has also catalysed digital transformation across the sector for improving operational efficiencies. As a result, the amount of digitally stored patient data such as discharge letters, scan images, test results or free text entries by doctors has grown significantly. In 2020, 2314 exabytes of medical data was generated globally. This medical data does not conform to a generic structure and is mostly in the form of unstructured digitally generated or scanned paper documents stored as part of a patients medical reports. This unstructured data is digitised using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process. A key challenge here is that the accuracy of the OCR process varies due to the inability of current OCR engines to correctly transcribe scanned or handwritten documents in which text may be skewed, obscured or illegible. This is compounded by the fact that processed text is comprised of specific medical terminologies that do not necessarily form part of general language lexicons.

This global health crisis imposes limitations on daily movements, which have deteriorated every sector in our society. Understanding public reactions to the virus and the non-pharmaceutical interventions should be of great help to fight COVID-19 in a strategic way. We aim to provide tangible evidence of the human mobility trends by comparing the day-by-day variations across the U.S. from January 2020 to early April 2020. Large-scale public mobility at an aggregated level is observed by leveraging mobile device location data and the measures related to social distancing. Our study captures spatial and temporal heterogeneity as well as the sociodemographic variations and teleworking trends regarding the pandemic propagation and the non-pharmaceutical mobility interventions. All metrics adapted capture decreased public movements after the national emergency declaration. The population staying home has increased in all states before the stay-at-home mandates implemented and becomes more stable after the order with a smaller range of fluctuation. The public had been taking active responses, voluntarily staying home more, to the in-state confirmed cases while the stay-at-home orders stabilize the variations. As the estimated teleworking rates also continue to incline throughout the study period, the teleworking trend can be another driving factor for the growing stay-at-home population. We confirm that there exists overall mobility heterogeneity between the income or population density groups. The study suggests that public mobility trends are in line with the government message urging to stay home.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this research was to utilize the most recent 5 years of data from an ongoing longitudinal study of health promotion and quality of life (QoL) among people with long-standing MS to investigate changes across time in functional limitations, health promotion, and health-related QoL. METHODS: Participants are mailed an annual survey to complete about their health promotion, depressive symptoms, health status, social support, MS-related functional limitations, and QoL. Differences across time were analyzed with repeated measures of analysis of variances and planned contrasts. RESULTS: In 2021, the 141 participants had a mean age of 69 years and had been diagnosed with MS for 34 years on average. Most had attended college, were married/partnered females, and reported adequate economic resources. Thirty-seven percent reported they were in poor to fair health. Physical activity and health responsibility scores decreased significantly during 2020-2021 compared with 2017-2019. Significant changes in depressive symptoms, social support, and functional limitations scores followed a different pattern with the largest changes occurring between 2018 and 2019. QoL and other health promotion scores did not change significantly across time. DISCUSSION: The relatively small changes in health indicators revealed here suggest that older people with long-standing MS may have generally been able to maintain their health promotion, functional abilities, and QoL from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, nurses and other providers should support them to resume their physical activity and regular provider contact as COVID-19 restrictions are eased. The patterns observed here demonstrate the importance of examining changes across an extended period, rather than simply looking at 1 year before and 1 year after a major event, such as COVID-19.

A quantitative proteomic comparison between metaphase-arrested cell lysates and chromosome-sorted samples reveals a cohort of proteins that were significantly enriched on mitotic ESC chromosomes. These include pluripotency-associated transcription factors, repressive chromatin-modifiers such as PRC2 and DNA methyl-transferases, and proteins governing chromosome architecture. Deletion of PRC2, Dnmt1/3a/3b or Mecp2 in ESCs leads to an increase in the size of individual mitotic chromosomes, consistent with de-condensation.

However, this measurement is invasive (requiring an arterial blood sample), time consuming, expensive, uncomfortable for the patients, and as such not ideal for serial measurements. Recent advances in the technology now provide for portable and rapidly responding measurement of the PO(2) and PCO(2) in expired gas, which combined with the well-established measurement of arterial oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry (SpO(2)) make practical a non-invasive surrogate measurement of the A-aDO(2), the oxygen deficit. The oxygen deficit is the difference between the end-tidal PO(2) and the calculated arterial PO(2) derived from the SpO(2) and taking into account the PCO(2), also measured from end-tidal gas. The oxygen deficit shares the underlying basis of the measurement of gas exchange efficiency that the A-aDO(2) uses, and thus the two measurements are well-correlated (r(2)~0.72). Studies have shown that the new approach is sensitive and can detect the age-related decline in gas exchange efficiency associated with healthy aging. In patients with lung disease the oxygen deficit is greatly elevated compared to normal subjects. The portable and non-invasive nature of the approach suggests potential uses in first responders, in military applications, and in underserved areas.

Three historical phases were established according to the public policy cycle, and material was classified according to the purpose of the normative documents. The content analysis was based on the advocacy coalition framework model. Of the federal legislations, 8.9% were for the Formulation/Decision-Making phase, 43% for the Organization/Implementation phase, and 48.1% for the Expansion/Maturation phase of telemedicine policy in Brazil. The Federal Council of Medicine was the most active in standardizing telemedicine and was responsible for 21 (67.7%) regulations.

We assessed clinicians knowledge and attitudes toward the rapid initiation of ART and provided academic sessions as a training method to guide clinicians through the implementation of a new standard of care. METHODS: A Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant, online survey was sent to primary care clinicians to assess their knowledge and attitudes towards Rapid Initiation of ART (RIA). We provided personalized academic detailing sessions, addressing questions and concerns gathered from both the initial survey and the individual pre-assessment questionnaire completed prior to the sessions. RESULTS: The survey was initially distributed in February 2019, followed by 4 weekly reminders. Approximately 585 providers completed the survey. Subsequently, 552 health care providers from 25 out of 62 counties in NY State were detailed between March 2019 and March 2021. Lessons learned from the sessions included the identification of pragmatic strategies that could be used in the design of effective detailing sessions, followed by enhanced clinical knowledge, which improved patient care.

We have evaluated our model for three heavily affected regions in Europe, namely Berlin (Germany), Lombardy (Italy), and Madrid (Spain). Before extensive containment measures made an impact, we first estimate the region-specific model parameters, namely ICU rate, time lag between infection, and ICU admission as well as length of stay in ICU. Whereas for Berlin, an ICU rate of 6%, a time lag of 6 days, and a stay of 12 days in ICU provide the best fit of the data, for Lombardy and Madrid the ICU rate was higher (18% and 15%) and the time lag (0 and 3 days) and the stay in ICU (3 and 8 days) shorter. The region-specific models are then used to predict future ICU load assuming either a continued exponential phase with varying growth rates (0-15%) or linear growth. By keeping the growth rates flexible, this model allows for taking into account the potential effect of diverse containment measures. Thus, the model can help to predict a potential exceedance of ICU capacity depending on future growth. A sensitivity analysis for an extended time period shows that the proposed model is particularly useful for exponential phases of the disease.","output":"COVID-19: a simple statistical model for predicting intensive care unit load in exponential phases of the disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT Carceral institutions are among the largest clusters of COVID-19 in the United States. As outbreaks have spread throughout prisons and detention centers, detainees have organized collectively to demand life-saving measures. Chief among these demands has been the call for decarceration: the release of detainees and inmates to prevent exposure to COVID-19. This paper theorizes the compounding racial vulnerability that has led to such a marked spread behind bars, mainly among race-class subjugated communities. METHODS We use journalistic sources and administrative data to provide an in-depth account of the spread of COVID-19 in American correctional facilities and of the mobilization to reduce contagions. We also use two survey experiments to describe public support for harm reduction and decarceration demands and measure the effects of information about (a) racial inequalities in prison, and (b) poor conditions inside migrant detention centers. FINDINGS We find that only one-third to one-half of respondents believe that response to COVID-19 in prisons and immigrant detention centers should be a high priority. We also find that Americans are much more supportive of harm reduction measures like improved sanitation than of releasing people from prisons and detention centers. Information about racial disparities increases support for releasing more people from prison. We do not find any significant effect of information about poor conditions in migrant detention centers. CONCLUSIONS The conditions in prisons and migrant detention centers during the pandemic-and public opinion about them-highlight the realities of compounding racialized vulnerability in the United States.","output":"Compounding Racialized Vulnerability: COVID-19 in Prisons, Jails, and Migrant Detention Centers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microalgae are considered potential candidates in biorefinery processes, and due to their biochemical properties, they can be used in the production of biofuels such as biogas, as well as for bioremediation of liquid effluents.

PARTICIPANTS: Interdisciplinary frontline clinicians including physicians, advance practice providers, nurses, respiratory therapists and paramedics providing inpatient hospital care to patients hospitalised for COVID-19. RESULTS: Fifty clinicians (32 women and 18 men) participated. Five themes with respective subthemes (in parentheses) were identified: depersonalisation and barriers to care (impeding rapport and compassion, focusing on infection risk at the expense of high-quality care, grief from witnessing patients suffer in isolation), powerless in uncertainty (inescapable awareness of personal risk, therapeutic doubt in a void of evidence, confronting ethical dilemmas, struggling with dynamic and unfamiliar challenges), overwhelmed and exhausted (burden of personal protective equipment (PPE), information overload and confusion, overstretched by additional responsibilities at work, compounded by personal life stressors, feeling vulnerable and dispensable, compassion fatigue, distress from the disproportionate impact on socially oppressed communities), bolstering morale and confidence (motivated by community and family support, equipped with data), and driven by moral duty (responsibility to patient care and community, collegial solidarity and collaboration, contributing to the greater good). CONCLUSION: Frontline clinicians reported distress due to the challenges of PPE, uncertainty and powerlessness, new responsibilities at work and home, losing control of their schedules, grief from witnessing patients suffer in isolation and witnessing healthcare disparities exacerbated by this pandemic.

METHOD: We compared prevalences of ED visits from the Dutch Injury Surveillance System (DISS) between the period of semi-lockdown (16 March-10 May 2020) and the same period in 2019. The same comparisons were made for the period of relaxation of measures (11 May-5 July 2020) and for the period of relaxation versus lockdown. To eliminate a possible effect of avoiding emergency care, analyses were performed on severe injury related ED-visits. RESULTS: The prevalence of severe injury related ED-visits during the period of lockdown was 27 percent lower compared to the same period in 2019 (6.755 versus 4.902, P&lt;0.05). This decrease was observed for all types of injuries and age groups, but was strongest for sports injuries (-53%) and among 10-19-year-olds (-55%). In contrast, the number of ED-visits increased after accidents with jobs in the house (+31%) and roller-skates (+223%). Among 0-11-year-olds, more accidents with trampolines were reported (+68%).

Methods: An online training program was designed by the Shanghai Pediatric Clinical Quality Control Center (SPQCC) during the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic on disease knowledge and practice of IPC. Training took place in the 81 partner hospitals affiliated with SPQCC. A 25-item self-administered questionnaire was used to evaluate knowledge gained from the training. Stratified-random sampling was used to select HCW according to three professionals (i.e., pediatricians, nurses and administrators) within each partner hospital. Awareness and knowledge of COVID-19 and its related infection control and practice was assessed by comparing survey results between different types of hospitals, professionals and professional ranks. A higher survey score meant that the respondent was more prepared and knowledgeable about COVID-19 and its infection control measures. Results: Completed questionnaires were returned from 1,062 subjects (385 pediatricians, 410 nurses, and 267 administrators), giving a response rate of 96.5%. Overall, awareness of clinical information related to COVID-19, importance of personal hygiene and isolation policy was high among the respondents.

After proving the existence and global asymptotic stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points of the model with constant parameters, we consider a family of Cauchy problems, with piecewise constant parameters, and prove the existence of pseudo-oscillations between a neighborhood of the disease-free equilibrium and a neighborhood of the endemic equilibrium, in a biologically feasible region.

Titres were also measured for non-vaccinees convalescing from a WT-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neutralising antibodies in BA.2 and BA.1 breakthrough infections and in BA.2 infections affecting non-vaccinees were additionally studied. RESULTS: In vaccinees or prior WT-SARS-CoV-2-infected people, BA.2 and BA.1 PRNT(50) titres were comparable but significantly (p < 10 (? 5)) lower than WT. In each group of 20 vaccinees with (i) three-doses of Comirnaty, (ii) two CoronaVac followed by one Comirnaty dose, or (iii) one dose of either vaccine after a WT-SARS-CoV-2 infection,  19 individuals developed detectable (PRNT(50) titre  10) antibodies to BA.2, while only 15 of 20 vaccinated with three doses of CoronaVac did.

Methods: The study population comprised 3,249 predominantly male, 18-20-year-old Marine recruits. Upon arrival at a Marine-supervised two-week quarantine, participants were assessed for baseline SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity, defined as a 1:150 dilution or greater on receptor binding domain and full-length spike protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays. SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed by PCR at initiation, middle and end of the quarantine. After appropriate exclusions, including participants with a positive PCR during quarantine, we performed three biweekly PCR tests in both seropositive and in seronegative groups once recruits left quarantine and entered basic training and baseline neutralizing antibody titers on all subsequently infected seropositive and selected seropositive uninfected participants. Findings: Among 189 seropositive participants, 19 (10.1%) had at least one positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 during the six-week follow-up (1.1 cases per person-year). In contrast, 1,079 (48.0%) of the 2,247 seronegative participants tested positive (6.2 cases per person-year). The incidence rate ratio was 0.18 (95% CI 0.11-0.28, p<0.00001). Among seropositive recruits, infection was associated with lower baseline full-length spike protein IgG titers (p<0.0001). Compared with seronegative recruits, seropositive recruits had about 10-fold lower viral loads (ORF1ab gene, p<0.005), and trended towards shorter duration of PCR positivity (p=0.18) and more frequent asymptomatic infections (p=0.13). Among seropositive participants, baseline neutralizing titers were detected in 45 of 54 (83.3%) uninfected and in 6 of 19 (31.6%) infected participants during the 6 weeks of observation (ID50 difference p<.0001). Interpretation: Seropositive young adults had about one-fifth the risk of subsequent infection compared with seronegative individuals.

For medical students good physical and mental health can help prevent burnout, equip students for their future healthcare setting and indirectly improve patient care. At the University of Nottingham (UK), we were keen to explore undergraduate medical students perceived wellbeing before, during, and after an early years (years 1-3) curriculum change. A restructure of the curriculum enabled personal wellbeing sessions to be embedded and directly linked to the pastoral support system. METHODS: Students perceived wellbeing was assessed through a questionnaire distributed to three cohorts of first year students at the start and end of the autumn semester. RESULTS: The data showed a clear improvement of perceived physical health at the end of the first semester following the curriculum change, alongside increased mood and ability to relax. A surprising outcome of this study was that students reported increased stress levels at the end of the semester, which we believe may be attributed to the change in assessment within the new curriculum. Our medical students are now facing end of year summative examinations, but are acutely aware of their progress as they undertake frequent formative assessments during the year. We propose that comparison of performance with peers is having a direct impact on perceived stress in these cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The study has shown that embedding wellbeing in the curriculum can have positive effects even within a changing curriculum. The importance of evolving wellbeing provision and support based on the needs of the student population is essential and probably never more in need than at this moment in time.

Since S-palmitoylation and cholesterol homeostasis are crucial for viral infections, we investigated IFITM interactions with cholesterol by molecular dynamic stimulations, nuclear magnetic resonance analysis in vitro and photoaffinity crosslinking in mammalian cells. These studies suggest that cholesterol can alter the conformation of IFITMs in membrane bilayers and directly interact with S-palmitoylated IFITMs in cells. Notably, we discovered that the S-palmitoylation levels regulate differential IFITM isoform interactions with cholesterol in mammalian cells and specificity of antiviral activity towards IAV, SARS-CoV-2 and EBOV.

In the present study we describe a transgenic mouse model expressing eNOS fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), which allows the study of localization and regulation of eNOS expression. We tested the functionality of eNOS in the eNOS-GFP mice. Expression of eNOS was restricted to the endothelial lining of blood vessels in various tissues tested, without appreciable expression in non-endothelial cells. Activity of the enzyme was confirmed by assaying the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline. NO production in isolated vessels was increased in transgenic mice when compared to non-transgenic control animals (4.88 +/- 0.59 and 2.48 +/- 0.47 micro mol/L NO, respectively, P < 0.005). Both the mean aortic pressure and the pulmonary artery pressure were reduced in eNOS-GFP mice (both approximately 30%, P < 0.05). Plasma cholesterol levels were also slightly reduced ( approximately 20%, P < 0.05). In conclusion, eNOS-GFP mice express functional eNOS and provide a unique model to study regulation of eNOS activity or eNOS-mediated vascular events, including response to ischemia, response to differences in shear stress, angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, and to study the subcellular distribution in relation with functional responses to these events.","output":"Functional expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase fused to green fluorescent protein in transgenic mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Observational studies have identified patients with cancer as a potential subgroup of individuals at elevated risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) disease and mortality. Early studies showed an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality for cancer patients, but it is not well understood how this association varies by cancer site, cancer treatment, and vaccination status. Methods: Using electronic health record data from an academic medical center, we identified 259,893 individuals who were tested for or diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 10, 2020, to February 2, 2022. Of these, 41,218 tested positive for COVID-19 of whom 10,266 had a past or current cancer diagnosis. We conducted Firth-corrected, covariate-adjusted logistic regression to assess the association of cancer status, cancer type, and cancer treatment with four COVID-19 outcomes: hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mortality, and a composite \\"severe COVID-19\\" outcome which is the union of the first three outcomes. We examine the effect of the timing of cancer diagnosis and treatment relative to COVID diagnosis, and the effect of vaccination. Results: Cancer status was associated with higher rates of severe COVID-19 infection [OR (95% CI): 1.18 (1.08, 1.29)], hospitalization [OR (95% CI): 1.18 (1.06, 1.28)], and mortality [OR (95% CI): 1.22 (1.00, 1.48)]. These associations were driven by patients whose most recent initial cancer diagnosis was within the past three years. Chemotherapy receipt was positively associated with all four COVID-19 outcomes (e.g., severe COVID [OR (95% CI): 1.96 (1.73, 2.22)], while receipt of either radiation or surgery alone were not associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Among cancer types, hematologic malignancies [OR (95% CI): 1.62 (1.39, 1.88)] and lung cancer [OR (95% CI): 1.81 (1.34, 2.43)] were significantly associated with higher odds of hospitalization. Hematologic malignancies were associated with ICU admission [OR (95% CI): 1.49 (1.11, 1.97)] and mortality [OR (95% CI): 1.57 (1.15, 2.11)], while melanoma and breast cancer were not associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Vaccinations were found to reduce the frequency of occurrence for the four COVID-19 outcomes across cancer status but those with cancer continued to have elevated risk of severe COVID [cancer OR (95% CI) among those fully vaccinated: 1.69 (1.10, 2.62)] relative to those without cancer even among vaccinated. Conclusion: Our study provides insight to the relationship between cancer diagnosis, treatment, cancer type, vaccination, and COVID-19 outcomes. Our results indicate that it is plausible that specific diagnoses (e.g., hematologic malignancies, lung cancer) and treatments (e.g., chemotherapy) are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Vaccines significantly reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in individuals with cancer and those without, but cancer patients are still at higher risk of breakthrough infections and more severe COVID outcomes even after vaccination. These findings provide actionable insights for risk identification and targeted treatment and prevention strategies.","output":"COVID-19 outcomes by cancer status, type, treatment, and vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Objective: To achieve a literature review on the impacts of COVID-19 on dentistry Methods: Analysis of scientific articles contained in the LILACS and PubMed platforms that fulfill the informative purpose of the research Results: The production of aerosols during dental procedures could be highlighted as the most dangerous agent, the literature recommends restricting the type of service only to emergencies and reducing the use of rotating instruments or cough-inducing equipaments New protective measures must be taken, such as the type of PPE used and the frequency of asepsis of the workplace, since any surface that has been exposed to oral or pharyngeal secretions may contain a load of viral particles, an online triage is also recommended before any assistance Due to the easy spreading of this disease and the possibility of asymptomatic patients, the current best measure is avoiding the execution of procediments Conclusion: COVID-19 will be a milestone for the current generations of health professionals, it could also be an advance for use distance technologies and integration of new biosafety techniques RESUMO Objetivo: Realizar uma revis?o de literatura sobre os impactos da COVID-19 na Odontologia Mtodos: Anlise de artigos cientficos contidos nas plataformas LILACS e PubMed que cumprissem o intuito informativo da pesquisa Resultados: P?de-se destacar como agente de maior periculosidade a produo de aerossis durante os procedimentos odontolgicos, a literatura recomenda restringir o tipo de atendimento apenas a emergncias e reduzir o uso de instrumentos rotatrios ou que induzam tosse Novas medidas de proteo devem ser tomadas, como tipo de EPI utilizado e frequncia de assepsia do local de trabalho, pois qualquer superfcie que fora exposta a secrees orais ou farngeas pode conter uma carga de partculas virais, tambm se recomenda uma pr-triagem n?o presencial antes de qualquer atendimento Pela facilidade de disseminao da doen?a e a possibilidade existncia de pacientes assintomticos, a melhor medida ainda  evitar a realizao de atendimentos Conclus?o: A COVID-19 ser um marco para as atuais geraes de profissionais da sade, podendo ser um avan?o para utilizao de tecnologias a distancia e integralizao de novas tcnicas de biosseguran?a","output":"COVID-19 pandemic impacts to Dentistry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Forced displacement and resettlement is a pervasive challenge being contemplated across the social sciences. Scholarly literature, however, often fails to engage complexities of power in understanding socio-environmental interactions in resettlement processes. Addressing Zimbabwes Tokwe-Mukosi flood disaster resettlement, we explore hegemonic uses of state power during the pre- and post-flood induced resettlement processes. We examine how state power exercised through local government, financial, and security institutions impacts community vulnerabilities during forced resettlement processes, while furthering capitalist agendas, drawing insights from analysing narratives between 2010 and 2021. Concerns abound that multiple ministries, the police, and the army undermined displaced peoples resilience, including through inadequate compensation, with state institutions neglecting displaced communities during encampment by inadequately meeting physical security, health, educational, and livestock production needs. We explore how forcibly resettling encamped households to a disputed location is not only an ongoing perceived injustice regionally but also a continuing reference point in resettlement discussions countrywide, reflecting concerns that land use and economic reconfigurations in resettlement can undermine subsistence livelihoods while privileging certain values and interests over others. Policy lessons highlight the need for reviewing disaster management legislation, developing compensation guidelines and reviewing encampment practices. Analytically, lessons point to how state power may be studied in relation to perspectives on the destruction of flood survivors connections to place, people and livelihoods, underscoring the critical need for theorising the relationships between power dynamics and diverse experiences around displacement.","output":"Forced displacement: critical lessons in the protracted aftermath of a flood disaster"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIM: Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a pandemic infectious disease that causes morbidity and mortality. As a result of high mortality rate among the severe COVID-19 patients, the early detection of the disease stage and early effective interventions are very important in reducing mortality. Hence, it is important to differentiate severe and non-severe cases from each other. To date, there are no proven diagnostic or prognostic parameters that can be used in this manner. Due to the expensive and not easily accessible tests that are performed for COVID-19, researchers are investigating some parameters that can be easily used. In some recent studies, hematological parameters have been evaluated to see if they can be used as predictive parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the current study, almost all hematological parameters were used, including the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet/lymphocyte ratio, monocyte/lymphocyte ratio, mean platelet volume to lymphocyte ratio, mean platelet volume to platelet ratio, plateletcrit, and D-dimer/fibrinogen ratio (DFR), neutrophil/lymphocyte/platelet scoring system, and systemic immune-inflammation index. A total of 750 patients, who were admitted to Ankara City Hospital due to COVID-19, were evaluated in this study. The patients were classified into 2 groups according to their diagnosis (confirmed or probable) and into 2 groups according to the stage of the disease (non-severe or severe). RESULTS: The values of the combinations of inflammatory markers and other hematological parameters in all of the patients with severe COVID-19 were calculated, and the predicted values of these parameters were compared. According to results of the study, nearly all of the hematological parameters could be used as potential diagnostic biomarkers for subsequent analysis, because the area under the curve (AUC) was higher than 0.50, especially for the DFR and NLR, which had the highest AUC among the parameters. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that, the parameters those enhanced from complete blood count, which is a simple laboratory test, can help to identify and classify COVID-19 patients into non-severe to severe groups.","output":"Which hematological markers have predictive value as early indicators of severe COVID-19 cases in the emergency department?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We performed a prospective survey on the adverse reactions following the first dose of two types of vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in healthcare workers (HCWs) in South Korea.

The HCWs were asked to report adverse reactions through a mobile self-report questionnaire for three days after vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 7,625 HCWs received the first dose of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccine during the study period. Of them, 5,866 (76.9%) HCWs (ChAdOx1, n = 5,589 [95.3%]; BNT162b2, n = 277 [4.7%]) participated at least once in the survey, of whom 77% were female and 86% were younger than 50 years. The overall adverse reaction rate was 93% in the ChAdOx1 group and 80% in the BNT162b2 group (P < 0.001). Both local and systemic reactions were more commonly reported in the ChAdOx1 group, and the difference was larger in systemic reactions such as fever and fatigue. In the ChAdOx1 group, the incidence of adverse reactions was significantly higher in females and those in the younger age groups, while the BNT162b2 group showed such difference according to age.

The purpose of this study is to report patient comfort and satisfaction levels with decision making. MATERIALS/METHODS Women with pre-invasive or early-stage breast cancer who had been given the option to omit radiation therapy were identified. Two validated instruments (decisional regret and satisfaction with decision) were provided to all women with 5 choices (strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, strongly disagree). All women then underwent a qualitative interview about their decision making process, and were given option of $50.00 gift card after completion. Interviews were transcribed, and common themes were coded using qualitative data analysis software by two members of the research team. RESULTS Thirty-six women diagnosed with early stage or pre-invasive breast cancer from 2013-2020 were consented. Median age at diagnosis was 72. Twenty (55%) chose to omit RT. Majority of women (92%) agreed or strongly agreed that it was the right decision, and that they were satisfied about being adequately informed about the issues that were important to the decision making process. In women who had chosen radiation therapy, one woman expressed regret regarding side effects of radiation therapy: \\"So with the surgery and the shrinking, then I think I would have been better off if I had gone with a mastectomy and probably a double and then had reconstruction.\\" Other women expressed regret with radiation in the context of coordinating the complexities of treatment: \\"I might have decided to just have a double mastectomy. I wouldn't had to have the cancer drug. I wouldn't have had the radiation. It was just much more complicated than I thought in my mind,\\" and \\"then again, in my head, there's something about putting radiation into my body when there's another option where one is putting something in and the pill is taking something out.\\" While no women expressed regret regarding omission of radiation (pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic), some women expressed knowledge deficit or poor expectation of the side effects of hormonal blockade: \\"We really didn't talk about the side effects. I've gotten more information from my friends that are on the pill than I have from the doctor.

Sick leave can be seen as an indicator of health in a working age population, and the present study aimed to investigate sick-leave patterns after Covid-19, and potential factors predicting longer sick leave in hospitalised and non-hospitalised people with Covid-19. METHODS: The present study is a comprehensive national registry-based study in Sweden with a 4-month follow-up. All people who started to receive sickness benefits for Covid-19 during March 1 to August 31, 2020, were included. Predictors of sick leave &#8805;1 month and long Covid (&#8805;12 weeks) were analysed with logistic regression in the total population and in separate models depending on inpatient care due to Covid-19. RESULTS: A total of 11,955 people started sick leave for Covid-19 within the inclusion period. The median sick leave was 35 days, 13.3% were on sick leave for long Covid, and 9.0% remained on sick leave for the whole follow-up period. There were 2960 people who received inpatient care due to Covid-19, which was the strongest predictor of longer sick leave. Sick leave the year prior to Covid-19 and older age also predicted longer sick leave. No clear pattern of socioeconomic factors was noted. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of people are on sick leave due to Covid-19. Sick leave may be protracted, and sick leave for long Covid is quite common. The severity of Covid-19 (needing inpatient care), prior sick leave, and age all seem to predict the likelihood of longer sick leave. However, no socioeconomic factor could clearly predict longer sick leave, indicating the complexity of this condition.

We have found that SARS-CoV enters cells via pH- and receptor-dependent endocytosis. Treatment of cells with either SARS-CoV spike protein or spike-bearing pseudoviruses resulted in the translocation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor of SARS-CoV, from the cell surface to endosomes. In addition, the spike-bearing pseudoviruses and early endosome antigen 1 were found to colocalize in endosomes. Further analyses using specific endocytic pathway inhibitors and dominant-negative Eps15 as well as caveolin-1 colocalization study suggested that virus entry was mediated by a clathrin- and caveolae-independent mechanism. Moreover, cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich lipid raft microdomains in the plasma membrane, which have been shown to act as platforms for many physiological signaling pathways, were shown to be involved in virus entry. Endocytic entry of SARS-CoV may expand the cellular range of SARS-CoV infection, and our findings here contribute to the understanding of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, providing new information for anti-viral drug research.

Aim : The aim of the study was to identify and describe the demands for AAL-services from the perspective of older adults. We also examine the challenges and needs of the ambient assisted living market using a needs based approach. Method : An exploratory case study was conducted with an aim to capture information about older adults demands for AAL services. A survey was used to collect the data. The survey study respondents validated the results. Results : The results of the study indicate that the area of AAL needs be studied from a multiple-sided market perspective. Our research suggests there is a need to describe and understand the factors that facilitate or constrain the implementation of services with focus on health and social care. There is also a need to describe and analyze the relationship between policy and practice and its effects on the AAL market. It is necessary to capture expressed demand, to identify market challenges at the macro level and to be able to understand how services should operate and serve older adults in practice. Such research is critical to the development of guidance for policy makers, suppliers and service providers. Discussion : Older adults are asking for intelligent, assistive living solutions that help them to continue to live independent lives and remain socially included in their networks, associations, and communities. The elderly need services that stimulate and maintain their physical and intellectual capital. The development of innovative AAL environments is, however, a complex social process that involves the use and delivery of innovative ICTCbased services. The implementation and use of AAL to support older adults involve service providers and elderly consumers.

Social, economic, and cultural forces also shape patterns of exposure, health-seeking behaviour, infection outcomes, the likelihood of diagnosis and reporting of cases, and the uptake of interventions. Although these social aspects of epidemiology are hard to quantify and have limited the generalizability of modelling frameworks in a policy context, new sources of data on relevant aspects of human behaviour are increasingly available. Researchers have begun to embrace data from mobile devices and other technologies as useful proxies for behavioural drivers of disease transmission, but there is much work to be done to measure and validate these approaches, particularly for policy-making.

METHODS MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched from inception to April 2019 for studies reporting measurable medical or surgical treatment outcomes for adult patients with CRS and underlying primary or secondary immunodeficiency. RESULTS Of the 2459 articles screened, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria: 2 prospective double-blind placebo-controlled trials, 2 prospective case-control studies, 2 prospective cohort studies, and 7 case series. The high degree of study heterogeneity precluded a meta-analysis. Antibiotic monotherapy was not linked with significant improvement in clinical, radiographic, or endoscopic outcomes. Immunoglobulin replacement therapy may potentially reduce the frequency of acute or chronic sinusitis in patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) but may not improve their sinonasal symptoms. Outcomes from endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) were reported in 8 studies, which found that surgery was linked with improvement in symptoms, disease-specific quality of life, endoscopy scores, and radiographic scores.

However, compared to high-end analyzers in hospitals, LFA devices, in particular, paper- based LFA tests, fall short in accuracy. This study focuses on two ways to improve LFAs: (1) using cellulose fibers, rather than glass fibers for a sample pad, and (2) incorporating a one-step simple, facile, and low cost PVA dam into the LFA. Both strategies (cellulose fiber as a sample pad and water dissolvable PVA dam) contributed to delaying the controlled biomolecules flow through the nitrocellulose membranes capillary channels resulting in increased bio-recognition time, thus contributing to the enhancement of LFA sensitivity. PVA modified cellulose fiber-based LFA demonstrated 10 times higher sensitivity than the cellulose fiber-based unmodified LFA, whereas 2 times enhancement was obtained in the cellulose fiber-based sample pad LFA compared to the glass fiber-based sample pad LFA. Ultimately, 20 times increase in sensitivity was achieved in the modified LFA device.

Reports of Long COVID are rising but little is known about prevalence in non-hospitalized patients. Objective: We sought to identify the persistent symptoms of COVID19 in frontline workers at Right to Care (RTC) South Africa who have past the acute phase of illness with a view to establishing rehabilitation programs for its employees and the community at large. Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey. We analysed data from 207 eligible COVID19 positive RTC frontline workers who participated in a post-COVID online self-administered survey. The survey was active for two months. Frequencies and median were calculated for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Results: The survey response rate was 30% (62 out of 207); of the 62 respondents with a median age of 33.5 years (IQR= 30 to 44 years), 47 (76%) were females. The majority (n=55; 88.7%) self-isolated and 7 (11.3%) were admitted to hospital at time of diagnosis. The most common comorbid condition reported was hypertension particularly among workers aged 45 to 55 years. Headache, body ache, fatigue, loss of smell, dry cough, fever, and loss of appetite were the most common reported symptoms at time of diagnosis. Persistent symptoms were characterized by fatigue, anxiety, difficulty sleeping, chest pain, muscle pain and brain fog, being the six most reported. Conclusion: The impact of persistent/Long COVID-19 on the health of frontline workers could have direct impact in health service delivery.

As of today, there exist no approved treatments against COVID-19. Vaccines are being developed, but they will take time, at least one year, to reach the population. Drug repositioning represents a fast track because already approved medicines have been broadly tested through multiple trials. We developed a repositioning strategy that mostly leads to candidates that are commonly used. The advantages are that they will facilitate proof of concept in humans through a real-world evidenceapproach and should be rapidly available to the population. We focus on the established research results that the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy pathways of the host cells are essential to the life cycle of previously known coronaviruses. We performed the relevant bioinformatics analysis to understand and confirm if SARS-CoV-2 may interact with these druggable pathways. Based on these considerations, we prioritized two additional druggable pathways, which are important to the viral life cycle and tightly connected to UPR/autophagy signaling: the mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTP) and NLRP-3 inflammasome pathways. These four important pathways are perturbed in most major common diseases and have therefore been targeted by numerous broadly prescribed drugs. We have identified 97 approved drugs that are known to modulate these four identified pathways, and which represent, therefore, interesting repositioning candidates. Although it is indisputable that these drugs should never be used for immediate self-medication against COVID-19, we notice that some of them could also be prescribed to individuals who have COVID-19 comorbidities (e.g., hypertension). It is debated if these comorbidities are linked to the pathology itself (e.g., hypertension) or the drugs used to treat the pathology (e.g., sartans). Therefore, relevant preclinical tests and massive electronic health records (i.e., real-world evidence) must be used to pre-screen them and check the COVID-19 prognosis of individuals taking these drugs.","output":"Focusing on the Unfolded Protein Response and Autophagy Related Pathways to Reposition Common Approved Drugs against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Approximately one third of older adults in the United States (US) and 13% of older adults in Mexico live alone.

While a rapid and effective immune response is essential to limit viral spread and mortality, this anti-viral response needs to be tightly regulated in order to limit immune mediated tissue damage. This balance between effective virus control with limited pathology is especially important due to the highly specialized functions and limited regenerative capacity of neurons, which can be targets of direct virus cytolysis or bystander damage. CNS infection with the neurotropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) induces an acute encephalomyelitis associated with focal areas of demyelination, which is sustained during viral persistence. Both innate and adaptive immune cells work in coordination to control virus replication. While type I interferons are essential to limit virus spread associated with early mortality, perforin, and interferon- promote further virus clearance in astrocytes/microglia and oligodendrocytes, respectively. Effective control of virus replication is nonetheless associated with tissue damage, characterized by demyelinating lesions. Interestingly, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 limits expansion of tissue lesions during chronic infection without affecting viral persistence. Thus, effective coordination of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines is essential during MHV induced encephalomyelitis in order to protect the host against viral infection at a limited cost.","output":"Fine Tuning the Cytokine Storm by IFN and IL-10 Following Neurotropic Coronavirus Encephalomyelitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Needle-free injection is a desirable goal for many reasons, including reducing pain, anxiety, and eliminating safety risks associated with needle-stick injuries.

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of risankizumab (BI 655066, Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany), a humanised monoclonal antibody targeting the p19 subunit of interleukin-23, in patients with moderately-to-severely active Crohn's disease. METHODS In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study, we enrolled patients at 36 referral sites in North America, Europe, and southeast Asia. Eligible patients were aged 18-75 years, with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease for at least 3 months, assessed as moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease at screening, defined as a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) of 220-450, with mucosal ulcers in the ileum or colon, or both, and a Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) of at least 7 (4 for patients with isolated ileitis) on ileocolonoscopy scored by a masked central reader. Patients were randomised 1:1:1 using an interactive response system to a double-blind investigational product, and stratified by previous exposure to TNF antagonists (yes vs no). Patients received intravenous 200 mg risankizumab, 600 mg risankizumab, or placebo, at weeks 0, 4, and 8. The primary outcome was clinical remission (CDAI <150) at week 12 (intention-to-treat population). Safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02031276. FINDINGS Between March, 2014, and September, 2015, 213 patients were screened, and 121 patients randomised. At baseline, 113 patients (93%) had been previously treated with at least one tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist (which had failed in 96 [79%]). At week 12, 25 (31%) of 82 risankizumab patients (pooled 41 patients in 200 mg and 41 patients in 600 mg arms) had clinical remission versus six (15%) of 39 placebo patients (difference vs placebo 150%, 95% CI 01 to 301; p=00489). Ten (24%) of 41 patients who received 200 mg risankizumab had clinical remission (90%, -83 to 262; p=031) and 15 (37%) of 41 who received the 600 mg dose (209%, 26 to 392; p=00252). 95 (79%) patients had adverse events (32 in the placebo group, 32 randomised to 200 mg risankizumab, 31 randomised to 600 mg risankizumab); 18 had severe adverse events (nine, six, three); 12 discontinued (six, five, one); 24 had serious adverse events (12, nine, three). The most common adverse event was nausea and most common serious adverse event was worsening of underlying Crohn's disease. No deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION In this short-term study, risankizumab was more effective than placebo for inducing clinical remission in patients with active Crohn's disease. Therefore, selective blockade of interleukin-23 via inhibition of p19 might be a viable therapeutic approach in Crohn's disease.

Hazard ratios ranged between 0.26 (0.23-0.30) to 0.69 (0.60-0.79) for infectious disease and pneumonia. Among participants with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or cancer, hazard ratios ranged between 0.30 (0.25-0.34) to 0.73 (0.60-0.89). COVID-19 mortality risk ranged between 0.42 (0.28-0.63) to 0.75 (0.49-1.13). We found a beneficial dose-response association with a higher lifestyle index against mortality that was consistent across sex, age, BMI, and socioeconomic status. There was limited evidence of synergistic interactions between most lifestyle behaviour pairs, suggesting that the dose-response relationship among different lifestyle behaviours is not greater than the sum of the risk induced by each behaviour. Improvements in lifestyle risk factors and meeting public health guidelines or best practice recommendations could be used as an ancillary measure to ameliorate infectious disease mortality.","output":"Lifestyle risk factors and infectious disease mortality, including COVID-19, among middle aged and older adults: Evidence from a community-based cohort study in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is the second most common cause of death due to a single infectious agent worldwide after COVID-19. Up to 15% of the cases are extrapulmonary, and if it is located in the central nervous system (CNS-TB), it presents high morbidity and mortality. Still, the global epidemiology of CNS-TB remains unknown. AIM: To estimate the global prevalence and incidence of CNS-TB based on the available literature. METHODS: We systematically searched in MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, Scopus, and LILACS databases (April 2020) and included observational studies evaluating the epidemiology of CNS-TB. Two independent researchers selected and assessed the quality of the studies and extracted relevant data. We performed random-effects model meta-analysis of proportions to estimate the pooled prevalence. The protocol of this study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD 42018103946). RESULTS: We included 53 studies from 28 countries, representing 12,621 patients with CNS-TB. The prevalence of CNS-TB was 2 per 100,000 inhabitants. According to the clinical setting, the prevalence of CNS-TB represented the 13.91% of all cases of meningitis and 4.55% of all cases of TB. The mortality was calculated by tuberculous meningitis due to the lack of data of other presentation, and it rose up to 42.12% in hospitalized patients. The burden of countries TB, Human Development Index (HDI), and the prevalence of HIV were the most important prevalence moderators, especially in patients with TB. No data on incidence were found. CONCLUSION: The prevalence and mortality of CNS-TB remain high, and TB meningitis is the most frequent presentation. The highest prevalence was reported in developing countries, and its main moderators were the countries HDI and HIV infection. Our study was limited by high heterogeneity, risk of bias, and potential data under registration from developing countries. The integration of CNS-TB early detection and management into national TB programs and population-based studies from developing countries are needed for better global estimation and response.

RECENT FINDINGS New observations in the field from 2019 to 2020 have resulted in a better understanding of the clinical association and pathogenic origins of IIM. The use of patient-reported outcome measures and perspectives, identifying biomarkers and making better use of autoantibody testing are summarized. Basic sciences have led to an improved understanding of the role of NETosis in calcinosis, and of interferon type 1, in IIM. Preliminary insights are offered into Covid-19 in the setting of IIM, and the use of potential tools for monitoring disease remotely, which may assume larger importance for optimal disease management during a global pandemic. The wider exploration of newer imaging modalities and the use of nailfold capillaroscopy is a further step in better management of the condition.

The potential benefits, clinical, and oncologic outcomes are still controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate clinical and oncologic outcomes of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) for right colon cancer using propensity score matching analysis. METHODS From December 2013 to June 2017, 174 patients underwent laparoscopic radical right hemicolectomy through a single-incision (n = 32) or a conventional (n = 142) approach. The data were prospectively collected and the patients were matched at a radio of 1:1 according to age, sex, body mass index (BMI), previous abdominal surgeries, comorbidities, ASA score ( 2/> 2), and pathologic stage. RESULTS No significant differences were observed in estimated blood loss, time to diet, postoperative pain score, length of hospital stay between the SILS and CLS groups. However, the SILS group showed longer operation time (175 (40) vs 145 (52.5), p = 0.011) and shorter incision length (4 (1.4) vs 7 (1.9), p < 0.001). There were 2 (6.3%) postoperative complications in the SILS group and 5 (15.6%) in the CLS group (p = 0.426). The pathologic outcomes were similar between two groups. The median follow-up period was 26.5 months in the SILS group and 34.9 months in the CLS group (p = 0.002). There were 3 recurrences (9.4%) in the SILS group and 3 (9.4%) in the CLS group. The 3-year disease-free survival rates were 92.4 and 93.8% (p = 0.984), and overall survival rates were 92.3 and 93.0% (p = 0.884) in the SILS and the CLS groups, respectively. No incisional hernia was observed during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS Though single-incision laparoscopic surgery for right colon cancer showed longer operation time in this study, it appears to be a safe and feasible option with comparable clinical and oncologic outcomes to conventional laparoscopic surgery.","output":"Clinical and oncologic outcomes of single-incision laparoscopic surgery for right colon cancer: a propensity score matching analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2020 State of the Food Security and Nutrition World report suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic may render 83 to 132 million people food insecure.

This potentially renders Africa off track in achieving SDG -2 of zero hunger by 2030. Ghana is a net importer of rice and how the sector responded to the global pandemic has received less traction in the agri-food system literature. There is skewed literature that concentrates on the global north. The paper employed a qualitative approach involving key informant interviews across 6 regions in Ghana. The study covered 48 Agricultural Extension Agents (AEAs) and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) officers, 80 farmers, and 48 market leaders. We use one of the country's main food staple - rice to show the food (in)-security situation during the pandemic. We articulate that using the right food security conceptual and theoretical framing remains imperative in understanding food (in)-security. The findings showed price hikes during the imposition of lockdown affected access (physical and effective demand). Rice however remained available during and after the lockdown imposition. Ghana's rice production output was affected during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The ramification of COVID-19 on Ghana's rice sector was not dire but points to the vulnerability of the rice value chain to future pandemics.

Data on maternity staff views on the provision and implementation of PPIUD services are limited. The objective of this qualitative evaluation was to explore the views and experiences of obstetricians and midwives providing PPIUD within a UK maternity setting, in order to identify areas for improvement and inform service provision in other areas. METHODS: Qualitative health services research within two public maternity hospitals in Lothian (Edinburgh and surrounding region), UK. Interviews with 30 maternity staff (obstetricians n=8; midwives n=22) involved in PPIUD provision. Data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Maternity staff were positive about the benefits of PPIUD for women. Midwives reported initial concerns about PPIUD safety, and the impact on workload; these views shifted following training, and as PPIUD was embedded into practice. Having a large pool of PPIUD-trained staff was identified as an important factor in successful service implementation. Having PPIUD 'champions' was important to address staff concerns, encourage training uptake, and advocate for the service to ensure continued resourcing. CONCLUSIONS: PPIUD in maternity services can help address unmet need for effective contraception in the immediate postpartum period. We emphasise the importance of widespread engagement around PPIUD among all healthcare professionals involved in the care of women, to ensure staff are informed and supported. Clinical champions and leaders play a key role in amplifying the benefits of PPIUD, and advancing organisational learning.","output":"Perspectives of obstetricians and midwives on the provision of immediate postpartum intrauterine devices: a qualitative service evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play essential roles in regulating physiological processes in eukaryotic cells. Many viruses use their own IDPs to hack these processes to deactivate host defenses and promote viral growth. Thus, viral IDPs are attractive drug targets. While IDPs are hard to study by X-ray crystallography or cryo-EM, atomic level information on their conformational preferences and dynamics can be obtained using NMR spectroscopy. SARS-CoV-2 Nsp2, whose C-terminal region (CtR) is predicted to be disordered, interacts with human proteins that regulate translation initiation and endosome vesicle sorting. Molecules that block these interactions could be valuable leads for drug development. The (13)C and backbone (13)CO, (1)HN, (13)C, and (15)N nuclei of Nsp2s 45-residue CtR were assigned and used to characterize its structure and dynamics in three contexts; namely: (1) retaining an N-terminal His tag, (2) without the His tag and with an adventitious internal cleavage, and (3) lacking both the His tag and the internal cleavage. Two five-residue segments adopting a minor extended population were identified. Overall, the dynamic behavior is midway between a completely rigid and a fully flexible chain. Whereas the presence of an N-terminal His tag and internal cleavage stiffen and loosen, respectively, neighboring residues, they do not affect the tendency of two regions to populate extended conformations.

Previously, we developed a mathematical model to understand factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent spread of emerging pathogens (Gostic et al., 2015). Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening program.

According to the research findings, MB has potential as a direct antiviral drug for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in the first stages of the disease. However, the MB accumulation by various types of tissues, as well as by immune cells, has not been previously studied. Therefore, the objective of this study was to obtain spectral data on the interstitial distribution of the administered drug in endothelial tissues in primates. The data on interstitial MB distribution obtained by spectroscopic measurement at both macro-and microlevels during oral administration to Hamadryas baboon individuals demonstrate that MB accumulates in mucous membranes of gastrointestinal tract and the tissues of the respiratory, cardiovascular, immune, and nervous systems. Additionally, it was found that MB was present in lung and brain myeloid cells in significant concentrations, which makes it potentially useful for protection from autoimmune response (cytokine storm) and as a tool for the correction of immunocompetent cells functional state during laser irradiation. Since the cytokine storm starts from monocytic cells during SARS-CoV-2 cellular damage and since tumor-associated macrophages can significantly alter tumor metabolism, accumulation of MB in these cells provides a reason to conclude that the immune response correction in COVID-19 patients and change in macrophages phenotype can be achieved by deactivation of inflammatory macrophages in tissues with MB using laser radiation of red spectral range. ? 2021 by the authors.

Eligible participants were young people living on the Island of Ireland, aged 16-25 years. The survey design was underpinned by the COM-B model of behaviour change. Semi-inductive thematic analysis was used to analyse comments collected via three free-text survey items. The COM-B model provided a thematic framework to organize subthemes extracted. A total of N=477 young people completed the survey, of which N=352 provided comments for at least one of three free-text survey items. The majority of respondents lived in Northern Ireland (96%), the average age was 21 years, and most respondents were female (73%) and were students (81%). Key barriers identified included Social Opportunity (other people not social distancing), Physical Opportunity (lack of environmental support for social distancing), and Automatic motivation (missing physical interaction from others). Key facilitators included Physical Opportunity (environmental cues and space to support social distancing), Reflective Motivation (awareness and understanding of risk of transmission), and Social Opportunity (observing others adhering to guidelines). These findings suggest that the actions of others, environmental supports, and perception of risk have an important role in influencing social distancing behaviour among young people.

This study represents a secondary analysis of a prospectively conducted immunophenotyping study of pediatric severe sepsis to test the hypothesis that hydrocortisone will be differentially associated with clinical outcomes in children with or without immunoparalysis. METHODS Children with severe sepsis/septic shock underwent blood sampling within 48 h of sepsis onset. Immune function was measured by quantifying whole blood ex vivo LPS-induced TNF production capacity, with a TNF response < 200 pg/ml being diagnostic of immunoparalysis. The primary outcome measure was number of days in 14 with MODS. Univariate and multivariable negative binomial regression models were used to examine associations between hydrocortisone use, immune function, and duration of MODS. RESULTS One hundred two children were enrolled (age 75 [6-160] months, 60% male). Thirty-one subjects received hydrocortisone and were more likely to be older (106 [52-184] vs 38 [3-153] months, p = 0.04), to have baseline immunocompromise (32 vs 8%, p = 0.006), to have higher PRISM III (13 [8-18] vs 7 [5-13], p = 0.0003) and vasoactive inotrope scores (20 [10-35] vs 10 [3-15], p = 0.0002) scores, and to have more MODS days (3 [1-9] vs 1 [0-3], p = 0.002). Thirty-three subjects had immunoparalysis (TNF response 78 [52-141] vs 641 [418-1047] pg/ml, p < 0.0001). Hydrocortisone use was associated with longer duration of MODS in children with immunoparalysis after adjusting for covariables (aRR 3.7 [1.8-7.9], p = 0.0006) whereas no association with MODS duration was seen in children without immunoparalysis (aRR 1.2 [0.6-2.3], p = 0.67). CONCLUSION Hydrocortisone use was independently associated with longer duration of MODS in septic children with immunoparalysis but not in those with more robust immune function.

Eukaryotic cells are equipped with highly conserved stress-response mechanisms that support cellular function when homeostasis is compromised, promoting survival. Two such mechanisms - the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy - are involved in the cellular response to perturbations in the endoplasmic reticulum, in calcium homeostasis, in cellular energy or redox status. Each of them operates through conserved signaling pathways to promote cellular adaptations that include re-programming transcription of genes and translation of new proteins and degradation of cellular components. In addition to their specific functions, it is becoming increasingly clear that these pathways intersect in many ways in different contexts of cellular stress. Viral infections are a major cause of cellular stress as many cellular functions are coopted to support viral replication. Both UPR and autophagy are induced upon infection with many different viruses with varying outcomes - in some instances controlling infection while in others supporting viral replication and infection. The role of UPR and autophagy in response to coronavirus infection has been a matter of debate in the last decade. It has been suggested that CoV exploit components of autophagy machinery and UPR to generate double-membrane vesicles where it establishes its replicative niche and to control the balance between cell death and survival during infection. Even though the molecular mechanisms are not fully elucidated, it is clear that UPR and autophagy are intimately associated during CoV infections. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought renewed interest to this topic as several drugs known to modulate autophagy - including chloroquine, niclosamide, valinomycin, and spermine - were proposed as therapeutic options. Their efficacy is still debatable, highlighting the need to better understand the molecular interactions between CoV, UPR and autophagy.","output":"The Unfolded Protein Response and Autophagy on the Crossroads of Coronaviruses Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent pandemic reminded the world of the high risk of healthcare workers (HCWs) and patient contagiousness along with the healthcare services disruption related to nosocomial outbreaks.

The antigenicity of the expression products was tested using a number of polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibodies. The polyclonal antisera recognized different sets of epitopes in the 1162-residue sequence. The N-terminal region of one of the two subunits, S2, was recognized by all polyclonal sera and by two monoclonal antibodies.

We find that observers agreements depend on the physical material properties of the objects such that translucent materials generate more interobserver disagreements. Further, there are more disagreements among observers in the grayscale condition in comparison to that in the color condition. We also discover that converting images to grayscale substantially affects the distributions of attribute ratings for some images. Furthermore, ratings of see-throughness, glossiness, and glow could predict individual observers binary classification of images in both grayscale and color conditions. Last, converting images to grayscale alters the perceived material categories for some images such that observers tend to misjudge images of food as non-food and vice versa. Our result demonstrates that color is informative about material property estimation and recognition. Meanwhile, our analysis shows that mid-level semantic estimation of material attributes might be closely related to high-level material recognition. We also discuss individual differences in our results and highlight the importance of such consideration in material perception.","output":"Crystal or jelly?

What accounts for these stark differences in country performances? In this article, we argue that a salient feature of economic and health performance is the degree of trust populations have in their governments. We set up a heuristic analytical framework that models this relation, under particular assumptions about what drives government and individual behavior, in order to better understand the mechanisms that may be at work. We identify three key roles that trust in government may play in enforcing social distancing policies, conveying credible information for individual decision-making, and shaping government attitudes towards risk. We argue that these implications are consistent with the empirical evidence. We also discuss the relevance of other forms of trust, namely, interpersonal trust and trust in science.","output":"Governing Life and the Economy: Exploring the Role of Trust in the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The wellbeing of front\\\\line healthcare workers can be impacted during a pandemic.

METHODS: An online qualitative and quantitative survey was conducted between March and June 2020 to explore the wellbeing of Australasian sonographers in the early stages of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. RESULTS: Whilst most sonographers felt supported at work (300/379), those working in public hospitals felt more so than those in private practice. Sonographers in private practice felt more as though their job was at risk and were more likely to consider an alternate source of income. Sonographers felt they were working on the front line and many felt anxious about themselves (74%) or family (78%) contracting COVID\\\\19 due to their employment. Forty\\\\one percent of sonographers felt more isolated than normal, with younger age groups (18\\\\34 years) feeling less like they had enough hobbies or selfcare activities to get them through.

Very quickly, there was a drop in the rate of hospital attendance. The purpose of this study was to observe the variations in the uptake of pediatric consultations and vaccinations in a pediatric hospital. Methods: A descriptive and retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out using consultation and vaccination statistics from a pediatric hospital in the city of Yaound, political capital of Cameroon, from January 2016 to May 2020. Data were entered in Microsoft Excel and exported to R software (Version 3.3.3) for statistical analysis. First, time series raw data (before and after COVID-19) were plotted and the trend estimated by locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) methods. Then a classic seasonal decomposition was performed to distinguish between seasonal trends and irregular components using moving averages. The WebelCOllech overall seasonality test (WO test) was also run to formally check for seasonality. The results of the study are presented as narrative tables and graphs. Results: Following the partial confinement recommended by the government of Cameroon, the number of pediatric consultations decreased by 52% in April and by 34% in May 2020 compared with rates during the same periods in 2019 (p = 0.00001). For antenatal visits, the rates dropped by 45% and 34%, respectively, in April and May 2020 compared with 2019. The demand for immunization services also declined. As a result, the demand for BCG vaccines, third-dose tracer vaccines (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis), polio, and MMR in children as well as tetanus vaccines in childbearing women dropped significantly. Conclusion: The start of the COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by a significant drop in consultation and vaccination activities. If no action is taken to correct this phenomenon, the ensuing months could be marked by a considerable increase in patients, sometimes suffering from vaccine-preventable diseases. The death rate could increase considerably in the pediatric population.","output":"Impact and projections of the COVID-19 epidemic on attendance and routine vaccinations at a pediatric referral hospital in Cameroon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have demonstrated that health care workers are, in general, poorly compliant with respiratory protection guidelines, especially when a N95 respirator is recommended. The purpose of this study was to assess health care workers' views about respirator use and the features they prefer to be included in the next generation of respirators. METHODS: A 63-item survey was distributed to health care workers in 27 units of 2 tertiary care medical centers. RESULTS: From a total of 559 surveys distributed at both hospitals, 159 responses were returned (response rate, 28%). Survey results indicated that health care workers seek respirators that are more comfortable, interfere less with breathing, diminish heat buildup, are disposable, and permit the user to have facial hair. Multivariate analyses suggest that emergency department staff had 12.3 greater odds of wanting a new respirator (P = .031) as compared with their referent group. Males were more likely to indicate that the N95 respirator was comfortable to wear versus females (P = .003).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a novel vertical traction device (VTD) on primary fascial closure (PFC) and prevention of fascial retraction. METHODS: Twenty patients treated with OA were included in this retrospective multicenter study. All patients were initially stabilized with laparostomy and the abdomen temporarily sealed either with a Bogot bag or a negative pressure wound therapy system (NPWT). RESULTS: The mean duration of OA and fascia-to-fascia distance (FTF) prior to the VTD application were 3 days and 15 cm, respectively. At relook laparotomy 48 h after VTD implementation, the mean FTF distance significantly decreased to 10 cm (p = 0.0081). In all cases, PFC was achieved after a mean period of 7 days. Twelve patients received the VTD in combination with a NPWT, whereas in eight patients, the device was combined with an alternative temporary abdominal closure system (TAC). Although not statistically significant, the FTF distance remarkably decreased in both groups at relook laparotomy 48 h following the device implementation. The mean periods of PFC for patients with septic and non-septic OA were comparable (7.5 vs. 7 days). During follow-up, two patients developed an incisional hernia. CONCLUSION: Vertical traction device prevents fascial retraction and facilitates early PFC in OA. In combination with NPWT, rapid fascial closure of large abdominal defects can be achieved.","output":"Vertical traction device prevents abdominal wall retraction and facilitates early primary fascial closure of septic and non-septic open abdomen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyzed the role of the RhoA/ROCK pathway in regulating endothelial dysfunction triggered by LPS and the protective effects of TSG (2, 3, 5, 4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-?-D-glucoside).

Cells were also pretreated with 30 M ROCK inhibitor Y27632 for 30 min or different concentrations of TSG for 24 h and then were incubated with 100 g/ml LPS for another 24 h. The results showed that LPS treatment significantly reduced endothelial cell viability, increased LDH release, and promoted cell necrosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which was dramatically inhibited by TSG pretreatment. Furthermore, LPS induction significantly enhanced the expression of RhoA, ROCK1, and ROCK2 and the activation of ROCK; these effects were reduced by TSG pretreatment. The suppression of either RhoA or ROCK significantly improved LPS-induced endothelial cell viability, and reduced cell necrosis and LDH release. In addition, LPS treatment promoted F-actin skeleton rearrangement and contraction ring formation around the plasma membrane, which was greatly inhibited by the suppression of the RhoA/ROCK pathway or TSG pretreatment. In conclusion, TSG may inhibit F-actin cytoskeletal remodeling by blocking RhoA/ROCK signaling and thus reduce LPS-induced endothelial cell toxicity.","output":"Tetrahydroxystilbene glucoside protects against LPS-induced endothelial dysfunction via inhibiting RhoA/ROCK signaling and F-actin remodeling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Identifying informative tweets is an important step when building information extraction systems based on social media.

Differential tau isoforms, expression levels, promoters, and disruption of endogenous genes in transgenic mouse models of tauopathy make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the biological role of tau in these models. We addressed this shortcoming by characterizing the molecular and cognitive phenotypes associated with the pathogenic P301L tau mutation (rT2 mice) in relation to a genetically matched transgenic mouse overexpressing non-mutant (NM) 4-repeat (4R) human tau (rT1 mice). Both male and female mice were included in this study. Unexpectedly, we found that 4R NM human tau (hTau) exhibited abnormal dynamics in young mice that were lost with the P301L mutation, including elevated protein stability and hyperphosphorylation, which were associated with cognitive impairment in 5-month old rT1 mice. Hyperphosphorylation of NM hTau was observed as early as 4 weeks of age, and transgene suppression for the first 4 or 12 weeks of life prevented abnormal molecular and cognitive phenotypes in rT1, demonstrating that NM hTau pathogenicity is specific to postnatal development. We also show that NM hTau exhibits stronger binding to microtubules than P301L hTau, and is associated with mitochondrial abnormalities. Overall, our genetically matched mice have revealed that 4R NM hTau over expression is pathogenic in a manner distinct from classical aging-related tauopathy, underlining the importance of assaying the effects of transgenic disease-related proteins at appropriate stages in life.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTDue to differences in creation of transgenic lines, the pathological properties the P301L mutation confers to the tau protein in vivo have remained elusive, perhaps contributing to the lack of disease-modifying therapies for tauopathies. In an attempt to characterize P301L-specific effects on tau biology and cognition in novel genetically-matched transgenic mouse models, we surprisingly found that non-mutant (NM) human tau has development-specific pathogenic properties of its own. Our findings indicate that overexpression of 4-repeat human tau during postnatal development is associated with excessive microtubule-binding, which may disrupt important cellular processes such as mitochondrial dynamics, leading to elevated stability and hyperphosphorylation of tau, and eventual cognitive impairments.","output":"Developmental pathogenicity of 4-repeat human tau is lost with the P301L mutation in genetically matched tau-transgenic mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cold chains are temperature-controlled supply chains and have a high priority from the managerial point of view.

Samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies to the spike (S) and nucelocapsid (N) proteins. We calculated seroprevalence using manufacturer cut-offs and using a mixture model in which individuals were assigned a probability of being seropositive based on their measured IgG, accounting for heterogeneous antibody response across individuals. The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence to anti-S and anti-N IgG was 62.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 60.6 to 63.4) and 13.5% (95% CI, 12.6 to 14.5), respectively applying the manufacturer's cut-offs, with low inter-assay agreement (Cohen's kappa 0.15). With the mixture model, estimated anti-S IgG and anti-N IgG seroprevalence was 64.9% (95% Credible Interval [CrI], 63.8 to 66.0) and 51.5% (95% CrI, 50.2 to 52.9) respectively, with high inter-assay agreement (Cohen's kappa 0.66). Age and socioeconomic factors showed inconsistent relationships with anti-S IgG and anti-N IgG seropositivity using manufacturer's cut-offs, but the mixture model reconciled these differences. In the mixture model, age was not associated with seropositivity, and improved household ventilation was associated with lower seropositivity odds. With global vaccine scale-up, the utility of the more stable anti-S IgG assay may be limited due to the inclusion of the S protein in several vaccines.

Initial reports suggest that the Omicron variant is more transmissible and resistant to vaccine neutralization but causes less severe illness compared with previous variants (1-3). To describe characteristics of patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection during periods of Delta and Omicron predominance, clinical characteristics and outcomes were retrospectively ed from the electronic health records (EHRs) of adults aged >=18 years with positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 test results admitted to one academic hospital in Los Angeles, California, during July 15-September 23, 2021 (Delta predominant period, 339 patients) and December 21, 2021-January 27, 2022 (Omicron predominant period, 737 patients). Compared with patients during the period of Delta predominance, a higher proportion of adults admitted during Omicron predominance had received the final dose in a primary COVID-19 vaccination series (were fully vaccinated) (39.6% versus 25.1%), and fewer received COVID-19-directed therapies. Although fewer required intensive care unit (ICU) admission and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and fewer died while hospitalized during Omicron predominance, there were no significant differences in ICU admission or IMV when stratified by vaccination status. Fewer fully vaccinated Omicron-period patients died while hospitalized (3.4%), compared with Delta-period patients (10.6%). Among Omicron-period patients, vaccination was associated with lower likelihood of ICU admission, and among adults aged >=65 years, lower likelihood of death while hospitalized. Likelihood of ICU admission and death were lowest among adults who had received a booster dose. Among the first 131 Omicron-period hospitalizations, 19.8% of patients were clinically assessed as admitted for non-COVID-19 conditions.

As a result of the EPP and an identified need for more proactive medication management, fulltime tele-critical care (TCC) pharmacists transitioned from working second shift to first shift hours, facilitating collaboration with multiple bedside providers in intensive care units (ICU) at 8 facilities. The purpose of this study was to categorize pharmacists' interventions completed on first versus second shift. METHODS: This multi-center, multi-ICU, retrospective observational review evaluated fulltime TCC pharmacist interventions documented from September 1, 2020 to November 30, 2020 (second shift) compared with February 8, 2021 to May 7, 2021 (first shift). While clinical decision support alerts triggered the majority of chart reviews on second shift, prospective chart reviews of select ICU patients were performed on first shift. Descriptive statistics were reported. RESULTS: On second shift, 710 interventions were performed in 395 patients;while on first shift, 1024 interventions were performed in 357 patients. Glycemic control interventions accounted for 43% of second shift interventions compared to 19.5% on first shift. Medication management interventions comprised 30% of second shift activities in contrast with 52.2% on first shift. As the TCC pharmacists cover multiple facilities across the system, a change in facility focus occurred as well. During second shift, one facility totaled 35% of all interventions. With the change to dayshift, two other facilities became the primary focus at 34% and 21.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: By changing from a reactive or alert-driven model to prospective chart review utilizing EPP, a change in intervention type occurred.

In this study, we globally profiled the stability of SARS-CoV-2-encoded proteins, studied their degradation pathways, and determined their correlation with the antibody responses in patient plasma. We identified 18 proteins with unstable half-lives and 6 relatively stable proteins with longer half-lives. The labile SARS-CoV-2 proteins were degraded mainly by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We also observed a significant correlation between antibody levels and protein half-lives, which indicated that a stable antigen of SARS-CoV-2 could be more effective for eliciting antibody responses.

METHODS This was a reflective theoretical descriptive study on an educational program based on clinical simulation, with four practical phases at different performance and complexity levels. Wearing, handling and adequately disposing of personal protective equipment, along with specific respiratory procedures in different healthcare settings up to intensive care for seriously infected patients were addressed. RESULTS This program was designed for application at different Brazilian healthcare levels through different clinical simulation strategies. Summaries of expected performance were suggested in order to standardize technical capacity within these simulation settings, so as to serve these levels. CONCLUSIONS Developing training programs for situations such as the current COVID-19 pandemic promotes safety not only for patients but also for healthcare workers. In the present context, clear definition of which patients need hospital outpatient or inpatient care will avoid collapse of the Brazilian healthcare system. Institutions that do not have simulated environments can, through the examples described, adopt procedures to promote didactic information in order to help healthcare professionals during this time.","output":"Clinical simulation strategies for knowledge integration relating to initial critical recognition and management of COVID-19 for use within continuing education and health-related academia in Brazil: a descriptive study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a 17-week, 3-component lifestyle intervention for enhancing health behaviors during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: A parallel-group (intervention and control) study was conducted amongst 79 airline pilots over a 17-week period during the COVID-19 pandemic. The intervention group (n = 38) received a personalized sleep, dietary, and physical activity (PA) program. The control group (n = 41) received no intervention. Outcome measures for sleep, fruit and vegetable intake, PA, and subjective health were measured though an online survey before and after the 17-week period. The changes in outcome measures were used to determine the efficacy of the intervention. RESULTS: Significant main effects for Time  Group were found for International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Walk (p = 0.02) and for all other outcome measures (p < 0.01). The intervention group significantly improved in sleep duration (p < 0.01; d = 1.02), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score (p < 0.01; d = C1.01), moderate-to-vigorous PA (p < 0.01; d = 1.32), fruit and vegetable intake (p < 0.01; d = 3.11), Short-Form-12v2 physical score (p < 0.01; d = 1.84), and Short-Form-12v2 mental score (p < 0.01; d = 2.69).

CONCLUSION: Results provide preliminary evidence that a 3-component healthy sleep, eating and PA intervention elicit improvements in health behaviors and perceived subjective health in pilots and may improve quality of life during an unprecedented global pandemic.","output":"The effectiveness of a 17-week lifestyle intervention on health behaviors among airline pilots during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid urbanization and increasing urban density in China threaten residents' mental health. As a vital component of built environments, green space plays a key role in individuals' psychological well-being; however, the mediating effect of residents' satisfaction with the green space environment on the relationship between urban greening and residents' mental health in Chinese contexts has yet to be thoroughly explored. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper attempts to reveal the internal logic and mechanism underlying the linkages between green space, residents' mental health, and their satisfaction with green space in Shenzhen, China. Specifically, this paper explores the mediating role of residents' satisfaction with a green space environment using questionnaire survey data, Quick Bird-2 high-resolution remote sensing image data, and a multilevel regression model. Our empirical findings indicate that the relative range of neighboring green spaces can directly improve residents' mental health. More importantly, the relationship between the relative scope of green space and residents' mental health is mediated by residents' satisfaction with the green space environment rather than its direct health effects. Given the influence of green space on residents' satisfaction with the environment, green space indirectly affects mental health. These findings should provide the government useful guidance for considering the spatial distribution and quantity of green space. Our results should also help residents improve their actual experiences and subjective satisfaction with the green space environment.","output":"Deciphering the Link Between Mental Health and Green Space in Shenzhen, China: The Mediating Impact of Residents' Satisfaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses are specific crown-shaped viruses that were first identified in the 1960s, and three typical examples of the most recent coronavirus disease outbreaks include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19.

The identification of viral pathogenic mechanisms is important for further developing effective drugs and targeted clinical treatment methods. The delayed revelation of viral infectious mechanisms is currently one of the technical obstacles in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. In this study, we proposed a random walk model to identify the potential pathological mechanisms of COVID-19 on a virus-human protein interaction network, and we effectively identified a group of proteins that have already been determined to be potentially important for COVID-19 infection and for similar SARS infections, which help further developing drugs and targeted therapeutic methods against COVID-19.

Design Three designs were compared. (A) case-cohort which does not explicitly account for the time-changing prevalence of COVID-19 infection, (B) 28-day landmarking, a series of sequential overlapping sub-studies incorporating time-updating proxy measures of the prevalence of infection, and (C) daily landmarking. Regression models were fitted to predict 28-day COVID-19 mortality. Setting Working on behalf of NHS England, we used clinical data from adult patients from all regions of England held in the TPP SystmOne electronic health record system, linked to Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality data, using the OpenSAFELY platform. Participants Eligible participants were adults aged 18 or over, registered at a general practice using TPP software on 1st March 2020 with recorded sex, postcode and ethnicity. 11,972,947 individuals were included, and 7,999 participants experienced a COVID-19 related death. The study period lasted 100 days, ending 8th June 2020. Predictors A range of demographic characteristics and comorbidities were used as potential predictors. Local infection prevalence was estimated with three proxies: modelled based on local prevalence and other key factors; rate of A&E COVID-19 related attendances; and rate of suspected COVID-19 cases in primary care. Main outcome measures COVID-19 related death. Results All models discriminated well between patients who did and did not experience COVID-19 related death, with C-statistics ranging from 0.92-0.94. Accurate estimates of absolute risk required data on local infection prevalence, with modelled estimates providing the best performance. Conclusions Reliable estimates of absolute risk need to incorporate changing local prevalence of infection.

Avian immunoglobulins (IgY) have been previously shown in animal models to protect against new infection and mitigate established infection when applied intranasally. We carried out a proof-of-concept study to address the feasibility of using such antibodies as mucosally-applied prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Hens were immunized with recombinant S1 spike glycoprotein of the virus, and the resulting IgY was evaluated for binding specificity, inhibition of glycoprotein binding to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein (the requisite binding site for the virus), and inhibition of viral replication in Vero cell culture. RESULTS: Titers of anti-S1 glycoprotein IgY were evident in yolks at 14 days post-immunization, peaking at 21 days, and at peak concentrations of 16.8 mg/ml. IgY showed strong and significant inhibition of S1/ACE2 binding interactions, and significantly inhibited viral replication at a concentration of 16.8 mg/ml. Four weeks collection from eggs of two hens produced a total of 1.55 grams of IgY. CONCLUSIONS: In this proof-of-concept study we showed that avian immunoglobulins (IgY) raised against a key virulence factor of the SARS-CoV-2 virus successfully inhibited the critical initial adhesion of viral spike glycoproteins to human ACE2 protein receptors and inhibited viral replication in vitro, in a short period using only two laying hens. We conclude that production of large amounts of IgY inhibiting viral binding and replication of SARS-CoV-2 is feasible, and that incorporation of this or similar material into an intranasal spray and/or other mucosal protecting products may be effective at reducing infection and spread of COVID-19.","output":"Avian antibodies (IgY) targeting spike glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) inhibit receptor binding and viral replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with mental health consequences due to direct (i.e., SARS-CoV-2 infection, potentially due to neuronal or astrocytic infection, microvascular, or inflammatory mechanisms) and indirect (i.e., social and economic impacts of COVID-19 prevention measures) mechanisms. Investigation of mental health in a region with one of the longest lockdowns and lowest COVID-19 prevalence globally (Victoria, Australia) allowed for evaluation of mental health in the absence of direct pandemic mental health consequences.

METHODS: County-level COVID-19 case, death, and population counts were downloaded from USAFacts.org. The 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme was collapsed into two categories called metropolitan (large central, large fringe, medium, and small metropolitans) and nonmetropolitan (micropolitan/noncore). Daily COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates were computed to show temporal trends for each of these two categories. Maps showing the ratio of nonmetropolitan to metropolitan COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates by state identify states with higher rates in nonmetropolitan areas than in metropolitan areas in each of the three 11-week periods. FINDINGS: In the period between March 1 and October 18, 2020, 13.8% of the 8,085,214 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 10.7% of the 217,510 deaths occurred among people residing in nonmetropolitan counties.

An earlier-strategy has biological rationale, even in the absence of urgent indications; however, a delayed-strategy may prevent selected patients from receiving RRT and avoid complications related to RRT. RECENT FINDINGS Previous studies assessing the optimal timing of RRT initiation found conflicting results, contributing to variation in clinical practice. The recent multinational trial, standard vs. accelerated initiation of renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury (STARRT-AKI) found no survival benefit and a higher risk of RRT dependence with an accelerated compared to a standard RRT initiation strategy in critically ill patients with severe AKI. Nearly 40% of patients allocated to the standard-strategy group did not receive RRT. The Artificial Kidney Initiation in Kidney Injury-2 (AKIKI-2) trial further assessed delayed compared to more-delayed strategies for RRT initiation. The more-delayed strategy did not confer an increase in RRT-free days and was associated with a higher risk of death.

Two reviewers independently screened, identified studies, and extracted data. Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale were used to assess the quality of included RCTs and CCSs, respectively. Stata (version 13.0; StataCorp) was used to perform meta-analyses using the random-effects model. Risk ratio (RR) was used for dichotomous data while the weighted mean difference (WMD) was adopted for continuous variables as effect size, respectively, both of which were demonstrated in effect size and 95% confidence intervals. A total of 11 studies were included. Four were RCTs and seven were CCSs. The samples of including studies ranged from 18 to 100 (total 982). The traditional Chinese medicine included Chinese medicine compound drugs (QingFei TouXie FuZhengFang) and Chinese patent medicine (such as Shufeng Jiedu Capsule, Lianhua Qingwen granules).

METHODS: Given this critical challenge, this article aims to propose a feasible solution to coping with pandemic situations through urban furniture design, using an integrated method of Quality Function Deployment (QFD) and Analytic Network Process (ANP). Eight communities in China are selected as the research sites, since people working and living in these places have successful experience preventing and containing pandemics.

Prone positioning in intubated patients is known to reduce mortality in moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. We aimed to investigate feasibility and effect on gas exchange of prone positioning in awake, non-intubated patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia. METHODS: In this prospective, feasibility, cohort study, patients aged 18C75 years with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19-related pneumonia receiving supplemental oxygen or non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure were recruited from San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy. We collected baseline data on demographics, anthropometrics, arterial blood gas, and ventilation parameters. After baseline data collection, patients were helped into the prone position, which was maintained for a minimum duration of 3 h. Clinical data were re-collected 10 min after prone positioning and 1 h after returning to the supine position. The main study outcome was the variation in oxygenation (partial pressure of oxygen [PaO(2)]/fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air [FiO(2)]) between baseline and resupination, as an index of pulmonary recruitment. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04365959, and is now complete. FINDINGS: Between March 20 and April 9, 2020, we enrolled 56 patients, of whom 44 (79%) were male; the mean age was 574 years (SD 74) and the mean BMI was 275 kg/m(2) (37). Prone positioning was feasible (ie, maintained for at least 3 h) in 47 patients (839% [95% CI 717 to 924]). Oxygenation substantially improved from supine to prone positioning (PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio 1805 mm Hg [SD 766] in supine position vs 2855 mm Hg [1129] in prone position; p<00001). After resupination, improved oxygenation was maintained in 23 patients (500% [95% CI 349C651]; ie, responders); however, this improvement was on average not significant compared with before prone positioning (PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio 1929 mm Hg [1009] 1 h after resupination; p=029). Patients who maintained increased oxygenation had increased levels of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein: 127 mg/L [SD 69] in responders vs 84 mg/L [62] in non-responders; and platelets: 2411  10(3)/L [1019] vs 3198  10(3)/L [1206]) and shorter time between admission to hospital and prone positioning (27 days [SD 21] in responders vs 46 days [37] in non-responders) than did those for whom improved oxygenation was not maintained. 13 (28%) of 46 patients were eventually intubated, seven (30%) of 23 responders and six (26%) of 23 non-responders (p=074). Five patients died during follow-up due to underlying disease, unrelated to study procedure. INTERPRETATION: Prone positioning was feasible and effective in rapidly ameliorating blood oxygenation in awake patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia requiring oxygen supplementation. The effect was maintained after resupination in half of the patients. Further studies are warranted to ascertain the potential benefit of this technique in improving final respiratory and global outcomes.

METHODS Sixteen consecutively hospitalized third-trimester pregnant women with pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, rheumatoid arthritis or connective tissue disease were selected as the study subjects for the simulation of COVID-19 pneumonia. Two physicians (imaging and internal medicine) without ultrasonic experience performed lung examinations on pregnant women after six days of lung ultrasound training, and their consistency with examinations by the expert was assessed. In addition, 54 healthy third-trimester pregnant women and 54 healthy nonpregnant women of the same age who were continuously treated in the outpatient clinic of this hospital were selected for comparisons of abnormalities on lung ultrasound. RESULTS (1) Third trimester pregnant women with pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, rheumatoid arthritis or connective tissue disease had the same lung ultrasound patterns as those associated with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Machine learning approaches are being investigated to help improve the effectiveness and speed of multiple stages of the drug discovery pipeline. Of these, those that use Knowledge Graphs (KG) have promise in many tasks, including drug repurposing, drug toxicity prediction and target gene-disease prioritisation. In a drug discovery KG, crucial elements including genes, diseases and drugs are represented as entities, whilst relationships between them indicate an interaction. However, to construct high-quality KGs, suitable data is required. In this review, we detail publicly available sources suitable for use in constructing drug discovery focused KGs. We aim to help guide machine learning and KG practitioners who are interested in applying new techniques to the drug discovery field, but who may be unfamiliar with the relevant data sources. The datasets are selected via strict criteria, categorised according to the primary type of information contained within and are considered based upon what information could be extracted to build a KG. We then present a comparative analysis of existing public drug discovery KGs and a evaluation of selected motivating case studies from the literature. Additionally, we raise numerous and unique challenges and issues associated with the domain and its datasets, whilst also highlighting key future research directions.

We explored the efficacy of self-guided online cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBTI) on situational insomnia during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: Participants were recruited from March to April in 2020 in Guangzhou, China. A 1-week Internet CBTI intervention was performed for all individuals with situational insomnia. The Pre-sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were measured before and after the intervention and compared between individuals who completed the intervention and those who did not. Results: One hundred and ninety-four individuals with situational insomnia were included. For PSAS score, significant group effects were found on total score (p = 0.003), somatic score (p = 0.014), and cognitive score (p = 0.009). Time effect was significant on total score (p = 0.004) and cognitive score (p < 0.001). There was a significant group  time effect of the somatic score (p = 0.025).

This paper questioned how government respond this pandemic, tried to track down the unresponsive and slow decisions, and analyze them comprehensively trough policy system framework. Moreover, we also considered a few feasible and strategic recommendations to accelerate the pandemic responding. Methods: To visualize the anatomy of problems in handling these pandemic responses, this work applied Easton's black box analysis in formulating and introducing public policy. The black box analysis would help us to portray and understood the interests, rationalities, and priorities behind introducing public policies which was implemented to handle this health problem. Besides, the policy triangle framework was used to analyze how environment influenced key actor in making decision. Results: This analysis study discovered the conflict interests in formulating and implementing public policy in handling COVID-19. The public policies are negotiated, discussed, and formulated under black box that ignore transparency, and other good governance principles. Consequently, the substance of public policy represents a certain interest of policy makers, that may conflict with the others and often contradict to the constitutional-based public interests, that is public health. It was impacted the emergence of messy and uncoordinated institutions that implement the conflicted policies. Undeniably, this situation may spark counter-productive ways, attitudes, and actions of people in responding those ambiguous policies. Therefore, this work recommended revising the coherences norms and public policies; reforming the ministry of health in public health's paradigm context; and improving the integration and coordination of cross related institutions, creating a single data on public health, and changing a new paradigm of people, including improving collective awareness in responding and handling COVID-19 appropriately.","output":"Requestioning the Indonesia Government's Public Policy Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Black Box Analysis for the Period of January-July 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To understand the course of recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and to determine its predictors, including patients' preCCOVID-19 physical and mental health status.

Participants used online questionnaires to regularly update their COVID-19 symptoms, recovery status, and duration of symptoms for those who fully recovered. Questionnaires were date stamped for estimation of COVID-19 symptom duration for those who had not recovered at their last follow-up. The UKMSR holds demographic and up-to-date clinical data on participants as well as their web-based Expanded Disability Status Scale (web-EDSS) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores. The association between these factors and recovery from COVID-19 was assessed using multivariable Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Of the 7,977 patients with MS who participated in the UKMSR COVID-19 study, 599 reported COVID-19 and prospectively updated their recovery status. Twenty-eight hospitalized participants were excluded. At least 165 participants (29.7%) had long-standing COVID-19 symptoms for 4 weeks and 69 (12.4%) for 12 weeks.

Time series were divided into pre-recession (Jan 2000-Nov 2007) and recession/post-recession (Dec 2007-Sept 2015) periods. Results The medical cost of DV-related hospitalizations alone was estimated as $1,136,165,861. A dramatic increase in DV episodes was found potentially associated with the Great Recession. The number of ED visits per month tripled from pre- to post-recession (104.9 vs. 290.6), along with an increased number of hospitalizations (77.1 vs. 95.6); African Americans and Native Americans were disproportionally impacted. In addition, psychiatric comorbidities, severe DV episodes, in-hospital mortality and charge per hospitalization escalated. The rise in DV hospitalizations and ED visits beginning in December 2007 was mainly attributable to physical abuse episodes in adults; minors had no change in DV trends.

However, the underlying mode of action is largely unknown. PURPOSE: A systems pharmacology strategy was proposed to investigate the mechanisms of QFPDD against COVID-19 from molecule, pathway and network levels. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The systems pharmacological approach consisted of text mining, target prediction, data integration, network study, bioinformatics analysis, molecular docking, and pharmacological validation. Especially, we proposed a scoring method to measure the confidence of targets identified by prediction and text mining, while a novel scheme was used to identify important targets from 4 aspects. RESULTS: 623 high-confidence targets of QFPDD's 12 active compounds were identified, 88 of which were overlapped with genes affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These targets were found to be involved in biological processes related with the development of COVID-19, such as pattern recognition receptor signaling, interleukin signaling, cell growth and death, hemostasis, and injuries of the nervous, sensory, circulatory, and digestive systems. Comprehensive network and pathway analysis were used to identify 55 important targets, which regulated 5 functional modules corresponding to QFPDD's effects in immune regulation, anti-infection, anti-inflammation, and multi-organ protection, respectively. Four compounds (baicalin, glycyrrhizic acid, hesperidin, and hyperoside) and 7 targets (AKT1, TNF-, IL6, PTGS2, HMOX1, IL10, and TP53) were key molecules related to QFPDD's effects. Molecular docking verified that QFPDD's compounds may bind to 6 host proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, further supported the anti-virus effect of QFPDD. At last, in intro experiments validated QFPDD's important effects, including the inhibition of IL6, CCL2, TNF-, NF-B, PTGS1/2, CYP1A1, CYP3A4 activity, the up-regulation of IL10 expression, and repressing platelet aggregation.

We used 3 rounds of qualitative coding to identify themes. RESULTS: Providers lacked access to information about: patients ability to pay for medications; true costs of full medication regimens; and cost impacts of patient insurance changes. Some providers said that while existing cost-related tools were helpful, they contained unclear insurance information and several questioned the informations quality. Cost-related information was not available to everyone who needed it and was not always available when needed. Fragmentation of information across sources made cost-alleviation information difficult to access. Providers desired future tools to compare medication costs more directly; provide quick references on costs to facilitate clinical conversations; streamline medication resource referrals; and provide centrally accessible visual summaries of patient affordability challenges.

The statistical analysis showed a significant association of age, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) D-dimer, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelets-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) with intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. Gender, dyspnea, and absolute eosinophil count (AEC) showed significant association with ICU patients only, while liver disease and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) had a significant association with death. Conclusion There are many notable clinical and hematological manifestations of COVID-19. Age, gender, dyspnea, comorbid liver disease, ANC, ALC AEC, NLR, PLR, and D- dimer may help clinicians predict the disease progression and reduce mortality risk.","output":"Association of Peripheral Blood Parameters With Outcomes of COVID-19 Infection in a Tertiary Care Setting of Eastern India: An Institute-Based Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of the global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on stock market liquidity, while taking into account the depth and tightness dimensions Design/methodology/approachThe author used a panel data regression on stock market dataset, representing 314 listed firms operating in six Middle East and North African (MENA) countries from February to May 2020 FindingsThe regression results on the overall sample indicate that the liquidity related to the depth measure was positively correlated with the growth in the confirmed number of cases and deaths and stringency index Moreover, the market depth was positively related to the confirmed cases of COVID-19 The results also indicate that the liquidity of small cap and big cap firms was significantly impacted by the confirmed number of cases, while the stringency index is only significant for the liquidity depth measure Moreover, the results regarding sectors and country level analysis confirmed that COVID-19 had a significant and negative impact of stock market liquidity Research limitations/implicationsThis paper confirms that the global coronavirus pandemic has decreased the stock market liquidity in terms of both the depth and the tightness dimensions Originality/valueWhile most empirical papers focused on the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on stock market returns, this paper investigated liquidity chock at firm level in the MENA region using both tightness and depth dimensions","output":"Stock market liquidity, the great lockdown and the COVID-19 global pandemic nexus in MENA countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) remain the only widely available tool for controlling the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

The ICOMEM Scientific Committee on this subject has tried to answer these questions after discussion and consensus among its members. The main answers can be summarized as follows: The occurrence of new SARS-CoV-2 infections in both vaccinated and previously infected patients is very low, in the observation time we already have. When breakthrough infections do occur, they are usually asymptomatic or mild and, purportedly, should have a lower capacity for transmission to other persons. Vaccinated subjects who have contact with a SARSCoV-2 infected patient can avoid quarantine as long as they are asymptomatic, although this decision depends on variables such as age, occupation, circulating variants, degree of contact and time since vaccination. In countries with a high proportion of the population vaccinated, it is already suggested that fully vaccinated persons could avoid the use of masks and social distancing in most circumstances. Systematic use of diagnostic tests to assess the immune response or the degree of protection against reinfection after natural infection or vaccination is discouraged, since their practical consequences are not known at this time. The existing information precludes any precision regarding a possible need for future revaccination. This Committee considers that when mass vaccination of health care workers and the general population is achieved, SARS-CoV-2 screening tests could be avoided at least in out-patient care and in the case of exploratory procedures that do not require hospitalization.","output":"Actions and attitudes on the immunized patients against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The quarantine of identified close contacts has been vital to reducing transmission rates and averting secondary infection risk before symptom onset and by asymptomatic cases. The effectiveness of this contact tracing strategy to mitigate transmission is sensitive to the adherence to quarantines, which may be lower for longer quarantine periods or in vaccinated populations (where perceptions of risk are reduced). This study develops a simulation model to evaluate contact tracing strategies based on the sequential testing of identified contacts after exposure as an alternative to quarantines, in which contacts are isolated only after confirmation by a positive test. The analysis considers different number and types of tests (PCR and lateral flow antigen tests (LFA)) to identify the cost-effective testing policies that minimize the expected infecting days post-exposure considering different levels of testing capacity. This analysis suggests that even a limited number of tests can be effective at reducing secondary infection risk: two LFA tests (with optimal timing) avert infectiousness at a level that is comparable to 14-day quarantine with 80C90% adherence, or equivalently, 7C9 day quarantine with full adherence (depending on the sensitivity of the LFA test). Adding a third test (PCR or LFA) reaches the efficiency of a 14-day quarantine with 90C100% adherence. These results are robust to the exposure dates of the contact, test sensitivity of LFA and alternative models of viral load evolution, which suggests that simple testing rules can be effective for improving contact tracing in settings where strict quarantine adherence is difficult to implement.","output":"Replacing quarantine of COVID-19 contacts with periodic testing is also effective in mitigating the risk of transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic had an enormous impact on the vegetable supply chain in China Effective evaluation of the pandemic's influences on vegetable production is vital for policy settings to enhance the security of vegetable supply Based on first-hand data from 526 households, we explored regional differences in different types of loss and potential factors affecting the severity farmer households suffered during the pandemic The results underline that sales contraction and price volatility in the context of interruption of supply chain dominate the total losses during the pandemic Such losses differ across provinces and are more substantial in provinces with stricter confinement measures Farmer households' participation in local market and modern marketing methods helps mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 shock, while labor hiring and facilities adoption in production widen the losses due to the shortage in the workforce In the future, the vegetable industry practitioners and relevant government departments should work together to coordinate the development of short and long supply chains and strengthen the stability and security of the vegetable supply chain","output":"Vegetable production under COVID-19 pandemic in China: An analysis based on the data of 526 households"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused a large disease outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019, is currently spreading across world's many of the countries Along with binding of the virus spike with the host cell receptor, fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes is a critical step in establishing successful infection of SARS-CoV-2 In this entry process, a diversity of host cell proteases and andro-gen receptor play a very important role directly or indirectly These features of SARS-CoV-2 entry contribute to its rapid spread and severe symptoms, high fatality rates among infected patients This review is based on latest published literature including review articles, research articles, hypothetical manuscript, pre-print articles and official documents The literature search was made from various published papers on physiological aspects relevant to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 In this report, we focus on the role of host cell proteases (ACE2, ADAM17, TMPRSS2) and androgen receptor (AR) in SARS-CoV-2 infection The hypotheses put forth by us are based on the role played by the proteases ACE2, ADAM17, TMPRSS2 and AR in SARS-CoV-2 infection which were deduced based on various studies We have also summarized how these host proteins increase the pathology and the infective ability of SARS-CoV-2 and we posit that their inhibition may be a therapeutic option for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection","output":"Can Host Cell Proteins Like ACE2, ADAM17, TMPRSS2, Androgen Receptor be the Efficient Targets in SARS-CoV-2 Infection?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The combination of electric vehicle (EV) and carsharing is expected to provide social and environmental benefits, like encouraging sustainable travel behaviors (reducing car ownership and vehicle kilometres of travel) and improving the accessibility and flexibility of urban transport.

Very few reports in Japan have examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on peripartum mental health. We examined the status of postpartum mental health before and during COVID-19 pandemic from a consecutive database in a metropolitan area of Japan. METHODS: The subjects were women who had completed a maternity health check-up at a core regional hospital in Yokohama during the period from April 1, 2017, to December 31, 2020. We collected the subjects scores for the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale (MIBS) at 1 month postpartum. The subjects were divided into four groups (three Before COVID-19 groups and a During COVID-19 group). MANOVA and post-hoc tests were used to determine mental health changes in the postpartum period among the four groups. RESULTS: The Before and During COVID-19 groups contained 2844 and 1095 mothers, respectively. There were no significant difference in the total scores of the EPDS and MIBS among the four groups. However, the EPDS items related to anxiety factors were significantly higher and the EPDS items related to anhedonia and depression factors (excluding thoughts of self-harm) were significantly lower in the During COVID-19 group. CONCLUSION: The EPDS scores changed in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety, which represent hypervigilance, was significantly higher and anhedonia and depression were significantly lower in the During COVID-19 group. Our results may reflect COVID-19-related health concerns and a lack of social support caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on one-month postpartum mothers in a metropolitan area of Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Local health departments are the backbone of public health emergency (PHE) response plans. The front line of emergency response preparedness is people. Role perceptions of individual staff members of a given organization strongly affect response probability and performance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine local public health employees perceptions of emergency response responsibilities, identify factors that influence their perception, and indicate the challenges and bottlenecks of PHE response in the Health Inspection Institution (HII) after its separation from Chinas multiple Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). METHODS: We used a stratified randomized sample survey to examine HII workers knowledge of their own duties concerning PHE response in 17 facilities in Heilongjiang, a province in northeastern China. Data were collected from May to July 2010 using a 9-item combined question inquiring about the workers statutory duties. RESULTS: Of 348 administered surveys, 309 were returned for an overall response rate of 88.8 %. Overall, the correct recognition rate of PHE responsibilities was low. Some HII workers were confused about their responsibilities required by law, regulations, and emergency response plans. A quarter of all the respondents had the lowest knowledge for PHE responsibilities. Factors influencing their perceptions of responsibilities were department, work experience in a CDC, and PHE response experience. CONCLUSIONS: To improve preparedness for a PHE, efforts are needed to train, support, and monitor the workers knowledge and competencies in PHEs as part of an organizational change; the workers knowledge of their responsibilities should be measured and used as an indicator of preparedness for a PHE, and training should be undertaken where there are deficiencies. Management should also encourage workers in the departments of food hygiene/school health surveillance to be more involved in PHE preparedness and response issues.","output":"Determinants of emergency response responsibility perceptions in the local public health workforce after Chinas health sector restructuring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is currently the center of what has become a public health crisis. While the virus is well-known for its trademark effects on respiratory function, neurological damage has been reported to affect a considerable proportion of severe cases. To characterize the neuro-invasive potential of this disease, a contemporary review of COVID-19 and its neurological sequelae was conducted using the limited, but growing, literature that is available. These neurological squeal are based on the manifestations that the virus has on normal central and peripheral nervous system function. The authors present the virology of the SARS-CoV-2 agent by analyzing its classification as an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus. A comprehensive timeline is then presented, indicating the progression of the disease as a public health threat. Furthermore, underlying chronic neurological conditions potentially lead to more adverse cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 may reach ACE2 receptors on neuronal tissue through mode of the general circulation. The CNS may also be susceptible to an immune response where a cytokine storm can manifest into neural injury. Histological evidence is provided, while symptoms such as headache and vertigo are highlighted as CNS manifestations of COVID-19. Treatment of these symptoms is addressed with paracetamol being recommended as a possible, but not conclusive, treatment to some CNS symptoms. The authors then discuss the peripheral nervous system sequelae and COVID's impact on causing chemosensory dysfunction starting with viral attack on olfactory sensory neurons and cells types within the lining of the nose. Histological evidence is also provided while symptoms such as anosmia and ageusia are characterized as PNS manifestations. Possible treatment options for these symptoms are then addressed as a major limitation, as anecdotal, and not conclusive evidence can be made. Finally, preventive measures of the neurological sequelae are addressed using a multidirectional approach. Postmortem examinations of the brains of COVID-19 patients are suggested as being a possible key to formulating new understandings of its neuropathology. Lastly, the authors suggest a more comprehensive neurological follow-up of recovered patients, in order to better characterize the neurological sequelae of this illness.","output":"A Contemporary Review of Neurological Sequelae of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An article in Nature Biomedical Engineering reports an in vivo workflow for the design of lipid nanoparticles to efficiently deliver mRNA to the lungs via nebulization.","output":"Nebulized lipid nanoparticles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this investigation was to examine the relationship between psychosocial variables and working conditions, and nurses coping methods and distress in response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis in Canada. PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE: The sample consisted of 333 nurses (315 women, 18 men) who completed an Internet-mediated questionnaire that was posted on the Registered Nurses Association of Ontario (RNAO) website between March and May 2004. The questionnaire was restricted to respondents who had to authenticate their RNAO membership with a valid username and password before accessing the questionnaire. This served a dual purpose: to ensure that only RNAO nurses completed the questionnaire and thereby safeguarding the generalizability of the findings; and second, to prevent any one nurse from contributing more than once to the overall sample. RESULTS: Correlational analysis yielded several significant relationships between psychosocial variables and working conditions, and the traditional correlates of burnout and stress. Three multiple regression analysis revealed that the model we evolvedincluding higher levels of vigor, organizational support, and trust in equipment/infection control initiative; and lower levels of contact with SARS patients, and time spent in quarantinepredicted to lower levels of avoidance behavior, emotional exhaustion, and state anger. CONCLUSIONS: By employing models of stress and burnout that combine psychosocial variables and working conditions, researchers can account for significant amounts of variance in outcomes related to burnout. These findings highlight the importance of vigor and perceived organizational support in predicting nurses symptoms of burnout. For healthcare administrators, this means that a likely strategy for assuaging the negative outcomes of stress should address nurses psychosocial concerns and the working conditions that they face during novel times of crisis.","output":"The relevance of psychosocial variables and working conditions in predicting nurses coping strategies during the SARS crisis: An online questionnaire survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To describe the current status of COVID-19 vaccine guidelines.

Subcutaneous tumor xenografts expressing red fluorescent marker protein were used as disease models. MR imaging was performed at 1T 1 H MRI using T1w-3D GRE sequences to measure time-dependent MR signal intensity changes by ROI analysis after image segmentation. Topical application of 1.0 M or 0.7 M GB-containing OC mixture with water and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) showed similar 30-40% increase of tumor FI during the initial 15 min. Afterwards, the OC effect of GB on FI and tumor/background FI ratio showed a decrease over time in the case of 1.0 M GB unlike 0.7 M GB mixture, which resulted in the steady increase of FI and tumor/background ratio for 15-60 min. The use of T1w-3D GRE MR pulse sequences showed that concentrated 1.0 M GB resulted in MR signal loss of the skin due to high magnetic susceptibility and that signal loss coincided with OC effect.
